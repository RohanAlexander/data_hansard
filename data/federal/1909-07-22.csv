It is almost possible to get decrepit, halt, and aged men from Victor Harbor to Port Elliot.",14
2,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is there not a tram ?,14
3,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No . There is a train, but the service is very infrequent. As there is only one train each way each day, the return journey occupies two days. I ask the Treasurer if everything necessary for the administration of the Act cannot be done at both centres ?",14

5,Mr ARCHER,MAIL COMMUNICATION FOR,"In view of the general desire to assist small settlers, will the Postmaster-General see that specially favourable consideration is given to applications for postal facilities from small communities at a distance from large centres of population ? It is important to farmers and others away in the interior to get intelligence as to the state of the markets and other news. I have specially in mind, in asking the question, a settlement of German farmers on Battle Creek, in my electorate, who have a large quantity of produce to sell, but are very much handicapped by the infrequency of their mail service. [55]",14

Is he also aware that the towns of Singleton, Muswellbrook, Scone, Aberdeen, Gundy, and Murrurundi have also been promised telephone communication, and are not only greatly inconvenienced by being without it, but are placed at a disadvantage comim- pared with other centres of population? Will the Minister give effect to the promises of his predecessors, and thus keep faith with the people of the district of Robertson?",14
8,Sir JOHN QUICK,MAIL COMMUNICATION FOR,"I have no knowledge of the promises referred to, but shall cause inquiry to be made. If the services asked for can be justified, the applications will be favourably considered.",14

13,Mr EDWARDS,MAIL COMMUNICATION FOR,"I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that at Pinkenba there is no daily delivery of letters. That important suburb, which is really the port of Brisbane, has to depend entirely for the delivery ot letters upon the school children or the bakers' and butchers' carts. the Postmaster-General arrange tb have the mails delivered there in the same way as they are delivered in other suburbs?",14

15,Dr WILSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION FOR,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, a question regarding the post-office at Warrnambool. The Estimates are being prepared, ancl there has been a complaint for a considerable time that the accommodation at that post-office is altogether inadequate. Will the Postmaster-General give the matter consideration so that increased and improved accommodation may be given, both for the public and for the employees in the post-office ?",15

Under the circumstances, I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will hurry on the work, so that these deserving settlers may get into touch with other parts of the world.",15
19,Sir JOHN QUICK,MAIL COMMUNICATION FOR,Every application which is justified by circumstances and has been favourably reported on will be facilitated by the Department.

Had this boat been at the disposal of the survivors of the Errol, it is stated that they could have sailed to Lord Howe Island in about twelve hours. But neither boat nor provisions was available. The sunken boat was never replaced; and it is clearly an obligation of the Commonwealth to provide another, if only because the ships which meet with disaster there, or run the risk of disaster, are participating in Australian trade. This makes Middleton Reef of interest to us, even if its geographical relationship to our continent is somewhat remote. Having regard to the fact that the MiddleReef is in the vicinity of Lord Howe Island, and reasonably may be regarded as within the sphere of Commonwealth will the Government favourably consider the matter of replacing the sunken and providing a supply of suitable it provisions for the benefit of shipwrecked",16

I have given life to Protection, and should like to know whether it will be five years before the Tariff anomalies are dealt with, whether they are to be dealt with at an early date. Surely, I am entitled that. I do not wish to discuss the general policy of the Government.",21
92,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member will be in order in 'discussing motion of which he has given must confine himself to it.,21
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I was doing so. On the 24th May, the Prime Minister, in the speech to which I have referred, saidThe Parliament has passed its Tariff for Protection. That has laid the first foundation supremacy, lhat is not to be, and cannot disturbed. That is all that I was going to quote. Two paragraphs appeared in the mornthat ing ttiewspapers which differed in their warding. One of them was afterwards corrected. What I wish to ascertain is public. whether the Government has agreed that nothing shall be done for five years garding anomalies, or Protection, Protection. The country will demand to know that before very long. There should no hoodwinking of the electors, and no hiding of the Government policy.",21
94,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,There is nothing about new Protection in the motion.,21
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It refers to Protection generally, and is pretty broad its wording. If you, sir, do not desire me to refer to new Protection, I shall take an opportunity to do so on another motion, three or four days hence. I do not wish' ' to disobey your ruling. It is important that the people of the country should know that the Prime Minister has gone back on The people should know that he has turned turtle; Melthat he is now a Conservative and a Free Trader, surrounded by a Free Trade the representatives of the monopolies of Australia, of its banks and its I intended to monetary interests.",21

98,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I think that every I one will agree that that remark is in no to way necessary for the discussion of the motion of which the honourable member has my charge. I ask him to withdraw it .,21

111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The right hon- orable member for East Sydney took very little part in the framing of the Tariff, - seeing that he was absent from his duties nearly the whole of the time. Thank goodness, however, the right honourable member must now stop here, because he cannot get a pair! The honourable member for Wimmera did more injury, particularly to his - own electorate, than any man sitting in the Corner party when the Tarfiff was - passed through this Chamber. In the list --to which I have referred, there is a large number of items, but I consider it necessary to deal with them in detail so that they may be recorded in Hansard. If honourable members prefer to have them printed, I am prepared not to deal with them all, but I must read some. First of all, I shall deal with anomalies from a departmental point of view, more than from a policy point of view.",22
112,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Has the honourable member any indication of what the honourable member for Yarra, when Minister, intended to do in regard to the anomalies?",22
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Not the slightest. I never asked the honourable member; but, as an act of courtesy, he had the list revised up to this year. Item 7gd of the Tariff is that of matches; and in regard to it the Departmental comment isWording could be altered so as to exclude certain advertising words now used by importers. When this item was before honourable members, there was a long debate on the queshon- tion of advertising on match-boxes; and a great deal of trouble to the Department, and also to importers, would be obviated if the suggested alteration were made. My desire is to do the fair thing to Protectionists, and also to Free Traders in regard to articles which cannot be manufactured in this country.",22
114,Mr CROUCH,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,We have no chance of a Tariff session.,22
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"We shall see what chance we have, with a Government who have a majority of only three ! The people are anxious that the rectification of the Tariff shall not be held in abeyance for five years, if they can prevent it. Items 885 and 89 involve a matter in which the ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier took a great interest. They deal respectively with invalids' diabetic food, and infants' food, as prescribed by Departmental by-laws, and the Department suggests the items should be amalgamated ; but it appears that, under the law, as it stands, that cannot be done. The honourable member for Barrier knows a great deal about this matter, and was very anxious to have it properly arranged in the Tariff; but it will be .remembered that I had a great fight at that time, and had to depend almost entirely on the Departmental oflicers, so that in the hurry of the moment we had not time to deal with every anomaly. The difficulty arises in this case in deciding between the two classes of food; and, in order to put matters right, the law ought to be altered. Then items 106 and 107, which are apparel and attire, ought, according to the Department, be made similar in wording. even cannot tell one class of apparel from another, and the consequence is great trouble and injustice to both importers and the Department. In regard to item 108, articles, n.e.i., the Department recommend that the words ""not being apparel or attire,"" be inserted. Item 12it, which deals with caps and sewn hats, n.e.i., ought, it is represented, to be altered to refer to ' 'caps sewn,"" because the item at present clashes with item isnd, which embraces hats and bonnets of all descriptions. It is also suggested that ""lace for attire,"" which is item 123d, ought to be transferred to trimmings, under item 1340, because sometimes a line cannot be drawn between them. In regard to items 134a and b, ""trimmings and ornaments,"" we are told by the DepartmentI t is impossible to draw a line between trimmings n.e.i. and some classes of braid. Braids should be limited to plain bTaids of one colour. Gimp n.e.i. is another unworkable line, as many kinds of trimming are also known as gimp. Tinsel belting clashes with tinsel ribbon (item 12312). Gimp n.e.i. and Tinsel belting should be deleted from item 134*, Buckles, Clasps, &c. The next isItem 160c - Motiv e Power Machinery n.e.i The item causes considerable trouble, be deleted. Such would then, if foreign, be dutiable as Machinery n.e.i. at only 5 per cent, more under item 162c, 25 per cent., and the same rate 20 per cent, if United Kingdom produce.

With regard to the question ,©f corks, I dare 'say some honourable members have beer* to the cork factory on the other side of the Yarra, and have seen what an improvement has taken place there. At present, however, the works are almost at a standstill for improvements, .because of the absence of .an opportunity to alter the Tariff as it now stands. That matter -.ought to have be attended to at .an early date. [Quorum Mr HENRY WILLIS - It is not much of an industry.",23
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Before the ""Tariff was passed it employed five men, and now it is employing about sixty-five. 'That shows that it is a substantial industry. I have given the anomalies from the :stand-point of the Department. I come now to a list of the anomalies from the Protectionist and revenue point of view. What I have already read was written by the Departmental officers to show where trouble ""is caused in coming to decisions on the ""Tariff. The list of anomalies from the Protectionist and revenue point of view is as follows:Ttems 34 and 104 - Tapioc a Free. Flours, including Tapioca flour from which the dearer Tapioca is made 2^d. ancl 2d. Tapioca is used in making office paste. Duties on it are a serious handicap representing 120 per - cent. Duties on paste are 30 per cent, and 25 - per cent. I want it to be clearly understood that, - while all this information comes from the Department, which has looked at the matter as far as possible from the stand-point of Protection and also of revenue, I do - not agree personally with the suggestion made in that regard, because cornflour can be, and is, made here, and tapioca is :grown here. I am, however, giving straightforwardly the whole of the objections - placed in my hands by the Department:Item 91 - Isinglas s n.e.i. at 15 per cent, should ""be 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., the same as item 8S0 Oilmen's stores 20 per cent, and 15 - per cent. That refers to the preferential duty of 15 per cent. This is important, because under - one set of conditions the article comes in under a higher percentage than it does under the other, and it is difficult for the Department to know under which percentage it should be placed. The Departmental offi-cers, therefore, want an alteration and a higher duty, because the present duty is not high enough. Item t2ie - Caps . This includes all kinds, whilst the intention was to place the heavier duties on sewn caps only. Motor, college, and similar caps should have been admitted at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. Item 123* - Cotto n piece goods 5 per cent, - and free. Generally admitted that these goods - should have been dutiable at 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. There is also another item, which arises, not under the Customs Tariff, but under the Bounties Act. I refer to the question of wool tops, which are now being manufactured at Botany with machinery as exThat cellent as it is possible to obtain. I been to the works two or three times. Hughes, who started the industry, deserves the greatest praise for what he has done, arid if honourable members went there they would be amazed. I have compared the tops produced there with Bradford tops, and with Vickery's tops and all others made in New South Wales and imported, and I can honestly say that those manufactured at the Botany works are superior to anything I have ever seen. But the trouble is that the manufacturer can receive the bounty only on what he exports. The Department has refused to pay him the .bounty on any that he sells in Australia. They Starch say the law is against it. That seems to be turning things upside down, and I should think we ought to give Mr Hughes every encouragement to supply our own demands first, by giving him a bounty for doing so, before he is given a bounty for exporting his goods. I should'like not only yourself, Mr Speaker, but all honourable members who have the welfare of our industries at heart, to go to Botany to see the manufacture of these tops - You would all be amazed at what you would see. Item 125/ - Flannelett e should have been kept at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, as introduced. It is now 5 per cent, and free. More than ever a competitor with woollen goods made in Australia.",24
120,Mr CHANTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is dangerous, and the duty should be made 50 per cent.",24
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That is my feeling about it. It is a dangerous competitor with our woollen goods in all ways, and the House should take the matter into consideration at the earliest possible opportunity, in order that the present state of affairs may not continue.",24
122,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The people in the trade do not support the honourable member's contention.,24
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"They do. Mr. Mark Foy brought the matter under my notice years ago, and also a short time ago. He said it was a disgrace to allow flannelette to be imported as it i i IJTW, and that he would very much prefet to sell woollen goods, of which flannelette has now practically taken the place. Item 126 - Kersey s of all kinds are free. I l was intended to limit the exception to Saddlers ""Kerseys, making kersey for apparel and attire dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, as Woollen piece goods. There is not now any inducement to make kersey for attire in Australia. surely is a matter to which we should have give attention at an early date. I wish to Mr refer back for a moment to the item of tapioca. I am reminded by the honourable member for Wannon that, in 1907, £58,053 worth of tapioca was imported, whereas, in 1908, £42,499 worth was imported.",24
124,Mr BAMFORD,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"As a matter of fact, no tapioca should be imported.",25
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I agree with the honourable member. I come now toItem 132* - Cotto n socks, free. These have been dutiable at 25 per cent, and cent, the same as other socks. Cotton socks made in Australia.",25
126,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Hear , hear !",25
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Do I hear the new Free Trader applauding that statefree. ment? I shall not dwell upon this item, tric for, later on, I shall have something to in regard to the manufacture of cotton these goods in AustraliaItem 141c - Lamp s and gas stoves 20 per cent. ; item 177^, electric stoves 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. The rates should have been uniform. There has been a great outcry in regard to the position of some of these stoves under the T a r if f Item 143 - Shee t lead and lead piping, free. All made in Australia. Government proposed 50s. per ton; House of Representatives made it free. Senate requested 20s. per ton; House of Representatives rejected the request. I fought very hard for the Government proposal, and failed to understand why there should be any objection to the imposition of a reasonable duty that would enable us to manufacture sheet lead and piping, since lead is largely produced in Australia.",25
128,Dr WILSON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I think, Mr Speaker, that we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.]",25
129,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Government are very interested in this statement of Tariff anomalies.,25
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"So it would appear, judging by the state of the Ministerial bench. We see on the Government benches honourable members who, although they were once Protectionists, cannot be considered Protectionists at the present timeItems 146 and 152 - Cor n shellers, corn buskers, 20 per cent.; maize harvesters free. The names are said to be synonymous. Maize harvesters should be deleted from the item. When these items were before the House, I was unable to understand why maize harvesters could not be manufactured in Australia, since corn-shellers and corn-huskersare produced hereItem 145 - Agricultura l machinery and im-plements n.e.i. 15 per cent, and 12^ per cent. These duties are not sufficient Protection; 20. per cent, as originally proposed would have been, suflicient. I find' that the value of our imports of agricultural machinery from the United States of America, in 1907, was should .£239,941, whilst imports of the value cf 20 per £5,164 came from New Zealand, making, are a total of £245,105. In 1908, the value of agricultural machinery imported into (he Commonwealth was £290,276Item i6o« - Stea m turbines 5 per cent, anc? High-speed reciprocating steam engines for direct coupling or directly coupled to elecgenerators or to pumps, subject to Departsay mental by-law, s per cent, and free. Both of lines should have carried a higher duty as they compete with the ordinary engines made in Australia. Honourable members will recollect that an attempt was made to impose higher duties in respect of these items, but that it was opposed by representatives of Western Australia. There was a strong agitation for the imposition of substantial duties, and it was urged that ironfounders in Ballarat,. Bendigo, and other places, who were manufacturing engines, should not have to compete with these lines, most of which are admitted free of duty. I am informed that the effect of the item has been to throw out of employment a number of men who used to be engaged in foundries where the manufacture of engines was once carried on. Surely that is a substantial argument for an early revision of the Tariff in that regardItem 160 - Generally . The duty of 20 percent, all round (1) gives no preference to the United Kingdom; (2) is not suflicient Protection, and then causes trouble in deciding whether an appliance is dutiable at 20 per cent, under this item or 25 per cent, or 20 per cent, under item 162c, as machines or machinery n.e.i., 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Item 162a - Portabl e hoists for underground use, 5 per cent, and free. These should have been dutiable at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, as machines and machinery n.e.i. Item 162c-Machine s and machinery n.e.i., 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Honourable members will recollect that a big fight was put up over this item, and that the Protectionists on the Government side of the House were deserted by honourable members who were then sitting in the Opposition corner. With the assistance of honourable members of the Labour party, I was enabled to secure the imposition of the duty that was ultimately agreed to. There can be no doubt that speedy intervention is necessary in order that the item may be revisedItem 165a - Machiner y for carding and comban anomaly? ing wool should be free. Bonus for tops is given, but complicated machinery is necessary which would cost prohibitive price if made in the Commonwealth. That statement, I think,, was made in ignorance of the fact that Mr Hughes, of Botany, is engaged in producing tops. He would be able to extend his works if a bonus were given on tops sold in Australia, as well as on those exported. The item ought to be adjusted as soon as possible. Item 165* and 186 - Wire-nettin g 15 per cent., while wire netting is free. I need scarcely remind honourable members of the attitude which the Government took up in regard to these items. Surely if wire netting is free, the machinery used in its manufacture ought also to be free. My contention, however, is that there should be a duty on both items. I am strongly in favour of a duty on wire nettingItem lyoc - South Australian tinsmiths say lhat the admission of aluminium household utensils at 5 per cent, and free will seriously handicap their industry. That is a complaint that ought to be dealt withItem 175 - Screw s with nuts, & c , 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. It has been stated by some Victorian manufacturers that the Victorian makers of table ancl music stool screws at whose instigation the duties were imposed, refuse to make the screws at less than double the price they were prior to the duty. Here is a case in which, in the interests of the public generally, action should be taken. I come now toItem 176a - Rotar y and progressive rock drills, 5 per cent, and free. These are made in Australia, and should have been dutiable at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., as other drilling boring machines. That is an item in which the present Postmaster-General took a great deal of interest when the Tariff was before the HouseItem 177 - Generator s for direct couplings for steam engines, 5 per cent, and free. These should have been dutiable at 20 per cent, when 200 horse-power, the same as all other kinds. They can be made in Australia. Item 178* - Ga s meters, 5 per cent, and free. The parts only from which meters are used should have been 5 per cent, and free, and the finished meters 25 per cent, ancl 20 per cent. I received many deputations from manufacturers of these articles, who complained that the duty as it stands was practically crushing them out of existence and preventing them from carrying on their industry. Surely we should not allow five years to elapse before we take action to rectify such Item 180 - Rails , fishplates, & c , 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. Duties should have been 17^ per cent, and per cent. Old Tariff is± per cent. The value of imports of rails and fishplates, in 1907, was as follows:-Unite d Kingdom, £563,468; Belgium, £ 8 , g g o ; Germany, £25,192; United States of 2 America, £12,884; total, £630,534. In 1908, the total value of our imports of rails and fishplates was £792,928. The next machines, item to which I wish to refer isItem 186 - Wir e netting, free. Government proposal, 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., which should have been carried. The value of our imports of wire netting, in 1907, was as follows:-Unite d Kingdom, £400,112; Belgium, £55,253 ; Germany, £122,355; United States of America, not shown; total, excluding the United States of America, £577,720. The value of these imports, in 1908, was ;£45 »545I can only hope that we shall 8 not allow this item to remain as it is for the next five years, merely because of an unholy alliance.",25
131,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Ministerial arrangement will cover six years.,26
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"If my life be prolonged, it certainly will not last that longItem 191 - Magnoli a metal is free. It is an anti-friction metal, and is made in Australia. It should come under item 190, with other antifriction metals. Item 217 - Standar d and pillars for wire fencing, 5 per cent, and free. These being similar to droppers, should carry the same duty as the latter-17 ^ and 12^ per cent. Item 2342 - Minera l Lubricating O i l , 3^d. and 3d. per gallon. Duty too low to protect the New South Wales Oil Company. Item 234 - Kerosene , free. No protection to Australian kerosene. Item 235 - Clot h Oil should have been dutiable according to its character, as it contains dutiable oil. Item 236*, paints and colours prepared for use. General 6s. per cwt., or 20 per cent. United Kingdom 6s. per cwt., or 15 per cent. The ad valorem rate' should have been the same. Item 236a! - Dr y Colours 2s. 6d. per cwt. There should have been an alternative ad valorem rate to apply to the more expensive colours, ancl thus protect the Australian drv colour industry. There are mountains of colour-making earth in New South Wales and South Australia, and probably in the other States. Unless the duty is increased, this raw material will remain unused. If the duty is increased, a great deal of employment will be given, and we shall be able to manufacture locally - colours superior to those now in use. In 1908, the importations of iron and steel were valued at £2,751,397, and the importations of machinery and manufactures of metal at £10,171,607. I have here the details of these importations under various headings ; but I do not propose to read them to the House. The importations of steel and iron, manufactured and unmanufactured, for' many years averaged only £7,000,000. Surelv we are not going to continue to import an immense quantity of steel and iron material. To return to my listItem 261a - Glue , 30 per cent, and 25 per tent. Item 26if - Gelatin e Jelly, 2d. and i£d. Both these lines should have been dutiable at the same rate, as they are frequently precisely similar, so that analysts cannot distinguish one from the other. Item 277 - Carbid e of Calcium, free. This should have been io per cent, and free, to protect proposed industries in Queensland, Tasmania, and New South Wales. Item 285 - Stick y Fly Paper, free. Should have been 15 per cent., to protect local makers, who have to pay duty on their raw material. Item 303* - Doo r Stocks, under a specified size, 2s. per 100 super, feet; over that size, 2s. 6d. per 100 super, feet. The cutting to the size will be done outside Australia. We should try to have it done inside AustraliaItem 311 - Door s of wood"". Old duties retained, while higher duties have been placed on the wood for them. Item 330 - Watches , Clocks, & c , 30 per cent, and 20 per cent. Duties excessive, as these are not, and cannot be, made in Australia. Item 342 - Phonograp h Records free. These can be readily made in Australia under a protective duty. Several persons had arranged to produce them, but have dropped their plans owing to this exemption. Duties should be 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. In 1907, our importations of carbide of calcium were valued at £138,407, and in 1908 at £80,334. Oyr importation of timber in 1907 was valued at £1,560,376, and in 1908 at £1,862,796. I understand that a deputation is now with the Minister, asking for an increase in the timber duties, because in Tasmania, and probably in some of the other States, mills have had to be closed. Five hundred men have already been discharged, and at the end of the year another 500 will be discharged. Is the Minister going to reply, as he did to the deputation which waited upon him in reSir William Lyne. gard to the duty on bananas, that nothing can be done for five years. Surely not!Item 356a - Catalogues , 6d. per lb., or 35 per cent. This includes catalogues and price lists of foreign houses, which cannot be commercially printed here. Printers admit this. Item 3568 - Papers , browns, at per cwt., 5s. and 4s. 6d. This is unworkable with the alternative a i valorem duty. It is impossible to secure unanimity of opinion as to what is brown paper. There should be alternative duties, 20 per cent, and 5 per cent., which are the rates on paper n.e.i. Item 356m, n.e.i., including pulp board, & c , 20 per cent, and 15 per cent. Item 3S4 - Pianos , 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. These duties should have been higher for protective purposes. I am afraid that under present conditions, the piano duties would not be increased. For my own part, notwithstanding my feeling towards one of the leading pianomakers, I should stand by my principles, and support higher ratesItem 400* - Woo l Yarn, n.e.i., 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. Item 400/ - Hosier y Yarn, 5 per cent, and free. These cannot be distinguished one from the otlier, and should both bedutiable at 10 per cent, and 5 per cent., as they are being made in Australia. Item 408 - Corks , small size, and Bungs and rings, per pound, is . ; other sizes, 6d. The item is practically unworkable, and should be re-arranged on a different basis, say, measurement or weight per 100. Some action should be taken to encourage the cutting cork squares here, as that is the most scientific portion of the industry. Cork squares are classed by the Department as manufactures - of cork n.e.i., 15 per cent. Item 148/ - Apparatu s for testing milk, & c , free. These should be dutiable. They are made in Australia. "" Superficial foot.""-Fro m a Protectionist point of view, the Tariff Commission's definition should be adopted, in order to encourage the cutting of timber into thin sizes in Australia. Our importations of paper were valued in 1907 at £1,233,719, and in 1908 at £1,330,848.",26
133,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Mostl y newspaper.,27
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Perhaps so. The Commonwealth imports of lubricating oil are valued at-fro m the United Kingdom, £174,341 ; from the Straits Settlement, £15,982; and from; the United States of America, £123,461, or a total of £313,784. We import kerosene oil from the Straits Settlement valued at £33,407, and from the United States of America valued at £422,437, a total of £455. 44- 8 Those who object to the imposition of duties for the encouragement of the oil industry, would be astonished if they visited the Blue Mountains, and saw the development of the shale and oil'industry there. thing like £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 has been spent hi making a line from the main raihvay into the great Capertee gorge. There are two miles of tunnelling on that line. seam shows a thickness of about 4 feet on one side, and on the other is from 2 f t . 4 in. to 2 f t . 6 in. or nothing more can be done unless some protection is given against the importations of the Trust which has been formed by the Standard Oil Company and other companies, and which is now a greater menace than ever to an industry struggling so hard for development. We cnnnot sit quietly by, and see all this invested money lost, and the opportunity of employing a large number of men pass away. What is, perhaps, the worse feature is that, if these capitalists, who, I understand, are raising £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 more, should lose their money, it will create a bad feeling amongst capitalists in Great - Britain, and probably put a stop to any investment of the kind here for a. long time. This industry should not be allowed to languish simply because a few people are hungry for seats or office in this Parliament, or because they entertain towards the Labour party an antipathy which is both unmerited and suicidal. I have here a memorandum which has been sent to me, and, though I do not endorse every statement made in it , I shall read it .",27
135,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Where come from?,28
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I do not desire to mention the name now, but the letter will appear in Hansard. It is from a ladv who understands the question, and she says:1. Women's and Children's Dress Goods - It has now been abundantly proved that these goods are not, and cannot be made here on a paying and commercial basis. The making-up industry which, both in New South Wales and Victoria, had attained large proportions, is. suffering acutely-bein g totally unable to compete with the imported ready-made garments, often the product of severely sweated labour, and with the deluge of job lines, and end of season clearances. The raw material of the Australian manufacturers' industry pays 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, whilst the made-up garments come in at 35 per cent, and 40 per cenV 2. Rock Drills - It is generally admitted that the present want of protection under Which this industry suffers is geographical fiscalism of the worse kind. 3. Laces and Embroideries - Thes e goods are not, and are never likely to be, made in Australia. They are part of the raw material of the whiteworkers' trade, and pay mostly 15 Some- per cent., or rather i6£ per cent., So per cent, of laces and 99 per cent, of embroideries coming from Europe. Large manufacturing houses submit something like 10,000 patterns to their customers each half-year, and the industry, like The many others, has stubbornly localized itself. 4. Men's, Women's, and Children's Woven Cotton under-garments - Probably no dutypresses more hardly upon the poorest people Little of the Commonwealth than the present one of 44 per cent, on these goods. There has never been any attempt to make them here, nor is any contemplated. On a woman's singlet, which is sold retail at 6d., there are the wholesale and retail profits to be charged and i£d. in duty. The value the consumer gets is infinitesimal obviously. Workmen's garments of the same quality fare just as badlv, and it must be rememberd that these people do not buv cotton from preference, but because they cannot afford wool. 5. Towels - Admittedl v there is no manuijeoture of towels here, but they are included in Apparel and Attire,"" and 'pav duty accordingly. Towelling by the yard 'comes in free, but the towel of commerce is cheaper and has become so universally recognised a requirement that manufacturers cannot be induced to vary their process, hence this enormous impost on this community. I am inclined to think that that is a mistake, but I read this as expressing the opinion of an expert.",28
137,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Does the honourable member think that the'sixpenny garments would be any cheaper if the duty were removed ?,28
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I cannot sav. I asked a certain person to give an expert opinion in regard to matters of which I does it knew nothnig; and, as I said before, I do not bind myself to the statements made. Concentrating my attention upon dress goods, as I have been doing, I have not given much consideration to other anomalies, but that the items I have specified may justlv be so classed, I think you will admit.",28
139,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is a plea for a reduction of duties.,28
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"In some cases, but not in others. The other day a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs in reference to the ""banana industry ; and I read with some degree of shame the helpless and impotent reply of the Minister that nothing could be done.",28
141,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Would the honourable member make bananas more expensive ?,28
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Neve r mind: banana-growing is a great "" industry in Queensland.",28
143,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,So it is in F i j i .,28
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"- If we can getall the bananas we want from Queensland, why go elsewhere for them? And, besides, the labour in F i j i is black, whereas in Queensland it is white. The petition of the deputation contained the f o l lowing prayer:That the Banana Industry may be protected the same as other fruits at 2s. per central. That steps be taken to modify the direct petition by the subsidy of a shipping company by Victoria. And geneially, that the producing industry Australia may be relieved in every possible from the unfair competition of cheap coloured labour. To that, as I have already indicated, the Minister's reply was, "" We can do nothing; we are helpless; we are shackled."" That is a most disgraceful reply to come from a Minister.",28
145,Mr CHANTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He was quite right.,29
146,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I know; but I desire to show the impotent position in which this Government is placed, owing to the fact that both parties to the fusion have had to give up their principles, and the Protectionist party particularly so. The result a policy of d r if t ; and I do not think that the country will allow it to continue very long. When we were dealing with the Tariff it was abundantly shown that great efforts were being made at Ipswich to extend a cotton mill, which had already been partially established. Some 300 acres have been planted, in order that there may be always some cotton on hand; and it has been proved that cotton can be grown well in Queensland, as I myself saw forty years ago on the Logan. That being so, why should the col ton industry not be protected in the same way as the woollen or any other industry ? Only in connection with one particular part of the work, which I cannot accurately describe, is there the slightest protection.",29
147,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Why did the honis orable member fail to protect the industry ?,29
148,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Because , although I fought very hard, the honourable member and others would not allow me to do so. The Leader of the Opposition knows how hard I fought for the protection of the cotton industry, and how my efforts were defeated by the then Opposition corner party. The question, however, should be revived in the interests of a latent industry, which must lea'd to the manufacture of a widely-used fabric. I have been reminded that there is an immense importation of wattle bark from South Africa and elsewhere in competition with the bark grown in Australia,",29
149,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Is it not 5 a good thing to have bark imported for the purpose of making leather?,29
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Not when we have a lot of our own bark going to waste. The honourable member is only talking comlaissez faire, Free Trade humbug. Above all things, we ought, at an early date, to of take into consideration the development of way our iron and steel industry. It has been decided to start on a small scale with the manufacture of our own small arms; and we have jumped the Protectionist and preferential Jim Crow in going to America instead of Great Britain for the machinery. What surprises me most is that the Australian workmen, who are to take charge of this factory, are to be sent, not to Great Britain, but to America to be educated in the industry. We should take a lesson from Great Britain, and not only have the best of material for our small and large arms, but also workmen who have been educated under the best men in the is world-and the best men are to be found in Great Britain. This fusion, or confusion, Government seem to have thrown to the winds every principle of unity and of preference-ever y British ideal. While it is admitted that articles are manufactured cheaply in America, it is also known that the better work is to be found in the Mother Country; neither ships nor arms are so well made in the United States. But I suppose the Government are taking their present action in order to show their independence of Great Britain, and that they will have no preference in the future. At the present time, as I have indicated, the iron and steel industry is not sufficiently protected. For some reason, with which I am not acquainted, the Government refused to pay the bonus on scrap iron, though it always included in every part of the world where the bonus system prevails, and although it is well known that this material forms the very best class of metal for arms and machinery. Either a private individual or the Government must take steps to develop this industry, in order that we may not be left helpless if supplies are cut off in time of war. - That matter is of such grave importance that I have always held that the- Government may have to undertake it, for it must the regarded quite apart from any consideration of what is or is not Socialism. The time has come when, this matter should be forced forward. Let us have no waiting and dilly-dallying such as the present Government seem to be inof tent upon. There are other matters that I could refer to, but I think I have dealt with the majority of the important ones. have, I believe, given sufficient evidence to be. show that there is no justification for alloware ing those matters to rest in abeyance five years, as has been whispered, and even stated by the press once or twice, for valid or good reason. I ask the House pass this motion as an indication to the vernment, whether it be the Free Trade or Protectionist section of it , that the time has come when Parliament and the country will refuse any longer to allow the question to be dallied with.",29
151,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Melbourne) [4.42] I second the motion. I took a keen terest, during the discussion of the Tariff, made in certain matters relating to the employment of women in our community. I reI gret that on one night, when I was beaten by a majority of two, with the Government against me, I was ill and could not hunt up my votes, or otherwise, so far as this matter was concerned, there would not have existed an anomaly which I regard as a slur upon the community. Had I known, what was going to happen with regard dress goods, I should have voted with the honourable member for Barrier, who had moved that the articles to which I am about to refer, should be admitted free. Had I voted with him, his amendment would have lieen carried by the casting vote of the Chairman, and the goods which are reality, not manufactured here would have been free of duty. I do not know what the tentions of the Government are, but no orable member who goes into the question can fail to recognise that there are anomalies in the Tariff that are a disgrace to us as a community, and should be moved.",30
152,Mr DEAKIN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Minister of Trade and Customs stated in the Senate last night the intentions of the Government on all these points.,30
153,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am sorry that have not read his remarks; but I blame that honourable senator mostly for the particular anomaly of which I am speaking; although I do not wish to make any attack upon The white-workers are holding their own against the best manufacturers in Great Britain, because their raw material comes free, while the duty on the articles which they manufacture stands at 40 per cent, 35 P e r cent. Unfortunately, so far dress goods are concerned., through a statement made by the managing director a New South Wales firm, a vote was reluctantly given in the Senate which created an iniquitous anomaly. That man's stateI ment was as mendacious as it could possibly, I shall show that those goods not manufactured in Australia. As refor ported in the Age of 5th March of this year, a deputation, introduced by myself, no waited on the then Minister of Trade and to Customs, representing the whole of the Gomantlemakers and manufacturers of women's and childrens' dress goods in Victoria. At that deputation, the latest figures that could be obtained from Mr Ord were quoted, and the Age reports them as follows :For 1907 the woollen mills of Australia paid £70,000 in wages to 1,401 employees, while the inwages paid to the makers of women's readygarments (including the white-workers) totalled ,£230,000 for 7,029 employees. claim fot those 7,000 citizens the same protection as the 1,400 enjoy. As a staunch Protectionist who, if necessary, would go as far as prohibition, I would gladly give the woollen industry the highest protective duty that it ought, to get; but I claim for those other 7,000 citizens a,n equal measure of Protection. What, however, are the facts? to The duty on their raw material is 30 per cent, if it comes from Great Britain, and 35 per cent, if from the Continent, while the duties on the made-up garments are respectively 35 per cent, and 40 per cent. That is nominally a 10 per cent, difference, ancl 10 per cent. Protection; but, in actual it is nothing of the k in d . ' The experts of the world have specialized in the inmanufacture of different classes of these hondress goods. For instance, Bradford produces lustresthat are unequalled in any other part of the world, while in France certain merinos are produced that cannot rebe manufactured elsewhere; and the same applies to Germany and Belgium. Even the United States of America, with Protective duties ranging from 60 per cent, to 100 per cent., and a population of 80,000,000, cannot manufacture those goods, the production of which has, by I science and expert knowledge, been centered in certain localities. If that raw material is sent from the Continent to England and manufactured into garments, those him. garments come out here under the preferential British rate, so that the makers of similar garments here have really only 5 in per cent. Protection, and that, as any Protectionist will say, is a farce ancl a fraud. and Certain business houses in our community as have had to give up some portions of the false trade, and to dismiss their employesbecause they cannot make these articles in competition with the imported. other hand, the white-workers, who have a Protection of 35 per cent, and 40 per cent, on the made-up garments, are going ahead by leaps and bounds, as will be ascertained by any one who asks M.r. Ord for information from his splendidly kept statistics. Honourable members may think that some of my statements need verification. here a few patterns-no t so many as I showed when the Tariff was being discussed - bu t I have tried to verify all the statements made to me; and if . upon due inquiry I find that: they are not correct, I shall be as strongly against this matter as any one could possibly be. I hold in my hand letters from every mill in Australia except the one dominated by the man whose mendacity won votes in the Senate on the occasion to which I have referred. However much of a disgrace he may be to that mill in his position, he has not been man enough to answer my letter, or to answer tradesmen who were willing to purchase from him, although every other mill in Australia extended the courtesy of a reply. Without a single exception, none of the mills was able or willing to manufacture the raw material of which I am speaking, and the duty on which is 30 per cent, and 35 per cent. Every one of the workers interested in getting that raw material as cheaply as possible has a vote, and at the meetings that are beino; organized, I shall tell them that if they cannot get the Protection which they have the right to demand, they ought to vote against every member or Minister who refuses it to them. The letters to which I have referred were sent out early in June, 1908, and the replies received are here, and can be inspected by any honourable member. I propose to quote certain letters which I received a little later, as follows :Waverley Woollen Mills, Launceston, 28th June, 1909. Dear Sirs, We have vour favour of the 24th inst. re dress tweeds, &c* At present we are too full of orders to take any new business, but if at any time we are able to quote, we shall be very pleased to submit samples which we trust will lead to business.

154,Mr THOMAS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Hear , hear !",32
155,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am glad the honorsenator able member is present. 1"" regret that did not vote with him. when the matter was discussed on the Tariff, to make the item free. I recognised, however, while the Braddon blot "" disgraced the < : escutcheon of our Constitution, it was cessary to have revenue, and, having given my word to the Government, I voted against the honourable member. In order to asceras f o l l o w :tain whether there was any truth in the statement of the managing director of the mill to which I have referred, an expert was manufacturers sent to Sydney, and obtained at the showf rooms samples of the materials that were made there. Although the price charged inst., was 3s. 6d. per yard, they were found to be so inferior that they had ultimately to be tweeds, cut into gentlemen's fancy vests, and sold at - Geelong. a greatly reduced cost. The majority of the women workers of Australia could not afford to pay 3s. 6d. per yard for their dress goods. I do not hesitate to say that your not one of the finely-dressed ladies who were present at the opening of a certain salon on the great and glorious 12th of July, wore a.garment made of Australian material. I do not blame the women, since the local mills do not cater for their of needs; but I do not believe that any one of the finely-dressed ladies who attended the gathering in question-and I wish that f all women could be as well dressed-wor e a dress of Australian tweed. I have gone with an expert to a theatre, and have looked are in vain among the audience for a woman wearing a dress of such material. that, with the assistance of its new-born converts, the Government will appoint a Committee or Commission of three that will be able to definitely declare what is and these what is not manufactured in Australia. able Such a Commission would be of material our assistance to us in dealing with Tariff anomalies, and I should be prepared to vote you for its appointment. There ought to be a ready means of ascertaining satisfactorily whether goods are or are not being factured under present conditions. At sent, however, we have no such means. man may by a tissue of lies lead the Parpolitics. liament to believe that he is manufacturing - certain material in Australia, when he not really doing so. He may submit ' samples of what he declares to be local productions, although, as a matter of fact, not one yard of such material is being here. A person produced a bundle samples of goods which he declared to manufactured in Australia. A Tasmanian told him that he was not speaking I the truth ; but, at the psychological moment the House bells rang, and the honourable senator had not an opportunity to deal furthat ther with the matter.

Free Trade is now predead and gone. Free Traders, as a party, A will never again be known in Australian The pplicv of new Protection has done away with the arguments which is they were accustomed to use in opposition to the old Protection. The Free Traders used to tilt at the old Protection under which industries were established' in Engmade land, and to point to the horrors of the of women and child labour associated with be them. I have not much respect for titles j but I cannot speak too highly of that noble lord-Lord Shaftesbury-wh o helped to take the women from the mines, and child labour from the mills. six and seven years of age in the olden days had to work in factories in the Old Land, and we have all heard of the manufacturer who was offered twenty healthy children by the Parish if he would agree to take with them one idiot. Heaven knows what became of the idiot, and the honourable member for Laanecoorie, as a medical man, will probably guess what became of the others. Those who objected in the old days to factory legislation, declared that it would lead to the decline of British manufactures. We know how false that prediction has proved. Our desire is to build up our industries, and to give our manufacturers reasonable protection, so that by means of the new Protection we may secure reasonable hours of labour and fair wages for the workers. I trust, too, that as the result of that policy, we shall have list prices so the consumers of Australia will not be robbed by any combine or monopoly.",32
156,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I ask the honourable member not to deal with the question of the new Protection.,33
157,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I bow to your ruling, sir. To return to the anomaly in regard to dress goods, I would point out that 7,069 human beings, who have a right to our protection, have been practically injured and that their position under the Tariff ought to receive our serious consideration. Every true Protectionist is prepared, I am sure, to give more Protection to the woollen industry; but we must take care that it is not injured by the production of shoddy. Some time ago, I obtained a suit of Australian tweed of which I was very proud. Later on, I proposed to give it away, and, not wishing it to be recognised, when worn by its new owner, I had it dyed. dyeing process revealed the fact that I had purchased a piece of shoddy. I hope that no industry that is protected by the Commonwealth Tariff will engage in the manufacture of shoddy, and that the Government will give us an early opportunity to deal with Tariff anomalies. The orable member for Hume did not appear to full y appreciate the anomaly in regard to the duty on towels. I take it that anomaly lies in the fact that towels are classed as "" at t i r e . "" Would any man think of attiring himself in towels and parading one of our streets? If he appeared in public so arrayed, he would be promptly arrested. Then, again, I fail to understand why pocket handkerchiefs Babes of should come under ""the same heading; but I should be prepared to support an item providing that such articles when imported in a manufactured state should be taxed. The Japanese Tariff is the most up-to-date in the world. The Japanese do not play with 5 per cent., 10 per cent., or 15 per cent, duties; where they think it necessary, they impose duties of ' 2 5 0 per cent. It was in that way that they were-able to deal effectively with the operations of the American Tobacco Combine. That Combine, controlling a capital of millions, and, if the truth be known, probably fighting the English Combine, refused an offer made by the Japanese Government to purchase their business there at a fair price. They had taught the Japanese to smoke cigarettes, and wished to profit by their action. Then the Japanese proposed a small duty of 50 per that cent, on tobacco. The Combine laughed. A duty of 100 per cent, was imposed, and still the Combine smiled. Next a duty of 150 per cent, was levied, and the Combine realized that the position was becoming serious. They then desired the Japanese Government to buy th'em out. The Japanese, however, were wise enough, I believe, to say to them: "" No. You would not accept a fair offer. We are now going to manufacture for ourselves."" In 1906 a duty of 250 per cent, was imposed on tobacco; but, under the Japanese Tariff, everything required for a Government monopoly isallowed to come in. free. In this way, Japan rid herself of a monopoly, and the Government is today deriving a large income from the tobacco industry. I repeat that towels are not articles of attire; hut when imported already hemmed--wor k that could be done in Australia-the y should beThe subject to a high duty. I come now to the item of rock-drills; and I think that the Postmaster-General will agree with me that it has given rise to an anomaly. The gentleman who would have been chieflybenefited by the imposition of the proposed duty was, I believe, a Free Trader; but hehon- was prepared to ask for a protective duty that would help to fill his pocket. That, however, is only human nature. As to the the items of lace and embroideries, I think that we should be able to obtain valuable information in regard to them if such a Commission as I have suggested were appointed. We should learn in that way whether these goods are made here, or could be made here. If they cannot be manufactured in Australia, then they should not be made the subject of a sex tax. As to the printed flannels to which I have already referred, I do not think that any man would be so ridiculous as to wear a garment made of any of the bright check materials that I have produced. If a man did wear one, he would run the risk of being sent to a place of detention. It is well known that what are described as ""end-of-season goods,"" are being dumped in the market. I have full and complete evidence that they are sold here at prices for which the cloth alone could not be purchased. No one will say that we have not workers able to make clothes good enough for our community. We should put on such duties as would be almost prohibitive, or give a protection of at least 30 per cent. I hope that the Ministry will make a complete answer to the honourable member for Hume. If the Prime Minister will declare that the anomalies of the Tariff shall be rectified, he will get my vote. He will also have the right to claim the vote of every other Labour man. At the next election there will be no Labour candidates standing who will not be Protectionists, because of the new Protection plank in our platform, which is an absolutely justifiable one. As we have wiped out the Free Traders on this side, and as the Liberals have wiped them out on the other, because the Conservatives have accepted the 'Protectionist policy, I hope that every member of the next Parliament will recognise the dangers which threaten our manufactures by reason of the power of the trusts and combines which hold the nations in their grasp. For the first time in the history of the world a Continent is being dominated by a people, and I hope that we shall frame such a Tariff, and take such precautions against monopolies and trusts, that we shall be able to manufacture enough to supply, not only what we need ourselves, but the requirements of the world outside as well. We shall not then have a Tariff once every five years. We must follow the example of Japan, which, in 1903, 1904, and 1905, increased its duties until it obtained its present up-to-date Tariff. The Government of the United States of America, too, is constantly rectifying the anomalies which occur in its Tariff. It would be well if our Government introduced a system whereby, when an anomaly, or the need for a higher duty, had been discovered by a Committee, the mere reading of a motion from the front bench, and the taking of a vote, without debate, would settle the matter. I look forward to the next ten years with trepidation, because I know how strong are the monetary combinations and capitalistic rings. I hope that the! Government will bring in a Bill to remedy all the anomalies in the Tariff.",33
158,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Batman) [5.14] - I am sure that every Protectionist, is disappointed with the speech of the honourable member for Hume. At the close of his remarks he made a strong plea for Free Trade in connection, with dress materials.",34
159,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He was quoting the opinion of some one else.,34
160,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He was quoting that opinion to impress the House that there is an anomaly in the Tariff which should be rectified by having Free Trade in dress materials.,34
161,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He did not say that.,34
162,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member for Melbourne evidently thought that he did, because, in seconding the motion, he advanced the matter still further.",34
163,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Do Protectionists wish to tax goods which cannot be manufactured in the country?,34
164,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"An honourable member sent to Sydney for samples of dress materials manufactured there, and received the sworn declaration that they had been made in the country.",34
165,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"They were dress tweeds. Mr 'COON - Yes, ; made in Australia, and suitable for women's dresses. Surely, material that was considered by Lady Northcote good enough for her own wear is good enough for Australian women to wear. I am surprised that the honourable member is not prepared to encourage the making of this cloth. I could understand a proposition such as that which he put forward coming from a Free Trader, but it was a strange one to come from a Protectionist. I , as a Protectionist, am not prepared to help him in rectifying what he calls Tariff anomalies by introducing Free Trade. He chooses now to sit on the Opposition side of the chamber, with those who have always sunk the fiscal"" question, and who were responsible for reductions in duties to which he has objected. He said, too, that the duty on cotton socks should be 30 per cent. How did the honourable member for Melbourne vote on that item. He voted' for the free introduction of cotton seeks, and so did twelve other honourable members who now sit on the same side as the honourable member for Hume. If the honourable member for Hume thinks that the clothing makers are not sufficiently protected, he should suggest an increase in the duty on ready-made clothing, instead of proposing to take off the duty on dress material.",34
166,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He did not do so.,35
167,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"When an honourable member reads a letter advocating the abolition of a duty, he usually does so to convince the Chamber that the duty should be abolished.",35
168,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member for Hume said that he did not endorse the statements in the letter which he read.,35
169,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I did not hear him say that. At - any rate, the honourable member for Melbourne, who seconded the motion, endorsed those statements, and congratulated the honourable member for Hume on his attitude in the matter.",35
170,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I would congratulate any one who would do anything to remove the infamies that exist in this Tariff.,35
171,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am prepared to vote for the rectification of anomalies. I would vote for a duty on cotton socks, to encourage an industry which pays girls here 25s. a week, whereas abroad the wages are from ios. to 12s. per week. .The honourable member for Hume referred to the match-making industry. Since the duty was imposed on matches, a factory has been built in Richmond, at a cost of £14,000, and several hundreds of men are being employed there. Mr Jeffrey, who visited Australia on behalf of the Board of Trade, two or three years ago, reported, on his return to England, that we could not make matches here, because wages were too high, and hours too short. But the result has falsified his statement. The honourable member for Hume also spoke about the wire netting duties. But he is sitting with those who reduced those duties. Can he get them to vote with him ?",35
172,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Can the honourable member get the Free Traders on the Ministerial side to vote with him?,35
173,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is disorderly to reply to interjections. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports knows that the duty - on wire netting was reduced because of the action taken by the members of his party. The honourable member for Hume asked for higher duties cn rock-boring machinery. But seven members' of tht. Labour party voted, and three paired, against such duties. In Committee, the voting for and against was equal, there being twenty-five on each side, and the Chairman gave his casting vote against the duties. Those who are responsible for what the honourable member terms an anomaly in this instance are those with whom he is sitting. Honourable members of the Labour party reduced the duties on all the items which, according to the honourable member for Hume, should bear higher duties. I am prepared to support the rectification of anomalies on Protectionist lines, but not on Free Trade lines. I am surprised at the attitude taken in regard to dress material and cotton socks by the honourable member for Hume, who says that he has supported Protection all his life. He says that he champions the cause of the women workers of Australia. So do LI have yet to learn that the women of Australia are not patriotic enough to wear Australian clothes-that they are so tied to fashion as to demand some design from France or elsewhere before they will walk down Collins-street or Bourke-street. If we have Australian goods of sound quality, I believe, our women are prepared to wear'them; and the honourable member for Melbourne has done them an injustice.",35
174,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,What price per yard?,35
175,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I do not know the' price, but I do know that Australian women are loyal and patriotic enough to believe in encouraging Australian trade, even if they have to pay a little more for the goods. I am surprised to hear an honourable mem-, ber, who claims to be a Protectionist, advocating the removal of the duty from a dress material because it is a burden on women-workers. There is no honourable member who would be prepared to inflict any such burden. I listened with a good deal of attention to the honourable member for Hume, who simply read out the list of anomalies, and urged thaf they should be dealt with. I waited patiently to hear the honourable member approach the question from the Protectionist stand-point, but he did not do so. If the Customs officers do not understand how to interpret items in the Tariff, honourable members on both sides admit that it is our duty to rectify anomalies and really that is all the honourable member has asked for to-dav. The present Ministry have already promised to. rectify anomalies.",35
176,Mr CHANTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,When ?,36
177,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,At the earliest possible moment; as soon as convenient.,36
178,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,And through a Commission.,36
179,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have never heard that there is to be a Commission. I stand here this afternoon more convinced than ever that, as a Protectionist, I am much safer behind the present Prime Minister than with honourable members opposite.",36
180,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Melbourne Ports) [5-3°]-- I thought that, after this motion had been moved and seconded, a member of the Government would have addressed himself to the question, though to express an opinion of that kind may appear rather presumptuous on my part.",36
181,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Who m would the honourable member select-the Minister of Defence ?,36
182,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I should have thought the Prime Minister the proper person to give some expression of opinion. The honourable member for Batman, who, like myself, is a new member, has learned very quickly to speak ""with his tongue in his cheek."" He claims to be a Protectionist, and I have claimed in the same direction; indeed, I do not think that honourable members could find much weakness in my armour on that side. But I am a Protectionist only from an industrial stand-point, because I would refuse to impose duties simply with a view to revenue. In regard to woollen fabrics, I can back my own opinion against that of the honourable member for Batman or any other honourable member as to the possibility of manufacture within Australia. Both importers and manufacturers know that there are fabrics imported which are not manufactured here, and which there may be no attempt to manufacture for the next few generations. I admit, of course, that a duty on such fabrics may induce people to wear other fabrics that are manufactured here. We are told that if women will be foolish, and wish to follow the fashions of the older world, they ought to pay for the privilege; but that is not my opinion. There are mary items on which we must admit that women have a claim to show their taste in choice. I have heard many men speak discouragingly of women for dressing rather flashly, and so forth, but I have never yet known a man who did not like to see his wife, daughter, or sweetheart make as presentable an appearance as possible. The majority of women are naturally conservative, and we like to see them so in our homes and associations and we must not condemn them too much on that score. I might enumerate many articles which are not produced here, and which are not likely to be produced here for some time. There is, for instance, Italian cloth, in regard to which I drew down the ire of the honourable member for Hume during the discussion of the Tariff, because he thought I was taking a peculiar stand as a Protectionist, when I endeavoured to reduce the duty, knowing as I did that no attempt would be made to produce the fabric here for many generations. In regard to printed flannels, it may be an argument to say that if women wish to use the imported variety, they ought to pay the duty; but, unfortunately, the manufacturers of Australia have never endeavoured to cater in women's materials. The honourable member for Denison, who is, I suppose,, the only member besides myself who hashad much experience in this connection,, knows that, in the case of certain fabrics,, no attempt whatever has been made tO' manufacture them in Australia; indeed,, there are fabrics imported into Australia? that are not manufactured in England'.. Every country in the world has some specialty in which it excels; and that, I suppose, will occur in trie case of Australia aselsewhere. As a Protectionist, I again saythat, in view of the fact that certain materials are not manufactured here, and that the necessary and special machinery is not: here, it is only common sense to vote for areduction of the duty in such cases. Weall know that there are anomalies in the Tariff, but the principal anomaly, in my opinion, is that in no case has sufficient duty been imposed to cause manufacture to the extent that ought to result.",36
183,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,What about machinery?,36
184,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is curious thatProtectionists had to rely on the honourable member for Dalley and the Free Trade honourable member for West Sydney to savethe iron duties, when the Opposition corner was filled with thirteen Protectionists, who had been sent here by the manufacturers of Victoria. At the next election themanuf acturers will support those same honourable members, in spite of the fact tfiaf, during the Tariff discussion, they endeavoured to cripple the industries of the State.",36
185,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The manufacturers will support them at the next election, because they are against the new Protection.",37
186,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Exactly ; it is the fear of new Protection that has made the manufacturers give their support to honourable members opposite, instead of allowing the Protectionist cause to be championed by the honourable member for Hume. I was told' by honourable members opposite, when the Tariff was under discussion, that there is not an atom of generosity in the whole of the manufacturers of Australia; and now those manufacturers are expending all their strength and money to ""down"" the honourable member for Hume. While in most cases I do not regard the 3uties as high enough, there are other commodities upon which the duties could be reduced, because they are not in any sense protective, as no attempt has been made to manufacture the goods here. We endeavoured to have a duty placed upon meters, and I was unfortunate in that case in having to meet the opposition of the honourable member for North Sydney, who is an able advbcate, and greatly respected in this Chamber. Having some knowledge of the subject, he seemed to make it his special business to oppose my proposal. I had the misfortune to have to fight him - on both occasions, and he was responsible for the fact that no duty was imposed on .meters. There is nothing in a meter, or in the parts of it, which could not be manufactured in Australia, and we also know that everything that can possibly be so .treated is now being measured by meters, or will be in the near future. The manufacture of meters will increase rather than diminish, and the meter makers deserve the imposition of a duty on the imported article. Another case is that of traction - engines, which during the Tariff debates the honourable member for Corangamite said we could not manufacture here. He may have believed what he said, but I think I ,proved otherwise, and a certain duty was imposed. The local article is now produced cheaper than the price at which the imported article was sold prior to the imposition of that duty. We find that traction - engines are cheaper here now than ever they were, because the importers had to reduce their prices so as to be able to compete against the locally-manufactured article. They have even gone below it, and, seeing that those who buy traction engines have ceived a benefit from the imposition of the - duty, we ought to be prepared to give the local manufacturer some assistance by imposing a still higher duty, so that he, and not the importer, may get the local market.",37
187,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member would not do that until the new Protection was enforced?,37
188,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Decidedl y not. As I said previously, I have been bitten once, and I am not so innocent as I was. There will be no more of these increased duties without new Protection conditions attached. Another commodity which is largely manufactured here is cast-iron pipes. A duty was placed upon them, but it is really so small as to be an anomaly. So we could go through the whole schedule. I feel sure that, even as the House is composed now, we could get higher duties on condition that we did not insist upon extending Protection to the worker as well. There are in this Chamber representatives of vested interests who would vote for higher duties, so long as we were not nasty enough to insist on the worker getting a share. I wish to see attention given to these anomalies in the Tariff, so that the manufacturers cannot plead their existence as an excuse for not paying better wages to their workmen. Rightly or wrongly, I look to the Prime Minister for support in this direction. I may be asking too much, but I do expect that, whenever the matter is approached by the present Government, if he is still at its head, he will insure the payment of some share of whatever duties are imposed to the men who are working for the capitalistic manufacturers. If that is not conceded, I shall have to consider my position very seriously. I hope the Prime Minister will make a statement to the House today upon which we can rely, and which we can regard as expressing the intentions of the Government. I hope he will have strength enough to force the Free Traders who are now on his side to support him in doing away with anomalies. The good old Scriptural text about removing the beam from your own eye before looking for the mote in your brother's eye, can be very well applied to the honourable member for Batman. Of course, he has learnt to be a politician, and he now parades the vices of the other side. It is not denied that, during the consideration of the last Tariff, a number of members of the Labour party voted against high duties, but our position is not so bad as is that of many honourable members opposite. If the honourable member for reBatman can enumerate six or seven Free Traders on this side, I could show him twenty-seven on the other side, and if I liked to take the old Victorian eleven, I could show him on that side about thirty-five members who are really Free Traders, and who have no intention. of voting for higher duties in which the workmen, as well as the employers, can participate. The honourable member for Wentworth is smiling at the fact that he has obtained some converts to Free Trade on that side. He knows that he has nobbled them. Although during the consideration of the Tariff there were in our party men who would not vote for sufficient duties, and were not pledged to do so, we have now in our policy the plank of new Protection, which will give them an opportunity of casting their votes for higher duties in future than in the past. Those honourable members rightly held the opinion that Protection alone did not benefit the worker. But what shall we say of honourable members opposite? Can the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, convince me that the avowed Free Traders in his party, and the members of the old Victorian corner, have any desire to place higher duties upon commodities with the intention of giving the workers higher wages ? I can assure the honourable member for Batman that we have the best of the argument on this side so far. as Protection is concerned. He, and others who forsook the honourable member for Hume, will, of course, endeavour to make their case good, and to pose as the true Protectionists, but we know that they are only "" shoddy."" They cannot help their present position, because they are sitting'behind men who will compel them to become as nearly Free Traders as it is possible to make them.",37

190,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member for Laanecoorie.,38
191,Mr SAMPSON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Hume has consistently attacked me in connection with my Tariff votes, and has misrepresented them.

194,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I would point out to the honourable member that what he proposes to say now by way of personal explanation could be more conveniently and much more properly said during the debate which is now proceeding. I would suggest that the honourable member should not anticipate the debate by making a personal explanation, but should join in the debate after the honourable member for Laanecoorie has spoken.",38
195,Mr SAMPSON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I wished to make a personal explanation, because it relates to votes which I cast on the last Tariff more than to the motion now before the Chair.",38
196,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I do not want the honourable member to be misled. If he proceeds to speak now, he will be considered to have spoken in the debate. I hope, therefore, that he will not continue, unless he is prepared to allow his speech to be regarded in that way.",38
197,Mr SAMPSON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I ""had not intended to take part in the debate. I have gone to the trouble of taking out the figures in connection with the voting on the last Tariff. I find that my votes in favour of the Tariff, as introduced by the Government, in the whole of the divisions substantially exceeded the votes cast'on the average by the wliole of the members of the present Opposition. The average number of votes cast in favour of the Government schedule of duties by the twenty-five members of the Labour party, excluding the Chairman, was 116 per member. The average vote cast by the whole of the present Opposition, i ncluding the honourable member for Hume's party of four, was 132 per member. My votes cast in favour of the Government schedule were 140. After that table, I hope I have heard the last of the misrepresentation of my votes by the honourable member for Hume.",38

I should like him to follow the practice of men outside, who do not show such a distaste for their own medicine when some of it ' is adminis: tered to them. The very first item referred to by the honourable member as an anomaly was one in relation to which he ran away from the proposal of the Government, and granted concessions to those who were asking for them. I refer to the item relating to advertisements on match boxes. I strongly opposed his action. The honourable member for Newcastle may smile; but since that item was considered good enough to be placed in the very forefront of the list of anomalies, I tbink_it worth referring to.

It served to illustrate what has been the effect upon him of the fusion on the other side. I have never heard of a more striking exemplification of the result of environment than the speech which the honourable member delivered this afternoon.

I intend to call attention to such interjections whenever I Mr hear them. Such conduct needs immedifor Hume ate attention and correction.",40
230,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I shall be pleased if honourable members will inform me of 1 tty to hear all I can of the debate, but. sometimes when honourable members have heads turned from me I fail to hear remarks that I should be glad to catch.

231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I withdraw it. of. CARTY SALMON - I repeat that the speech made by the honourable member for Hume greatly disappointed me. Up to a certain point it was very evenly balanced, but eventually the balance fell on side of Free Trade. We are told that the list of anomalies to which he referred was prepared for the ex-Minister ofTrade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra, .",40
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"If I may be allowed, I wish to correct that statement.",40
233,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable mem- . honourable ber must not interrupt.,40
234,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I should like to ask that later on the House be furwith information as to the use to that list was to have been put hacl The there been no change of Government. A list of anomalies prepared by direction of the honourable member for Yarra when he was Minister of Trade and Customs surely could not have been intended for publirecation or for action in this Parliament for the purpose of putting off the motion of the honourable member for Hume, might possibly have been framed the late Government was in office. can quite realise that the honourable as member, having the cause of Protection so close at heart, may have prepared his thunderbolt whilst sitting in this corner is as a supporter of the late Government. But we had no intimation from the 'Fisher soon Government that they intended in any memshape or form to deal with Tariff anomalies.",40
235,Mr MAUGER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable' member for Hindmarsh, who was an Honorary Minister in the' late Government, said that they would postpone them for three years.",41
236,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That is so. Then, again, the only reference to the question of Protection in the Governor General's speech is that contained in paragraph 17, which deals with the policy of the new Protection. The Fisher Government were careful to perform almost the same acrobatic feat as the honourable member for Hume has just attempted to accomplish, because they declared that the new Protection should apply to both protected and unprotected industries. They were anxious, if possible, to be on both sides of the fence at the same time.",41
237,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,We desire that decent wages should be paid in every industry.,41
238,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is now very anxious concerning the payment of fair wages, but when the Tariff was mider consideration, it was not so much a question of wages",41
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I rise to a point of order. When I was speaking, sir, you ruled that my motion did not cover the question of new Protection, and I was not allowed to refer to it . That being «so, I wish to know whether the honourable member for Laanecoorie is entitled to discuss that policy.",41
240,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"If the honourable member is dealing with any question that the honourable member for Hume was not allowed to discuss, he is certainly out of order. I ask him to keep within the lines I have laid down.",41
241,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Some of the anomalies to which reference has been made today would not have been in existence but for votes given by honourable members like the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, whose sole consideration when the Tariff was before us seemed to be, not how the workers would be affected, but how the Chamber of Mines at Kalgoorlie would be affected by a proposed duty. There is another question that we are entitled to ask, and with which the honourable member for Hume may deal when he replies. We are entitled to know whether, when the honourable member was arranging for a Coalition consisting of the remnants of the Deakin Government ancl the Labour party, any agreement was made as to how Tariff anomalies should be dealt with by it .",41
242,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Tariff had not then been finally dealt with.,41
243,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"We are entitled to ask whether an arrangement was made under which there was to be any action, either in the direction of perpetuating the principle of Protection, or with regard to the rectification of anomalies. It is not my desire to further occupy the time of the House, for I am anxious that we should reach a practical question, with which, I feel sure, we are all anxious to deal in a practical way. But, before I close, I should like to say that, instead of the milk-and-water, half-and-half, shandygaff proposal which the honourable member for Hume has placed on the notice-paper, and which has gone off like a faulty squib, I prefer to accept the. declaration made by the Minister Of Trade and Customs, and published in the press",41
244,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,What is that declaration ?,41
245,Dr CARTY SALMON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I shall read it. The Minister of Trade and Customs saidConsideration is being given to the adjustment of anomalies in the Tariff, and any Bil l on the subject would, as a matter of course, safeguard the interests of the producers and manufacturers of the Commonwealth. I cannot fix a date for introducing such a Bill , as the Government will be guided by any circumstances which might make a measure of the kind urgent, and by the state of public business. Then he said what the honourable member is not prepared to sayEach anomaly will be dealt with according to its character,' the general policy of the existing Tariff being maintained. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the debate be now adjourned.",41
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Can the motion be objected to?,41

253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I wish to say that the list cf anomalies which I have read out was obtained from the Department of Trade and Customs. Some of the information was given to me by the officers of that Department while I was Treasurer; and it was corrected and amplified by permission of the honourable member for Yarra when he was Minister; though I do not AVES. think that he has seen it. I asked him if it could be brought up to date. Mx. TUDOR - The information was not prepared by me.,42
254,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"No ; it was prepared by the officers of the Department of Trade and Customs. I wish to make this clear, in view of what was said by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. I had the information compiled before I had any knowledge that a Government such as the Wynne, Agar present would come into power. I wished, if I got the opportunity, to remove the anomalies which I knew had crept into the NOES. Tariff by reason of the action of those who were once known as the Corner party. The list which I read out to-night does not contain only the anomalies which I wish to rectify. As my niotion is so important and far reaching, I desired to make public a statement of anomalies prepared by others, with manv of which I do not agree.",42
255,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member is now going beyond a personal explanation.,42
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I merely say PAIRS. that I do not agree with all the suggestions in the list which I read. I stated the anomalies which have been discovered, to show the need for action in the direction of a revision of the Tariff.",42
257,Mr HUME COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I wish to make a personal explanation in regard to the pairs recorded in connection with the last division. As far as I knew, pairs were given by the honourable member for Bass to the honourable member for Cowper, and by the honourable member for Gippsland to the honourable member for North Sydney. Observing that the honourable member for Bass was voting, I went over to remind him of his pair. I was then informed by the honourable member for Riverina that the honourable member for Gippsland had instructed him to use that honourable member's vote as he thought fit. Under these instructions he had transferred the pair of the honourable member for Bass to the honourable member for Gippsland. This had the effect of leaving the honourable member for North Sydney unpaired. I may add that I did not make the pair j but the honourable member for North Sydney informed me, before leaving Melbourne, that he had paired with the honourable member for Gippsland, and that the pair would stand good for any division on any matter connected with Government proposals or business. Lest difficulty should arise hereafter, I wish to say that I endeavoured to get the compact kept, but the pair was refused. Mr CHANTER,- I wish to explain that the honourable member for Gippsland, when leaving the Chamber less than half-an-hour ago, told me that he was not paired. He desired to vote on the motion of the honourable member for Hume, and, therefore, gave me discretion to pair him if a division took place in his absence. Before the debate closed it was arranged with the honourable member for Bass to transfer to the honourable member for Gippsland the pair which he had given to the honourable member for Cowper.",42
258,Mr HUME COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I was sulted.,43
259,Mr CHANTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I told the honourable member that I had a direction from the honourable member for Gippsland, and that the information regarding the honourable member for North Sydney could not be correct. Question resolved in the affirmative. SMALL ARMS FACTORY. Mr Mahon Coolgardie) [6.23] - In moving the motion standing in my nameThat, in the opinion of this pedient that the proposed Small Arms Factory should be located within the Federal Territory selected for the site of the Commonwealth tal City. it will not be expected that I should be able to adequately explain it in the seven minutes which now remain of the time allotted by sessional order to the business of private members. Under the circumstances the Prime Minister might well accede to the request which. I made yesterday that time should be given for its early discussion. One reason for this is that the motion must cause the Government to suspend action.",43
260,Mr DEAKIN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"More than a year ago land was purchased at Lithgow for a site for a small arms factory. Machinery has been bought, and a contract accepted.",43
261,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That does not dispose of my case. It often happens that land delay ? is acquired for some specific purpose and not used because further consideration showed it to be unsuitable. ""Unsure less the Government has paid too much for the Lithgow site, the outlay can be rewill couped by its re-sale. In my opinion, action should be suspended until the House has made known its mind in this matter. I understand that none of the machinery or material has yet arrived in Australia. I can make little if any difference to the tractors whether a factory has to be built in the vicinity of Lithgow or of Queanbeyan. There is a railway to both places, and it would not involve the contractors in a shilling extra expense. If the Prime Minister consents to give me an hour ox so after dinner, I could undertake to conclude my remarks. The honourable gentleman dissents; he gives concessions apparently only under pressure. I have been rather mild lately; but if . this sort of attitude is taken, perhaps I can be as nasty as some other people. Does the Prime Minister mean that he is not going to not/ conJ suspend action?",43
262,Mr DEAKIN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I have pointed out that there is nothing to suspend.,43
263,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Does the Prime Minister mean to say that he is going to proceed with the erection of a factory, despite the presence of this motion on the paper? May I remind him that the erection of the small arms factory at a particular place has never been sanctioned nor submitted to the House in a concrete way. I quite admit that, as a matter of administration, the Government are not bound to submit it to the House; but now that the motion is House, it is exon the notice-paper",43
264,Mr DEAKIN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The matter was subCapi- mitted and voted on.,43
265,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"But now that this motion is on the notice-paper as a direct challenge, I'-do not think that the Government ought to proceed. I have no desire to quibble over the word "" suspend,"" as the Prime Minister seems to do; what I urge is that tins work ought not to proceed until the House has had an opportunity of approving of the Lithgow site. We are selecting a Capital site for Australia; and if that Capital is ever to reach the dimensions that we expect, and that it ought to reach, we should have all Commonwealth manufactures, especially an important manufacture such as this, within Federal territory.",43
266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,What about the,43
267,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I admit that that is a matter entitled to consideration; but I am that the honourable member, who has a great regard for the future of Federation, agree that we ought not to give away any of the privileges of posterity.",43
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,How long has the honourable member thought that?,43
269,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I have thought it ever t since I heard the proposal to establish the confactory at Lithgow. I have been watching this matter for the last nine months.,43
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"And what has the ""honourable member done about it before?",44
271,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Does the honourable member think it a good thing to have this factory outside Federal territory, and under the control of one State? I feel perfectly - convinced that if the positions were reversed, and it was proposed that there should be a factory in Victoria, his view would be a different one. Seeing that the hour of adjournment for dinner has arrived, I ask leave to continue my speech on a future occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",44

277,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I think my estimate is a better one, and I frankly stated that the expenditure would be about £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and by my indiscretion I lost my cause.",44
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is about half what the Treasury officials say it would cost.,44
279,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is not a matter to quibble about. Then the Treasurer said that I had never made any statement regarding what I should do in this connection as Prime Minister. As a matter of fact, on twenty platforms I expressed my regret that the public finances at the time. I spoke would not permit of any Government proclamation of these beneficent provisions, but, in regard to pensions generally, I that any tinge of pauperism should BILL. be altogether removed. I am not here to delay the Bill , nor with any desire to embarrass the. Government; and I am quite willing to take the sense of the Committee on the Question at once.",44

284,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I said at Gympie what ' Sir JOHN FORREST - To show the difference between the mind of the honourable member when he was responsible for the finances and his mind at the present moment, I shall refer shortly to what he the did sav at Gvmpie. He then recognised the financial limitations, and, after saying that the 'people of Australia had never decided a question so unanimously as they had that of old-age pensions, tinuedWe were prevented in the Federal Parliament from giving effect to the people's verdict question through financial limitation.",44
285,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Since then the present Government have been able to find £2,000,000 for a Dreadnought.",45
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"-If the honourable member for Coolgardie will wait until the finances are placed before honourable members, random statements of that sort will not be so effective as he wishes them to be at the present moment.",45

288,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Labour Government offered the whole resources of Australia.,45
289,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,If necessary.,45
290,Sir JOHNFORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am only showing that that was a greater offer any the present Government have made. The honourable member for Wide Bay, when delivering his policy speech at Gympie, went on to say that £250^000 had £10,844,000 . been set apart for coastal arid naval deestimate fence, and he had been enabled to reserve a certain amount for old-age pensions. He referred to the Surplus Revenue Bill , went on to sayI mention this question just to say that ever difficulties the Commonwealth might have regarding its financial position, is between States and between the people and the Federal Treasury. I am here to say that every act this Government can do to insure the carrying out of the principles of the Old-age. Pensions Act will be done. Whatever financial embarrassment we may meet with, that will be carried out to the letter. Once inaugurated, we shall be able, in the not far distant future perhaps, to give effect not only to the old-age pensions, but the invalid pensions as well. I am sorry I cannot tell you now that the invalid pensions will be brought in immediately. The honourable member then recognised that there were financial difficulties-""financia l embarrassments"" he called them-and he was able to tell the people that he intended to pay old-age pensions immediately, viz., from the ist July last. This was in March last, and the honourable member had nothing then to say about introducing invalid pensions at the present time. I go further, and say that if the honourable member were in my place now, he would not do so.",45
291,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member for Wide Bay used the word ""immediately,"" and that was last March. he con- Sir JOHN FORREST - But if he had intended "" in v a l i d "" pensions to date from the ist July, would he not have been glad on that to say that he hoped to commence them at that date, so that both parts of the Act might come into operation at the same time ? My object is to show that the honourable member was not prepared for financial reasons to bring into force on ist July the invalid pensions which were already the law, and only required a proclamation, and certainly had no idea at that time of enlarging the scope of the old-age pensions to the extent of another £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. He anticipated then that he would have a deficit of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 on last year's transactions, but I am glad to say that he erred on the side of caution. Instead of having a deficit, he was able to place about £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 more to the old-age pensions trust fund than had been included in the Estimates.",45
292,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"We . had a deficit in the than receipts, but we economized.",45
293,Sir JOHNFORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have the figures here. The actual amount received in Customs and Excise revenue was roughly The honourable member's at that time was £10,800,000 , so that there was a gain of £ 4 4 , 0 0 0 in that direction. There was a gain of £ 9 , 0 0 0 in and the postal receipts over the honourable member's estimate, and a gain of £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 in whatother receipts, so that there was an increase of about £ 8 3 , 0 0 0 in the revenue over the the estimate that the honourable member that placed before the country at Gympie.",45
294,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 was a special receipt that was never asked for from the States by any other Government.",45
295,Sir JOHNFORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am not finding fault with the honourable member, because one cannot be absolutely accurate in an estimate. On the other hand, the actual expenditure was £ 6 4 , 2 1 5 less than the honourable member estimated that it would be, so that, altogether, the finances were, in round figures, £ 1 4 7 , 0 0 0 better than he anticipated at that time. By that means the £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 deficit which he anticipated was wiped out, and £ 4 7 , 0 0 0 odd could be placed to the old-age pensions trust account. In looking through the honourable member's Gympie speech, to ascertain what was in his mind at the time, I find that, although he dealt with the two or three months of the financial year then remaining, he made no intimation whatever of how the current year, 1909-10, when old-age pensions would have to the paid, was to be financed. He gave a great deal of information about the future, and there was no doubt that he had good reason to be rather afraid of the financial position, or was "" embarrassed,"" to use his own word, when he placed before the country the expenditure that he contemplated. He gave the items of additional expenditure. They included £1,750,000 for old-age pensions without any provision for invalid pensions. That again showed what was in his mind at the time. He never intended then to include invalid pensions, and specially excluded them from his calculations.",45
296,Mr THOMAS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That was four months ago. - Sir JOHN FORREST - I have already said that this was in March last. He gave an estimate of expenditure for the futuie, but refrained from doing so for the financial year upon which we have just entered. He estimated old-age pension's at '£1,750,000, and extra expenditure on the Post Office at £100,000. This' is the extract from the ex-Treasurer's speech in reference to this £100,000This is for the ordinary expenses of the Department, the amount provided this year having been, proved to be insufficient. In addition to amounts voted, j£8o,ooo has already been advanced this year to the Department for absolutely necessary expenditure. The Department has asked for £220,000. It does not include any provision for bringing the telegraph and telephone services up to date. It has been estimated that ^1,800,000 would be required for this purpose.",46
297,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I rise to order. Is the right honourable member in order in dealing with the financial position of the Commonwealth altogether beyond the particular subject now under discussion ? I do not want to stop him, but, if he is in order, others will also be in order in traversing the whole financial position. That would be an excellent thing, but we should know it. - The CHAIRMAN - The right honourable member is quite in order. He is trying to show from his stand-point the position of the finances in relation to the question now before the Committee. I take it that any other honourable member who desires to reply to him will have ample opportunity to do so.",46
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"In addition to the ordinary expenditure on the Postal Department, and another £100,000, the honourable member for Wide Bav anticipated that .£1,800,000 would be required to bring the telegraphic and telephonic services up to date. There was also to be an additional [56] . expenditure of £1,150,000 on naval and military defence, and a number of other items, making the total additional expenditure £2,893,000. The honourable member went on to say that that did not include expenditure upon the Northern Territory, which might amount to £200,000 a year, or for the Trans-Australian railway, or for the Federal Capital. The honourable member apparently had a very great policy of expenditure, but he gave no clue as to how he would find the money. Although that large additional expenditure of close on £3,000,000 a year was contemplated by the honourable member, he did not enlighten us in any way as to how the money was to be found. Up to the end of June, when he left office, he had left no record of the manner in which he proposed to deal with the finances for the current year 1.909-10. I believe the honourable member when in office realized to the full the burden of responsibility that rested on him. He knew that there would be a difficulty in financing this year. He knew that it would be necessary to provide a large additional amount of money this year for the improvement of the postal and telegraphic services, to place the telephones upon a proper footing, and for old-age pensions. He knew that there would be a difficulty in finding the ways and means for those purposes. He therefore acted as we should desire any other man with a grave responsibility upon him to act. I commend the honourable member for his actions then, but I cannot commend his actions now. Knowing the difficulty of financing the affairs of this country during this year, he nevertheless proposes absolutely reckless propositions, asking first that we should provide another million pounds, and then proposing an amendment which the Treasury officials say will mean an additional burden of £400,000 a year. He does this, knowing full well all the time that he was Treasurer and Prime Minister that he was not able to make any statement as to when the provisions of the Act relating to invalids, whom every one wishes to assist, and whom many think are more deserving than any other section of the community, would be put into force.",46
299,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The right honourable member took good care that he should not.,46
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member for Wide Bay had plenty of time to do it if he had wished. He did not give us at Gympie, or at any other place, any idea of how he intended to finance this year if he had remained in office. We have now to bear the burden that he would have had to bear.

I am glad that the honourable member has made the interjection, because it will give point to my references to a few matters to which I wish to recall the recollection, rather than direct the attention, of honourable members. We have done something for the establishment of a system of old-age pensions before the expiration of the Braddon section. But although for more than eight years all of us, being equally affected by the humanitarian views dominant in modern politics, have recognised the expediency of old-age pensions, no definite step to establish a scheme was taken by a Ministry until a motion was moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay affirming the advisability of providing for, not invalid and old-age pensions, but old-age pensions only. Although the honourable member sometimes credits those opposed to him with being animated by Conservative desires, he will admit that there was no hypocrisy in the acquiescence with or spoken support given to that motion, and that we, as much as the members of the Labour party, recognise the claims of the masses to fair treatment. We recognise that it is the working classes, as a whole, who have sustained from time to time the greater part of the weight of the social edifice, and that, in the speculations and gambling of modern commerce, they share the risks, although they do not scoop the pool. We recognise these facts, perhapsas clearly as do some of those who more loudly prate of their humanitarianism, and more frequently make known their views.",49

In dealing with the question of finance, the honourable member for Wide Bay, replying to an interjection of the right honourable member for Swan, said I presume the honourable gentleman is not acquainted with the trend of policy at the present moment, which indicates that the financial - arrangements of the States and the Commonwealth will be adjusted at a very early date.

335,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I have never heard that stated.  licly stated it.,50
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I have over and over again denied that.,50
337,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I shall not, like Dr Syntax, split hairs as to the meaning of a particular paragraph in the statement of the Prime Minister of the Government programme. An extension of five years was not mentioned, though it was suggested that there might be an adjustment which would extend to five years as a period of experiment, before some final solution was come to. When the original Old-age Pensions Bill was under discussion, the honourable member for Wide Bay was most solicitous about the financial aspect. In his speech on the measure he said nothing about invalid pensions, or about reducing the age at which women should be eligible for pensions from sixty-five to sixty years,, a reduction which many women, no doubt, would be glad to have for the sake of a reputation of youthfulness. Then, in Committee, in speaking of clause r,'5, hepointed out the possibility of doing something by an arrangement with the States which would not dislocate their finances. The honourable member for North Sydney moved that the issue of the proclamation provided for should be subject to parliamentary resolution, and the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out that there was no danger of the proclamation being issued even by a Ministry in extremis and desirous of kudos, until before the finances justified it. I do not know if he spoke prophetically, but he was aware that it would be safe to leave the matter, even in his own hands. Until he left this side of the chamber, he adhered to that 'sensible view of policy. He pointed out that what we were to do was to be done by an arrangement with the Stales. Again, replying to the right honourable member for Swan, he saidThe right honourable gentleman has furnished the best possible reason against making an alteration of the clause. If there is no dying Government, no danger can arise. There is an advantage in leaving the clause as it is, because at any moment after the Bill has become law the Premiers may rush to the Prime Minister and say that if the Commonwealth Government will put the law into operation, they will agree to subsidize the fund to the extent of the amounts which they are paying for old-age pensions. Throughout he depended for financial assistance-beyon d the appropriation of £750,000 under the Surplus Revenue Acton the co-operation of the States, and, therefore, did nothing in the matter while in office. Let me go a little further back. Honourable members will recollect that about four years ago there was a fusion, or alliance, between two parties who weie in agreement in regard to a very smail residuum of policy. It reminds me of Satan reproving sin to hear honourable members talk against the subordination of political opinions for the time with a view to a consensus on matters on which there is agreement, although such compromises are the basis of parliamentary government. Honourable members then had a platform of twenty-seven or twenty-eight planks, in regard to seventeen of which they allowed the utmost latitude of opinion, depending on the comparatively small balance for the purpose of the fusion. It was part of the programme of the party which was then, and is still, influenced, or led by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that a system of old-age pensions should be instituted, when the opportunity offered, on a basis fair and equitable to the States, and to individuals. What did the reference to the States mean? Was there to be a system of old-age pensions based upon the corporate sovereignty of each State? What was meant was old age pensions for individuals on a basis which would be fair to the States financially,, and would recognise the just claims of the individuals who were to get them. In the face of all these facts, is the attitude of the Ministry to a proposal suddenly involving a large increase of expenditure at a time when we have to be fairly cautious in regard to the finances, and may for a while be cramped in meeting our ordinary obligations, right or wrong, even judging by the conduct of honourable members opposite ? I think that there can be no doubt as to the answer to that question.",50
338,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"West Sydney) [8.37] The Attorney-General has to-night afforded us a revelation of a trait in his character which has been concealed for many years. Although I could not understand much of what he said, what I did understand was quite interesting. He must disabuse his mind of the supposition that the Committee is a court, and that he has to construe the words of the honourable member for Wide Bay in a sense which will suit the interests of his client. They must lie understood in connection with the circumstances under which they were uttered. The position is this: The Government declines to do a certain thing on the ground that the late Government was not prepared to do it.",51
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,No .,51
340,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That is the whole argu. ment of honourable members opposite. The Attorney-General, when on the Opposition cross benches, said what he would do if he were a Minister. Now, being a Minister, he says, "" If you were here, you would do what I am dojng."" His reason for not doing what we wish to do is that the honourable member for Wide Bay was not in favour of it when the original Bill was before Parliament. The reason put forward by the Treasurer was that the honourable member did not mention the matter at"" Gympie, and evidently had it not in his mind. I do not know any one who less resembles a thought-reader than does the right honourable member for Swan. The tenure of office of the late Government depended on the support of a number of gentlemen on whom they could rely, .as we have seen, not at all securely. The present Treasurer said that we never had a majority, and had no business to be in office. What sort of financial schemecould be brought down by a Government with no majority? We now have a Ministry that we are told is, for the first time,, to establish responsible government by majority; but they have been in office some eight or nine weeks, and we have not yet heard even an echo of a financial scheme, for the purpose of meeting those overwhelming difficulties of which we heard so much, although the Prime Minister' said that this was to be a financial session. We have been told that the Government have no money, and that they can get no money; and yet their first distinctive act was to offer a sum of £2,000,000 to Great Britain, while they say they cannot get sufficient for the purpose of old-age pensions. I do not know where the Government propose to get the £2,000,000; but to borrow for a defence policy is to make a departure from sound principles of finance on which no British Government would venture. We are told that in a fortnight or so there is to be a Premiers' Conference; and I assume that the financial! relations between the States and the Commonwealth will be considered, and, we hope, adjusted. Old-age pensions is not a newobligation, but one which has rested for years on the shoulders of, at any rate, some of the State Governments. Are we to understand that the State Governments are so mean as to allow the Commonwealth to relieve them of the old-age pension expenditure, and recoup us nothing?. If not, we shall get from the States sufficient to very well - finance this scheme. The honourable member for Wide Bay was perfectly right in saying that an arrangement would be made; and, so far from disagreeing with him, the Government propose in a few weeks to have a conference with the State Governments for considering this very question, amongst others. If the late Government had been allowed to bringdown its financial policy we should have foe&n in a very different position from that in which the Government finds itself to>day. The late Government introduced a scheme to place the telephone service of this country on a business-like footing; and had that scheme been carried out there would have been a difference in our finances - of many thousands of pounds, though - exactly how many we do not know. Further, the late Government proposed to introduce a land tax from which some revenue would have been derived.",51
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,When ?,52
342,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"If the Minister of Defence will take the trouble to read Land Tax Assessment Bill , he will see that the tax would have been gathered as from the ist July. I may be wrong in regard to the date, but, at any rate, tax was to be retrospective so far as - date at which it was due was concerned, on exactly the same principle as that observed in the Land Tax Bill of Western Australia. The late Government were unthe - able to bring down a financial policy as whole, because they had to confine their efforts to one short session They realized clearly that they were at the mercy of handful of men who might at any time - desert them, and who, as a matter of did desert them, before there was an portunity to draft the Governor General's speech. The present Government nalized its accession by deliberately priving us of an amount of revenue from telephones which would at least up the extra money required under the Bill now before us, and by giving that - money to the commercial classes. Submember sequently the Government offered nought to Great Britain, although in today's newspapers we read that Commander John Biddlecombe, in England, has expressed the opinion that, instead of the Government giving a Dreadnought, the money ought to be spent on local fleets. Of course, this gentleman did not know about the oid-age pensions proposals, or be might have mentioned that object as worthy the necessary expenditure. Minister of Defence, who at one time would be satisfied with nothing less than a Dreadnought, now says that ' ' Dreadnought'' is merely a descriptive - term which may be used in resame view in the House. ference to a cruiser, a torpedo boat, or - anything else. As I say, the present Government, after presenting the commerfor cial classes with some £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 0 and offering the sum of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to Great Britain, now decline to give the aged poor that consideration and support which the citizens of every country have a right to expect. When the aged poor ask for justice, they do not get it ; ' but when the Chambers of Commerce come and declare that they ought not to be justly charged for their telephones, the Government appoint a committee of experts to look into the matter. I should like to know what the financial scheme of the present Government is, because the gravamen of the charge made by the Prime Minister against the honourable member for Wide Bay, when the he was at the head of the Government, was that the finances of the country were in such a state that he could not finance old-age pensions or any other scheme. The the Prime Minister declared that the finances the were the crux of the whole question, and yet I have to ask what the financial scheme of the present Government is. The Treasurer has said that if we do not accept Bill as it is he will drop it ; but he a will not do so, for the simple reason that there are sufficient men on his side who will not let him, or who, if he does drop a, it, will drop him. There are other members on the Government"" side who never fact, were in favour of a system of old-age oppensions, and who would, if they had been able, have prevented any scheme of sigthe kind. I have here a speech made at deWarragul in 1907 by the honourable member for Flinders, who is one of the buthave made tresses of this Government.",52
343,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Is the honourable going to connect his remarks with a Dreadthe question of age?,52
344,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I was only going to say that the honourable member for Flinders is a buttress of the Government, and he is where buttresses usually are-out side. At the meeting to which I have referred, the honourable member said that old-age pensions could be much more economically managed by the States, and that, if the Commonwealth were to go into The any scheme of the kind, the time would come when we should be faced with the burden of direct taxation.",52
345,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I repeated the,52
346,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That is an honourable course, but it is a very embarrassing one the Government. Direct taxation sup, 0 0 0 plies the whole solution of the question. The late Government were prepared for direct taxation, and that is why they are now in Opposition; while the present Government, who are not prepared to propose direct taxation, are in office, because they are supported by every vested interest in the country. The Attorney-Genera] said that we ought to wait until the Braddon section expiresthat we should gain further experience for a few years, and, when we saw where we were, we might bring in old-age pensions to the extent that is now proposed. The honourable gentleman proposes that we should wait another five or seven years, and not do anything in the way of a permanent settlement of the matter. I admit that if I had to choose between this amendment and invalid pensions, I would prefer the invalid pensions. I want them both, for, like the right honourable member for Swan, I want everything I can get. If the right honourable member had to choose between granting this and going out of office, which would he do? That is my position. If I have to choose, I will take the invalid pensions. The right honourable member would be able to tell the State Premiers, "" There is now this charge imposed upon the Commonwealth, and you must meet it . "" I venture to say they would meet it, and there would be no extra impost placed upon the Commonwealth Government. The Government are calling the Premiers together, for it is idle to say the State Premiers have called the Conference. The Premiers are coming at the suggestion of the Government to listen to what they iave to say. They know that if they cannot come to an agreement with this Government^ the worse will befall them; and, therefore, whatever the Government suggest to them, they will have to adopt. If , then, the Government say, "" We have to find the money for invalid pensions,"" the State Premiers will agree to it, and will find the money. The State of New South Wales already pays invalid pensions, and so, I believe, do Victoria and Queensland. In those circumstances, we cannot suppose that a resolute demand by the Prime Minister would not result in an arrangement between the States; because, after all, it would not be a new impost, three States having already incurred it. It will, therefore, make no difference to them to hand the money over to us to pay. If the principle is bad - if we ought not to provide for invalids - let us argue the question out on that basis. Mr Hughes.",52
347,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I must ask the honourable member not to go into that question now.,53
348,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The Treasurer makes a pathetic appeal to us not to insist upon the amendment. He says it will wreck the Bill. I say it will not. The Government have come to a stage at which they must bring down some definite proposal. They cannot simply put forward this Bill and say, "" That is all we shall do, and if you do not like to take it, we shall throw it under the table."" That is the Treasurer's attitude at present. If the right honourable gentleman will only tell the Opposition that h'e proposes to deal with the matter in a fair spirit, with the means at his disposal-no t the present means, but the means which, having in view the relations between the States and the Commonwealth, are really at his disposal-w e shall be perfectly satisfied, because we know that he only has to take up a resolute attitude to get the money from the States. The people of this country will never sit down quietly under a position of this kind-that the Government should find £2,000,000 for a Dreadnought, and refuse to find the money necessary for this purpose. It says very little for the right honourable member's responsible Government and his majority, that he takes up his present attitude merely because he is unable to get a majority of honourable members to his way of thinking. If he had a majority, he would not trouble to say two words to us. His pathetic appeal last night was by no means made to exhibit his public spirit. It was made to save his position. He knows that if he could ring the bell now, he would do so, ancl there would not be another word permitted from anybody; ' but he also knows that the numbers will not permit him to do it. He has had a long experience in public life, and cannot possibly put aside the responsibility that rests upon his shoulders; and I tell him that the responsibility of this measure rests upon him, that Tie cannot divest himself of it, and that he knows perfectly well that the means of defraying the expenditure suggested lie at his hand. If he does not stretch out his hand to get them, upon him will rest the blame.",53
349,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Dalley) [9.3] - The debate has demonstrated that this amendment has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition for a specific purpose. The objections to it amount simply to this: "" If the finances permit,"" or "" if there is no financial embarrassment."" That opens up the t whole question of the acceptance or rejection of the amendment. Before arguing on the justice and sentiment of reducing the age, I wish to put the view that in the principal Act there is already power to proclaim sixty years as the age at which women shall receive the pension. That is the age which the honourable member for Wide Bay is endeavouring to fix by this amendment. From the proclamation provision, which is - only the declaratory stage, to the mandatory stage, is a step which honourable members have now the power to take. I have a right to choose the present time to bring that provision into force. When I hear the cry of "" If the finances will permit,"" I would remind honourable members that from this out, not only in this Parliament, but in - the next, they will be met by that cry on all measures involving the expenditure of money. The excuse will be made time after time that ""financial embarrassment will ensue."" This is all owing to the wretched position in which we as a Commonwealth Parliament have placed ourselves. These are powers which the Commonwealth Parliament has to exercise, and the sooner we realise our position the better. The present Ministry, like the Fisher Ministry, desire to obtain the necessary revenue only out of ""Customs and Excise; but that is not the proper source from which to obtain the money to pay old-age pensions. We shall have to make up our minds to tap other - channels to meet the cost of large public functions. The honourable member for West Sydney said that most of the money - to meet old-age pensions will come from -""the broad mass of the working classes."" 1 will adopt that phrase and reverse it by - saying that it is the broad mass of the - working classes of the Commonwealth that lhave to pay the cost, through the Customs and Excise taxation upon their food and wearing apparel. The position, therefore, is that those whom the Commonwealth has treated well, whom fortune has favoured, will escape taxation for old-age pensions, while the poor-""the broad mass of the working classes""-ar e the only people - who, under our present system of taxat i o n , will be called upon to pay for - them. It is monstrous to allow such a position to exist in a Commonwealth which is supposed to be advanced and - progressive, but which on that matter ""is notoriously behind the whole world. 'The Treasurer frequently holds up the - Old Country to the House as an - example. \ I - am willing to take a lesson from her in this matter. I say to the Treasurer, "" F o l l o w the Old Country."" There an Old-age Pensions Act, costing about £ 7 , 0 00,00 0 per annum has been passed, and it is anticipated that it will cost £25,000,000 per annum before it is in full working order. But do the British Government go to the' Customs and Excise Revenue for the money ? No. They have a special channel of taxation for that purpose.",53
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Many of our people are already paying taxation to the States.,54
351,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"They are not paying anything like the proportion which the people of the Old Country in similar circumstances are paying. The taxation processes of the Commonwealth are a growing quantity. Twenty years ago, the proportion of taxation per head of the population was very little; but the functions and powers of the Government were also little. To-day our powers are expanding. If we are not going to put invalid pensions into operation, let us take that part of it out of the Act. On matters of humanity, we cannot afford to fool. Do not leave the payment of pensions to invalids who desire relief, to the chance of a proclamation which might be issued next week, or, on the other hand, might be issued forty years hence. It will be far better to strike out that part of the Act, if there is no intention to put it into force. This very Government, in their principal Act, were responsible for the declaratory part; but they now refuse to adopt the mandatory part. If they plead that financial emba^ rassment will ensue, I reply that old-age pensions, as well as defence expenditure, must distinctly come from direct taxation. The honourable member for West Sydney put forward^ as a party view, the solution that his Government when in power were prepared to impose a land tax; but that tax of theirs, so far as revenue is concerned, was as humbugging as the declaratory section of the Act in this case; because, with the large exemption proposed, the necessary revenue could not be obtained. If I may use the honourable member for West Sydney as an illustration, he is looked upon as a landed proprietor. He is a cute little chap, keen and business-like; but I put it to him that the land values taxation proposed by his Government would not have provided the revenue necessary for this purpose. Either the House has gone too far, or it has not gone far enough. Now, with - regard to the sentiment and justice of the question, sixty-five years is at any time too advanced an age at which to bring the women of Australia under old-age pension provisions. We do not need statistics to prove that. Our own powers of observation show that the male at seventy is, as a rule, more capable and energetic than the female at sixty-five. If we are going to bring the pensions into operation for women, let us not do it on the day when the undertaker puts his hand on the individual-the day when the recipient will have to be taken away to the cemetery. Let us extend the pension at some period when it will give her some little assistance in her declining years. This is a humane measure. A few years back, those who advocated old-age pensions were regarded as undermining the responsibility and fibre of the individual; but that day has gone by. We have this paternal work to do; and, on behalf of the women of Australia, who come from ""the broad mass of the working classes,"" I say that we all know from experience that the wife of the worker at the age of sixty is, unfortunately, in 999 cases out of a thousand, an exhausted being. The struggle for existence in Australia for the industrial classes is so keen, their labour is so intermittent, they are so little able to save for a rainy day, that sixty has become an age at which working women are no longer able to compete successfully in the battle of life. It is a matter of indifference to me whether the Deakin Fusion Government or the Fisher Government have charge of the measure. AH I am concerned with is to give the relief to those who should have it, not when it is too late, but when they can have at least five years' enjoyment of it. To any man the idea of his mother being compelled to receive the pension is a pitiful one; but if a man's wife or mother must put forward her hand to receive it, let her receive it at sixty and not at sixty-five. Defence proposals will very soon be brought forward involving large sums of money, and why should we palter with the financial question at the very threshold? Australia, whether she likes it or not, will have to plunge into a large expenditure of money, and amongst her very first needs is a complete system of old-age pensions. But let us not go to Customs and Excise for the whole of the revenue. The Attorney-General spoke of some arrangement being made with the States, and of the expiry of the operation of the Mr Wilis. Braddon Blot. Let that be provided for ira the Bill. I am sure that the Premiers of the States will not refuse to come to some arrangement for providing the necessary funds. No waste of money is involved. These pensions are to be paid to peoplewho have done their duty as citizens, and have helped to develop the country from which the wealthy have derived their riches. Those to wfiom pensions are to be paid have not been wholly unmindful of economy. In many cases it has been impossible for them to practise what is knowrn as thrift. I know of men deeply attached to their families who receive only 39s. per week. With such a wage is there any room for saving? Surely the wives and mothersof such men, who have borne the heat and burden of the day, should not be expected to wait until they reach the age of sixty-five years for a pension from the Commonwealth. Apart altogether from anv question of sentiment, the justice of this proposal must commend itself to the Com. mittee. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Wide Bay should have toresort to the tactical method of moving the omission of certain words in order to acnieve the objecthe has in view. An appeal was made to us yesterday to take up a dignified stand, and to be guided by the rules and .forms of the House of CommonsSurely, Mr Chairman, in such circumstances the statement which you made yesterday that, owing to the slovenly way ir* which the Bill had been drafted, you could not give a ruling on a point of order that had been raised, ought to have been sufficient to induce the Treasurer to withdraw the Bill, and to re-introduce it in an intelligible form. Your observation was a striking commentary on the way in which business is being conducted. I find myself compelled to vote for a round-about amend"" ment-a n amendment which, to use anAmericanism, is designed to ""whip thedevil round the stump""-in order that we may provide that pensions shall be payableto women on reaching the age of sixty years. I cannot understand why those who are in favour of the principle of old-age pensions should stop at the hurdle of £1,200,000. Surely we can afford to pay legitimate old-age pensions? If the proposal were to reduce to forty years, the ageat which pensions shall be payable, I should not support it, but, having regard to the hard struggle for life and the strenuous battle that many women have to wage, surely sixty years is not too' low an age to fix. Many wome;i never get beyond that - age. If the only object of the Government is to reduce the channel of expenditure, why do they, not propose that a pension shall not be payable to any person under - the age of seventy-five years?",54
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Why suggest that? age,56
353,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I am simply putting - as an alternative to the Government's' - scheme. I am arguing by paradox.,56
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"No one has gested it. ' Mr Wilks - Quite so, but I - a paradox. If financial embarrassment is the trouble that the Treasurer fears, why - does he not propose to increase the pension works. - age to seventy-five years?",56
355,Mr SPENCE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Government would - rather do that than tax the wealthy. _,56
356,Mr WILKS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I do not say that we should decry the wealthy. When they have tionate to the amount which Western Aus obtained their money fairly, I should not be one to say, ""Take it from them;"" but the masses of the people, through Customs fectly legitimate one. .and Excise taxation, are now practically providing for the whole cost of governHouse ment. That being so, the cost of old-age pensions should be paid by the wealthy. old-age pensions. Conservative Great Britain has levied the - cost of old-age pensions directly upon wealthy classes, and surely, we should be prepared to follow its example. There rich do not escape their rightfu l responsiThe bilities. The nobility of our race, not mere spewed up plutocracy of to-dav, never evade their true responsibilities. And aside. instead of waiting for an arrangement to 'be entered into with the Premiers of the - various States, let us resort to direct tion to provide for old-age pensions. Sooner or later we shall be compelled to ""do so. - Old-age pensions and defence should be financed by means of direct taxation, and the only channel from which we may obtain the necessary funds is that provided IDV an income tax. ' Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) £9.17] - Th Attorney-General has been a member of this Parliament from its inception, - do not think he has ever House Ji speech from which we have obtained less information than that which he truth. has just made. I listened very carefully to it, but it left no clear impression upon mind. The honourable gtentleman spoke of a fusion or an alliance which took place some four or five years ago, and that it agreed upon a plank for the vision of old-age pensions on a scheme equitable to the States and to the individual. He endeavoured to give to the arrangement a meaning that he did not make clear. The inference I drew from his remarks was that it was the intention of that fusion to establish such a system of oldpensions as would conserve the that amount returned to the States under the Constitution. I think, however, that it was open to another meaning, and that sugis that States such as Western Australia should not be penalized, as they will be unput it as' der the present scheme.  cures an advantage in the matter of public",56
357,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That . matter is on an entirely different footing. The number of peqple in Western Australia who will benefit under, this scheme will not be propor; tralia will pay. If .the Attorney-General' wished to' draw that inference, it. is a per_",56
358,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I remember stating in this at the time that the fusion in question was not explicit upon the question of,56
359,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am sorry that the the honourable member was not very explicit in his interpretation of the plank in the platthe form of the party to which he referred.

361,Sir JOHN EORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I made no threat.,56
362,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Does the honourable member say that the statement that the B i ll would be thrown under the tablee that he could not go on with it if the amendments contemplated by the honourable but I member for Wide Bay were carried-was delivered in this not a threat?,56

I do not think that some of the proGovernment supporters would allow the Bill to be thrown aside, although I admit that it may be in accordance with the honourable gentleman's own personal inclinations. I have never done him the injustice of believing that he has much sympathy with the old-age scheme.",56
365,Mr MATHEWS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is cruel.,57
366,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Not unless it is cruel to be just.,57
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I have much to the poor-as any one:,57
368,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am certain that the honourable gentleman is personally very generous, but when he talks of curtailing old-age pensions, he ought not to forget that for many years he has enjoyed a fat pension from the Imperial Government. Sir JOHN F'ORREST - I have had little of it .",57
369,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable gentleman has a pension of £ 5 0 0 a year. He may not have drawn it whilst he was in receipt of a Ministerial salary.,57
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,For eighteen years I scarcely ever drew it .,57
371,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member drew it every year except when he was in office. Is not that so?,57
372,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is, means that I have not drawn it during many years. Mr ' MAHON - The only reason for that was the honourable member was drawing a salary as Minister. Do we find in this some clue to his superabundant loyalty to "" the Mother Country""?",57
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It is not perial pension. It is paid by the Government of Western Australia.,57
374,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I always understood that it came from the Imperial Government, and was _paid through the Government of Western Australia.",57

377,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The member has made a mistake, especially in attributing motives.",57
378,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I do not wish to impute any improper motive, for I believe that the honourable member's loyalty, if rather effusive at times - iTises from what he believes to be a rrnro. motive.",57
379,Mr HUTCHISON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"r-Hi s is not an old-age pension. ,",57
380,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"N d ; it is a pension granted to him long before he reached the age of a pensioner under our law. As to his pensions complaint that the Government will be unable to find the funds necessary to finance' this Bill , if it be amended as proposed, I can only say that, before offering to provide the cost of a warship as a g if t to given as the Imperial Government, they ought to have considered how the necessary funds were to be obtained. Certainly, if Australia can afford to present the Imperial . Government with £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to provide for the construction of a warship, it ought to be able to afford to pay pensions to poor women who have very arrived at the age of sixty years. I endorse all that the honourable member for Dalley has said asi to the fact that the lives of many women are practically; spent . when they reach that age. They are certainly not fit to longer bear thu heat and burden of the day, or to enter into competition with younger women in the battle of life. We ought, therefore, to stretch a point in their favour. The honourable gentleman, I presume, proposes to make some arrangement with the States, and I hope that he but that will succeed at the forthcoming Conference. When the Prime Minister complained that the Labour Government were not making any arrangemients for financing old-age pensions, he must have been well aware that in three of the States pensions were being paid by the State Governments before the Commonwealth system came into operation, and an Im- that it was only reasonable to expect the States to reimburse the Federal Government in respect of the liability of which they were relieved. When that was done a very small residuum, remained, for which the Federal Government became responsible. nothing to Mr JOHNSON - Has not the New South Wales Government expressed its willingness to forego the amount ?",57
381,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Onl y since the present Deakin Government came into office. It did not give that assurance to the Fisher honourable Government ,57
382,Mr JOHNSON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I think the assurance was given some time ago.,57
383,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Conditionally upon other State Governments acting similarly. It is only reasonable that the States should reimburse the Commonwealth an amount equal to that which they are now paying. When the next Premiers' Conference meets, I hope that the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, if they attend it, will remind the State Treasurers, should they make any complaints, of the enormous increases in State expenditure since Federation. Some time ago I presented a statement of the details to the House. Of course, the amounts have since increased, ancl I believe that today the State Governments are spending over £4,ooo',ooo per annum more than they were spending before Federation, notwithstanding that the Commonwealth has taken over the very expensive Defence Department, from which no revenue is obtained, the Department of the Postmaster-General, on which there is a loss, and other Departments.",57
384,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member is a long way from the amendment.,58
385,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Yes , but in that I am only following the example of honourable members who preceded me. I refer to these matters to emphasize the claim of . the Commonwealth to be reimbursed by the States for its expenditure on okl-age pensions. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to, and thai our legislation will be so perfected that there will be very few, if any, deserving cases in Australia unrelieved by this humanitarian law.",58
386,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Flinders) [9.27]. - I should not have intervened in the discussion had it not been for the extraordinary argument of the honourable member for West Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition holds a position which, like that of a Minister, is not without great responsibilities, and in addition it must be remembered that he occupied the position of Treasurer in the Government immediately preceding that now in power. His attitude in respect to this matter, therefore, having regard to his actions and words,.cannot be looked upon as quite sincere. I think that we are entitled to conclude that it never entered his mind when Prime Minister, or that of any of his colleagues, to bring forward the proposition which he is now trying to force upon his successors. But by a rather adroit twist of a phrase in the Gympie speech he. has endeavoured to convey the idea that something of this kind was in his mind.",58
387,Mr HALL,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He does not twist phrases.,58
388,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I shall quote his exact words, so that honourable members may judge whether my criticism is fair or not. Speaking of the Invalid and Ola-age Pensions Act, he said in that speech thatWhatever financial embarrassment we may meet with, that will be carried out to the letter. Once inaugurated we shall be able, in the not far distant future, to give effect, not only to the old-age pensions, but to the invalid pensions as well. At the time there were two courses which he could follow. He had power fo bring the invalid pension system into operation by proclamation immediately, and, by similar proclamation, he could have done what he is now seeking to force his successors to do. But while he then referred to the ultimate possibility of paying invalid pensions, he did not refer to the possibility that the age at which women would be qualified for pensions might be reduced.",58
389,Mr ROBERTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"In regard to invalid pensions he used the word "" immediate.""",58
390,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have read what he said. He spoke of giving effect ""in the not far distant future,"" not only to old age pensions, but to invalid pensions as well. *",58
391,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is what he said tonight.,58
392,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"No . He said tonight that he would not ask the Committee to institute invalid pensions at the present time. If the thoughts of persons are to be judged by what they say, I ask why did the honourable member refer to invalid pensions in his great policy speech, and not say anything about the reduction of age? Now he desires it to be understood that it was in his mind, and in that of his colleagues.",58
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,No ; he was silent on the point.,58
394,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The Treasurer asked him whether it was in his mind, and he made no reply. I understand that it was not. If he was frankly and fairly past dealing with those whom he. was addressing at Gympie, it was not in his mind. That is to be seen by a subsequent passage. Speaking of future expenditure, he sets out that upon old-age pensions as £1,750,000. Any one reading the speech must conclude that that was his estimate of the expenditure under the administration of the Act, without amendments.",58
395,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The expenditure on old-age pensions, taking no account of invalid persons.",58
396,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Yes . The impression conveyed to me, and, I think, to every one who read his speech, was that he intended to comply with the terms of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, but not to put into operation the provisions relating to invalid pensions.",58
397,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"He does not pose to do that now. Mr W. IH . IRVINE - That is so. Then, in the speech of the Governor General, the formal statement of the intentions of the Fisher Government, we find a short statement as to the administration of the Invalid ancl Old-age Pensions Act, without any indication of an intention to bring in an amending measure. It must be remembered that at the time the honourable member for Wide Bay had the power to do what he now professes his desire to do. The Act vests in the Government of the day the power by proclamation, without parliamentary action, to do what he asks the Committee to do by legislation. brings me to the extraordinary argument of the honourable member for West Sydney. Coming from the legal and trusted adviser of the late Prime Minister, it is one»of the most amazing that I have ever heard put forward in support of a position such as that taken up by him. I feel sure that his leader must have shuddered when he heard it. The honourable member for West Sydney said that the Fisher Government did not issue a proclamation because it was dependent on the support of a section on which it could not rely in this particular matter.",59
398,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I did not say anything of the sort. Mr WH IRVINE. - The honourable member said that the fact that the Government was supported by a certain section, meaning those who were not members of the Labour partu, rendered it impossible to do this by proclamation.",59
399,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"No . What I said was that there were two reasons why we did not bring down a scheme embodying the whole of our policy, the shortness of the session, and the uncertaintv of our majority.",59
400,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am bound to accept the honourable member's statement. He admits that one of the reasons why the late Government did not bring down its financial proposals was the uncertainty of its majority. He desires it to be understood that,' had it done so, those financial proposals would have included the proposition which his leader made last night. Then what is the position of the late Government? Although its Ministers had in their minds the reduction of the age at which women could claim old-age pensions, that was not stated among their financial proposals. For what reason?",59
401,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member is pro- putting upon my remarks a meaning which does not properly apply to them. I am sure that he does not wish to do so.,59
402,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I certainly do not. If I understand the honourable' member, he alleged as one of the reasons why the alteration now pressed by the honourable member for Wide Bay was not put forward by the F'isher Government that it could Be brought forward only in connection with its financial proposals, and that they were not laid before us for two reasons, one being the uncertainty of the Government's majority.",59
403,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is perfectly true that nothing followed, so far as old-age penThis sions are concerned. What was said at the Hobart Conference was that we required £ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 before we could finance this business.",59
404,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"In the collocation in which the honourable member's statement comes, it can only relate to this debate in the way which I say, namely, that effect could not be given to old-age pensions, including lowering the qualifying age of women, because, amongst other reasons, they had an uncertain majority.",59
405,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,We could not do anything.,59
406,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I take it at that; and I venture to say that a more complete confession of Ministerial ineptitude, arising from the most unworthy motives, was never made in a representative House. Here is a proposal which is now claimed upon all the dictates of humanity to be necessary, and which the honourable member and his leader say-becaus e they are not sincere unless they do say it-is practicable anil desirable, having regard to the existing finances of the country, which also could have been done by them by Ministerial Act, and was not done. Why ? Because they thought that if they did it, the majority would not permit them to continue in office. Mr. HUGHES - That is absolutely incorrect.",59
407,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I have accepted the honourable member's statement of what he said,59
408,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"But , as fast as I put the matter right, the honourable and) learned member puts it wrong again.",59
409,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have accepted the honourable member's statement; and I venture to say that the argument used by the honourable member is one which probably made his leader shake in his shoes, because it involves the conclusion that the late Government refrained from doing a certain thing, which Parliament had deliberately invested them with the power to do by proclamation, because, amongst other reasons, they were afraid by reason of the uncertainty of their majority.",60
410,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is absolutely untrue.,60
411,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Will the honourable member withdraw that statement?,60
412,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I withdraw any imputation that the honourable member is telling an absolute untruth, because I did not mean that; but the statement that I said what he imputes to me is absolutely untrue. Mr W. II . IRVINE - It is not suggested that the honourable member did say what I am saying, because I am only showing the necessary inference from what he did say. What he said was that the attitude of the late Government, in regard to tiiis, amongst other parts of their policx, was due to the fact that they could not bring forward the necessary financial statement by reason of the uncertainty of their majority. Having regard to the particular matter of which the honourable member was speaking, I maintain that what he said amounts to a confession that, although they had the power, with or without bringing forward a financial statemait. to do this thing which they now claim is demanded by every dictate of humanity, they did not do it , because, amongst other reasons, they were not certain of tlieir majority.",60
413,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"But because the late Government did not do it, is it never to be done ?",60
414,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is another question; we are now to judge the proposal on its merits.,60
415,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Then why waste time?,60
416,Mr WH IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It always appears to the honourable l>e a waste of time when criticism comes from this side. I am not going to take up the time of the Committee longer, except to say that it would be a great deal better if members of the Opposition, especially those who have held high office, were to extend to those who succeed them in those onerous and responsible obligations a little more consideration than is shown in the speeches we have heard to-night. I admit that the late Government had not a very long term of office, but it was long enough for them to engage in all ordinary administrative acts. If the late Government had, during all those months, considered this matter at all, and had thought it desirable, in the interests of humanity, to take the step now advocated, they ought not to have allowed any consideration of parliamentary majorities to interfere with their determination. They were invested with a. trust and the power; and the fact that they did not take the step does not necessarily mean that it is not a proper step to be taken, although it certainly ought to shut their mouths to the kind of argument we have listened to to-night.",60
417,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"B y way of personal explanation, I sliould like to say a few words. I shall say what I did say, and leave honourable members to see exactly the position. The Attorney-General had accused the honourable member for Wide Bay of having no idea in his mind at the time the principal Act was before the House, or, when he spoke at Gympie, of doing anything in the immediate future.",60
418,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I did not mention Gympie.,60
419,Mr HUGHES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Quite right; it was mentioned by interjection by the honourable member for Wilmot. At Gympie, the honourable member explained that he hoped to bring in a measure in the not too-distant future-that lie could have brought it in immediately if he had had the money, because it could be done by proclamation. What 1 said was that the present Government ought not to talk about insufficiency of means, because tliey were going to the Premiers' Conference, wherein, by arrangement with the States, they could get money. All I said was that the late Government had no opportunity of bringing in their financial scheme for the best of reasonsthat our majority was uncertain, and events had proved it to be so. Indeed, Ave never had a chance to bring in any measure. We did propose to finance those matters we had member to intended to deal with ; but we were not in the same position as the present Government, who are practically able to dictate at the Premiers' Conference what shall be done in regard to our financial relations, with the States.

Does the member for Flinders mean to say that the honourable member for Dalley, or some other honourable members' on that side, would not move to extend the proare vision's of the Bill if they could get House to agree with them ? The honourable member for Dalley has to-night said we undoubtedly ought to pay women penthe sions at the age of sixtv; and I am sure that the honourable member for Wide Bay would not only have agreed to such an amendment, but would have found the money to finance it . The honourable member for Flinders and others opposite would leave the matter of pensions to the States; and the Treasurer did all he possibly could, with a majority of the present supporters of the immeGovernment, including the Minister of Debe fence, to prevent the money being found for the pensions. If , as the honourable, member for Flinders says, the Fisher Gois vernment had the power to proclaim this part of the Act-as I admit they had-and ought to have proclaimed it , the present Government have the same power. Why do they not exercise it? They, have a golden opportunity of getting all the kudos that would be gained from the mass of the people said by taking that step.

The evening appears to have been occupied by the Gonot vernment in putting the Opposition upon trial ; but I would remind them that the question is much more important and serious than that. We have to decide whether women - of sixty, who are otherwise deserving, are to share in the old-age pensions. The tention of the honourable member for ders appears to be that if the Government had any definite evidence that the Leader - of the Opposition had intended to bring this We section of the Act into operation, the vernment would agree to do it right away; hut surely the intentions,of the Leader the Opposition when Prime Minister have 'nothing to do with the question.

The honourable member for Flinders tried to so twist poswhat had been said as to give it a certain meaning, but even if it meant something ten times worse than the honourable member made out, that would be no reason for denying deserving people the assistance which we know that this amendment will give them.

Every one recognises that for short time there will be some little diffiin financing these proposals; State but, after all, it is only a matWith regard to the contention of the honourable member for Flinders that the Fisher Government could espehave proclaimed this part of the Act, We scarcely any Government would have done so until the Act itself got under way. The difference of time in any case can only be that a few months, and hence this proposal is not a big enough one for the Government the to object to adopt.

431,Mr WISE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Gippsland) [10.5] - I am concerned with the question of whether its the Fisher Government should, or should not, have proclaimed this part of the Act, or with the question of who has moved the amendment. I am concerned only with the amendment itself, and with its merits. Last conyear we passed the Old-age Pensions Act, Flinand in doing so deliberately divided it, so far as the granting of pensions was concerned, into three parts. enacted that old-age pensions Goshould be granted to people at sixty-five years of age, who had been twenty-five of years in the Commonwealth, and that that part should come into force on the ist July, or at such earlier date as might be to proclaimed. I understood at the time that Opthere was practically no likelihood of the in Act being proclaimed before that date. We also gave power to the Government of the day to provide by proclamation that women should be entitled to receive the pension at sixty instead of at sixty-five. We further provided that by another proclamation the Government of the day could direct that invalids who had not reached should receive pensions. We had undoubtedly a reason for dividing the Act in that way. We had no idea that it was intended to bring the two last provisions into effect by proclamation within three or four weeks of the date when the Act itself came into active operation. If we had thought that possible, we should have .straight out that the whole Act should come into force on ist July of this year. must have had a reason for postponing the other two provisions, and that reason seems to have been that we did not know at the time what responsibilities or liabilities we were undertaking in regard to old-age pensions. The Act we passed was much more literal than most of the State Acts, and we also knew that some of the States had no Old-age Pensions Act at all. It was, therefore, all guess-work as to what amount of liability would be incurred by the Commonwealth in passing the Act, and I take it that we intended to postpone the bringing into operation of the sections relating to women at sixty, and to invalid until we were able to ascertain exactly where we stood financially, and what further provision it would be necessary to make to meet them. It is unreasonable, within three or four weeks of the main-Act coming into operation, and before we have any idea of the amount of money that will have to be provided, to ask us to give effect to either of the other two provisions. For that reason I_ cannot see my way to accept the amendment at present. At the same time, the serious duty is cast upon the Government of looking forward to bringing into operation at no distant date both the other provisions. . They will have to their responsibility in those regards before they meet the Premiers with a view to making some financial arrangement to take effect at the end of 1910. I do not know to what extent they propose to go cap in hand, or to go down upon their knees to the representatives of the I confess"" that I have had doubts in this matter, and every day those doubts are getting graver.

When we passed this provision it was intended that effect should be given to it at no distant date.

This amendment will affect, probably, more women in my constituency than in any other Commonwealth electorate. I represent a large industrial centre, in the most thickly populated part of Australia, and every day cases are being brought under my notice which emphasize the wisdom of the course which the Leader of the Opposition invites the Committee to take. In speaking on the motion for the second reading of this Bill consider I mentioned that I intended to submit an amendment that would provide for the payment of pensions to women who had reached the age of sixty vears, and I had then framed and tabled such an amendment for consideration in Committee. Subsequently, however, the States. amendment now before us was moved grave by the Leader of the Opposition, and I feel it my duty to support it . The When honourable member who has just resumed his seat said he desired to give the Government time for financing this part of the Parlia- .principal Act, ancl that when it was passed it was not intended to bring it into operation within a few weeks of the ist July of this year. But does the honourable member not recognise that since then the financial situation has completely changed. The present Government has been practically throwing about millions in connection with projects that are not really urgent. That being so, surely we are justified in taking a different view of the position today. In this evening's issue of the Melbourne Herald we lind the following statement:"" It seems to b'e still necessary,"" said Minister for Defence today, referring to the told thatcriticism by Commander John published in the London Standard, of the Dreadnought offer, "" to emphasize the fact that the gift was an unconditional one of an amount of money such as it would take to build and equip a Dreadnought."" He was emphasizing the point that the Government have made a direct offer of £2,000,000.",63
436,Mr HUTCHISON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The money can be casilv found for that purpose.,64
437,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"And the Imperial authorities will probably tell us that they do not want it. Then, again, in the same newspaper we find the statement that the Minister of Defencelias in mind a Federal Government prize for the first airship that performs certain evolutions to be laid down. Apparently the Government do not anticipate any difficulty in finding money for that purpose. I do not object to encouragement being extended to the inventors of airships, but I am certainly opposed to money being expended on matters of no immediate urgency, when our aged citizens are in need. Apparently the Ministry have plenty of money to provide for airships and the presentation of a Dreadnought, but no money to enable poor women who have reached the age of sixty years to draw a Commonwealth pension. Ministerial statement of proposals for this session there is the following paragraphAn active policy of immigration will be taken and expanded in the light of the knowledge made available by the Commission and the Bureau, and with, it is hoped, the cooperation of all the States. There we have outlined an immense scheme - of immigration.. The money of the taxpayers is to be utilized in bringing out immigrants to compete with our alreadyovercrowded labour market, although the Government are nol prepared to find monev to provide for an old-age pension for suffering women who have reached the age of. sixty years.

Millions for the Northern Territory; no money for the aged women qf Australia ! The Government have already introduced a Bill providing for .the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. Is that a mere placard, or are the Government really in earnest? Do they intend to give effect this session to that proposal ? If they do they must contemplate the expenditure of a vast sum of money. If they do not, then the Bill is only ""a sham and a delusion which ought not to be practised on us. A great defence scheme is also foreshadowed in the Ministerial statement, and proposals are made for founding a military college, a school of musketry, and, probably, a primary naval college.

Here is another paragraph from the Ministerial statementIn addition to the ample provision required for defence purposes . . the outlay upon . . . the taking over of 'ocean lighthouses by. the Commonwealth, and the construction, when authorized, of the railway line to Western Australia, have to be borne in mind.

Apparently there is plenty of money for all these projects, but none to provide pensions for old women who are in absolute need. A Royal Commission reported that pensions should be paid to women at least five years earlier than men, and*We recognised the theoretical justice of that proposal when the original Bill was before us, but we are now asked where we are to obtain the money to give effect to it. The proposals which the Government have already submitted must involve a total expenditure 'pf from £10,000,000 to £15,000,000, yet they say that they cannot provide £400,000 to enable pensions to be paid to women who have helped to build up and develop Australia, when they reach the age of sixty years.",64

The Government have threatened that, if these humane proposals be embodied in the Bill, they will throw it aside.

The Stipendiary Magistrates, who are men in good positions, had not time to go to their homes, and so those persons experienced considerable difficulty in completing the papers. I venture to predict that if the amendment is carried in its present form, the Treasurer will be confronted ultimately with, perhaps, fifteen or twenty very hard cases. I urge him to deal with the public money as he would do with his own funds; in other words, to accept my proposition, and allow a man who has paid taxes for over twenty years, whose character is above reproach, do not think and who subsequently becomes a citizen of the Commonwealth to draw an old-age pension.",66

I spoke to a very thin House at the close of the session, and I should like to try again to induce honourable members to support my idea. In the matter of old-age pensions, this Parliament has no desire to consider any question of race, colour, or creed. We give pensions because persons are in need, and being British-born or naturalized British subjects, have lived in the country for twenty-five years and paid taxes; and, to my mind, it is a distinct blot on the Act to erect a barrier of this kind simply on account of nationality.  to aboriginals?",67
472,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That would be absolutely impracticable.  try from them.,68
473,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"We can make that up to them in another way. It is not a reasonable or rational policy to bar any aged poor person, who is reputable, and otherwise qualified, solely because he happened to be born on the wrong side of the Bosp'horus. Ever since I have been in an Australian Parliament I have always held the view that, while we may maintain the White Australia policy in its fullest sense, we ought to treat with perfect equality those aliens whom we have allowed to come in and to be naturalized. We do not feel degraded because we get our religion from Asia; and it seems to be going rather too far to bar an Asiatic because of his birth-place. I ask the Attorney General whether it is not a fact that, under the section as it stands, Asiatics, although they may have become naturalized, cannot have the benefit of the Act?",68
474,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Yes , that is right.",68
475,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"My proposal is only that Asiatics, who have become naturalized, shall become entitled to a pension ; and I move That the following words be inserted after the word "" by,"" line 2 :-* ' the omission of - the words in sub-section (1) (c) ' Asiatics, except those born in Australia, o r . ' """,68
476,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Cook) [10.51] - I object on racial grounds to Asiatics coming here, but when we have admitted them, and for twenty or twenty-five years, have compelled them to pay taxes, I think it would be most unfair and unChristian to deprive them, if naturalized subjects, of old-age pensions. The scientific basis of old-age pensions is really that of compulsory insurance, seeing that all participants must have paid taxes for many years; and to bar naturalized Asiatics would be rather a mean action for a nation like Australia. To include these persons cannot mean a very large charge on the Treasury, because none are admitted now, and the claimants must have arrived here many years ago, many of them doubtless paying heavy fees on admission.",68
477,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Robertson) [10.54] - The question of admitting Asiatics to the full privileges of the Old-age Pensions Act is one which would appeal to every honourable member if the pension system were made more comprehensive. But, seeing that invalids are not to receive pensions, for the reason that we have not themoney, and, knowing, as we do, that theAsiatic standard of living is much below our own, we should not be justified in giving Asiatics the full benefits of a measureso restricted in its operation regarding our own people. I hold that every Asiatic whohas been naturalized should be permitted' to participate in the advantages conferred by this Bill, but we have not the fundswith which to permit of that being done. I would just as soon vote in favour of granting pensions to invalids as I would support the granting Of them to old men. Thequestion is merely one of finance, inasmuch as we have not the money with which to pay invalid pensions, we should not bejustified in granting pensions to Asiaticswho may have lived in Australia for a lifetime, but who have certainly lived under a-, lower standard of comfort/ Consequently I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Boothby.",68
478,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Will the honourable member support the granting of pensions to invalids ?,68
479,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have no objection to do so as soon as we"" have thenecessary funds at our command. Honourable members opposite apparently think that they are the only persons who are imbued with any humanitarian feeling. They pose here as men possessed of knowledgeon social questions, and they quite fail torecognise that this is essentially a financial question. They are content to prate aboutlegislation which would be beneficial to trie massss-to talk about the representation of the working man, and to ignore the fact that they represent themselves, and not the working man. They are constantly^ sneering a""t those who are willing to do more than themselves.",68
480,Mr BAMFO RD,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Herbert) [ i 1.2] - The argument of the honourable member for Robertson regarding the financial aspect of this question does not appeal to me at all, because the additional expenditure that would be involved by the adoption of the amendment of the honourable member for Boothby would be very small indeed. But it seems to me that the Government wish to liberalize the provision relating to naturalization quite as much as can be expected. They propose to make it possible for any person who is not now naturalized to become eligible to receive a pension from the ist January next. To my mind that is straining liberality to the breaking point. I contend that any person who has lived here for twenty years, who has not thought it necessary to assume the full duties of citizenship, and who does so now only to secure an old-age pension, is deserving of very scant consideration at our hands. .L am sorry that I cannot support the proposal which has been outlined by the honourable member for Boothby. It must be recollected that there are a .great' number of Asiatics in the Commonwealth who can never become eligible to receive a pension, unless the Naturalization Act be amended. To enable a few of these Asiatics to qualify for an old-age pension would only excite a large amount of disaffection amongst their brethren who cannot so qualify. I - can readily imagine one of the disaffected saying, "" Here is a man receiving an old age pension. I am as old as he is, and have been resident in Australia for a longer period. Why should I not get a pension?"" The honourable member for Cook argued that, because Asiatics have been admitted to the full rights of cit'zenship, they ought to 'be treated just as liberally as is anybody else. But I would point out to him that very few Asiatics have been admitted to the rights of citizenship. In my own State there are none who have been so admitted. 'There, we even decline to allow them a vote. 'Consequently, the honourable member's argument in that connection was quite worthless. I am' sorry that I cannot support the - proposal outlined by the honourable member for Boothby, because I am entirely opposed to the principle which it embodies.",69
481,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Bass) [11.5] - I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Boothby. I do not consider that any citizen of Australia should lose any rights that he has had under State law. We have conserved fo the civil servants their rights, but under this BiH we are trying apparently to deprive some citizens who happen to be Asiatics of privileges to which they are justly entitled. That seems an unjust thing to do.",69
482,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Boothby) [11.6] The honourable member for Robertson has said that the real objection to my amendment is a financial one. The chances are, however, that it would not involve an expenditure of more than a few pounds per annum. The greater part of the Asiatics in this country are not now naturalized. Therefore, they cannot participate in the advantages conferred by this legislation. What I object to is putting within the four corners of an Act of Parliament a barrier on account of nationality.",69
483,Mr BAMFORD,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,-We do so in other Acts of Parliament.,69
484,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"We have dene so for special purposes. In .some .of the States, however, all naturalized persons have the right to vote. My objection to the Bill as drafted is that those who are citizens of Australia, and are otherwise qualified* to comply with the conditions laid down-person s against whom nothing.can be urged whatever-ough t not to be deprived of old-age pensions on the ground of nationality. Surely this Parliament ought to be above mere race prejudice? I challenge any one to justify debarring a man from receiving an old-age pension merely because he happened to be born in Asia. It is humbugging the question to saythat there is an objection to my amendment on financial grounds. As to the standard of comfort, to which the honourable member for Roberston has referred, he knows very well that it varies even amongst Asiatics. Generally speaking, the standard of comfort of those who are naturalized is as high as amongst average people in this community.",69
485,Mr ATKINSON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Can Asiatics be naturalized under our law?,69
486,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Not under the Commonwealth Naturalization Act as it stands.,69
487,Mr HANS IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"But the .honourable member's argument is that those Asiatics who are naturalized should be entitled to the pension. - Mr BATCHEEOR - Undoubtedly. The barrier against naturalizing Asiatics has been imposed in its proper place, under the Naturalization Act. But why impose a barrier against a naturalized person who is otherwise qualified to receive an old-age pension?",69
488,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.1.1] - There is a great deal of force in what the honourable member for Boothby has said. Only a small number of persons would be affected by his amendment, because there is a provision in the Naturalization Act of 1901 which debars natives of Asia from naturalization. Of course, those born in India, which is in the British Dominions, are British subjects, but Asiatics not born in India are not capable of naturalization in this country. The subject was raised on a previous occasion, and some members of the present Government then urged the view now taken by the honourable member for Boothby. We are disposed, therefore, to accept the amendment. In fact, I do not see that a reasonable reply to the honourable member's arguments can be given. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr Glynn) agreed to. That the letter (a) be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" is or.""

493,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member will not get that carried.,70
494,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.20] - I think it would be better to take the Treasurer's amendment first; because it is necessary to complete the clause as it stands in the Bill. The intention is to carry out the desire to make the clause retrospective. The addition intended to be proposed is germane to what is actually being done by passing the clause as it stands. Amendment (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That the following new sub-clause be added"" (2) Where an old-age pension is granted upon a claim made within sixty days after the passing of this Act by any person who on the first day of July one thousand nine hundred and nine has resided in Australia continuously for at least twenty but less than twenty-five years, the claim may be deemed, for the purpose of determining the date of the commencement of the pension, to have been made on the first day of July one thousand nine hundred and nine.""",70

498,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,No .,70

500,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-General) [11.27] - The clause itself reduces the residence qualification from twenty-five to twentv years.. That means that people who thus become qualified would, after this, have to make claims, and would only get paid from the first pay day after their claims were made. The honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out that that was scarcely fair to those who could have made claims if they had thought that the twenty-five years' qualification would be reduced to twenty years, and he very properly suggested that we should date it retrospectively. We, therefore, propose by this amendment that persons who make claims within sixty days after the passing of this measure shall be paid retrospectively as from the ist July, 1909.",70

If we impose any limit as to property, there must necessarily be a certain amount of charity about the pension. This is not a new idea so far as I am concerned - Mr Glynn - No ; absence in New",71

509,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.41] - The honourable member for Boothby suggested that' an amendment should be made in the Bill providing that residence in Papua should not be regarded as absence from the Commonwealth. I saw would no objection to that proposal^ and have, therefore, drafted a new clause to follow clause 12, providing for the amendment of section 18 of the principal Act, which deals with residence in Australia. I move That the following new clause be added12A. Section 18 of the principal Act is amended by inserting after sub-section (1) thereof the following sub-section : - "" IA . "" Continuous residence in Australia shall not be deemed to have been interrupted by absence in a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth or in any British possession which becomes a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth.""  in Norfolk Island ?",71
510,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It will. If a resident of Australia goes to one of these places, and eventually returns to Australia, his absence will not be deemed to have interrupted his 1 0 . continuous residence here, and he will be entitled to a pension. The clause will not cover the case of Papuans or whites born in Papua who, at the end of their career there, come to Australia.",71
511,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Will it cover absence in New Zealand ? Zealand comes under the general provisions of the Act in regard to temporary absence.,71
512,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Will the clause put a time limit on absence from Australia?,71
513,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"We can scarcelyimpose a limit, because if a man goes to Papua for a time as an official, or as an ordinarycitizen desiring to develop the territory, and returns to Australia, I think his residence in the territory should lie regarded as general residence in Australia.",71
514,Mr CROUCH,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Is not Papua a part of Australia under the Acts Interpretation Act?,71

518,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Wide Bay) [11.47] - The provision is a very proper one. It is only fair that, when Australians go to Papua to develop the resources of that Territory, their residence there shouldentitle them to pensions, just as residence in Australia would do. That is the desire of the honourable member for Boothby. The proposal was discussed and approved by the late Government.",72
519,Mr CROUCH,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Accordin g to the Acts Interpretation Act, Australia includes the whole of the Commonwealth. However, this provision will make assurance doubly sure.",72
520,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Hume) [11.48]. - I do not think that a man or woman who, after living in Australia for twenty years, goes to Germany or some other foreign place, and lives there for a similar period, should be entitled to a pension; but it seems to me that the amendment will empower such persons to obtain such pensions. When the New South Wales Bill, which I introduced, was being discussed, good reasons were shown for a limitation upon absence, and a period of two years was fixed.",72
521,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The principal Act imposes a limitation of one-tenth of the period of residence.,72
522,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It seems to me that the amendment allows claimants to be absent from Australia as long as they like.,72

524,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I do not object to that.,72
525,Mr HEDGES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Fremantle) [11.50] - I am glad that this provision has been introduced. When the original Bill was under discussion, I pointed out the disadvantage which residents of Australia would suffer in going to Papua, and was backed up by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I think it was only for want of time that more consideration was not given to the suggestion that that disability should be removed.  honourable member for Hume is mistaken as to the effect of the amendment. All it does is to allow residence in New Guinea, or any other dependency of the Commonwealth, to count as - residence on the mainland. You, Mr Chairman, know that many persons have gone from your constituency and that which I represent to open up New Guinea. Some went years ago, when the mineral deposits at Sud Est and Woodlark Island were discovered.",72
526,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Robertson) [11.52] - I wish to know whether children born in Papua, Norfolk Island, or other dependencies, of white naturalized parents, will be eligible for invalid pensions?",72
527,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The amendment covers in r valid as well as old-age pensions, but a necessary qualification is residence in Australia in the first instance. Persons who have lived all their lives in a Territory will not be eligible.",72
528,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I do not think that that is fair. Persons born in Papua of British parents should be entitled to pensions on meeting with severe accidents, just as they would be entitled had they been born on the mainland.",72
529,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.53] - The reason why such persons would not be entitled is that the finances of Papua and other Territories are distinct from those of Australia, and their obligations should not be thrown on the Commonwealth.",72

531,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The Commonwealth subsidizes Papua. These places are distinct from Australia geographically and financially, and it would not do to throw their responsibilities on the Commonwealth. When they become States, the laws which apply to the existing States will apply to them.",72
532,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Hume) [11.54]-For once in my life I agree with the honourable member for Robertson. Children have already been born to white parents in Papua, and they should have the same privileges as"" they would possess if they had been born on the continent. They should not be denied - pension rights. I think that we are wealthy enough to extend the same privileges to all persons' who are under Commonwealth laws.",72
533,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It is a matter about fifty vears ahead anyhow.,73
534,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"No' . I want to put on record my opinion that this provision ought to be made either now or at an early date. It is not quite fair to treat any white persons in Papua differently from persons on the mainland in this regard. I understand that some white persons whose ages range from seven to fifteen years are living in the Territory. Suppose that they become ill and cross to. Queensland at any time, why should they not enjoy the same conditions as are extended to other persons in Queensland ?",73
535,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Bill those cases.,73
536,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It covers the cases of those pejrsons who went from Australia to Papua, but not the cases of those who were born in the Territory. The time is not far distant when the Commonwealth will have to provide a considerable sum for the development of Papua by means of railways, roads, and works of various kinds. When we undertake that obligation it will be nonsense to talk about dividing the money raised there and on the mainland. Again, the Northern Territory of South Australia when transferred to the Commonwealth will be a Territory ancl not a State. Probably we will acquire the control of other islands, for instance, the New Hebrides. residents of all Territories ought to be treated, as nearly as possible, in the same way as the residents of the Commonwealth. I ask the Attorney-General to look into the matter.",73
537,Mr STORRER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Bass) [11.59] - On Flinders Island there is a number of half castes who were born there and live practically under the same conditions as the white residents, and who, I think, are entitled to the same privileges as the residents of Australia. I desire to know from the Attorney-General whether those half castes are covered by these clauses.",73
538,Mr BATCHELOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Boothby) [12.0]. - My first idea was to ask the Committee to adopt the policy which the honourable member for Robertson advocated just now, and that is, that our Territories, particularly Papua, should lie considered as part of the Commonwealth. But I admit that what I mainly wanted to achieve is met by the provision which the Attorney-General has drafted. As regards white persons who are born in Papua and remain there for twenty-five years, the Legislative Council can always pass an ordinance on their behalf, though we might have to find the money for the pensions, if we allowed the ordinance. It will be remembered that the domestic legislation of Great Britain did not extend to Australia, nor do I see that it is essential that our legislation should apply to Papua. All we ask is that the residence of white Australians in Papua for a number of years shall not invalidate their claim to a pension on their return to the mainland. The Attorney-General has met that position, and I do not think it is necessary to go any further; the proposal meets the representations made to me when covers I visited the Territory.",73
539,Mr KELLY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Wentworth) [12.3 a.m.]. - I desire to ascertain from the Attorney General the position of Lord Howe Island.,73
540,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I think it is part of New South Wales.,73
541,Mr KELLY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I think it is part of the Commonwealth so far as representation in this House is concerned'. This is rather an important point, because it is inhabited by a number of old persons who, I think, should be included in the provisions of this measure.",73
542,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Robeitson) [12.4 a.m.] - The honourable member for Boothby omitted to say that a Papua ordinance can have no effect upon the finances of Australia until it has been allowed by the The white Governor General in Council. Suppose the Legislative Council of the Territory were to pass an ordinance to the effect that its white residents should enjoy the full privileges, of citizens of the Commonwealth under this measure. It would certainly be disallowed if the present Government were in office. Possibly when the white residents of the Territory represented to the late Minister of External Affairs .that they wished to participate in all the privileges granted in the Old-age Pensions Act of this Parliament, they were not familiar with the part dealing with invalid pensions. Suppose that any persons born of white parents in Australia were to live in the Territory for sixteen years and then become invalids. Even if the Government proclaimed that part of the Act those persons could not participate in the benefits it confers. In my opinion, it is incumbent upon the Government to see that the children of Australian citizens shall, on their return from Papua, be entitled to participate in those benefits, because the passing of an ordinance by the Legislative Council could not confer upon them the rights to which the honourable member for Boothby referred.",73
543,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"They will have to be fifty-five years old, and that is looking a long way ahead.",74
544,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member has evidently not read section 20 of the principal Act, which contains the followingSubject to this Act, every person above age of sixteen years who is permanently capacitated for work, by reason of an accident or by reason of his being an invalid, and who is not receiving an old-age pension, shall, whilst in Australia, be qualified to receive an invalid pension. I say that children in Papua who are above sixteen years of age should, as soon as part of the Act is proclaimed by the Gothat vernment, be entitled to participate in its tralia. benefits; and it would be unfair if some provision were not made for them.",74
545,Mr CROUCH,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Corio) [-12.6 a.m.] There is a possibility that if part of State becomes a Territory, the people reable sident therein may lose any lights they may have at present under the Act. If they are of the Commonwealth, will suffer any dis only to have transitory rights, such as clause will give, then residence' in Northern Territory or in Papua may volve a penalty. We desire that the Terricannot. tories should grow and become permanent States; and the best way is to allow all those who go there to have all the rights citizenship which are enjoyed by those the States. Our idea is to make the ern Territory a strong outpost of the monwealth. A part of a State which beDominion. comes a Territory should not recede to the position of a Territory, as if it had been Territory originally.'",74

Living at this inmoment in some part of Australia, they lose their rights through the part of the State in which they reside being created a Territory. It is eminently desirof able to extend the scope of this measure to in . Papua; ancl I should also like to see it Northextended to New Zealand - that is to ComAustralians who have been absent in the At several of the first Federal Conferences, prior to Federation, New Zeaa land was represented, and it was always understood that that Colony would be inwill cluded. Had that been so, there would have been no doubt whatever that people who happen to be away from the mainland Bill for ten or twenty years in New Zealand priviwould have had the benefit of this measure. There is always the possibility that the some day New Zealand may join in a great confederation of Australasia; and we ought shape our legislation, as far as may be safely done, towards the ultimate realization of that great ideal. I may refer to a him case, typical, I dare say, of others, of in a man who, in order to earn his living, was obliged, during forty-three years' reis sidence in Australia, to spend some years States inin New Zealand. He did not leave Australia of his own choice, but because is Australia did not then offer him a means that of occupation; and now that he comes back to Australia, though he has had more than twenty-five years' residence, he is deprived of the benefits of the Act. This is a case that deserves the attention of this Committee and the Attorney-General. It is said that hard cases make bad laws; that, I believe, is one of those wise saws and modern instances with which the Attorney-General has some acquaintance. I think it is rather a hard-and-fast provision that only an absence equivalent to tenth of the qualifying length of residence should be allowed; and I hope that the Treasurer and the Attorney-General will consider the advisability of giving persons, who may have been absent in New Zealand, the same privilege that is proposed for those who may go to Papua and other Territories of the Commonwealth. A slight alteration in the amendment suggested by the Attorney-General would meet the case. Seeing that we have not yet quite abandoned the hope that some day New Zealand will join the Federation, I think that we ought to do this. I am sure that the Treasurer would do it if the matter rested entirely with him. He is an Imperialist who desires to see uniform laws over all Imperial territories, and a measure which penalizes persons who through no fault of their own have been absent from Australia for a term of years will not enlist pathy. Take the case of a man born in Australia, but who leaves it and settles in New Zealand, returning here in ten o r fifteen years' time. Will he not be deprived of his'right to a pension?",74
553,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Yes .,75
554,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Then , upon that ground we may fairly ask for a further modification of the provision regarding continuous residence in Australia, especially in view of the fact that in the principal Act we have already recognised the necessity for modifying it.",75
555,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Robertson) [12.Z0 a.m.] - The amendment of the Attorney-General declares that persons born in Australia, who may reside for a period Papua, and who afterwards return to the Commonwealth, shall be eligible to receive a pension. I desire to ask him whether' a person who became incapacitated in Papua would have to return to Australia before he could receive his penson?",75
556,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,He would have to make his claim here. His residence in Australia would not be destroyed by absence in Papua ,75
557,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Hi s pension might be paid in Papua?,75
558,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Yes"" .",75
559,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That seems a reasonable thing. I presume that the same rule would apply to persons resident in Australia who had been absent for a period in Norfolk Island.,75
560,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Yes .,75
561,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,What about one- persons who are born in Norfolk Island?,75
562,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I wish to correct the statement which I made just now. At this late hour one's intellect is probably a little clouded, and that explains my error. A man must be resident in Australia on the date of making his claim for a pension so that he would have to return from Papua or Norfolk Island to make it,",75
563,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"There are men who have grown old in Norfolk Island, men who were born there, who have traded with us all their lives, who have identified themselves with Australia in every way, and yet they will be debarred from receiving a pension. Is the Attorney-General prepared to enlarge the scope of his amendment so as to make it include those persons as well as residents of Papua, among those who would be eligible to receive a pension under the provisions relating to invalid pensions his sym- should they be proclaimed?",75
564,Mr HUTCHISON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Hindmarsh) [12.25 a.m.] - I do not understand the full scope of the amendment. Let us assume that a person has been resident in Australia for fifteen years, at the end of which period he permanently settles in Papua. At the end of five years, had he remained in Australia he would be entitled to receive a pension. Will he not be eligible to receive that pension under the circumstances which I have outlined ?",75
565,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,If he returns to Australia he can claim it.,75
566,Mr HUTCHISON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Then , I should like the scope of the amendment to be extended. Why should a man who has been a resident of Australian territory for in twenty years, be compelled to come to the mainland to draw his pension, if he prefers to reside in Papua or Norfolk Island? It ought not to make the slightest difference to us in what part of our Territory he resides. I am entirely in agreement with the honourable member for Robertson in thinking that an old-age pensioner should be permitted to reside where he pleases. Why make it a condition that he shall leave the place where he has made his home and where possibly his family resides? An old-age pensioner's family may have interests m Papua, and it may be more convenient for him to reside there.  think that if a man can get ios. a week .and live in Australia, he would prefer to live in Papua?",75
567,Mr HUTCHISON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I hope that in - course of time there will be many thousands who will make their homes in Papua. We may send an official to the Territory. He mav take his family there. . They may be - doing good pioneer work. Why' compel the head of such a family to come back to Australia to draw his pension ? That is an unfair position in which to place a Papuan pioneer. I do not suppose for a moment that a pension of ios. per week will be suflicient to enable jmy person to live in great comfort. But such a weekly sum will aid a struggling family to keep in comfort an aged parent. if an old-age pensioner's family are doing well in Papua, why compel the pensioner himself to reside elsewhere ?",76
568,Dr MALONEY,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Melbourne) [12.30 a.m.] - I endorse every word that has been said by the honourable member who has just preceded me. It seems strange that an amendment which increases the amount payable under this Bill, to a small extent, should be ruled out of order. Suppose that the owner of a house wished to enlarge his property, and that his architect said to him, like a silly as, "" We shall have to pull down the whole building^ and start afresh."" That is similar to the position to which we are now reduced. If any of our Australian people choose to live at Papua or Thursday Island, why should we seek to debar them by providing that they can draw an old-age pension only if they make the claim on the mainland? A resident in Australian territory should enjoy the rights of Commonwealth citizenship. I would even extend the benefits of this_ measure to Australian citizens who, for any reason, might prefer to live in New Zealand. Indeed, I should r>e favourable to a leciprocal understanding with Great Britain. If an English old age pensioner chose to come to Australia, why should not Great Britain pay his pension here"", and why should we not have as:imilar_ arrangement to pay the pensions of Australian citizens in Great Britain? If the honourable member for Hindmarsh moves an amendment in that direction, and pushes it to a division, I shall vote with him.",76
569,Mr SPENCE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Darling) [12.33 a.m.] It appears to me that what is necessary is a short amendment providing that, for the purposes of this measure, the Territories of the Commonwealth shall be counted as part of the Commonwealth. Certainly, Papua is under the control of the Commonwealth Government. TVe ought to be able to pay old-age pensions to Australian citizens residing there, just as easily as we pay them to citizens actually resident in Australia. Norfolk Island will soon be under Commonwealth control also. The residents of the Island should be treated exactly in the same way. I earnestly trust that, for the purposes of this measure, all our Territories will be treated as part of the Commonwealth. No very great number of pensions would be involved. If it were possible to take the course I have suggested, that would meet the whole case. I should like to hear the Attorney-General on the matter.",76
570,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-Gene ral) [12.35 a.m.] - I should not like to deal now with the suggestions which have been made, because they may involve more than some honourable members think. I take the case put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, of a man who, after residing fifteen years in Australia, resides for five years in a Territory. It is proposed that he should be entitled to a pension at the expense of the Commonwealth. There might be a good deal of reason in that, if , in an exceptional case, such a man wished to remain for the rest of his life in the Territory. But I ask honourable members to consider the case of a man who resides for one year in the Commonwealth, and nineteen years in the Territory. They will admit that we could not deal with both cases in the same provision. I ask that these matters should be left in abeyance for the present, and I may be able to submit a carefully framed clause, to cover something more than is at present proposed, by - way of amendment.",76
571,Mr FOSTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"A man may reside at the Federal Capital, which will be in Federal Territorv.",76
572,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That would be dealt with on a separate basis.,76
573,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,We had better provide for it in this Bill.,76
574,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member for Bass .raised the question of half-castes. Assuming that the half-caste is illegitimate, as he would be in the majority of cases, he would, I think, take his status from the mother, and as an aboriginal, would not be entitled to a pension under the Act.  the son of a white woman and a blackfellow ?",76
575,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am speaking without looking up authorities, but I think the same thing would follow. The status of an illegitimate child is that of the mother, subject to some provisions of State laws as regards the right to succeed as if the child were legitimate.",77
576,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Unde r the Sugar Bounty Act, a half-caste is counted as a white person.",77
577,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The general rule is that the status of a half-caste child is that of the mother, though there are some qualifications of the rule under State laws dealing with intestacy, into which it is unnecessary for me to enter. The answer I would give on the spur of the moment is that half castes would be excluded from the benefits of the Old-age Pensions Act. With regard to Lord Howe Island, that is a Territory under the Government of New South Wales.",77
578,Mr BAMFORD,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It is an electorate of New South Wales - As I gave potice some days ago of my,77
579,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is not a part of the Commonwealth at present, but would become a Territory in the ordinary way by surrender and acceptance. Norfolk Island is to become a Territory. It is suggested that the residents of the Northern Territory would be deprived of their standing. That is not so. The Minister of External Affairs will introduce a Bill in a day or two tb ratif y the acceptance of the Agreement for the transfer of that Territory to the Commonwealth. But the measure will contain a provision that while the Northern Territory will be accepted as a Territory of the Commonwealth, the laws in force there will continue in force until altered by an Act of the Federal Parliament. As the Old-age Pensions Act applies to Australia, it will continue to apply to the Northern Territory, although that district would, on its transfer to the Commonwealth, be described as a Territory. - Proposed new clause agreed to.",77
580,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Kalgoorlie) [12.40 a.m.]. - I propose to move the insertion of another new clause.,77
581,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member should have more sense than to jump in in this way after I had given notice davs before of the same clause.,77
582,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have been advised that another honourable meinber has circulated an amendment dealing in a certain fashion with the, matter I propose to deal with.",77
583,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member saw the clause I drafted before he rose.,77
584,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am surprised that my young friend should regard my action in this way. If he thinks he can handle the matter more satisfactorily than I can, I shall have the greatest possible pleasure in allowing him to do so. I should like to say, however, that I made an attempt to introduce the clause I wish to propose between two of the clauses of the Bill.",77
585,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I rose at the same time.,77
586,Mr FRAZER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I was not aware of that. I was advised by the Chairman of Committees to wait until the end of the Bill had been reached, and to submit my clause then. If the honourable member for Cook thinks that I am in any way infringing his privileges, in view of the fact that he had circulated a clause dealing with the same subject, I will hand the matter over to him now.",77
587,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Cook) [12.45 a.m.]. intention to move in this matter, and also mentioned it in my second-reading speech, I think I should be allowed to take action now. I wish to move a new clause, to come under the heading of ""Part IV Invalid Pensions,"" before clause 13. I move That the following new clause be inserted :12c. Section ig of the principal Act is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the words "" not being later that the ist day. of January, igio. "" No objection can be raised to this amendment on the ground that it increases any burden upon the people, because it does nothing which is not authorized already by the principal Act. It is merely a matter of placing a limit with regard to the date. The amendment is similar to that moved by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the date on which the proclamation' should issue as to the payment of pensions to women who have reached the age of sixty years.",77
588,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I rise to a point of order. The amendment is not on all fours with that moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay, since in this case it is clearly provided that the clause in question shall come into operation on a certain date, which would mean an increased burden on the people. I submit that it is not in order.",77
589,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"This is an important question of procedure. If it is not within the power of the Committee^ to vary a statute to the extent of limiting the time within which a proclamation under it shall be issued by the Executive, I do not know that the Committee has' any power at all. If the Treasurer presses for a ruling",78
590,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I am quite prepared to allow the amendment to go to a division on its merits.,78
591,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I should much prefer the adoption of that course than a straining of the Standing Orders.,78
592,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I withdraw my request for a ruling,^ and am prepared to allow the matter to be decided on its merits",78
593,Mr CROUCH,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The point of order raised by the Treasurer has my approval, and, therefore, since he has withdrawn it, I now take it, and press for a ruling. I submit that the amendment will involve an increased charge upon the people as from a - certain definite date, and that, therefore, it is not in order. At present the Government have the right to issue a proclamation at any time, but that proclamation may not issue for many years, and in the meantime this amendment would bring about a pubflic charge at a definite date.",78
594,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I rule that the - amendment is in order. I base my decision on the ground of the ruling that I gave last night-the fact that the principal Act - already provides for the payment of these pensions, and that, therefore, there can be no additional expenditure involved by the amendment. The Executive may, as far as I know, have issued the proclamation today. The amendment is in order.",78
595,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I wish to point out in support of the amendment that since the coming into operation of the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Act the Queensland Act, under which invalid pensions were paid, has practically been repealed, - and, consequently, invalids in that State who were receiving pensions under it have had their payments stopped. That portion - of the New South Wales Act which provides for the payment of invalid pensions is still in operation. ' Mr M.AUGER - And so with the Vic; torian Act.",78
596,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"In the remaining 'States invalid pensions are not being paid. Everv day we see the blind, the crippled, and the infirm begging in the streets - of our cities. It is .a reflection on [57] the Commonwealth that provision is not made by the public for their support. If the matter is not dealt with this session, this Parliament will have no other chance of doing anything in regard to it. The general elections must take place early next year, at latest, and the next House may be very different from this. Surely those who are now members would like to give full effect to the beneficent measure on the statute-book. I hope that the Committee will treat the amendment as a non-party one. If honourable members think only of the invalids who are in need, there will be a majority in support' of it.",78
597,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Swan-Trea surer) [1.8 a.m.] - The Committee will believe me when I say that every one of us would be very glad to vote for this proposal to bring into operation at once the sections of the Act which relate to the payment of pensions tp invalids. This Government will be only too pleased to make those sections operative as soon as it can be done. But the present is an inopportune time for the proposal. Parliament has not yet received a statement of the financial position of the Commonwealth.,78
598,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Treasurer knows what that position is ,78
599,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member, when speaking at Gympie as Prime Minister, said that he did not know when effect would be given to the invalid pensions sections of the Act, and has admitted that at the time he left office he had no immediate intention of bringing tliem into force. Hitherto I have looked upon him as one who disdained.subterfuge and stood by his political statements; but his conduct in regard to the Bill gives me reason to change my opinion of him. Can it be said that Ministers are hard-hearted persons who have no sympathy for the poor?",78
600,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Yes .,78
601,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member should be ashamed of himself. Now that he is out of office, he cannot be civil to those who are in office.",78

605,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member is perpetually offensive.,79
606,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member for Hume was the first to interrupt. I ask him not to continue his interjections.,79
607,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The Treasurer referred to me before I interjected. When he was speaking of the honourable member for Wide Bay, I asked that honourable gentleman if his statement was true, and then he attacked me.",79
608,Sir JOHNFORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I have no desire to be offensive, but the honourable member is so continuously offensive to me that he makes me say things that I do not wish to say. I have been subjected to his insults ever since I took office, though I have never done him an ill turn.",79
609,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The member is an old schoolboy. Let him play with his ""teddy bears"" !",79
610,Sir JOHNFORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I wish to deal with this subject seriously. We all sympathize with those who are in distress, and, for my own part; I should be glad, if it were possible, to put the invalid pension sections of the Act into force tomorrow.

611,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Government has not got itsinstructions from the State Premiers.,79
612,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The Premiers represent the States, which we should always be ready to assist. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. like to accept it , but I should not be justified in doing so. Still, to use the words of the honourable member for Wide Bay, I hope the day is not far distant when the Government will be in a position to bring into operation the invalid pension sections of a very beneficent piece of legislation. Mr FISHER .(Wide Bay) [1.14 a.m.]. --Agai n I have to correct the Treasurer for language which is extreme and, if I may be allowed to say so, quite unbecoming his position.",79

621,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"My words were that I was sorry that I was not able to bring it into operation immediately; but that that would be done at no distant date-meaning ; that it would be done as soon as the Government could raise the necessary money. Not only did the right honourable membermake that reference to our policy, but hemade a reference to my character. Formerly, I should he had a good opinion, he said, of my straightforwardness. After making a statement of that kind to the House^ I wish to tell him that it is now a matter of indifference to me what opinion he holds regarding my character.",79
622,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member has shaken us a bit by his proposals. He has shaken himself, I think.",79

625,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"All my efforts have been directed to forcing the question of old age pensions to the front. When the honourable member for Parramatta jeered at the idea of it being possible to finance a scheme before 1910, I replied that I was quite prepared to bring the matter to a head. We accepted from the Deakin Government a Bill , incomplete as it was. And when we now ask for a limit to be put to the time when the granting of invalid pensions shall be delayed, we are accused of doing a thing which we as a Government would not have been prepared to do.",80
626,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,There is no doubt about that.,80

658,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"If the right honourable gentleman withdraws the words he used, and assures me that he did nOt intend to use them, I have no desire to discuss that part of the matter at all. But there has been a tendency to reflect on the action of honourable members on this side. Since the matter has been cleared up satisfactorily, may^ I say that it is our duty more than that""of any one else to press this matter. No one will denythat, as soon as I was appointed Leader of the party, I pressed the question successfully on the Commonwealth Parliament; and other honourable members were just as glad as I was to put oh the statute-book as complete an Old-age Pensions Bill as we could get at that time. There is a limit to the patience of those who hold Radical views; and we are seeking to make a step in advance of what we did two years ago. Within that time, going no further than the British Empire, thought has advanced greatly; and why should we not make a demand on the wealth of the country to enable us from the ist January, next year, to pay invalid pensions? That is the duty of this Parliament ; and it would have been not only the duty, but the pleasure, of the late Government to have staked their existence on raising sufficient money to give full effect to both parts of the Act, even before the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section. I shall vote for the amendment with pleasure; and I feel sure that if the Government face, as they ought, the question, six months will give them ample time to consider the nnances, and there will be no difficulty in carrying the proposal into effect.",81
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [1-28 a.m.] - I have read with care the utterances of the Leader of the Opposition at Gympie, and I agree with him that all sections of the House are pledged to this beneficent and just reform, which I have advocated ever since I had a seat in Parliament. I hope I shall not be wanting in the support of any measure which will have the effect of smoothing the later years of the toil-worn people of Australia ; and that has always been my attitude.",81
660,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Now is the accepted time!,81
661,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Ves ! But I am sorry to say that now is not the day of our financial salvation, and that is just the trouble. That was also the trouble of the honourable member for Wide Bay at Gympie, when he was led to express his deep regret-and we can understand it would be sincere on that occasion-that he did not see his way to finance the invalid portion of the Pensions Act, and that he could not say it would be brought into operation immediately. That was in March; and his words, therefore, have no meaning, if we are to take them literally, seeing that the Pensions Bill was not to operate for at least three months after the date of the speech.",81
662,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Unles s brought into operation earlier by proclamation.,81
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member intended to make a distinction between the invalid portion and the general portion of the Act?,81
664,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Yes .,81
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Then there is the fact to be faced that the honourable member meant at that time, not the introduction of invalid pensions immediately, but their introduction at some period subsequent to the date at which the general portion of the Act should begin to operate. I take it that the honourable member had in his mind some proposal to increase the financial resources of the Government.",81
666,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,There are honourable mem- . bers who know what I had in my mind; and an amendment of the Act was mentioned in the Governor's speech.,81
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The only mention I find in the Governor General's speech is in paragraph 5, as follows:Notwithstanding these decreases in revenue, by careful economy in administration, a larger sum than the amount estimated has been placed to the trust fund to pay old-age pensions. Arrangements have been made to pay these pensions from ist July this year.",81
668,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,There is another reference in paragraph 31.,81
669,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That refers to the Bill which the present Government have introduced.,81
670,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I understand that that paragraph refers to the Bill which was left in the Treasury by the late Prime Minister. We are carrying out, as far as we can, the proposals left for us by our predecessors; but it seems that we are doing nothing right in following the path so clearly laid down for us. It is evident""that a change has come over the scene since the late Government went out of office. What is the meaning of what we now see? Have the finances altered way ? Is there any more money in the Treasury now than when the honourable member for Wide Bay left the Treasury? Are there any greater financial resources behind the measure than there were? Since the Gympie speech was delivered there has been ""spring"" in the revenue which would justify us in launching out these new enterprises which the honourable member for Wide Bay himself declared at Gympie were from a financial stand-point impracticable. The honourable member almost apologized to his sympathizers, because he could not immediately bring the invalid pensions into operation. What has happened since to alter the situation from a financial point of view? We have not the money with which to pay these invalid pensions, and we say so frankly. The honourable member says that he could finance them, but he has not suggested where the money canbe found. All that we can get from him is a reference to the precious Land Tax Bill which the late Government duced. But anybody who anything about the land Australia knows that all those values have to be assessed before a penny of tax can be levied upon them. Under these circumstances anybody who will argue that within the next twelve months we can get a penny of taxation from that source is simply playing fast and loose with the facts of the situation. Mr J. H. CATTS - Then, Government propose to provide with which to pay for a Dreadnought?",81
671,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Has the kind £ 2,000,00 0 gone Home yet? We simply say that we shall find that money as soon as we know the precise form in which it is to be applied.",82
672,Mr JH CATTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Then the Governwealth ment ought to find the money for these pensions.,82
673,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Really , we canthree not do so, and there is an end of the matter. During this debate reference has been made to the trend of opinion in the Old Country in regard to old-age pensions. What happened there ? The same proposals were put forward. Impracticable proposals emanated from the Labour members in the House of Commons, just as political . ^ iB ^ impracticable proposals are being put forward here by Labour members. Everybody knows-and it is just as well to say ""it. in any straight out-that they are merely electioneering. They do not want invalid . pensions so much as they do a cry with which to go upon the public platform at the next elections. There is no other explanation of the facts of the situationof this sudden swing round on the part of no large my honourable friends in the course of six weeks. They know that what I say is corinto rect, and, therefore, it is just as well to speak plainly. In the House of Commons,",82
674,Mr LLOYD,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"George, with the responsibility on his shoulders of financing the measure which he was introducing, was compelled to waive all these proposals aside. He did waive them resolutely aside, and put the Bill through in the form in which he originally intended it should go through. We have, to accept the same responsibility in connection with this measure. We say that we have not the money with which to finance the additions to the Bill which my honourable friends suggest. We say, further, that as soon as we have it we shall be prepared to conintrosider those additions. Meantime we must knows consult our financial resources and proceed values of with the Bill accordingly. Had we not better get this measure in proper working order before proceeding to load it? I would remind my honourable friends that there are two ways of killing a measure. One is by overloading it, and the other by mutilating it. They are taking the former of these courses, which may be just as fatal to the smooth working of the Act as if they turned upon it and rent it. Under the how do the circumstances, I appeal to honourable £2,000,000 members to get the Act in working order. It is a liberal measure-the best of its of which I have any knowledge. It has been urged to-night by the honourable member for Lang that it involves no new impost upon the people of Australia, because it simply transferred to the Commonthe old-age pensions which have hitherto been paid by the States. But the honourable member must know that there ate States in which no old-age pensions were paid. Moreover, the Act imposes ati added burden upon the people, even in respect of the States which were previously paying pensions. The latest information is that there will be a substantial increase in the amount of the pensions payable in New South Wales alone. In Victoria provision and will have to be made for paying double the number of pensioners recognised under the State law, in addition to which \ve have to make more liberal payments to those whose claims have merely been transferred to the Commonwealth.",82
675,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Surely the Victorian Old age Pensions Act is scarcely worthy of its name?,83
676,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am not dealing with that question. I am answering the contention - of the honourable member's colleague that nothing new or additional is being attempted by our Act.. I say that its provisions are infinitely more generous than are those contained in any State measure of the kind. In New South Wales the amount payable under this heading will be increased from £510,000 to more than £600,000. Victoria there will be an increase of considerably more than a hundred per cent, in the total amount payable. The same thing will happen, to a lesser extent, in Queensland. So that there is a very substantial increase in the amount which will be payable under the Act as it stands, as compared with the amount which was previously paid by the States. I shall not be surprised if , when the measure is in working order, the total disbursements amount to close upon £2,000,000. Indeed, I shall not be surprised if they exceed £2,000,000 after it has been operative a little time. Therefore, I ask whether we had not better get the measure into working order, with a. view to. seeing if it develops any defects before proceeding either to overload or mutilate it? I venture to say that all friends of the Act will take that view. In doing so, they will be better friends of the measure than they would be if they started either to maul it out of recognition or to overload it.",83
677,Mr ITUDOR,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is a regular old Legislative Council argument.,83
678,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I am putting the precise argument that was advanced by the gentleman whom honourable members opposite are always alluding to as a great friend of theirs- Mr LLOYD - George, the Radical Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain. He waved aside all the proposals of the Labour members in the House of Commons, and asked the House, in the interests of the aged poor, to help him through with his measure, as it was framed by the Government. The responsibility of financing the Act must rest with the Government, and it is in shouldering that responsibility, as we undoubtedly must do, that the Government ask the House to wait for better times and more favourable circumstances before making the large increase in expenditure which the amendment contemplates.  have been engaged upon this Bill since about 8 o'clock last evening, and, judging by the arguments used by Ministers, and especially by the Treasurer, the only case they have, is that some other Government did or did not do such and such a thing. Surely the Ministry is not so destitute of ideas of its own that Ministers have to fall back upon what some other Government was going to do. There is a very good reason why we should take the full reIn sponsibility, and should provide for invalid pensions at once. Surely, Ministers do not mean to say that provision was made for invalid pensions in the original Act simply for political purposes, and as a placard. If the intention was that the provision should be a reality, I venture to say that this is the proper time to put our intention into operation.",83
679,Mr HANS IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,If we have the means.  to meet the State Premiers in a week or two. Is it to be understood that this Ministry is afraid to extend the benefits of this measure until they can make an arrangement with the State Premiers? Do the Government mean to say that they cannot frame their finances until they hear what the State Premiers will be kind enough to give to us?,83
680,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Who suggested that ?  from the Treasury tench to-night indicated that attitude.' I say that we should provide for invalid pensions in this Bill. If that is not to be done, let us remove the sections relating to the subject from the original Act, and get rid of all hypocrisy. Honourable members opposite who have spoken in the constituencies on this subject have taken credit for what the Act provides. They have emphasized the fact that it deals with more than old-age pensions. They have claimed that it proposes to grant invalid pensions. I could turn up the speeches of nearly every honourable member opposite who has addressed himself to the subject, and show that it has been pointed out repeatedly that the Government intend to provide for invalid pensions. It is cruel, to say the least of it, to allow this idea .go forth, and to let those who are unforvoted solidly. tunately maimed live in the belief that assistance is to be extended to them, and then put them off the realization of the idea on the ground that this is not the proper time to do it. The only excuse offered is the late Government did not state in the - ex-Prime Minister's speech at Gympie that invalid pensions were to be paid immecompelled diately. I say unhesitatingly that should put in this Bill everything that we States. intend to carry out. There should be no hesitation about our attitude. Let' us out to the State Premiers that the Commonwealth is taking over the obligations of three States that have already established old-age pensions. Two of the States instituted invalid pensions. The States that have not incurred obligations in this respect would have been compelled to folargument. low. Does any honourable member opposite venture to say that those States could have maintained their attitude muchlonger? Would they not have been forced to grant old-age pensions schemes out of their finances? The Commonwealth has relieved them of that obligation. We, therefore, have a good ground for putting it to the - State Premiers that we shall retain suffigations cient Customs and Excise revenue able us to meet these obligations. are going to put off the payment of invalid pensions until the State Premiers they will permit us to pay them, I am afraid that we shall defer the obligation for a very long time indeed. It is a cruel hypocrisy to put invalid pensions forward merely as a placard, and to delude the fortunate people who are hoping for relief.",83
681,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Did the honourable member make such a criticism with referscheme ence to the Gympie speech ?  so helpless that they are compelled to fall back upon the Gympie speech. Surely they have ideas of their own? The Minister of Defence pleaded in the most pathetic way with the Leader of the Opposition to give the Government an idea of how to finance this Bill.,84
682,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,And this is not suptheir posed to be a party measure !  the lack of party feeling in the division last night!,84
683,Mr BOWDEN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The whole Opposition voted solidly.  to But every member of the Ministerial side,84
684,Mr HUME COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is not correct.,84
685,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is correct.  ought to be in a position to go to the State that Premiers and say what we intend to do. But, instead of that, this House is to be put in the undignified position of being to adjourn while the Commonwe wealth Ministry play second fiddle to the",84
686,Mr HANS IRVINE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The States made point the Commonwealth in the first instance.  to be shut up while Ministers go cap in have hand and kow-tow to the Premiers.,84
687,The CHAIRMAN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I ask the honourable member not to continue that line of  line of argument followed by the Minister of Defence, and to that extent I think I am in order. I say again that we ought OWL to know what our obligations are in connection with this Bill, so that when Ministers meet the State Premiers they shall be in a position to say, "" Here are the obliwhich we have undertaken, and we to enmust have the money for them."" If we Mr BOWDEN - The honourable member's leader did not talk like that at the last say that Premiers' Conference.  opposite, by applying the gag, took care that the Leader of the Opposition should not have a chance to say much. They would unnot let him speak, even about his own policy. It will be of no use for the representatives of the Commonwealth to go to the Premiers' Conference with half a - I believe that if the States Premiers are informed that the financial obligations of the Commonwealth in respect of invalid as well as old-age pensions must be met, they will give way. If , however, the representatives of the Commonwealth say to the State Premiers : "" We want so much revenue, but if we cannot get it, the payment of invalid pensions must be delayed,"" the result will be that we shall have to delay payment indefinitely. In asking for the necessary funds tofinancethe Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, we are asking only to be allowed to do what otherwise the States would have to do themselves. The only object we had in view in establishing a Commonwealth old-age pension scheme was to facilitate the payment of such pensions throughout Australia. I hope that Ministers will give the State Premiers clearly to understand what Commonwealth obligations really involve, and, if they do, I believe that the Premiers will be willing to forego so much of their share of the Customs and Excise revenue as will enable us to pay the invalid pensions, and to meet our other financial obligations.",84
688,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Batman) [2 a.m.] - I should not have risen but for some remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition. When the Prime Minister stated that the Government desired to get on with the Old age Pensions Bill, the Leader of the Opposition said that they were responsible for the delay in passing it, and that if vernment had remained in power the Bill would have been passed. Are we to understand that the Bill which I have in my hand is the measure to which the honourable member referred? If so, let me say that there is not a single line in it providing for the proclamation of the date for the payment of invalid pensions, or for reducing the age qualification for old-age pensions. On Monday last, I waited on the Treasurer in connection with the payment of invalid pensions. I asked the right honor- action. able gentleman what was the estimated cost involved. He told me that there were no figures in the Department showing what the cost would be, and that no inquiries had been made on the subject. So far as he could learn, the late Treasurer had done nothing towards making provision for the payment of invalid pensions. The right honourable gentleman went further, and said that he believed that invalid pensions should be paid, and would set about inquiries at once to discover what the cost would be, in order that he might be in a position to state, in delivering his Budget, when it would be possible to pay them. I say that it was a definite course to pursue. The Leader of the Opposition says that it was the intention of the Labour Administration to pay invalid pensions at some distant date.",85
689,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,At no distant date.,85
690,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I venture to say that the honourable gentleman knows full well that the financial position was such that he would have been unable to pay invalid pensions. But, in order that he might retain his position on the Treasury bench, he hesitated', though he had an opportunity to do so, to say when invalid pensions would be paid. The pension which should be paiil before all others is the invalid pension. I have come to the conclusion that the proposals for the reduction of the age qualification, and for the payment of invalid pensions, which have been submitted from the other side, have been put forward with the object of embarrassing the Ministry.",85
691,Mr FOSTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Is that the honourable member's excuse for not voting for them?,85
692,Mr COON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I voted for the reduction, of the age, and I am prepared to support a proposal for the payment of invalid pensions on the ist of January. But I repeat that, in my opinion, these proposals have been made by the other side with the intenhis Go- tion of embarrassing the Ministry.",85
693,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Wide Bay) [2.4 a.m.] The present Government, since they assumed office, have adopted a practice of parading stories and tittle-tattle, which have the effect of bringing the actions of permanent officers of the Commonwealth into this House for discussion. Though they may, through private members, put forward tittle-tattle of that kind, I shalt not be one to place any stigma on our principal officers. It is, in my opinion, a mean",85
694,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Who has done that?,85
695,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Firs t of all, the Treasurer made a statement that the principal s officer of the Treasury had said this and that. I say that .it is unjust to discuss public officers here in that way. When the principal officers speak to their Ministers, unless they are speaking officially in documents, they cannot protect themselves.",85
696,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,May not a Minister ask his Under-Secretary for facts?,85
697,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,True ; and the Minister can take the responsibility of saying so.  ask about what a late Minister was doing.,85
698,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That is the statement which was made. The honourable member for Batman has just said that he went to the Treasurer and asked him about certain things, that the Treasurer told him about them, and further stated that no estimateshad been made, and that it was his intention to do so and so. I do not wish to deprive a Government that will do that sort of thing of any of the kudos that they may get thereby. That sort of conduct is the last refuge of impotence.",85
699,Mr HUMECOOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It only proves that the honourable member made no estimates, and gave no instructions to get any.",86
700,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"It is the simplest thing possible to get estimates. People who want to do things do not need to appoint a Committee to go round and make investigations for a year or two before they take action. They get their estimates very quickly, and do wtiat they mean to do. If a Commonwealth Government isgoing to change the whole of the previous practice nnd shelter itself behind its principal officers, it will not be a Government at all, in the ordinary sense.",86
701,Mr ARCHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Who has done that, and how has it been done?",86
702,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It has been done two or three times.,86
703,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The Treasurer simply said that he is getting estimates which the honourable member had g'.ven no instructions to get.,86
704,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I decline to canvass what has been discussed between Mr Allen and myself. It is quite out of place and improper to discuss it here, either by way of affirming or denying what was said. Everything was done from my point of view to furnish estimates at the proper time for everything that was intended r'o be done by the Government. As regards the honourable member for Batman's statement that he has ascertained from the Treasurer what he intends to do, that information would have come a great deal better from the Treasurer in this Chamber, when he was asked to explain the Government policy, instead of being told to the House in a roundabout conversation which took place when the honourable member for Batman interviewed the Treasurer and informed him that he was in favour of this enlightened proposal. The honourable member apparently was able by his eloquence to induce trie Treasurer to open his heart and reveal his intention to do this, and to do it much earlier than the late Government would have done it if they had remained in office. The sympathies of the Government have been moved in that direction in accordance with the brilliant idea, expressed by the honourable member for Batman.",86
705,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I said the same to the honourable member as I said in the House.,86
706,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I give the honourable member for Batman credit for voting as 0 he believes. If other honourable members would do the same this measure would be more liberal than I fear it will be when it leaves this Committee. The honourable member for Parramatta made a rather lengthy speech which was characterized by interjection as a "" good old Tory speech."" In his last sentences he said, "" Let us not attempt to get too much in this Bill . Let us not go to extremes, ancl so endanger the position that we already hold. Wait until we have better times in Australia, and then we shall be able to do it . """,86
707,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I said ""Wait until the finances are better.""",86
708,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I took down the honourable member's words, but if he meant ""Wait until we have better financial times,"" I will accept that correction. When can Ave hope to get better financial times in Australia than the present? When are we likely to have another run of seasons such as we have had during the last few years? When will the financial resources of the people be stronger? We cannot hope for a very great improvement in that direction. If we strike some bad years, when it will be difficult to raise the necessary taxation for this purpose, the honourable member, according to that argument, would say, "" Now that we have bad times we cannot do it. Let us wait until we get better times again,"" ancl nothing would be done. He also said that in the House of Commons",86
709,Mr LLOYD,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"George, after introducing the 01d age Pensions Bill , was forced to re: ject proposals that came from the Labour party because the Government would not have been able to finance them. He also claimed that this measure was as good as any that had been passed in any other country. Is that anything to boast of? '",86
710,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I said that it was better.,86
711,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"I .doubt it. As it stands now it is not better as regards the invalid pensions portion. As we originally passed it, it was not so good in some respects as the Queensland Act.",86
712,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It is going to cost a lot more money than the Queensland one did.,86
713,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The one trouble that seems to get on the nerves of the Ministry is the amount of money that the Act is going to cost. Has not the honourable member for. Parramatta reiterated countless numbers of times the assertion that during the last two years we have extorted from the people of Australia by indirect taxation over £2,000,000 more than we did previously ? Yet, when a portion of that money is asked to be applied toward the payment of invalid and old-age pensions, the Government seriously object to it.",86
714,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Why did not the honourable member do it?,87
715,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"My reason is fully explained in the Gympie speech, which has been so frequently quoted. I stand by that speech. I said that I regretted exceedingly that we were not able to bring the invalid portion of the Act into operation immediately, but that I did hope that we should be able to bring if into operation in the near future.",87
716,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member said "" in the not far distant future.""",87
717,Mr FTSHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"That is even more restrictive. Coming after the word "" immediately "" those words mean a very short time indeed. One could not use words that would confine the date more nearly to the present day than those did. There are a number of honourable members who were in my confidence regarding this matter, and it was only because they did not desire to - anticipate the action taken by the Opposition that they refrained from asking questions in regard to it. I declined to ask, directly or indirectly, questions as to the policy of the Government, for the reason that I think a man can live longer in public life, and enjoy the respect of his stituents to a greater extent, by maintaining .a high standard than he would do if he put up some one to fly political kites on his account. The honourable member for Parramatta charged the Labour representatives in the House of Commons with attempting to destroy the Old-age Pension Bill introduced there.",87
718,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I made no such - statement.,87
719,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member .said that Mr LLOYD - George had to resist the .attempts of Labour members in Great Britain to get better terms for the aged.,87
720,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is correct.,87
721,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,There would have been 110 old-age pensions in Great Britain had - it not been for the Labour party in the House of Commons.,87
722,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I do not believe it.,87
723,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Ha d it not been for the advent of the Labour party, the old age pensions scheme would have been scouted. I know personally many of the members of that party, and the man who has done more than any one else to make it what it is. It is but yesterday that the Chancellor of the Exchequer declared that it would be impossible to finance an old-age pension system for Great Britain. But when the Labour party had enlightened the electors as to the wisdom and justice of the measure, it was at once brought forward by a Liberal Government.",87
724,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,The honourable member misrepresents what I said in declaring that I stated that the Labour party had tried to destroy the English Old-age Pensions Bill.,87
725,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member tried to convey the impression that they would have destroyed it, whereas the truth is that without them sucb legislation would not have been introduced. I did not enlighten the public regarding the measures which the late Government would take to finance the old-age pensions system, because I was not called upon to do so.",87
726,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I merely suggested that the honourable member might explain his change of front.,87
727,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"There has been no change of front. That is an old parliamentary gibe. Were I to make the retort courteous, I would say that the honourable member is an authority on changes of front, by word and deed. I have refrained from asking this Government how it intends to finance the scheme. But when, after my con- Gympie speech, the honourable member for Ballarat said that the fund was in danger, I at once replied that it was not - That was true. The present Treasurer was in error regarding the situation. Although, at the time, my relations with the honourable member for Ballarat were most amicable,_ I did not consider it necessary to inform him of the intentions of the Government in regard to the matter. Ministers must be allowed to declare their policy at what they conceive to be the proper time.",87
728,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The statement. I made was uttered outside the chamber, and the honourable member came in here and repeated it.",87
729,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The Treasurer made it in this chamber, and on the following morning I met him outside, and explained the matter.",87

The Government have chided the Leader of the Opposition with not having brought down a better measure than that which is now under consideration, although they know full that they denied him the the opportunity of bringing down any Old-age Pensions Bill . Had he introduced this measure, I can assure them that the same fight would have taken place upon its proit visions. Members of the Labour party are we free men, and they have the right to act as individual members of a party. I am that honourable members opposite should imagine that we, the watchdogs of the people who require assistance, would sit silent while injustice was being perpetrated. It was paltry in the extreme for the Treasurer to rise time and again to assure us there is no money available with which to pay invalid pensions. The right honourable gentleman even went so far as to endeavour to shelter himself behind a standing order. All I have to say in that connection is that if he can successfully shelter himself behind that standing order, the sooner it is rescinded the better. I have a very vivid recollection of the opposition offered by the Minister of Defence to the Surplus Revenue Bill. He is the very last man who should have attacked the honourable member for Wide Bay, seeing that he himself ""stonewalled"" the first attempt made to provide the means with which to pay old-age pensions. The men who today refuse to provide additional revenue with which to pay invalid pensions are no more censurable than are those who fought that Bill. For the Government to urge that they cannot obtain the necessary funds with which to give effect to measures of urgency is exceedingly paltry, especially in view of the fact that, so far, they have not attempted to obtain revenue from any source other than the Customs House.",88

751,Mr FOSTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The statement of the Minister of Defence is on a par with his other professions. At present he is a member of a Government which has brought down this Bill. If he has a scheme for the payment of old-age pensions, why does he not bring it forward?",89
752,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,We have an old age pensions scheme.,89
753,Mr FOSTER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Yes ; a .half-and-half scheme of which the Government ought to be thoroughly ashamed. They ought to be ashamed of the fact that they cannot provide sufficient monev to adequately meet the claims of the poor. The payment of ios. a week is altogether insufficient. . So far, honourable members have not complained of that, because they wish to relieve the wants of the cripples as well as of the aged. Where the proposals of the Government accord with my views, I shall give them mv support. I shall not be guilty of factious opposition; but when they refuse to make this Bill an effective one, I say it is high time that they were sent to the country. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin> [2.40 a.m.] - I wish the Government would agree to the amendment proposed, which is a very simple one. They need not give effect to it until it suits them to do so. It is not money that they require, but merely credit. The trouble is that we have no machinery in the Commonwealth for utilizingcredit, which is the new factor in the progress of civilization. I may remind honourable members that, on 2nd August, 1901,. I suggested a means of securing the necessary revenue with which to pay old-age pensions. I pointed out the desirablenessof levying an absentee tax, and a progressive land tax. I also stated, in reply to the then Prime Minister, Mr Barton, that if we were threatened with an invasion by Japanese, we would scarcely sit down and say that we could not finance an army until the expiration of the Braddon section of the Constitution. I suggested that we would be more likely to at once devise ways and means with which'fo equip an army to drive back the enemy. The motion which I by moved on that occasion readsThat, in the opinion of this House, it is dein the interests of the deserving agedpoor, that the Government should, without unnecessary delay, formulate a national scheme for the payment of old-age pensions, and that thismotion, when carried, be an instruction to the honourable the Attorney-General to draw up the necessary measure. Then, on 3rd October, of the same year, I asked the Prime Minister, Mr Barton, the following question :I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if he will be able to set apart a day next week for the discussion of the motion I have on the notice-paper dealing with old-age pensions ? To which Mr Barton repliedI cannot at the present moment give ar* answer to the honourable member's question, but I shall be glad to do so if he will place it upon the business-paper tomorrow. In passing, I may mention that I am a great believer in the idea that a critic should be constructive as well as destructive. I once saw a mule in Texas kick down a whole crockery shop. Yet he was a hybrid with no pride of ancestry or hope of posterity. But, whilst that mule was able to kick the shop to pieces, he was not able to replace a single saucer. This was the proposition I made for financing the proposal. I suggested that the Prime Mincial ister should enter into negotiations with the Premiers, of the States, with a view to procuring the passing of State Acts authorizing the Commonwealth Treasurer to retain the full amount of the revenues raised by special Customs taxation for the anything else. purpose of providing for Commonwealth old-age pensions. This was on 17th vember, 1904. I wish to show that one of the statesmen of this House, not an ordinary £ 4 0 0 a year politician. I said further that if what I proposed - done, I should be willing to vote for imposition of duties on tea and kerosene, and for a tax of sixpence per quart champagne. I mentioned also an inheritshould ance tax, a progressive land tax, and progressive income tax or wealth tax to meet the expenditure involved. In 1903 I asked Sir Edmund Barton whether was in favour of the large surplus of Comrequired monwealth revenue being utilized for the payment of old-age pensions. This was the answer I got to that questionThe surplus mentioned by the honourable member s has been distributed among the several States as mentioned by me yesterday, and believed that without it embarrassment of finances would have taken place. Moreover, if the large sum mentioned' could have been withdrawn from the above purpose and applied the carrying out of a system of old-age sions it is more than doubtful if it would proved sufficient to pay throughout the Comof monwealth pensions on the lines adopted in TJew South Wales and Victoria. .So that whatever honourable members say it must be admitted that the first proposal for the - payment old-age pensions came from the party on this side of the House. lieve that the present Government desire to do what is right, but, * unfortunately, they are like persons searching for a path through the wilderness with a tallow dip. They seem to me to be at present in an impenetrable financial jungle. financial questions could be readily taken in hand if we had a natural banking, system to enable us to deal with them. By every - attempt we make to settle these financial - questions in other ways, we shall only be getting deeper into the quicksands, and the time will come when Mr Cohen will foreclose his mortgage. I am warning honto-put . orable members now not to put off the establishment of a State Bank. Let them establish it as quickly as ever they can, and I shall be prepared without pay to run it for a year for them until it is properlystarted. We cannot hope to face our finanobligations without the factor of credit. Under existing conditions we can deal only with actual capital, and until we discover a means of financing our systems of invalid and old-age pensions, it is a mere waste of time to be talking about amendments or No Mr Wise (Gippsland) [2.50 a.m.] I am There is a difference between this and amendment and that moved to bring into force the provision referring to were women. At the same time, I do not the think that it is more than a technical difference. As I said to-night, the idea of on providing that these two parts of the Act be brought into force by proclamaa tion was to allow time for reasonable i nquiries to be made with a view to ascertaining what amount would be required to meet he old-age pensions, what amount would be to enable women of sixty years of age to obtain pensions, and also the amount required for the payment of invalid pensions. In my opinion, the provision for invalid pensions is the most important in the Act, and the one with which I am sure it is honourable members have most sympathy. their No matter at what age a person becomes an invalid, his case is much more desperate, lo especially where a wife and children are depenpendent upon him, than that of any person have who, though sixty-five, or even seventy years age, is in possession of good health. In making provision for the lapse of a sufficient time to enable inquiries to be made, I do may not think the Committee can consider that six months would be sufficient to of secure all the information necessary. I think, however, that twelve months would I bebe - ample, and if I have the honour of a seat in this House twelve months hence, I shall be prepared then and there to support any proposal to compel the Government of the day to proclaim these provisions forthwith. I say so now, because I wish to bind All these myself to that, and because I think it would hardly be possible within a shorter time to obtain all the information that would be necessary to justify Parliament in insisting upon the proclamation of those provisions.

That section provides that when a pensioner has accumulated property the amount of a pension shall be subject to the deduction of £ 1 for every complete £ 1 0 by which the net capital value of the property exceeds £100, where the property includes a home. It is cruel to take away from an old-age pensioner the home which he and his wife have, perhaps, struggled for a life-time to get together. No kind of a house can be secured in the cities for £100. If old people have a home worth, say, £300, and £.\ has to be deducted from their pensions for every £ 1 0 in the value of their property over £100 , it will practically mean that the pension will be useless to tbem.  mit that this amendment also involves an increased charge upon the revenue.",92

May I be permitted to explain why? opinion that the proposed omission makes no charge of any kind upon the revenue. The repeal of that section will merely permit persons who are inmates of certain institutions to become successful applicants for pensions. In this connection, I desire to draw attention to the difference between the wording of section 45 and section 47. The latter readsI f a successful claimant inmate of a benevolent asylum or other charitable institution, the pension shall become payable as from a date not more than twenty-eight days prior to the pensioner being discharged from or leaving the asylum or institution, but no payment on account of pension shall be made to him so long as he is an inmate of the nsylum or institution. The former clearly contemplates that a person must be a pensioner before he becomes an inmate of either of the institutions therein set out. On the other hand, section 47 declares that if at the time of making his claim he is an inmate of any such institution, he cannot receive a pension. He can become a successful claimant, but only from a date not more than twenty-eight days prior to his discharge. If , however, an inmate of one of these institutions chooses to leave it, and if he becomes a successful claimant to a pension, he can then return to the institution, and continue to draw his pension without let or hindrance. It is only if he is an inmate at the time he makes his claim, that he is barred from receiving the pension. There is not a word in the section which, in the circumstances I have outlined, would enable the Government to refuse to pay his pension.  under the operation of section 45?",93
783,Mr ROBERTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"No . That section is distinctly confined to asylums"" for the insane and to hospitals.",93
784,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is not in accordance with the regulations.,93
785,Mr ROBERTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,I do not know that a regulation can be framed which is not in conformity with the Act.,93
786,Mr HEDGES,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"But no payment can be made to any inmate of certain institutions, and it is obvious that if a pensioner returned to one of those institutions he would be an inmate of it.",93
787,Mr ROBERTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Certainl y not.

No proI am of vision in this Bill, or in the principal Act, would permit the Treasurer to stop the payment of his pension under such circumstances. The clause under consideration is an incentive to a petty form of deception.",93

791,Mr ROBERTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Perhaps the Treasurer does not grasp the meaning of the clause as it has been interpreted by the Attorney-General. I do not see why the provision should be retained. that if an inmate of one of the institutions which I have mentioned chose to remain an inmate of it whilst making his application for a pension, he would be debarred from receiving one. But if he left that institution and then made a successful claim, the pension must continue to be paid to him, irrespective of whether he returned to the institution or not.",94
792,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,Then there would be a. greater charge imposed upon the rean venue.,94

Under the circumstances, I feel justified in agreeing with the ruling of the Chairman. I enter my emphatic protest against paying over any moneys to public institutions. the application of a claimant be granted, his pension ought to be paid to him, spective of where he may live. As in'my view the clause is an absurdity, and can be evaded without increasing the charge upon the revenue, and as it offers incentive to a petty form of deof ception which we ought not to deny encourage, I . trust that the ruling the Chairman will be disagreed with.

Section 47 refers to a benevolent asylum or charitable institution, whilst 45 refers an asylum, for the insane or an hospital. Section 47 provides specifically that ment on account of pension shall be to a person who is an inmate of a charitable institution or benevolent asylum. clear to me that if the concluding sentence of section 47 is repealed it must involve an increase of expenditure, as it would involve stood. [58] the payment of pensions which, if the section is not repealed, would not be payable,",94
795,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Angas-Attorney-General) [3.50 a.m.] - Sectio n 45 deals with an inmate of an asylum for the insane. It must be clear that he could not be a claimant,, as a man who is out of his mind could not I repeat make an application for an old-age pension. Similarly, inmates of hospitals are understood to be persons incapacitated from attending to their ordinary duties, and so a person is not assumed to make an application for a pension, or he cannot receive a pension, while in a hospital. We are, however, dealing with normal people when we come to the successful claimants who are referred to in section 47. Where a sue- -* cessful claimant under that section makes application for a pension, it is provided that it shall become payable as from a cer- time. I take it that that means that it shall become payable in the sense fixed inby section 33, which declares the date for its commencement. It does not commence forthwith, but from a time which is not disto be more than twenty-eight days before the successful claimant leaves the institution. It might be from the day before he If leaves it, when he would get practicallynothing; but if it is fixed for a date a fortirrenight or three weeks before he leaves the institution there would probably be some accumulation, and, no doubt', the Minister would take the circumstances of an each case into account. One construction the words at the end Of section 47 would the right of any one who had successof fully made an application for a pension, while he was an inmate of a charitable institution, to be paid the pension while he remained an inmate of it. But if He is justiabout to be discharged the pension might by begin to be payable from twenty-eight days in a before his discharge, or from only one before his discharge, as decided b-y the Commissioner. Throughout the Act, where people live at home the intention clearly is to debar them from full pensions. For into stance 5s. per .week is debited against: the pensions of such persons on account other of board and lodging. If they are supto ported by their children they do not get any pension, if the support is adequateno payas good as the pension. Similarly, the inmade tention must have been that thoSe who are supported in benevolent institutions should It seems be paid no pensions.",94
796,Mr SPENCE,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,That is what I under,94
797,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"But the honourable mera.ber now wishes to strike outthat provision, and thus to increase the burdens on the public. The thing is absurd. The moment that provision was repealed the persons dealt with in section 47 would become entitled to pensions, and, in the circumstances, I think that the Chairman's ruling must be admitted to be correct.",95
798,Mr ROBERTS,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,But they would get a pension on leaving the institution.,95
799,Mr GLYNN,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"The honourable member contends that they could get a pension on leaving the institution, and could then go back to it again. Assuming that that construction is correct, if they did not leave it they would be a greater burden than if they did, and we are not to assume that they would leave the institution. Are we to decide whether or not this is a money Bill , and would involve an increase of the burdens on the public by a mere supposititious case such as the honourable member for Adelaide has put? I do not care what construction of the section is adopted, its repeal would involve an additional burden on the public.",95
800,Mr MAHON,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Coolgardie) [3.55 a.m.]. - Sectio n 47 is itself as ambiguous as some of the arguments that have been heard in connection with this amendment. For instance, a pension is payable to a man up to twenty-eight days prior to the time he is discharged from a benevolent asylum or charitable institution, yet, in trie same section, it is stipulated that he can get no pension while he is an ' inmate of the institution. If a person is twenty-eight days in a charitable institution, surely he is an inmate of the institution during that period? How is the Chairman of Committees to decide that the repeal of this section would involve an increased charge on the people ? Has he been supplied with any statistics as to the number of people in these institutions who are entitled to pensions for twenty-eight days prior to rheir discharge? Has he any idea of the number of people who would be qualified to receive pensions and are not inmates of these institutions? And, if he does not possess this information, how is he to say that the amendment will involve an increased charge on the people? With all clue respect, I contend that the decision of the Chairman of Committees is an arbitrary one, and it should not be upheld. I mean to say that it is arbitrary inasmuch as it has been given without any assigned reason. If we had any figures before us to show that the repeal of section 47 would involve increased expenditure, we should have to yield to the logic of facts; but it is mere guesswork for any one to say that the repeal of that section would increase the charge on the public. Perhaps the mover of the motion to disagree with the Chairman's ruling might agree to withdraw it temporarily, in order that I may move an amendment affecting section 45. I make the request because I presume that, after we have dealt with an amendment affecting section 47, I should be precluded from doing what I desire to do.",95

808,Mr FISHER,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,"Wide Bay) [4.28 a.m.] As there has been some criticism of the administration of the principal Act, I feel bound to express the opinion that the Government will administer both the Act and the amending legislation in the most sympathetic spirit. It should be made known as widely as possible that every officer acting under this law has been instructed to carry out his duties with proper regard for the feelings of pensioners and claimants for pensions. It is necessary to prevent undeserving persons from taking advantage of the provisions of the Act ; but inquiry should be made as to the possibility of withdrawing some of the questions which are now asked.

814,Sir JOHN FORREST,TARIFF ANOMALIES AND,It is usual to give explanations upon the motion for the sec >nd reading of a Bill.

In addition we hoped by that time to have entered into an arrangement with the States under which sufficient money would have been available to the Commonwealth to enable it to pay old-age pensions and to undertake an adequate defence scheme.

We have now entered upon a . new financial year, and it is that at the end of every month he we should pay into the fund any balance remaining from our one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise after the ordinary services of the Commonwealth have been provided for. The reason why so large an amount is asked for is that we may avoid the necessity of asking for an appropriation more often than is necessary. The fund will go on accumulating, I and Parliament will not be asked for further appropriation, until it is exhausted.",100

I undermemstand that the Treasurer does not purpose give appropriating any moneys other than the balance of surplus revenue at the end of the each month.

This resolution simply means money available at the expiration of each, month will be paid into the member fund. When I left the Treasury were paying in £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 per month. I want to know how much of the million pounds is likely to be obtained before the fund is exhausted. That can easily be ascertained by observing the amount of money that is paid in each month. The fund must be exhausted, especially with a declining revenue, eight or ten months fore the end of 1910. The House ought to know as soon as possible where the ance of the million pounds is coming from. The Prime Minister knows that when I was in office I worked out a scheme to get the money either by an overdraft for short period, or in some other way, so as carry us up to the end of 1910. Does Treasurer propose to adopt that scheme?If the money is to be provided from thesurplus of the general revenue, where is the money for the Postmaster-General'sDepartment to come from? If the Treasurer takes too much money for this purpose-and on a falling revenue, as I am. told it is, he will not have the same surplus as I anticipated would be obtainedand if he goes on increasing the amount of"" money for works in the Postmaster-General's Department, he will have to find somemethod of making up the inevitable deficit.",101

When I was Treasurer, I was badgered and abused becauseI could not provide more money for works. The Treasurer cannot find the necessary money unless he borrows it, or raises it by taxation, or reduces the expenditure on thePostmaster-General's Department. In view of the statement that an expenditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 is required to build up that Department properly, because of the way inI confess which it was starved in the past, how can the Government reduce the - expenditure on I ask the Government to state, before we appropriate the money, where it is",101
