2,Mr COSTELLO,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The measures contained in this bill will cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers from 1 July 2006. The tax cuts are another step in comprehensive tax reform that has seen income tax cut previously in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. From 1 July this year, the government will reduce the 47 and 42 per cent rates to 45 and 40 per cent respectively. This builds on reductions to lower income rates in earlier years. In addition, the government will increase the thresholds so that the 15 per cent rate will apply up to $25,000 of income, the 30 per cent rate will apply up to $75,000 of income, the 40 per cent rate up to $150,000 of income and the 45 per cent rate will apply to income above that. The government will cut the fringe benefits tax rate from 48.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent to ensure that the FBT rate aligns with the top marginal tax rate, including the Medicare levy. The low-income tax offset will be enhanced by increasing it from $235 to $600. It will begin to phase out at $25,000 from 1 July 2006, compared to $21,600 currently. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not pay tax until their annual income exceeds $10,000. The Medicare levy-low income phase-in rate will be cut from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, ensuring more low-income taxpayers pay a reduced rate of Medicare levy. BILL 2006 Senior Australians who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $24,867 for singles and up to $41,360 for couples. Overall, in percentage terms, the greatest tax cuts have been provided to low-income earners. These tax changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period. The increase in the 30 per cent threshold and the low-income tax offset will provide more incentive for those outside the workforce to re-enter it and those on part-time work to take additional hours. Moreover, a taxpayer will need to earn $121,500 to pay an average tax rate of 30 per cent. From 1 July 2006, the top marginal tax rate will apply to around two per cent of taxpayers. Taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal tax rate until they earn more than three times average weekly earnings. Reducing the top marginal tax rate and significantly increasing the top threshold will improve the competitiveness of Australia's tax system compared with other OECD countries. Australia's top marginal tax rate will be in line with the OECD average and the increase in the top threshold will place Australia 10th highest in the OECD. Six years ago, the threshold for the top marginal tax rate was $50,000. If the threshold for the top marginal tax rate had been indexed when this government came to office in 1996, it would have stood below $64,000 by 1 July this year. Under the government's reforms and this bill, by 1 July year that threshold will be $150,000. This package provides $36.7 billion of benefit to taxpayers over four years and reinforces Australia's reputation as a low-tax country. These tax cuts significantly restructure the personal income tax system, to increase disposable incomes, to enhance incentives for participation and to improve Australia's international competitiveness. Business tax Mr Speaker, this bill also implements the 2006-07 budget measure that will substantially improve Australia's depreciation arrangements by increasing the diminishing value rate for determining depreciation deductions from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. This will cut business tax by $3.7 billion over the next four years. The effect of the measure is to provide the equivalent of a 33 per cent increase in the allowable depreciation rate for all eligible assets. This will increase incentives for Australian business to invest in new plant and equipment and make it easier for businesses to keep pace with new technology and remain competitive. Investment is a key element of productivity growth and, therefore, of economic growth. The increased depreciation rates under the diminishing value method align depreciation deductions for tax purposes more closely with the actual decline in the economic value of an asset, which will lead to improved resource allocation in the economy. This is consistent with the government's tax policy strategy of ensuring that the tax system has minimal effect on the allocation of resources in the economy. The measure will apply to assets acquired on or after 10 May 2006 and includes appropriate integrity measures to ensure assets this held prior to that date are not able to be brought into the new arrangements. Full details of these measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. EXCISE LAWS AMENDMENT (FUEL NA MEASURES) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
3,Mr DUTTON,TAX REFORM AND OTHER,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.08 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill, along with the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, gives effect to the government's announcement in its energy white paper Securing Australia's Energy Future of 15 June 2004. The current complex system of fuel tax concessions will be replaced by a single fuel tax credit system from 1 July 2006. In particular, the decision to remove effective excise from burner fuels resulted in the need to amend the excise tariff and the customs tariff for imported equivalent products. This bill makes changes to the Excise Act 1901 so that the mechanism of fuel tax relief for eligible users is through the fuel tax credit system legislated through the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and not through concessions within the excise system. The companion bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, removes the various rates that apply to fuel and replaces them with only two rates-one for aviation fuels, which are not part of the fuel tax credit tem, and one for other fuels. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 make complementary changes to customs legislation so that the imported fuels receive the same treatment as locally produced fuel. Both the excise and customs legislation are unlike other taxing legislation in that a fundamental principle of the legislation is control of the revenue authority over goods that are in scope. Where possible and within this constraint, requirements that are redundant or inconsistent with modern business practice are removed. In certain other cases, this concept of control is drawn upon in measures to protect the revenue. The bill clarifies the arrangements for using imported inputs to excise manufacture. In conjunction with complementary changes in the customs bills the import duty that would be payable on imported goods, that would be excisable if manufactured in Australia, is extinguished when the imported goods are used to manufacture, in Australia, excisable goods. The import duty is extinguished when an excise liability is created. This will vide a seamless transition from the customs regime to the excise regime for imported products used in excise manufacture while protecting the revenue. The arrangements for concessional spirits-that is, spirits that are free of duty because they will be used for certain purposes (other than making excisable beverages)are streamlined. The complex arrangements that are currently contained in the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the Excise Act 1901, the Spirits Act 1906 and the Distillation Act 1901 and the relevant regulations are replaced with simpler provisions in the Excise Tariff Act and the Excise Act. The new arsys- rangements do not change the eligible uses of concessional spirit but streamline the administration and clarify the factors under which spirits do not attract excise duty. Changes are made to the licensing regime so that all excise licences will now have an expiry date and application for renewal must be made. This means some licences that currently do not expire will now expire every three years and that current licences that expire every year will expire every three years. the This is a balance between reducing the burden on business and protecting the revenue. There are also changes to the factors that can be taken into account when deciding to grant or cancel a licence. These factors build on existing factors that are directed at ensuring persons who would be likely to pose a risk in terms of whether all excisable goods or tobacco leaf is correctly accounted for are kept out of the excise system. Tobacco plants, leaf and seed are not excisable but their production is directed towards producing excisable tobacco. Controls are necessary to ensure that tobacco does not enter the illicit market. Provisions ensuring that tobacco leaf is correctly accounted for have been amended to provide clarity and alignment pro- with controls on excisable goods. The bill also amends the Excise Act 1901 in a number of areas to reduce a number of prescriptive and interventionist requirements that are no longer in step with modern administration. For example, the current legislation contains complex rules for establishing the volume of beer. This is replaced by a provision that the CEO may make determinations on rules for measuring quantities, weights and strengths of excisable goods. This will allow the ATO to recognise changes in commercial business operations and adopt industry standards for measuring excisable goods. The ATO will actively consult with affected industry in determining such rules. The bill repeals the following acts: the Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act 1997, the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997, the Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997 and the Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997. The introduction of the fuel tax credit system will mean that the penalty surcharges system is no longer required. The Coal Excise Act 1949 is also repealed. Coal has attracted a free rate of excise since 1992 but coal producers have been required to be licensed and keep records and provide returns relating to coal production. The companion bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, removes coal from the schedule of excisable goods and so it is no longer necessary to have the controls provided for in the Coal Excise Act 1949. The Distillation Act 1901 and the Spirits Act 1906 are also repealed. These acts contain provisions relating to the manufacture of spirits. Many of the provisions are already adequately covered in the Excise Act as the manufacture of spirits also is the manufacture of excisable goods. Certain provisions required to protect the revenue or ensure product standards are inserted into the Excise Act 1901. These include provisions for the maturation of brandy, whisky and rum. The bill also provides for a grant Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Act 2004 for renewable diesel manufactured through a process of hydrogenating animal fats or vegetable oils. This will ensure that fuel produced by this process will receive the same effective tax treatment as biodiesel. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (FUEL NA MEASURES) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
4,Mr DUTTON,TAX REFORM AND OTHER,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.17 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is a companion bill to the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. This bill makes changes to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 so that the mechanism of fuel tax relief for eligible users is through the fuel tax credit system, legislated through the Fuel Tax Bill 2006, and not through concessions within the excise system. In particular, the fuel items in the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 are amended so that there are only two rates of duty, one for aviation fuel and one for other fuels. In conjunction with the fuel tax credit system this will remove the effective excise on burner fuels and provide effective excise relief for a wide range of business users of fuel, including where fuel under the is used other than as a fuel. The fuel items of the tariff are also amended to recognise that fuels can now be manufactured from sources other than petroleum, oil shale or coal. This bill streamlines the existing schedule by removing redundant provisions and also removes certain free items where the items are for use by certain third parties. These concessions will still be available to those third parties through changes to the Excise Regulations 1926. There will be no changes to the eligibility for these concessions except for a tightening of conditions under which tobacco can be used, free of excise duty, for research purposes. The changes are directed at simplifying the schedule and making it, as far as possible, concerned with classifying goods and not providing concessional rates in the schedule. The excise rate for snuff tobacco is aligned with the rate for other tobacco. Snuff is not manufactured in Australia; however the complementary changes in the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 will ensure that importers of snuff tobacco pay the same duty as other tobacco users. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum already presented. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned.

5,Mr DUTTON,TAX REFORM AND OTHER,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.19 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 contains several amendments to the Customs Act 1901 (the act). This bill is part of a package of bills dealing with fuel tax and excise reform. First, the bill will repeal provisions in the Customs Act designed to address fuel penalty surcharge legislation. These amendments will ensure that the act is consistent with the government's proposals to replace all existing rebates and subsidies for fuel products, including concessional and free rates of duty, with a fuel tax credit scheme. Secondly, the bill will amend the act to strengthen and clarify the compliance and other arrangements that apply to the use of imported excise equivalent goods in the manufacture of excisable goods. These amendments will ensure that the revenue is more adequately protected, and will bring existing practices into line with the conditions under the Excise Act 1901. The bill will establish that the manufacture of excisable goods may occur in a customs warehouse and will provide that such manufacture using excise equivalent goods must occur at a place licensed under both customs and excise legislation. The bill will also establish that customs control of excise equivalent goods continues until such a time that an excisable liability has been created under the Excise Act, or the goods are entered into home consumption and relevant duties paid, or the goods are exported. Other amendments will identify when liability is extinguished for customs duty on excise equivalent goods used in excise manufacture, and how owners of these goods will account for such goods to Customs. The bill will include a provision that deals with the maturation period of certain imported spirits. This provision currently resides in the Spirits Act 1906, which will be repealed by the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006.

6,Mr DUTTON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.22 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the customs tariff) - a These amendments implement changes that are complementary to amendments contained in the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, and are part of a package of bills dealing with fuel tax and excise reform. Schedule 1 of the bill contains amendments to the customs tariff to decrease the customs duty applied to aviation turbine fuel (kerosene) and aviation gasoline. These measures were previously tabled in the House of Representatives in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 of 2005 and took effect from 1 November 2005. They now require incorporation in the Customs Tariff Act. Complementary changes are being made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 through the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. Schedule 2 of the bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to complement amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and to reflect amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. In brief, the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act impose a uniform rate of customs duty of 38.143c per litre on most fuel products. The amendments also remove a number of redundant provisions from the customs tariff, including the duty differentials for petroleum products based on container size, sulphur content, and whether a petroleum product contains a fuel marker. Schedule 2 of the bill also contains a number of related consequential amendments to the customs tariff to ensure that it aligns with the excise tariff. This includes aligning the rate of snuff with the ordinary tobacco rate. Schedule 2 of the bill also includes some technical changes that are of a minor or machinery nature. These include: change to the definition of mead to ensure greater consistency with the wine equalisation tax legislation; - a change of classification for biodiesel to ensure conformity with a World Customs Organisation classification decision; and - amendments to definitions of beer to align with the excise tariff definition and clarify when the different rates of customs duty apply for different types of beer. Finally, schedule 2 of the bill incorporates a range of measures designed to strengthen customs control over certain goods that are used in excise manufacture. These include the repeal of concessional items 44 and 67 of schedule 4 to the customs tariff. These items currently provide the mechanism for excise manufacturers that use excise equivalent goods-petrol, alcohol and tobacco-to remit their customs duty liabilities, except for ad valorem duty on certain spirit and fuel products. The bill will also attach a rate of customs duty of $290.74 per kilogram to tobacco leaf (not stemmed or stripped) to ensure that if any leaf is not accounted for before excise manufacture, Customs has the legislative ability to recover the appropriate duties. The Australian Taxation Office already has that ability through section 105 of the Excise Act 1921. Debate (on motion by Mr Griffin) adjourned. NA BILL (No. 3) 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill and read a first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.26 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2006. It is a very straightforward bill. The amendments provided for in this bill are necessary to allow or require manufacturers of medicines, blood and tissues to apply for a manufacturing licence electronically using the TGA's e-business system. As a result of the implementation of this amendment, manufacturers will be able to monitor progress with their licence applications and electronically submit requests for changes to their licences. Paragraph 37(1)(a) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 currently specifies that an application for a manufacturing licence must be made in writing in accordance with a form approved by the secretary. In October 2004, the TGA implemented a new computerised system for managing licence applications, the conduct of good manufacturing practice audits and other licence issues. This new Manufacturer Information System (MIS) was designed to allow for electronic licence application. This amendment is required to enable this function to be utilised. It is expected that the majority of applications for manufacturing licences will be lodged electronically. The electronic licence application does not require any information beyond that already required by the approved paper application. The electronic application form is also designed to allow documentation requested to accompany the application to be submitted electronically. Electronic applications for manufacturing licences will facilitate the speedy submission of applications by manufacturers and the efficient handling of applications by the TGA. Debate (on motion by Mr Griffin) adjourned. NA (DESIGNATED UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Robb. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
7,Mr ROBB,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (9.28 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. On 13 April 2006 the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced the government's decision to introduce legislation as soon as possible to further strengthen border control measures in relation to unauthorised boat arrivals. The amendments proposed in this bill will give effect to that decision. The offshore processing arrangements introduced in October 2001 have been an outstanding success in ensuring that the integrity of Australia's borders can be maintained, while preserving Australia's strong commitment to refugee protection. Under the existing arrangements, unauthorised arrivals at certain offshore parts of Australia which have been identified as ‘excised offshore places' are prevented from making valid applications for visas, including protection visas, in Australia, unless the minister considers such an application to be in the public interest. Such persons may be removed to a declared country outside Australia for processing of any claims that they are owed refugee protection under the refugees convention as amended by the refugees protocol. These arrangements have proven their worth. However, it is important that Australia continually review its policy and legislation in this critical area to ensure that proper arrangements are in place to deal with new developments. Border protection requires continued vigilance and the government has formed the view that there should be some redefining of the persons to whom the offshore processing arrangements will apply. It seems incongruous that an unauthorised boat arrival at an excised offshore place is subject to offshore processing arrangements, while an unauthorised boat arrival travelling, in some cases, only a few kilometres further to the Australian mainland is able to access the onshore protection arrangements, with the consequential opportunities for protracted merits review and litigation processes. The landing on mainland Australia of a group of unauthorised boat arrivals from Indonesia in January 2006 highlighted this incongruous outcome. The essence of this bill therefore is to broaden the group of people to whom offshore processing arrangements will apply. This expanded group, referred to as ‘designated unauthorised arrivals', will include the existing group of people who arrive unauthorised at offshore entry places. It will also include persons arriving unauthorised by boat on the Australian mainland. The introduction of the offshore processing arrangements in 2001 was greeted in some quarters with a degree of concern and criticism. Some claimed the offshore processing arrangements were a sign of Australia resiling from its international obligations. Nothing can be further from the truth. Since 2001, there have been 1,547 people processed offshore under these arrangements. All had access to reliable refugee assessment processes, undertaken either by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or by trained Australian officers. Not one person found to be a refugee in the offshore processes has been forced to return to their homeland. This record has demonstrated that the government has delivered on its obligations under the refugees convention to all of the people processed under those arrangements. It is important to note that the key elements of the original offshore processing arrangements which guarantee the proper care and protection for asylum seekers, and their access to a reliable refugee assessment process, will continue for the new group of designated unauthorised arrivals. Such persons may only be sent for offshore processing to declared countries. The minister may only declare a country where satisfied that it will provide a place of safety for asylum seekers, where their refugee claims can be assessed, and from which resettlement or voluntary return of refugees can be arranged. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the offshore processing centre on Nauru is available to house and care for any new groups being transferred offshore for processing under the proposed legislation. The Australian government will ensure the continued access by any such people to a reliable refugee assessment process. If necessary, Australian officers are available to conduct this work using arrangements originally developed in consultation with the UNHCR and modelled closely on the process used by UNHCR itself. In line with the existing offshore arrangements, any person found to be owed refugee protection will be able to remain safe in the offshore processing location while resettlement is arranged. It is important to note that the refugees convention does not prescribe the processes which signatory states must follow to identify refugees. The convention also does not establish an entitlement for asylum seekers to choose the country in which their claims will be assessed or in which protection will be provided. These are issues for sovereign states to settle. The existing provisions which allow a person being processed offshore to be brought to Australia for a temporary purpose, such as to receive medical treatment, will continue in respect of designated unauthorised arrivals. The right for such a person, they have remained in Australia for more than six months, to request an assessment by the Refugee Review Tribunal of their refugee claims, will also continue. The bill will introduce a requirement for the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to report annually on offshore processing arrangements and refugee assessment outcomes, and for these reports to be tabled in both houses of parliament. Certain persons not intended to be caught by the offshore processing arrangements will be exempted from the definition of designated unauthorised arrivals. These include New Zealand citizens, permanent residents of Norfolk Island and persons brought to Australia purely for Customs Act purposes. The bill also allows the minister to declare that specified persons or classes of persons are exempt. This will provide flexibility to avoid the arrangements being extended to those not intended to be covered by the changes. Sound border management requires such flexibility, recognising the range of complex circumstances that can apply to a person's arrival in Australia without a visa. For example, a person who has been medically evacuated from a commercial vessel at sea, and who has inadvertently engaged these provisions by arriving in Australia without a visa, could be such a case. The person may have had no intention to come to Australia, and their circumstances may warrant a more flexible approach. In announcing these changes on 13 April the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs made it clear that the new legislation would apply to people arriving from that date, and that any new boat arrivals from that date can expect to be processed offshore. If a person arrives unauthorised by boat on if or after 13 April 2006 and has a visa application still on hand when the bill commences, that visa application will become invalid. In such cases, the individual will be liable for transfer offshore for processing of any asylum claims, as foreshadowed in the announcement. The legislation will not affect the visa status of any person who has arrived in mainland Australia before 13 April 2006. Any applications for visas lodged in Australia by such persons will continue to be processed in Australia in the normal manner. This bill marks an important strengthening of Australia's border control measures. It strengthens our capacity to deal sensibly and flexibly with unauthorised boat arrivals. The changes proposed in the legislation reflect the government's continuing focus on ensuring that there are appropriate and effective capabilities in place to manage our borders and preserve Australia's sovereignty. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed from 10 May.",27
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,The question is that amendments (1) to (19) and (22) moved by the member for Calare be agreed to.,30
9,Mr GRIFFIN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Bruce) (9.38 am)Following on from some of the debate last night with respect to these particular amendments, which relate to the eligibility of prisoners to be able to cast a vote, and also the question of the closure of the electoral roll at the time of the issuing of the writs, I want to put on record our position on the issue of prisoner voting. Labor do not support the amendment proposed by the government, but we support the amendment proposed by the member for Calare. We believe the current arrangement, whereby prisoners serving a full-time sentence of three years or less retain the right to vote in federal elections, is adequate for the simple reason that, as these people may well re-enter society during a government's term, they should have their democratic say in who will be in government at that time. We believe this is a logical approach and a far better one than the one proposed by the government. I note the Special Minister of State trotted out a number of examples which, allegedly, we are in line with by going down this particular track. There is also, as he knows, a range of other examples which are, in fact, contrary to that. It is a situation designed for a political outcome, just as this legislation's entire basis has been from the very beginning. What we have seen with this legislation, as others have said, is an attempt to bring into place, because of the circumstances in the Senate, an agenda that this government has had for quite some time with regard to a range of issues. I want to continue on from the question of the closure of the electoral roll and to pick up on a couple of points again that the Special Minister of State at the table made yesterday in response to the second reading debate. He gave a rather detailed, analytical series of figures-for a minute there I thought I was listening to Brendan Nelson-regarding the issue of enrolments and changes to enrolments et cetera. I do not accept all of his figures, as much as I have a good deal of respect for the minister, but the fact of the matter is that, even if we just go off his own figures, ‘the number of electors then that may have been affected under the proposed arrangements is close to 47,000'. That is 47,000 Australians, which is about half a federal electorate. That is the figure we are talking about here, if we accept the position of the minister and the government. They are happy to create a situation where the odds are that they will knock out half a federal electorate by these changes on the basis of concerns about what might happen but which the previous minister has said has not happened and that is any question of large-scale fraud. My recollection is that only one group outside the government came forth to the Senate inquiry to defend the position of the government on some of these issues. That was that well-known expert on electoral matters, the Festival of Light. Let the light shine on them when it comes to their actually assisting a government to move down to a system which is less democratic. For that, they stand condemned. A couple of other points I would like to make on the closure of the roll issue go beyond the question of some of the figures that the minister produced last night. I reiterate that numerous experts have made the point that young people will be seriously disadvantaged by these changes. The minister in his speech does not really refute that. He merely makes the point that it is not politically motivated because the electoral studies show that a significant percentage of young people-in fact, 41 per cent or so according to the study-actually voted for the conservatives. Again, this is legislation designed to ensure that when the coalition is not going so well it has that little bit of extra fuel in the tank to get over the line. Let us be really clear about that. In normal circumstances that same study shows that young people do not support the coalition, and have not supported the coalition historically, and that is why they have in this place. Yesterday I quoted on a number of occasions Professor Brian Costar with regard to this issue. He makes a point on the need to involve young people. We have a problem, and it is not just an Australian problem but a problem internationally, of engagement in electoral systems-engagement in the politics of the day. That is particularly an issue for young people. If we move to a situation where we make it even more difficult for young people to be involved, it is going to create additional problems for the system. Professor Costar said: Good reasons would need to be adduced to justify the denial of the vote to such a larger cohort of citizens; especially the new enrolees, most of whom would be young people, who need encouragement to become civically engaged. (Time expired)",30
10,Mr NAIRN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The government does oppose these amendments to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2005 as outlined in the debate yesterday. I think it appropriate that I make a few additional comments, given some of the comments made by the member for Bruce and the member for Banks yesterday particularly in relation to young people. The member for Bruce just said that I did not refute the fact that young people might be disenfranchised. I did not say that at all. I certainly pointed out the facts and most of the facts that he seems to question come straight from the Australian Electoral Commission. But be that as it may. I thought it would be appropriate to indicate that. The member for Banks seemed to be suggesting that young people are not engaged in the political process. I thought the House should understand what is happening in engaging young people in the political process. The AEC's divisional returning officers and other staff in the divisions conduct educational activities for primary, secondary and tertiary students upon request. The sessions cover subjects such as levels of government, voting procedures, elections and enrolment. The School and Community Visits Program also targets specific audiences, including new citizens and Indigenous and non-English-speaking groups. The AEC provides professional development workshops for teachers as well as resources on electoral matters. There are four electoral education centres-at Old Parliament House here in Canberra, in Melbourne, in Adelaide and in Perth. These centres are visited by thousands of students every year for education sessions. These include information on the history of voting, details on voting in Australia and conducting mock elections. The divisional officers have had 59,261 participants in their workshops to date in 2005-06, and there were 84,911 in 2004-05. In 2004-05 the electoral education centres had 108,493 students and accompanying adults participate in over 2,857 sessions. Information available for sessions conducted so far in 2005-06 at the Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne centres is that 55,290 people participated in 1,661 sessions. The Electoral Commission is doing huge things to engage young people, and it is progressing to having them on the roll because young people get on the roll when they are at school. More and more students stay at school through to year 12. They get on the roll when they are 17, so they are automatically on the roll for voting purposes the day they turn 18 without their doing anything. It is interesting that at the close of the roll September 2004, before the last election, there were 65,139 provisionally enrolled 17year-olds. Of the 65,139 provisionally enrolled 17-year-olds at the close of the roll, 13,803 turned 18 on or before 9 October 2004, so they automatically went on the roll. So much for the so-called disenfranchising that the Labor Party and others claim is happening. It is also interesting to look at the figures of young people in the days leading up to the election. Like the facts that I gave yesterday, no matter whether you know the election is happening a week ahead, 10 days ahead or four years ahead-the states have fixed dates, so you know four years ahead-the bulk of the people getting on the roll towards election day get on in the last two days. No matter whether the election is 10 days, 20 days or four years ahead, the bulk of people do it in the last couple of days. There is a lot of speculation and a lot of advertising about elections and people leave it until the last minute. It does not matter if you close the roll well before or not, there will still be that rush and this bill allows people more than those couple of days to be able to get on the roll. This is contrary to what the member for the Northern Territory, who did not understand the bill, said. He said that the roll was going to be closed on the day the election was called. That is not what is in the bill. The roll will be closed on the day the writs are issued. The writs are issued often several days after the announcement of the election. For young people, it is the same thing. The bulk of them enrol in the last two days. Something like 70 per cent of what goes on in the last week happens in the last couple of days. We continue to oppose these amendments. (Time expired)",31
11,Mr GRIFFIN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I want to pick up on a couple of points the Special on 7 Minister of State just made. He quoted a range of figures and details with respect to actions of the AEC. I suggest he goes back to the AEC web site and has a look at the Youth electoral study, an AEC publication, and at what that says about the involvement of young people in the electoral process and how they feel about the nature of their place in the political system in this country. I will give him a couple of quotes from that report just in case he does not have time to read it-I know he is a busy man. A key point is: Young people don't understand the voting system. In addition, the report asserts: Young people do not perceive themselves generally as well prepared to participate in voting. If he goes to that report, he will find a range of other points. One of the reasons the AEC is involved in education of the voting system, which I support wholeheartedly, is that there is a problem. That is why they are doing it-because it needs to be done-and the response of this government is to set up a situation where it becomes harder for those people to be part of the process. The minister makes the point that a lot of people change their enrolment details late. Yes, that is true, because it is one of those things which people do when they feel they have to do it. The nature of having to do something like enrol, or ensure your enrolment is up to date, relates to the question of when you have to vote and when the roll closes. If you take time off that, people will miss out. The minister uses terms like ‘the bulk'. He is right about that-the bulk of people will be okay-but there will be a sizeable component who will not be. The further you close down those time lines the greater that number will be. He makes the point that it does not even matter whether you have a fixed-term government there is still a late rush. There is, but with fixed terms there is a long period of time beforehand when you know when the election is going to be and you know when the roll will cut out, and your electoral system can adjust accordingly. You can through your electoral bodies advertise to ensure people are aware. You can ensure through newspapers, television and radio that people know the date and know they have to do it. But in these situations we are relying on the fact that the AEC is going to come up with a whiz-bang campaign. I would like the minister to point out to me where in the budget papers it shows this massive increase in funding for the AEC to provide for advertising campaigns to ensure that the electorate is aware, once the election is called, that the roll will close within a matter of days. I would like him to show me where that massive increase is in the AEC's budget, because I could not find it. I challenge the minister to show us where that massive increase is in the AEC budget that will provide the information to ensure that people are aware that the roll is closing. There is another point with respect to that. You can have a campaign ready to go, but you cannot go with that campaign until you are fairly confident that the election will be called. If the term is a three-year term, as we have, in normal circumstances once you get up to about two years and nine months you would say, ‘It's not far off, you better start advertising.' Of course, you still would not have the date. Let us have a look at the nature of election timing in this country. In recent times we have had a couple of governments that have run three years, but history indicates that not to be the case and that many elections are called early. This Prime Minister called the 1998, the 2001 and the 2004 elections. They are the three elections that he as Prime Minister has had responsibility for setting the dates. One of those was massively early; two were on time. So his record so far is one in three. That record would not have allowed-there is no way known-the AEC setting up an enrolment campaign 12 months out from an election due to be called. So it would not have worked in those circumstances. Is the minister right that people overwhelmingly do these things late? Yes. It is like everything else. When do you tend to pay your bankcard bill? You tend to pay it close to the date when it is due. When do you pay other bills? You tend to pay them-or I do-close to when they are due because essentially that is when you have to do it. But, under this system, people will have less time to be sure about what is going on. Again, it is not just my opinion on this. (Time expired)",32
12,Mr WINDSOR,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I raise a couple of points in this consideration in detail debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The member for Bruce commented a moment ago about elections being called at particular times. One thing that may well alleviate that problem would be to move to fixed terms in the federal parliament. I was involved in the early nineties in a hung parliament in New South Wales and the Independents in that parliament were instrumental in putting in place a four-year fixed term within the New South Wales jurisdiction. I do not think anybody on either side of the New South Wales parliament-it was a Liberal government in power at the time-would now argue that they revert to the old system. It addressed the uncertainty that the member for Bruce talked about of when an election could be held and a whole range of administrative problems with the Electoral Commission and people knowing when things are happening. The Special Minister of State spoke earlier about young people. Minister, one of the problems that young people whom I am in contact with have with the political process is that they see failing transparency in the way in which particularly the executive of government is run. This bill adds to that problem, in my view. Donations will be able to be hidden away in various associated entities and other bodies. The transparency of the donation process in particular will be much greyer, and I think that disillusions people who would like to engage in the political process. They really need to know who is paying the piper in terms of political donations. My main purpose for rising at this stage of the debate is to put on the public record that I will not be supporting two of the amendments that the member for Calare has moved. It is a shame that they are bulked together. I do not believe that prisonerspeople who have broken the law and are incarcerated-deserve the vote, but I place on the public record that I do support the sevenday rule that the member for Calare is arguing for. Arguments have been put in the last 10 minutes that actually support that, including an argument from the minister when he said that it is within the last few days that people become aware and then register. His argument is that, if you make it any two days, they will do it in the last few days. I think the seven-day rule deserves support-I know it will be defeated here-but I do feel strongly about the two issues, the prisoner issue and the seven-day rule, being bracketed together and I will not be supporting the member for Calare.",34

(6) Calculations under subsection (4): (a) are to be made using only the March index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and (b) are to be made disregarding March index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published March index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base). (7) In this section: indexation year means the financial year commencing on 1 July 2006, and each subsequent financial year. March index number means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of the 3 months ending on 31 March.

(59) Schedule 2, item 17, page 40 (lines 21-22), omit item. The remainder of my amendments focus on improving the integrity of our electoral sysomit tem and removing the contradiction inherent in the title of the Electoral and Referendum omit Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2005, given its outrageous omit provisions. Amendments (20), (21) and (23) to (35) improve the transparency of the Senate voting system by re-empowering the voter by putting control of their preferences omit back into their hands by removing abovethe-line voting and installing a partial preferential system of voting for Senate candidates. I have proposed that, with the removal of omit the option to vote above the line, all Senate candidates are listed individually but the voter need only mark preferences for the candidates equal to the number of vacant Senate seats for a formal Senate vote. In the case of a half-Senate election, this will be six 6), preferences for a formal vote. If the voter wants to indicate additional preferences, they 8), may do so without invalidating their vote. The voter retains control of their preferences, and the disincentive of being compelled to vote for 73 candidates, as was the case in the 2004 election in New South Wales, is removed. The AEC's figures confirm that the large fields of candidates in Senate elections are a disincentive for voters to direct their own preferences, with 96 per cent of voters voting above the line at the 2004 election. Using this system for electing the Senate will eliminate behind the scenes preference deals between parties and groups running above the line, which allows the harvesting of preferences to deliver seats to candidates with 33), omit extremely low primary votes. We have heard a lot in recent times and as recently as late yesterday about transparency, accountability and the disenchantment of people with the voting system. One of the primary causes of that disenchantment is a Senate voting process that most Australians do not understand. I believe that, after the last election, they were absolutely dismayed at the direction in which preferences that they did not allocate but that were allocated on their behalf flowed and finished up. The obvious example is that of the Family First candidate's election with just over two per cent of the primary vote. Preference voting above the line would have been at least an interim reform on the way to the fairer system I propose here, but that of course was rejected by the government because it had a hint of voter free choice about it-so much for integrity. Amendment (37) inserts a new section, 294A, which imposes a cap on election campaign expenditure by or on behalf of a candidate for the House of Representatives or the Senate. This cap is set at $50,000 and will be indexed to the CPI. Consideration is given to larger electorates as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal in regard to the entitlements of office. These electorates will have a cap of $72,500. The Commonwealth Electoral Act did contain a campaign expenditure limit for individual candidates, which was repealed in 1980, ostensibly because spending by others-that is, political parties and other third party organisations-made the cap irrelevant. My amendments include all expenditure in relation to a candidate's campaign, regardless of who is spending the money. I must direct the attention of members of this House to overseas examples of the imposition of a spending cap, which is very basic to achieving a level playing field for all those who may wish to run for public office. All expenditure must be authorised under these amendments by the candidate-again, regardless of where the money is coming from-and it must be disclosed in election returns, with penalties for any contraventions. Amendment (36) complements this cap. The public funding a candidate receives for their share of first preference votes will be capped at $50,000 and at $72,500 for larger electorates to further discourage candidates from disregarding the campaign cap and avoid profiteering from elections. Not only will these amendments level the field for all candidates, party endorsed or not, but they will also halt the great waste of money, public and private, on election campaigns that is heading towards a US scenario where you are not even a starter without a multimillion dollar campaign fund, and the end result is heading towards the very best democracy money can buy. Finally, my amendments (38) to (59) remove this government's flagrant attempt to improve their fundraising capacity by increasing the disclosure threshold from its current $1,500 to $10,000. The then Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, believed that with this new disclosure limit 80 per cent of donations will still be disclosed. (Extension of time granted). This, however, is only 80 per cent of those receipts described as donations by political parties, which is far from their total income. If 80 per cent of donations are above $10,000, it proves my point that fundraising is getting way out of hand and is way beyond the capacity of the ordinary would be member of parliament trying to run as an Independent or with a smaller party or group, if that be the case. The massive increase proposed in this bill will simply make it easier for individuals and organisations to contribute more money without having to tell anyone. Pure and simple, it means influence can be bought without anyone ever knowing, and it conveniently squeezes smaller parties and individual candidates out of the equation. Electoral integrity-what rot! Disclosure is not about convenience to donors or those that receive donations; it should be about transparency. It is essential for voters to be able to determine also who a candidate represents-their constituents or their donors. My amendments install a disclosure threshold of $200 on political donations to help achieve this aim. I commend them to the House, knowing what their outcome will be.",36
16,Mr NAIRN,NOES,"The government will oppose all of these amendments to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Amendments (20), (21) and (23) to (35) would repeal several sections of the Electoral Act, including section 211 and others, which would remove the capacity to allow group voting tickets. This would mean a return to pre-1983 style voting, with no above-the-line or below-the-line voting. The government is considering the recommendation for compulsory preferential above-theline voting in Senate elections which was made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 2004 federal election. The committee also recommended that the option of compulsory preferential below-the-line voting be retained. Consideration of these amendments would pre-empt the government's response to the joint standing committee's recommendations. Amendment (37) appears to contradict the original objective of the scheme, which sought to provide public funding to cover the costs of contesting an election and to reduce the need for parties and candidates to rely on donations to participate in elections. Amendment (38) is likely to increase the administraditure tive burden on candidates and parties. Sections 304 and 309 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act currently place a disclosure obligation on candidates and allow endorsed candidates to submit a nil return as their nations and expenditure are disclosed in the party's annual return. This amendment would impose a second disclosure obligation on candidates so that candidates would effectively have to lodge two disclosure returns for a single disclosure period. The disclosure returns would largely report the same expenditure except that the proposed amendment does not contain a disclosure threshold. The requirement that all expenditure on behalf of, or gifts or donations to, a candidate must be with the written authority of the candidate may place a cumbersome administrative burden on both candidates and donors. The requirement may also result in fewer gifts being made directly to candidates if donors are unable to acquire written authority in advance to make a gift. Much electoral expenditure-for example, advertising-is undertaken by a party as a whole or by campaign committees and benefits more than one candidate. This amendment would place an administrative burden on candidates and parties to apportion expenditure to individual candidates and ensure written authority from all affected candidates. The proposed amendment would also reduce transparency as returns would only be required to be publicly available for a period of six months after being received by the Australian Electoral Commission. There is no limit on the public availability of candidate returns under the existing section 304. We oppose amendments (39) to (41) and (43) to (45). Similarly, we oppose amendments (42), (46) and (47). The government considers that the current provisions place an unnecessary administrative burden on publishing and broadcasting businesses. Expenon electoral advertising is already disclosed by individuals and organisations that authorise the advertisements, as required by other provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The government obviously does do- not support amendments (48), (50) and (63). It considers that the proposed threshold is appropriate on the basis that the current threshold was too low when it was originally set and has since been eroded by inflation. The government is of the view that the support and contribution of political parties is critical to the health of Australian democracy and merits some recognition at a significantly greater level than currently. Statistics provided by the Australian Electoral Commission show that 10 per cent of the donations reported by donors for 2004-05 were under $10,000 and 62 per cent were over $10,000. The member for Calare talked about 80 per cent of donations, but the figure of 81 per cent that I used in summing up was in fact for all other parties, including Independents et cetera. All private funding would be disclosed under these provisions. Disclosure is an interesting aspect. I should point out that these disclosure provisions are a minimum requirement and anybody will be free to disclose donations below $10,000 if they so choose. The opposition have been against this as well so, come the next election, it will be interesting to see whether will disclose donations under $10,000 or accept the threshold of $10,000. (Time expired)",42
17,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"I rise to support the member for Calare. The very reasons why these amendments to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2005 should be supported have just been articulated by the Special Minister of State. The minister talks about transparency; the amendments deliver a degree of transparency. The minister talks about the accountability of the process; the amendments deliver that, particularly in relation to the disclosure of donations but also through the simplification of the Senate voting process and through the cap on expenditure. I think these amendments deliver positively in terms of the integrity of the electoral process. The minister has just said he believes the current bill and the government's amendments will give greater disclosure-and I am pleased to note that the Attorney-General is in the chamber. I am not sure whether the Attorney-General was listening last night when I spent some time talking about the Australian Electoral Commission currently investigating Mr Greg Maguire, a businessman from Tamworth who was involved in the allegations of bribery involving the member for Gwydir and Senator Sandy Macdonald, but he ought to be aware of that. The Australian Electoral Commission is investigating claims made under oath by Mr Maguire in terms of political donations. I would ask the Attorney-General to look very closely at the integrity of the processes the minister has talked about-the integrity of the Senate and the integrity of the legal process involved in being sworn under oath and committing to provide certain information they under oath in terms of the Electoral Commission. If the minister at the table, Minister Nairn, is serious about honesty in terms of disclosure, we have to make sure the Electoral Commission looks seriously at these issues.",43

21,Mr NAIRN,NOES,"by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill, and I move government amendments (1) to (17) together: (1) Schedule 1, item 84, page 22 (lines 29 and 30), omit subparagraph 314AEB(1)(a)(i), substitute: (i) the public expression of views on a political party, a candidate in an election or a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate by any means; (2) Schedule 1, item 84, page 23 (lines 8 and 9), omit subparagraph 314AEB(1)(a)(iv), substitute: (iv) the broadcast of political matter in relation to which particulars are required to be announced under subclause 4(2) of Schedule 2 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992; (3) Schedule 1, item 84, page 23 (line 18), omit subparagraph 314AEB(1)(c)(iii), substitute: (iii) the Commonwealth (including a Department of the Commonwealth, an Executive Agency or a Statutory Agency (within the meaning of the Public Service Act 1999)); or (iiia) a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate; or (4) Schedule 1, item 84, page 24 (lines 5 and 6), omit “$10,000; and”, substitute “$10,000.”.

(17) Schedule 4, item 5, page 52 (lines 17 and 18), omit “to political parties and gifts to”, substitute “and gifts to political parties,”. As honourable members will be aware, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2005 contains measures relating to thirdparty disclosure of political expenditure, registration of political parties and tax deductibility for donations to political parties and of paraIndependent candidates and members. The amendments I have moved relate to these three measures. Turning to amendments (1) to (3), item 84 of schedule 1 to the bill currently provides for third parties to lodge annual disclosure returns if they incurred expenditure for a political purpose or received gifts over the disclosure threshold which enabled them to incur expenditure for a political purpose during a financial year. These provisions give effect to the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 2004 federal election that third parties should be required to meet the same financial reporting requirements as political parties, associated entities and donors. Following introduction of the legislation, I received representations from the non-profit sector, including World Vision Australia, the Australian Council for International Development and the National Roundtable of Nonprofit Organisations about the possible impact of the proposed third-party disclosure obligations on the work of this sector. The issue was also raised with the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee at its inquiry into the bill on inde- 7 March 2006. The government has listened to their concerns and has taken action to remove the unintended administrative burden that would otherwise be faced by non-profit and similar organisations in lodging annual returns as a result of the application of the broad definition of ‘electoral matter' in section 4 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The amendments I present were developed in consultation with the not-for-profit sector and the response has been very positive. In an email to my office on 23 March 2006, Paul O'Callaghan of the National Roundtable of Nonprofit Organisations wrote: ‘The minister's proposal will be welcomed by the non-profit sector as demonstrating a serious effort to address our organisational concerns.' I would like to thank Mr O'Callaghan and his colleagues for their constructive contribution. As a result of the amendments, third parties will be required to lodge an annual return on expenditure incurred for the purpose of expressing public views by any means on specified participants in the political process-namely, a political party, a candidate in an election or a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate. The amendments will also ensure that, if a third party is required to authorise an advertisement pursuant to section 2 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, they will be required to disclose expenditure in accordance with the new reporting requirements set out in proposed section 314AEB of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This amendment captures disclosure of political content communicated through broadcast media. Third parties will also be required to report on expenditure incurred for the printing and publication of electoral advertisements, notices and other material that falls within the categories covered by section 328 and proposed section 328A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The amendments also provide that thirdparty reporting requirements will not apply to Commonwealth departments and agencies or to members of the House of Representatives or the Senate. As result of these amendments, the third-party reporting requirements will, however, apply to associated entities, as these entities can be actively involved in the political process. Associated entities will continue to be required to provide information under the existing requirements of section 314AEA, ‘Annual returns by associated entities'. The threshold for third-party reporting will be the same as that proposed for other disclosure thresholdsthat is, $10,000. The government considers that these amendments will ensure transparency in the reporting of political expenditure by third parties. With amendments (4) to (5), the government also proposes to make consequential amendments as a result of the amendments to third-party reporting which I have just outlined. This includes amending new section 314AEC to remove the categories to which the annual reporting requirement applies for gifts received for political expenditurenamely, deleting paragraph 314AEC(1)(d), which is now redundant. I will turn to amendments (6) to (7), which relate to party registration. Item 5 of schedule 3 to the bill provides for the register of political parties to be frozen for six months after the bill receives royal assent. No changes may be made to the register during this period apart from the name of the registered officer for a political party. Amendment (6) will provide for the address of the registered officer to be changed in addition to the person's name. This will ensure that, when registered officers change, all notification that is required to be sent to the registered officer under the Commonwealth Electoral Act will be sent to the officer's current address. Item 6 of schedule 3 to the bill relates to the register of political parties that would be in force if an election were called during the re-registration process. The bill as it currently stands does not allow for any changes to be made to the register if item 6 were in force. Amendment (7) provides that the name and address of the registered officer of a political party may be changed on the register that is in force under item 6. The provision would operate only if an election is held within 12 months from the commencement of the deregistration process. This amendment will ensure that registered officers would be able to sign a nomination for candidature in a federal election. Turning to amendments (8) to (17): schedule 4 of the bill as it currently stands provides for tax deductibility for contributions to political parties, but only for gifts Independent candidates and members. The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 will ensure parity of tax treatment by allowing tax deductibility for either gifts and/or contributions to both political parties and Independent candidates and members. I am sure the Independent members in the House will be supporting that particular amendment and I commend the amendments to the House.",44
22,Mr GRIFFIN,NOES,"The opposition will not be opposing the government's amendments. But I am going to take the opportunity that I have now, given the fact that the gag has been used twice during the consideration of this bill and the earlier amendments, to put on record a couple of comments with respect to the previous set of amendments, which I was not allowed to talk on. As the member for Calare is aware, there were a number of amendments there which in fact the opposition was prepared to support but, in the context of the grouping and their being presented as a whole, the circumstances were that there were a number that we could not support, which is why we voted in that fashion. But we share a range of the concerns with the member for Calare and other Independents, particularly on issues of increases in thresholds. These are real problems and need to be dealt with. With respect to those threshold issues, which also relate partly to the government's amendments, I would like to take issue with an earlier comment made by the Special Minister of State in his response to the second reading debate. He quoted some of my earlier comments on the issue of multiple donations and the potential for them to occur. He said: By his own admission, the member for Bruce believes that the receipt of multiple donations clearly increases the chance of corruption. He had previously said that the fact that a to range of multiple donations had occurred from a range of different trade unions was proof that there were problems and that, in those circumstances, it proved just how evil the union movement and the Labor Party were. The minister once again missed the point. The point is that, where there is potential for multiple donations and where those donations are not disclosed, you leave open the potential for apparent corruption. You remove transparency from the system. The quote that he used, the detail that he provided with respect to what was happening with trade union donations, actually proves the point: those organisations were not only complying with the spirit of the law and the legality required; they were ensuring that they were transparent about what they had done. That is not the problem; the problem is that, under a system that presents a massively greater incentive by moving the threshold up to 10 grand a pop, who will not declare those multiple donations? There will now be a massive incentive for those who would seek to conceal their donations. I will tell you now: it will not be trade unions ing that opportunity, because they have not been doing it now; it will be others-and they will not be associated with my side of politics. A point that several speakers from the other side have made is that there will be a limit-you can obey the law but you can still declare more. The Labor Party will be obeying the law, but when we are in government again we will be changing the law. We will ensure that we return to a system of full transparency. I could go on for quite a while, but, as we have already been gagged twice in this debate, the chances are we will be facing a third. Although some might argue it is third time lucky, I may not test that premise. However, the amendments at hand are the result of rushed legislation moved in a shoddy fashion without proper consideration and designed to deliver a political outcome. The government and the previous minister, as the architect of this legislation, were so hot to trot to go after in a political way third-party Broadbent, R. organisations which they think involve themselves in the political process-whether they are the Wilderness Society, other organisations of that nature or trade unions-that they came forth with legislation that would have caused enormous problems for a whole range of organisations that are not at all po- Hartsuyker, L. litical. In his earlier comments, the minister outlined a number of examples. Their pursuit of an incredibly partisan poKelly, D.M. litical outcome in the way they have handled this legislation from the beginning resulted in them bringing forth faulty legislation. Thankfully, elements of those faults have been found. I have no doubt at all that, in the Neville, P.C. next several years, we will be back here fixing up the mess that they will create by what they are doing today. I have no doubt also that, if we continue to talk about it for much longer, we will be facing another gag. If that is the case, so be it. But the overall point tak- about the issue of donations is that you can- (Time expired)",47

28,Mr BEVIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 joins a long and growing raft of legislation designed to deal with the current threats presented to Australia, particularly by non-state terrorism. It is true that Australia needs tough laws to deal with terrorism but, just as importantly, we need well-balanced laws that target the terrorists, not innocent citizens. need strong safeguards to protect the civil and human rights that are fundamental to our freedoms. It is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that, in responding to terrorism, we do not undermine or destroy the very liberties we are seeking to protect. I made similar comments in my opening remarks on the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005, the major piece of legislation at the end of last year flowing from the COAG meeting. It is worth repeating those sentiments whenever legislation of this type is being considered because this is very much about getting the balance right in a free society. It is about ensuring the safety and liberty of the people of Australia but doing it in a way that does not undermine or jeopardise the fundamental freedoms which we hold dear and which generations of Australians have fought to preserve. Unfortunately the Howard government's track record in getting that balance right is not good. It seems that the government fail to understand that we can have security without sacrificing our liberty. This bill, in fact, remedies some failings in the existing legislation and is based on the work of the parliamentary committee. Before I turn directly to the detail of that I want to take the opportunity to put this into some historical context because it does, as I commented, join a long and growing raft of legislation in this field. Last year we saw the unedifying spectacle of the government pressing the premiers and the chief ministers of the states and territories to adopt a framework of legislation that most Australians would regard as repugnant. It is a matter of history that, as a result of some negotiations in COAG, some pressure from the Labor side of parliament and, to be fair, some pressure from the Liberal backbench, there were substantial changes made to the preferred legislation of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. It is well that those changes We were made because their preferred legislation-the desired approach of our Prime Minister and Attorney-General-effectively authorised administrative detention. By that I mean that it empowered politicians and public servants to decide who gets jailed and who gets detained. In Australia we do not subscribe to those views. Unfortunately we have a Prime Minister who does and who sought to establish a law that would have provided unprecedented powers for bureaucrats to decide who gets taken off the street and who gets locked up and to lock them up in secrecy with few rights in the process. We need to ensure that these sorts of powers to detain are always exercised with judicial oversight. It was one of the preconditions Labor spelled out well before even the COAG meeting occurred last year. It was one of the principles we held to last year throughout the debate surrounding the antiterrorism legislation. It is a fundamental tenet of our system of government that the detention of Australian citizens is a matter for judicial determination, not for politicians sitting in this place and certainly not for reaucrats. Sadly, that was not the preferred view of the Prime Minister. There was one other aspect of the legislation that was passed last year which drew sharp criticism from our side of the parliament and from many commentators in the community and which, sadly, the government still holds to. That is the view that these extraordinary powers and laws should apply for a period of 10 years-that the sunset clause should be a 10-year period. The whole concept of sunset clauses is to restrict laws a comparatively small time frame, after which the parliament can renew them, alter them or decide that they are no longer appropriate. A 10-year period is not a sunset clause. Let us be frank about this: a 10-year period is a political lifetime. There are many people who transit through this parliament in well under 10 years. In fact, the last time. I received advice on this I was told that the average term of a member of the House of Representatives is seven years. The government is trying to set a sunset clause that is actually longer than the average term of a member of parliament and is somehow calling that a short-term sunset clause. It also defies the clear will of the parliament on these matters in the past. The government got its way last October and November in establishing a 10-year sunset clause and I suspect, in spite of our opposition, it is likely to get its way this time as well, given that it now has control of the Senate. But when the Liberal and National parties did not have control of the Senate, and when Australia had to deal with the immediate aftermath of September 11 and the terrorist threat we confronted, the parliament adopted a sunset clause of three years. It was not 10 but three. I will return to that matter later in my address because I think it is particularly important, when we empower agencies to do things that are not normal in our bu- society, to impose a realistic time frame for those powers to end and for the parliament to be obliged to reconsider them. There is one other failing that I think it is important to note at the outset that the government has still not remedied, and that is its failure to expand the resources available to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is very important in the structure of our intelligence community. It provides an oversight and an overto view to guarantee some transparency to ensure the agencies that are involved in security and act largely in a secret manner-and of necessity must continue to act largely in a secret manner-are not able to act in a way that the parliament has not approved or that would be outside the expectations of the Australian people. The Inspector-General's office fulfils that role. It is the office through which complaints are thoroughly investigated. Indeed, the Inspector-General has the capacity to initiate investigations of his own volition. That is very important. I think the Australian public can take some comfort from the independence of the office and the role that it performs. However, we cannot take comfort from the fact that, whilst the size of our secret telligence agencies have doubled, the budget for IGIS-the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security-has virtually remained static. There needs to be a significant increase in the resources available to the Inspector-General's office simply to deal with the expanded number of cases, the expanded number of officers in the intelligence community and, inevitably with that of course, the expanded number of questions, issues and complaints that arise. The government has not done that. That diminishes the balance in the system and it also opens up the government and, sadly, the actual security agencies to questions of doubt and criticism from people in the community. We all in this place who are involved in these debates field complaints from time to time from constituents and folk around the country who think that our intelligence agencies may be doing the wrong thing. It is not healthy for the public to not have confidence in their intelligence agencies in these matters. One of the principal vehicles that I think builds that fidence is the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The government should not allow the intelligence services to have their operations questioned in the minds of many in our community by failing to resource the Inspector-General so that he can properly supervise what goes on in those intelligence services. We just had a very bigspending budget. I would like to think that the Attorney-General could find some funds to significantly improve the situation of the Inspector-General. There is one other matter that I want to fer to in the historical context, because it is an important issue, and that is what I regard as the mismanagement of the sedition laws. Last year's bill included new sedition laws. We all in this place know that they are faulty. The Attorney-General knows that they are faulty. He knows that they are not the laws in that we should have. That is why the Attorney-General has announced a review of them. Strangely, the Attorney-General announced he was reviewing those laws before the parliament had even adopted them. Everyone in this parliament knows that they are faulty. It was a foolhardy approach that the government adopted-using its numbers to force through laws that we know are not right. The sooner the Attorney-General is able to bring a bill into this parliament to improve those sedition laws and the sooner the review is completed and hopefully published, the sooner public confidence in these matters will be restored. This bill, however, does fix some of the problems that exist with the current act. The bill deals with ASIO terrorism related questioning and detention powers. It provides clarity for questioning warrants and also for warrants for questioning of those people who are held under detention. As I mentioned, it extends the sunset clause for 10 years. These laws will be in place under these proposals conuntil 22 January 2016. Schedule 1 of the bill renumbers the provisions of the act and is straightforward. Schedule 2 provides certain rights for those people being questioned and/or detained and questioned. Those rights clarify the maximum length of detention and how long a person may be questioned for and provide some clarification on the involvement of lawyers. The bill includes a number of changes that adopt many of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I pause to say that I think re- that is an extremely important committee in the life of this parliament. The Labor Party has always regarded that committee as one of the important and serious committees throughout the parliamentary structure and it is no accident that the Labor Party representation on that committee includes some of our most respected and senior members of the parliament. They are people who have, in a number of cases, been former senior ministers: Senator Robert Ray, a former Minister for Defence, amongst other portfolios; the Hon. Duncan Kerr, a former Minister for Justice; Senator John Faulkner, a former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel; and my good friend and colleague Anthony Byrne, a highly regarded and well-respected member of the House of Representatives. The Labor Party representatives on that committee are senior people. We take these issues very seriously and we think it is important that their advice and their views should be carefully examined. In this bill the government adopts a number of recommendations of that committee. Unfortunately, it does not adopt two recommendations in particular that Labor regards as important and which will be the subject of amendments I will be moving during the consideration in detail stage. Labor welcomes the changes to clearly distinguish between ASIO warrants for questioning and those for questioning whilst in detention. We welcome a subject's access to lawyers and to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. This bill provides greater certainty and clarity in the operation of the act, and that we are grateful. It ensures that clientlawyer privilege is respected in those cases involving questioning warrants and in such cases it enables contacts between a subject and their lawyer at any time while the subject is before a prescribed authority for questioning. It also clarifies the time periods for questioning under each of the warrants. The bill establishes an explicit right of access to the state ombudsman or other relevant state bodies with jurisdiction to receive and investigate complaints about the conduct of state police officers. That is a sensible additional provision. It also imposes an obligation on the prescribed authority to advise the subject of their rights. All of these are sensible improvements in the legislation. Many would ask the question why they were not there in the first place, but they are very appropriate and welcome improvements to the legislation. It is proper that state bodies such as an ombudsman be entitled to investigate state police officers and matters associated with these warrants. It is more than reasonable that the prescribed authority advise the subject of a warrant of their rights to complain to a relevant state body. Other provisions in the bill improve the questioning process-for example, by requiring the prescribed authority to inform the subject of the reason for the presence of each other person who is present at any time during questioning. You can well imagine the circumstances of a person who as the subject of these warrants is taken away for questioning-taken to a strange but secure place with physical circumstances surrounding them which are unfamiliar to them and people they do not know in the room for reasons they do not know. This does provide some degree of information to those subjects so that they can at least know who is in the room and what their role is. Labor, however, is very confor cerned that the government has not agreed to committee recommendations Nos 10 and 19 and, as I said, I will be moving amendments dealing with both of those when we deal with them in the consideration in detail stage. Items 5 and 6 of schedule 2 of the bill include amendments that ensure both questioning warrants and warrants for questioning and detention permit the person to contact a single lawyer of their choice at any time they are appearing for questioning or are in detention. That is a useful and important provision to enable the subject of a warrant to obtain fair and proper legal advice and representation. I understand there may from time to time be questions about the appropriateness of individual lawyers and concerns about those lawyers somehow in turn being a security threat. That is dealt with elsewhere. Those provisions that I just mentioned accord with the joint standing committee's recommendation 4: - a person who is the subject of a questioningonly warrant have a statutory right to consult a lawyer of choice … Item 13 of schedule 2 provides that if a person who is appearing for questioning before a prescribed authority under a questioning warrant indicates that they want to make a complaint to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or to the Commonwealth Ombudsman then the prescribed authority can defer the questioning and the person must be given facilities for making the complaint. This is an important safeguard. This gives effect to recommendation 11 of the joint standing committee: - a subject of a questioning-only warrant have a clear right of access to the IGIS budsman and be provided with reasonable facilities to do so … Item 14 provides for a person who is detained under a detention warrant to make a complaint to a complaints agency of a police service of a state or a territory, and I have already commented on that. I would, however, seek from the Attorney-General some clarification about whether the same rights apply in respect of the soon-to-be-established Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. He may be able to shed some light on that in his response to the second reading debate on the bill. Item 24, schedule 2 enables a person's lawyer to address the prescribed authority during breaks in questioning. Recommendation 5 of the joint standing committee was that the act be amended so that individuals could make representations through their lawyers to the prescribed authority. It is not clear how item 24 that is before us at the moment reflects that joint standing committee recommendation, as the bill appears to permit representations to be made only during procedural time, not during actual questioning time. Again, I invite the Attorney General to clarify that in his summing up of the second reading debate. Whilst these are improvements to the legislation, the government has not gone far enough. Let me return to the question of the 10year sunset clause. As I commented before, 10 years is by no-one's reasonable definition a sunset clause. Even in the wildest expectations of the Prime Minister and the Attorney General, it is highly unlikely that either of them will be standing at the dispatch box dealing with the sunset clause in 10 years time-a highly improbable event. Ten years is absurd, frankly, and there is nobody in this debate who actually believes that a 10-year sunset clause is sensible. The government do not want a sunset clause at all, so they put in or the Omplace a ridiculous period of time. As I said earlier, the parliament, when the Liberal and National parties did not have unfettered power in the Senate, adopted a three-year sunset clause. The United Kingdom, which has had to face regular, genuine threats of terrorism on its soil-not just since September 11, 2001 but for decades, going back to the days of IRA bombings-has in place similar legislation with sweeping powers, and it operates with a one-year sunset clause. That is 12 months, not 10 years. In the United Kingdom powers of the kind that are in this act that we are amending have to be approved every year by the parliament. That is the standard that a genuine democratic parliament imposes on these sorts of powers: the parliament has to renew every year these extraordinary powers. When we as a parliament considered it in 2002 we adopted a three-year time frame. I think that three years is not unreasonable. Given the fact that the government has adopted a 10-year approach, the parliamentary committee last year, and again this year, recommended five years. I think the parliamentary committee has probably decided that, whilst three years might have been a good thing in the past, given the government has adopted a 10-year time frame there is not much point in arguing for three years, but five years is at least somewhere along the road. Five years, I have to say, is at the upper end of any sunset clause ever adopted by this parliament, no matter what area of law we are talking about-and way beyond the one year that the United Kingdom parliament adopted for these sorts of laws. But, no, the committee's recommendation of five years has been rejected and the government holds firm to this ludicrous 10-year sunset clause. will be moving amendments to give the parliament the opportunity to adopt the committee's recommendation of what amounts to effectively a five-year sunset clause. When the Liberal and National parties were in opposition they seem to have had a different view about sunset clauses. I have a few examples here. There is a much longer list, but it is worth recounting what they did when they were in opposition. For example, when they were dealing with a sports drug agency bill David Jull, who was then a shadow minister and is now the chair of this joint committee, proposed an amendment for a three-year sunset clause. That was a sunset clause on sports drugs legislation, nowhere near as sensitive an issue as anything we are dealing with here. But, at the time that was before the parliament, David Jull as a shadow minister proposed a three-year sunset clause. When data matching in our tax bill was proposed, Andrew Peacock, whom some of us will remember, proposed that that should have a two-year sunset clause. When copyright amendments were before the parliament, Andrew Peacock again proposed a two-year sunset clause. A couple of years later, when there was a second data-matching bill dealing with taxation, David Connolly, who was then the spokesperson for the Liberal and National parties, proposed a one-year sunset clause. There were some sensitivities about people's civil liberties with data matching. That is why the then opposition, the Liberal and National parties, thought that the government should not be able to just do this data matching whenever they felt like it. They wanted a one-year restriction on it. Compare that with the standard they apply today as a government on sensitive matters balancing security and civil liberties. We recall the Training Guarantee Bill I from 1993, which the Liberal and National parties did not like at all. Kevin Andrews, now the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, then proposed a sixmonth sunset clause. This is the same minister who is out there gladly kicking workers of Australia to death under his euphemistically, strangely titled Work Choices bill. When migration legislation was before this parliament in 1994 Philip Ruddock, the present Attorney-General, proposed a three-year sunset clause. The last example I will give is the superannuation bill of 1995, where David Connolly proposed a two-year sunset clause. You could not find a bill that this parliament has enacted where there has been a 10year sunset clause, other than these security bills being pushed through by this government using the brute force of their numbers in the Senate. It is wrong. Every member in this parliament knows that it is out of kilter with the standard this parliament has adopted on every other occasion that sunset clauses have been determined, yet the government are determined to bludgeon it through the parliament with the force of their numbers in the Senate. I would urge government members to reconsider their approach to this important issue. The second important issue, which unfortunately the government has not dealt with in this bill, is the committee's recommendation No. 10, which requires ASIO to provide a copy of the statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued to the prescribed authority. That means that the prescribed authority should have available the full details of the facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued. How else can the prescribed authority properly discharge his or her role in supervising the questioning that is under way? If you have no idea why a person is being questioned, how can you possibly determine whether or not the questioning and the process that you are seeing in front of you are fair and reasonable, whether they are right or wrong or whether or not they are lawful? The simple answer is that you cannot. Without that information, the prescribed authority is effectively blinkered. I hark back to the government's approach to this last year and to my opening comments. Remember the preferred model that the Prime Minister wanted. The Prime Minister tried to force upon the premiers, the chief ministers and this parliament a set of laws in which politicians and bureaucratsnot a judge or a magistrate-could themselves decide who would be taken off the streets and locked up for a while without being able to tell their partner, their wife, their children or their employer that they had been locked up and taken off the streets. That is what John Howard wanted to do last year. The only thing that stopped him was the outcry from people throughout the country-an outcry that was facilitated by the decision of Jon Stanhope, the Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister, to make public the Prime Minister's draft legislation. Against that background, we now have a choice of allowing the prescribed authority to know the grounds and reasons on which a warrant is issued. The Howard government does not want the prescribed authority to have that information. The prescribed authority is a judicial officer appointed by this government. We are not talking about someone they do not trust; we are talking about a magistrate or a judge that this government has selected for the purpose. Why on earth should that person not have the information about the grounds on which the warrant is issued? The simple fact is that there is no justification for that, unless of course you have a latent desire to return to the process that John Howard wanted last year: restrict the judicial oversight and give maximum power to politicians and bureaucrats to decide who gets locked up and how they are dealt with. That was unacceptable to the parliament last year, it was unacceptable to the premiers and the chief ministers and it is unacceptable to Australians. I will be moving an amendment to deal with that. I make it clear here today-and I will mention this again when we deal with it in detail-that, if our amendments fail, a Labor government will amend this law after the next election to ensure those rights for all Australians. Labor will amend this law to ensure a realistic sunset clause. When we deal with this bill in detail, I will be very pleased to move those amendments on behalf of the Labor Party and to make that commitment.",50
29,Mr RICHARDSON,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today in support of the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, which seeks to amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. One of the key amendments in this bill relates to the current sunset clause. In the absence of this amendment, the current questioning and detention powers contained in division 3 of the existing act would cease on 23 July 2006. This amendment bill seeks to extend by 10 years the existing sunset clause provision and prior review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, ensuring that the sunset clause would not come into effect until 22 July 2016 and requiring prior review by the parliamentary joint committee by 22 January 2016. Experience over the past decade has shown that the current questioning regime has proved exceptionally valuable in obtaining important and relevant information about this government's fight against terrorism. The safety and well-being of the members in the gallery, our schoolchildren who are looking down upon us and all Australians are paramount. There are exceptionally stringent safeguards to ensure that the personal rights and liberties of those being questioned and/or detained are protected and that those personnel involved in the process are subject to a series of accountability mechanisms. It is not enough to simply demand that our intelligence organisations keep us safe from the ever-growing global threat of terrorism; we must equip them with lawful means of doing that very important job. Schedule 1 of the bill involves simplificaamends tion, restructuring, correction and language changes as well as some alteration to the numberings in the act. Schedule 1 does not contain any substantive changes; they are merely administrative. The schedule gives effect to recommendations 2 and 3 of the parliamentary joint committee's report. Schedule 2 of the bill implements in whole or in part a number of the remaining recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee and addresses other issues which arose during the committee's review. Schedule 2 clarifies the ability of subjects of either a questioning-only warrant or a questioning and detention warrant to make complaints. It also enhances the requirement that subjects be informed of the capacity to make complaints and facilitate the making of those complaints. The schedule inserts positive rights of contact with a lawyer for those individuals who are subject to a questioningonly warrant, as is already the case with questioning and detention warrants. It also extends the provisions which provide ASIO with the ability to challenge the presence of a lawyer where a person is detained under a questioning-only warrant. Schedule 2 requires the prescribed authority to explain more clearly their role and includes an explanatory note to signpost avenues of judicial review, both of which are in accordance with recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee. This bill seeks to find the delicate balance between providing our law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the power they need to do the job we demand of them and ensuring the right of Australians to justice, legal representation and procedural fairness. The amendments contained in this bill provide an opportunity for the lawyer involved to address the prescribed authority during breaks in questioning. The bill also secrecy provisions to cater for disclosures to additional complaints bodies and requires the prescribed authority, the director-general and the Attorney-General to take certain issues into account in deciding whether to permit disclosures. Such matters to be considered include the person's family and employment interests, the public interest and the risk to security. Schedule 2 inserts statutory financial assistance provisions so that an individual has a statutory right to apply for financial assistance for legal and related costs arising from the questioning proceedings. We recognise that not all individuals have at their disposal the financial resources to engage legal representation. We also recognise the important role lawyers play in ensuring individuals receive adequate protection of their rights. One of the very important provisions in schedule 2 of the bill clarifies the distinction between questioning-only warrants and questioning and detention warrants. In doing this, the amendments ensure that procedural time spent processing an individual is not counted towards the questioning time limits. This particular provision ensures that the administrative requirements will be complied with, while also ensuring that intelligence and law enforcement personnel are able to use the time within which they are legally able to question an individual for relevant and meaningful purposes. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security delivered its report on the proposed amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act. This bill demonstrates the Australian government's responsiveness by giving effect to many of the parliamentary joint committee's recommendations and addressing specific concerns which arose during the review. In my former occupation, I was a police officer on the front lines. I know all too well the struggle when you are required to do a job but are not afforded the power you require to do that job effectively. The fight against terrorism and the ever-increasing threat that we as a nation face from terrorism cannot be underestimated, and we must empower our intelligence and law enforcement officials with the appropriate power to do their job. These amendments afford them that power while ensuring the rights and freedoms of individuals and by clarifying exactly what those rights and freedoms are. For these reasons I commend the bill to the House.",56
30,Mr BYRNE,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In rising to speak to the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 today, I want to commend the members of the now Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, of which I am a member, on its review of division 3, part III of the ASIO Act and the report it produced. In the course of that inquiry, the committee arrived unanimously at a series of 19 recommendations which it believed would strengthen the legislation and enable ASIO and the government to exercise their powers more effectively. It has been part of a fairly long journey to get this piece of legislation right. I have found it quite instructive to reflect on the history of this bill. I refer here to a Bills Digest which drafted an outline of the legislative history of division 3, part III. It might be worthwhile for the House to consider this history and look at how this legislation started, because it is quite interesting. The legislative history says that division 3, part III, which relates to ASIO's questioning and detention powers, was inserted into the ASIO Act as a result of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003. The division adds to the suite of exceptional powers that parliament has entrusted to ASIO. A bill to add division 3, part III to the ASIO Act, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 21 March 2002 as part of a package of antiterrorism legislation. When the bill was first introduced, it aroused some community controversy. The 2002 bill enabled incommunicado detention of nonsuspects, both adults and children, for up to 48 hours, with potential for indefinite renewal of the warrants under which they were held. Detention warrants were to be issued by the executive, not by a judicial officer. Contact with a lawyer was not guaranteed. There was no provision for the legislation to be subject to review or have a sunset clause. In 2002, the PJC described the bill as ‘the most controversial piece of legislation ever reviewed by the committee'. The 2002 bill was referred to the PJC and, together with other antiterrorism bills, it was also ferred to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Numerous legislative amendments were recommended by both committees. An amended 2002 bill passed the House of Representatives and was further amended in the Senate. The House of Representatives accepted some of the Senate's amendments but negatived others that the Senate continued to press. As a result, the bill was laid aside, becoming one of the potential double dissolution triggers at the time. There was a lot of politics surrounding this. We were told that this legislation had to be passed in the interests of national security. A second bill, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, was introduced into the House of Representatives on 20 March 2003. This bill was finally passed, after further amendment, on 26 June 2003 and commenced operation on 23 July 2003. During its passage through parliament, amendments were made which to an extent refined and clarified the legislation and ameliorated some of its more draconian aspects. Among other things, amendments were made affecting the legislation's application to chilpected dren; the maximum period of detention was set at 168 hours; provision was made for protocols to govern the custody, detention and interview process; criminal penalties were introduced for officials who breached safeguards; ASIO was required to include warrant statistics in its annual report; warrants were to be issued by judicial officers; the PJC was tasked with reviewing the legislation; division 3, part III was sunsetted three years after its commencement-this was in the wake of the Bali bombings and September 11; and the requirement that a subject's lawyer be approved by the Attorney-General and security cleared was removed. Division 3, part III-this particular legisre- lation again-has been amended five times since the passage of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003. Major amendments were effected by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003. This act extended from 24 hours to 48 hours the maximum period of questioning when a subject uses an interpreter and inserted new nondisclosure offences that operate during the currency of a division 3 warrant and for two years after the warrant has expired. Referring to the Bills Digest again, as things stand, with the above provisions in mind, division 3, part III can be summarised as follows: it enables ASIO to obtain a warrant from an issuing authority that allows adults who are not suspected of a terrorism offence but who may have information about terrorism activities to be questioned for extended periods. They can be detained if there are reasonable grounds for believing that they may alert someone involved in a terrorism offence, may not appear for questioning or may destroy or damage evidence. The statutory regime also applies to children aged between 16 and 18 years if they are susof involvement in a terrorism offence. Questioning takes place before a prescribed authority who oversees the process. The language in the Bills Digest is quite interesting. It says that this regime is unprecedented in Australia and arguably in the common-law democracies with which Australia is often compared-the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The issue we face is that this is not a mild piece of legislation; it is a piece of legislation that has been framed in the aftermath of Bali and September 11. I agree with the intent of the legislation; we must do all we can do within our powers to prevent a terrorist act from occurring on our soil. It is not the intent of this legislation I have a problem with; it is the application of it. It does not apply the powers effectively. It diminishes the capacity of an authority like ASIO to exercise its powers effectively. If the legislation is not correct, it can also allow a legal challenge through the Federal Court to not permit that evidence to be used-and that is an issue that concerns the committee unanimously. These 19 recommendations that were put forward to the government for response were shaped with that intention in mind-to strengthen the legislation to enable the execution of questioning and detention warrants in a way which would not compromise the agency, the people being questioned or the government. That is why we as an opposition have concerns with two components of the government's response that have been enacted in the legislation which relate to prescribed authorities and the sunset clause. Referring again to the Bills Digest, a prescribed authority's functions and powers include: - explaining the warrant to the subject of the warrant, informing them of what the warrant authorises ASIO to do, their avenues of plaint and judicial review, and who they are permitted to contact - directing that a person be detained - deciding that an interpreter should be provided to a person who is appearing for tioning - deciding whether questioning is to continue under the warrant and setting breaks between periods of questioning - directing that a person be released from detention once further questioning is statutorily prohibited authorising the police to conduct a strip search on a detainee - providing a reasonable opportunity for a person's lawyer to advise them during breaks in questioning, and - directing that a person's lawyer be removed if they are disrupting questioning. The committee unanimously suggested that: - ‘the supervisory role of the prescribed authority be clearly expressed'and the government has agreed in part with this and: - ‘ASIO be required to provide a copy of the statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued to the prescribed authority before questioning commences'. In light of the description of the prescribed authority's functions, the fact that the prescribed authority is invariably a retired judge and the information is generally provided to the issuing authority before the warrants for questioning are issued, I do not understand why the government would say that this is not relevant and that this information should not be provided to the prescribed authority. When the committee was examining these issues and taking testimony from people who had had experience with the process, that inconsistency was one of the key issues raised. Some concern was raised in the minds of some members of the committee that, if there was not a capacity for the precom- scribed authority to be making judgments based on the full facts, this could be used if it were taken to the Federal Court. What we are about in this committee is making sure that this legislation works, so I ques- would ask the Attorney-General or, in his absence, the Attorney-General's Department, to consider this: why is it relevant that this information be granted to the issuing authority but not to the prescribed authority, who sits in on these questioning periods and potentially sits in on the detention periods, because the detention power has not been utilised at this point in time? As I have said before, no-one in this place and no-one on that committee contested the fact that we need to obtain that information, if the body believes it has the information, to interdict or prevent a terrorist act. That point is not in dispute. But what is in dispute in this place-and this is why the opposition is putting these amendments-is how to make sure this legislation can be exercised effectively. The other issue that we will be moving an amendment on is the review and the sunsetting. I would like to refer to the Bills Digest again with respect to this particular issue. It says: Division 3, Part III ceases operation on 23 July 2006. Provisions for review and sunsetting were inserted into Division 3, Part III as a result PJC's inquiry into the Australian 2002 Bill. In proposing a sunset clause in 2002, the PJC said: It will be up to the Government of the day to argue for the continuation of proposed Part III, Division 3 of the ASIO Act which will be inserted by the Bill. The timing of the Committee's review will ensure that the Government could, if necessary, prepare and introduce a replacement Bill when the relevant part of the Act expires. In evidence given to the PJC in 2005, ASIO, the Attorney-General's Department and the AFP argued against any further sunsetting and recommended that the questioning and detention regime become a permanent part of Australia's counterterrorism laws. According to these agencies, concerns about how the powers would be used have proved to be unfounded, valuable information has been obtained and concerns about terrorism are unlikely to abate. I will make a point about that, particularly as to the exercise of the powers. Does it not occur to the Attorney-General that having a review three years after these extraordinary powers have been implemented actually aids the public's confidence in the fact that these powers are being exercised? If the intent of the authorities is that there should be no sunset clause, how does that inspire public confidence in the fact that there is going to be appropriate scrutiny, an overview, of what are clearly extraordinary powers given to an agency in light of a terrorist threat or a perceived terrorist threat? You cannot have that as a permanent part of the landscape. You cannot have a permanent cold war. In effect, judgments like this have got to be made on the basis of intelligence at the time. That is why the committee unanimously put forward a five-year sunset clause. Whilst we have an absolute commitment to ensure that these questioning and detention powers are used to interdict or prevent terrorist acts, we also have to be mindful of the fact that the community needs to have confidence in the agency. In fact, in a recent of the speech the Director-General of ASIO spoke quite strongly of the need for people to understand that ASIO needs to run its operations covertly in the public interest. But it also needs to reassure the public as to its exercising of extraordinary powers like the ones that we are debating here today, so that the public has confidence that these powers will be exercised properly. A 10-year period of time, in my view, and in the committee's view, does not allow that to happen. No agency is above review or scrutiny, particularly an agency whose brief is to conduct covert operations on behalf of the Australian community. In doing so, the community gives that agency trust but it also wants accountability, it also wants scrutiny and it also wants to know the agency is doing its job-and, in essence, as I believe and the committee believes, a 10-year sunset clause does not give that assurance or guarantee. The fact is that, regardless of whether we like it or not, a five-year sunset clause encourages the agency and the government to operate those powers with increased responsibility. While I do not believe that a 10-year sunset clause will enable them not to exercise their powers responsibly, I do think a five-year sunset clause gives a market signal: we do not want ASIO to wind up like the then DIMIA. ASIO is Australia's front line against a terrorist act being committed in this country. What we do not want, through some sort of legislative slackness, is a culture to emerge within that particular agency which means that shortcuts will be taken. I believe, and the committee believes, a five-year sunset clause will ensure that opportunity or thought will not occur. Certainly, reporting by the agency in question back to the committee indicates that the idea of a sunset clause within a reasonable time frame will work well. What I would ask the agency and the Attorney General's Department is this: show me the evidence that having a five-year sunset clause compromises the operation of the agency, because in all of the evidence that was put forward to the committee I saw no suggestion of that at all-and if that is the case I want to know why there is a 10-year sunset clause in this. I think the committee-and I appreciate that the member for Moncrieff is not hereoperates on a bipartisan basis, because that is the way national security should be treated in this parliament. That is what the Australian public demands of both sides of politics. In that spirit, I would ask the Attorney and the government to seriously consider the amendments that the opposition will be moving because, as I have said, they came out of a committee process that was determined to improve the legislation. I believe that if those amendments are accepted that legislation will be improved.",58
31,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This bill amends division 3 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, which deal with ASIO's terrorism related questioning and detention powers. The bill makes a number of welcome improvements to the act. In addition there are a couple of worthwhile recommendations which have not been adopted and which form the basis of Labor's amendments, which I will discuss a little later. Labor welcomes the changes to clearly distinguish between ASIO warrants for questioning and warrants for questioning while in detention. The bill ensures that client-lawyer privilege is respected in cases involving questioning warrants, and in those cases it allows contact between a person being questioned and their lawyer at any time while they are being questioned by a prescribed authority. Labor also supports clarification of the time periods for questioning under each of the warrants. Another positive change is that the bill establishes an explicit right of access to a state ombudsman or other relevant state bodies with jurisdiction to receive and investigate the conduct of state police officers. The bill also imposes an obligation on the prescribed authority to advise the person being questioned of this right. Labor believes that state bodies such as the ombudsman should be entitled to investigate state police officers and that people being questioned should be advised of their right to complain to relevant state bodies such as the ombudsman. Other provisions in the bill improve the questioning process. For example, the bill requires the prescribed authority to inform a person being questioned of the reason for the presence of each other person present at the time of questioning. I will now move to the parts of the bill which are of concern to me and to Labor. To put these concerns into context it is important to note that this bill responds to recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. That committee is now known as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The joint committee recently reviewed ASIO's terrorism related questioning and detention powers, which are found in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Their report entitled ASIO's questioning and detention powers: review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of division 3 of part III in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 was tabled in the House of Representatives on 30 November 2005. Whilst this bill adopted six recommendations by the joint committee, it adopted six other recommendations only in part and did not adopt a further seven recommendations. Labor is concerned that recommendation 10 of the joint committee is only ‘agreed in part' by the government. Recommendation 10, part 1 was adopted, which states that ‘the supervisory role of the prescribed authority must be clearly expressed' to the person being questioned. Recommendation 10, part 2 states that: - ‘ASIO be required to provide a copy of the statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued to the prescribed authorauthority, ity before questioning commences'. The government has rejected this part of the recommendation. The government has argued that prescribed authorities have sufficient information to fulfil their role vising proceedings, because they are provided with a copy of the warrant. Labor is concerned that failing to fully adopt recommendation 10 diminishes the safeguards in the detention regime. This is of great concern to me and, I am sure, to many people in my electorate of Canberra, many of whom have contacted me in relation to these issues. I and Labor agree with the joint committee's view that access to this information will assist the prescribed authority to exercise their supervisory role when a person is being questioned. Accordingly, a copy of all the relevant documentation should be provided before questioning begins. The government's response to the joint committee report has not provided any compelling or satisfactory reason for not adopting recommendation 10 in full. Another major concern to me and my colleagues is the proposed 10-year sunset clause for division 3, part III of the ASIO Act. Division 3, part III can be summarised as follows. It allows ASIO to obtain a warrant from an issuing authority which allows adults who are not suspected of a terrorism offence but who may have information about terrorist activities to be questioned for extended periods. They can be detained if there are reasonable grounds for believing that they may alert someone involved in a terrorism offence, may not appear for questioning or may destroy or damage evidence. The statutory regime also applies to children aged between 16 and 18 years if they are suspected of involvement in a terrorism offence. Questioning takes place before a prescribed who oversees the process. The regime is unprecedented in Australia and, arguably, in the common-law democracies with which Australia is often compared, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zeain super- land and the United States. This bill proposes a 10-year sunset clause for division 3, part III, with a date of 2016. The joint committee recommended that the new sunset clause come into effect on 22 November 2011-that is, a five-year sunset clause, not a 10-year sunset clause. Many submissions to the joint committee argued against renewing the questioning and detention regime. They argued that the threat level to Australia does not justify the regime, that the existing powers of law enforcement agencies and existing criminal laws are sufficient and that the legislation is inconsistent with democratic rights. Most agreed that, if division 3, part III is to be re-enacted, it must be sunsetted. A 10year sunset clause is clearly too long. That is why Labor is moving an amendment to reduce the sunset clause to five years. Many of my constituents have contacted me with concerns about the ways in which civil and human rights in Australia have been threatened in recent years. I strongly believe that, whilst we need to protect our citizens from terrorism, we must also protect their human rights and our system of democracy. As my colleague the member for Brisbane said earlier today, Australia needs tough laws to deal with terrorism-there is no doubt about that. But just as important are well-balanced laws that target the terrorists, not innocent citizens. We need strong safeguards to protect the civil and human rights that are fundamental to our freedoms. We must ensure that, in responding to terrorism, we do not undermine or destroy the very liberties that we are seeking to protect. Terry Higgins, Chief Justice of the ACT Supreme Court, said in October 2005: Can we still claim to live in a democratic state if we do not have the most basic democratic rights? It is important to guard against the tion of civil liberties regardless of whether the challenger is a radical terrorist, or an unduly scriptive piece of legislation. Chief Justice Higgins was expressing his concerns at the Howard government's proposed antiterrorism laws last year. The Howard government has shown that it is not very good at maintaining that important balance between having tough laws to protect our citizens from terrorism and, at the same time, protecting their civil rights and human rights. The Howard government's behaviour over the last few years has shown an arrogance and a lack of consultation with state and territory governments and with the public. We must take a balanced approach to protection from terrorism and protection of civil and human rights, and that is why I will support Labor's amendments to this bill. Can I again refer to Justice Terry Higgins. I would like to further quote, if I may. He said in an article in the Canberra Times in October last year: The argument that it is simply a matter of “extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures” is initially persuasive, but less compelling when subject to closer scrutiny. History has shown that, unfortunately, once taken away, rights don't tend to hover in the stratosphere, waiting to be reactivated. There is the problem that measures that are introduced during times of national emergency have a nasty habit of outstaying their welcome. I would like to conclude with a quote by Robert Maynard Hutchins: The death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush. It will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference, and undernourishment. It is absolutely important; it is absolutely vital. Yes, we do need to have strong laws at a time like this, but the balance that has to be struck between the need for those laws and the need to uphold basic human rights and the freedom of our democracy is no less imviola- portant. I very strongly support our foreshadowed amendments to this bill and I prestrongly suggest that the government pay due attention to them.",62
32,Mr CREAN,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the foreshadowed amendments to be moved by the member for Brisbane to the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This is another bill to amend our antiterrorism laws. It reflects the government's response to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD arising from its review of ASIO's terrorism related questioning and detention powers. The PJC on Intelligence and Security-formerly the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD-was given oversight of this legislation and it remains an important mechanism for parliamentary oversight. In the context of this legislation, the PJC has recommended sensible refinements and improvements in the light of the experience of the operation of the legislation. We support the provisions of this bill that accept the majority of the PJC's recommendations. However, we believe that the PJC's recommendations relating to information to be given to the prescribed authority and the length of the sunset clause should be accepted as well. The government does not, and that is why amendments will be moved by the member for Brisbane, and that is what Labor is supporting. I should make the point also that this bill is being debated in far less controversial cumstances than the earlier bills in relation ASIO's powers. Debate today is not taking place in the highly emotive atmosphere of 2001 and 2002, following the attacks in New York and the Bali bombings. Post September 11 and those Bali bombings, it was essential for governments and parliaments to respond to requests from enforcement agencies concerning their powers to counter terrorism. But the response, we always insisted, had to be tempered by ensuring that the rights and freedoms fundamental to Australian citizens are also protected. This is the fundamental balance that we as a parliament have to get right. In the wake of those attacks by terrorists against Australian citizens resulting in horrific loss of life, Labor accepted at the time the argument that ASIO's powers had to be increased to help deal with this new threat. In essence, ASIO then had powers to ask questions of terrorist suspects but not to demand answers. The law in other circumstances in this country does require people to answer questions-why not have the same requirement for those believed to be associated with terrorist activities? That principle made sense to us and we were prepared to extend those powers, but we insisted that, if they were to be extended, it had to be done in a way that protected the basic rights of the people who were going to be questioned. The Howard government through this whole exercise since September 11, left to its own devices, has never got the balance right-never. It prefers to play to the politics of fear and insecurity. It has never of its own initiative sought to deal constructively in a bipartisan way to address the issues in this parliament. So up until now it has been left to parliament, with a Senate which until recently the government did not control, to ensure that we got that balance right. The cir- position of the Australian Labor Party has to been critical to date in achieving the best possible outcome. It is worthwhile reminding this House of the history of that debate and of the proposed legislation-the precursor to this legislation-that the government talked about and wanted to introduce back in 2002 and again in 2003. In that period the government did not deal with this in a rational and calm way. The Prime Minister and the then Attorney General, Daryl Williams, were only too willing to play wedge politics and to exploit the rhetoric of fear. It was the Labor Party that was committed to getting the balance right and that ensured not only that we had better legislation as a result but that the PJC recommendations, which are before us today, are much more difficult for the government to ignore in pursuing their wedge politics and fear based agenda. Just think of this: under the original proposed bill back in March 2002, just four years ago, ASIO warrants that this government wanted us to pass could have provided for indefinite detention and questioning of persons who had information on terrorist attacks, including children; detention incommunicado-in other words, no guarantee of access to legal advice for the person being questioned-detention warrants to be issued by the executive-that is, by the Attorney General-not by a judge; no rights to decline to give information or produce a document; and no penalty for officers who did not administer the bill correctly. In that original legislation, the government provided for no parliamentary oversight, review or sunset provision. Under the government's original proposals, a 10-year-old child could have been held in detention and strip-searched. This was an outrageous abuse of people's rights in this country and totally unacceptable. We said so and we opposed it. Another indication of the haste and recklessness with which the original legislation was drafted was its inclusion of the absurd situation where a terrorist suspect could only be detained and questioned for 12 hours but a nonsuspect who may have had information about a terrorist attack could have been detained and questioned for up to seven days. This legislation then had serious flaws and Labor said so. We were prepared to be constructive: we put suggestions to the government, we debated the issues in the House and the Senate and we worked to make the legislation better to ensure that the terrorists and only the terrorists were targeted. On 21 March 2002 we had the ASIO bill sent for further parliamentary scrutiny by the PJC. That committee was given just five weeks to complete its report. Following public criticism, the government agreed to extend the inquiry to June. In the meantime Labor conducted lengthy and successful negotiations with the government on the antiterrorism legislation that it was seeking to introduce. Ultimately, the Prime Minister, who had originally proposed more draconian legislation, was forced to admit that we as a parliament had got the balance right. At the National Press Club on 11 September 2002, he said: We have, of necessity, tightened our security laws. I believe through the great parliamentary processes that this country has ... we have got the balance right. But understand this: it was Labor's stance in the parliament that ensured that we did get the balance right. And it was a balance he was not seeking when it came to extending ASIO's powers back in 2002. At the time, there were those who argued, and perhaps still argue, that we should not be increasing ASIO's powers at all. The Labor Party do not agree with those arguments. We have responded to the very real threat of terrorism in a way that increases our preparedness and power to deal with terrorism while, at the same time, keeping the balance and protecting the rights and liberties of individuals. In the middle of these inquiries that I talked about and post the October 2002 Bali bombings, the government wanted to introduce sweeping powers to enable the Attorney-General alone to proscribe terrorist organisations. We opposed that power as well. We opposed it being in the hands of the Attorney-General-it was too much power in the hands of one person. In the spirit, again, of constructive cooperation, we proposed judicial oversight, not parliamentary oversight, to deal with this. We said that we were prepared to accept proscription by the United Nations. We also at the time moved swiftly and introduced a private member's bill in this parliament to proscribe Hezbollah, based on intelligence briefings we had been given about the activities of that organisation. Again, it was Labor taking the initiative to deal with terrorism and terrorist organisations while always considering the need to protect the civil liberties of ordinary Austracredit, lians, making sure that they were not overridden by the hysteria that this government was trying to whip up. After the proscription debate, which saw us successful in preventing the power of proscription being in the hands of the minister alone, the two Senate committees reported on the ASIO bills. Based on all the evidence that they had had before them, they recommended a number of amendmentsamendments we in the Labor Party were prepared to adopt because we believed that they significantly improved the bill in getting the balance right, but amendments the government refused to accept. In essence, the debate then became around principles that we insisted had to be included in the bill-principles such as the choice of legal representation by the person being questioned; protection of children under the age of 18; a three-year sunset clause to ensure further parliamentary scrutiny; and the introduction of a questioning regime, not a detention regime. We said that, in its application to young people aged 16 and 17, the bill should only apply if they were suspects, not if they were nonsuspects, and we said that the period and conditions of questioning under this bill should be comparable to those under the Crimes Act. We also insisted that rolling warrants could not be available-if there was to be additional detention it had to be based on additional and materially different information. The Prime Minister of the day insisted on the hard line, ignoring the recommendations of the parliamentary process, ignoring our offers to him to negotiate a successful outcome. The Prime Minister shamefully goaded us in the parliament that Labor would be to blame if we went into Christmas and the parliamentary recess of 2002-03 and there was a terrorist attack. To its great the Labor Party stared him down. We said that he had an option: he could have a bill that was agreed in the parliament if those principles that I have just outlined were adopted. He chose to walk away from the constructive approach. He sought to exploit the politics of division and fear, not to address the new powers for ASIO through legislative reform in a sensible, balanced way. By Labor staring him down, the bill not only was laid aside but became a potential double dissolution trigger. History will show that there was no terrorist attack over that Christmas. Christmas came and went-and so, it appears, did the Prime Minister's urgency, having told us in December how important this legislation was. It did not come back into the parliament for another four months. And, when it was eventually passed in June 2003, the bill that the parliament passed was almost identical to what Labor had been proposing back in December. We could have had it in place six months earlier. It is true that the government did not agree with all of the proposals that Labor put forward, and we were prepared, given that the key ones that I referred to above were adopted, to pass the bill. But, in doing so, we also made it clear that, when elected, we as a government would introduce new amendments to improve the deficient proposals and to implement the ones that we had not been successful in forcing the government to adopt-for example, amending the act to ensure that custody is limited to a maximum of 72 hours under each warrant and also to remove the reversal of the onus of proof for elements of some offences. I go through this history to demonstrate that it is possible for the parliament to get this balance right-the balance between being tough on the terrorists but also recognising the basic rights and liberties of our Australian citizens. We are making sure that, in getting the balance right, we do not compromise the work of our law enforcers. We got that balance right. This was admitted by no less a person than Dennis Richardson himself, formerly the Director-General of ASIO and now Ambassador to the United States. He had this to say on 19 May 2005 in evidence before the joint parliamentary committee that is making these recommendations: The legislation that was initially introduced into the parliament with our supportthat is, ASIO's supportand advice was much simpler and was, of course, tougher. We debated among ourselves whether the compromises that had been made in the parliament would make it unduly complex. Our concerns were misplaced. We were wrong in worrying about it. As it has turned out, the balance the legislation has so far been very workable and it has operated very smoothly ... Again, that balance was only achieved because the Labor Party in this parliament took a stand. It stood by its principles, it stood by its conviction and it was prepared to stare the government down when it was trying to whip up hysteria and fear in the community. The three-year sunset clause that we then insisted upon is the reason we have the amendments before us today: they come as recommendations from that review. As I said at the beginning, we support this bill subject to the amendments that we will be moving. There are a number of amendments for improving the legislation. These amendments come from a parliamentary process-a bipartisan approach that looks at the evidence and does not look at the political opportunities, which is the only spectrum through which the Prime Minister views these things. I do not need to go through the proposals before us in detail. That has been done by the member for Brisbane. But they do include greater certainty in distinguishing between questioning warrants and detention warrants; protection of client-lawyer privilege; clarification of time periods for questioning; giving right of access to state ombudsmen in relation to the conduct of state police; and improvements to the questioning process. These are all important new safeguards, and we welcome them. But the government has not accepted the PJC's recommendation relating to the requirement for ASIO to give the prescribed authority, usually a judge, the full statement of the facts and the grounds on which the warrant is based. The government has not provided sufficient reasons for not accepting that. The Attorney-General did not address the issue in his second reading speech. I hope, given that he is at the table now, he does it today. The government has also not in accepted the PJC's recommendation for a five-year sunset clause, instead proposing 10 years. We believe that is too long and inappropriate. Again, these are matters of balance and judgment. We have demonstrated the ability to get that right far more than the government. There is a need for tough antiterrorism laws, but there is also a need to protect people's civil liberties. I support the amendments that are being proposed by the member for Brisbane that will again strengthen the direction and get the balance right. It is always Labor that is putting the constructive proposals forward to achieve that balance.",64
33,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank the members who have contributed to this debate-they include the members for Brisbane, Kingston, Holt, Canberra and Hotham. I agree very strongly with the comments made by way of introduction by the member for Brisbane. These are issues about balancing very important protection measures with appropriate safeguards. In fact, the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 reflects the government's agreement that where there were further suggestions that could be helpful they would be pursued. This bill adds rights and safeguards which apply to the subjects of questioning. The warrant regime will provide for an expanded role of the prescribed authority in directing proceedings and enhance the ability of lawyers to represent their clients. I say this very deliberately because, if you are going to argue about balance, sometimes there is room for differences of view, but very important to start understanding where the balance is. It may have been a mistake by the member for Hotham that he suggested in his comments, when I came back into the House, that somebody could be questioned for seven days. The period is 24 hours with a further extension in particular circumstances. It has not been seven days. I simply make the point it is something that can be done over a period of seven days but they are in individual periods within that time. The member for Brisbane also madeMr Crean-Up to seven days.",68
34,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"No, not up to seven days. It is 24 hours. I listened very carefully to what the member was saying. The member continues always to be very argumentative and will never accept any gentle advice. Mr Crean-Gentle advice?",69
35,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yes, gentle advicevery gentle-and I intend to continue to be gentle, even with the member for Brisbane. I come in here and find that there are some amendments which, if he had given them to us in advance, we might have been able to help him with. But he proposes to move an amendment which seeks to require the director-general to give an issuing authority a copy of the statement of facts and grounds. The act already requires this at section 34C(4). It already requires it; it is in the act. There may have been somebody else he would like to see given that information but the amendment asks that the issuing authority be given such a statement-the act already requires it. I only mention those matters helpfully because I do not wish to be critical; I hope for enthusiastic support for these measures. In the context of some of the arguments that we have had today, particularly about the length of the sunset clause and related matters, it really depends upon your percepit is tion as to what risks we face and how long you think we are likely to continue to face them. I would like somebody to tell me that within three years terrorist threats will have gone away but I do not hear anybody making that assertion. I know that some people get lulled into a false sense of security and assume that nothing could happen here. I simply say that nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation is designed to assist the relevant agencies that have shown a capacity to help us deal with these situations. There have been people charged with terrorist offences in Australia and convicted; there are a further group of people at present under charge. Our security agencies have played a significant role in relation to these matters. The point I want to make is that we are resourcing our agencies to meet the challenge that we face. We have done so after the Taylor review. The member for Brisbane suggested that, while we are expanding the roles of the agencies, we were not additionally resourcing the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Mr Bevis-Nowhere near to the same extent.",69
36,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I think that is a qualification. Perhaps the honourable member knew that I was going to point out that the Inspector-General has, in fact, been additionally resourced. Those resources are the subject of recommendation, given the nature of the numbers of complaints that he is receiving, and also the assessment, which would include discussions with him, as to what extent he believes it is necessary for him to undertake own motion inquiries. In the budget papers, it will be seen that the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, over a four-year period, has received an additional $3 million to enable it to address the workload associated with the increased activity of the Australian intelligence community. The honourable member raised some issues in relation to complaints handling. I want to make the point that a person who is the subject of questioning or questioning and detention has a number of complaints mechanisms available to them. They can complain to the Ombudsman, they can complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and they can instruct a lawyer to pursue remedies on their behalf. So these are issues that can be effectively addressed and, in our view, we think we have the balance right in relation to those matters as well. Another point that I want to raise, because it has become the major focus, is in relation to the 10-year sunset clause. The reason we came to the view that 10 years was appropriate was that that was the period settled in relation to other legislation dealing with security issues on which we have been in dialogue with the states. Our view is that these issues ought to be addressed at the same time. You do not need a multiplicity of inquiries and reviews. For that reason, in our opinion, the more appropriate period was that settled in relation to other legislation. In that context I would simply say that this bill represents an important step in ensuring the continuation of ASIO's questioning and detention powers beyond July this year and the effective operation of them. We have accepted recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and I thank them for the work that they have undertaken. We have not accepted all of their recommendations, but we believe that the legislation is being improved by those that we have accepted. We appreciate the contributions that members on both sides of the political divide have made. We think that the measures contained in the bill maintain an appropriate balance of civil liberties by enhancing safeguards and conferring more explicit rights on people who are being questioned and detained. These measures, combined with some other changes in response to the PJC and minor corrective changes, will clarify and strengthen, in our view, the effectiveness of ASIO's questioning and detention regime. The questioning and detention regime needs to operate effectively if ASIO is to continue to have the best set of tools at its disposal for working together with other agencies to ensure the protection of the Australian community. I conclude by saying that there have been-and reports from ASIO indicate thisa number of people questioned. That has proved very helpful to the agency in its work. The detention regime has not had to be used, but I think the very fact that it is there ensures more ready cooperation from people who might otherwise be resistant to questioning, knowing that it is possible that detention could be sought if cooperation was not forthcoming. The fact that there has not been use of the detention power should not be seen as a basis for suggesting that it is not needed as part of the overall scheme. I commend the bill to the House, and we will deal with the amendments shortly. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",70
37,Mr BEVIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (4) together: (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5, after subsection 34D(6) (line 23), insert: Statement of facts and grounds to be provided (7) If the Director-General gives an issuing authority a request under subsection (6) the Director-General must also give the issuing authority a copy of the full statement of the facts and other grounds on which the Director-General considers it necessary that the warrant should be issued. (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (line 29), after “subsection 34D(6)” insert “and provided a statement in accordance with subsection 34D(7)”. (3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 9, after subsection 34F(7) insert Statement of facts and grounds to be provided (8) If the Director-General gives an issuing authority a request under subsection the Director-General must also give the issuing authority a copy of the statement of the facts and other grounds on which the Director-General considers it necessary that the warrant sued.

I make one variation to the first amendment so that it reads: If the Director-General gives an issuing authority a request under subsection (6) the Director-General must also give the issuing authority a copy of the full statement of the facts and other grounds on which the Director-General considers it necessary that the warrant should be issued. Mr Ruddock-I have no problem with the member making better sense of his amendments and correcting the error that I pointed out.",71
38,Mr BEVIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am indebted to the Attorney for pointing out the absence of the word ‘full', and I am delighted that its inclusion now overcomes what was his apparent concern a few moments ago because in factMr Ruddock-I am pleased to offer my assistance. I am here to help you out.",71
39,Mr BEVIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I look forward to that assistance. No doubt an appropriate form of words can be dealt with in the Senate so that the sense of this very important amendment is given effect to.,71
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I would just seek clarification from the member for Brisbane that he is moving amendments on which he intends to speak and has a belief in.,71
41,Mr BEVIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Indeed, I am. I appreciate your wise counsel about that. The government's response to the committee report on (7) the matter that is the subject of my amendments was: The Government considers that it is not appropriate for ASIO to give the prescribed authority a copy of the full statement of facts and grounds on should be iswhich the warrant is based. That is what the government said in response to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The government position is that the issuing authority should not have access to the full statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant is based. That is an extremely important principle in the process that we are dealing with. The prescribed authority is a judicial person appointed by this government for the purposes of this act. They are hand-picked. They are chosen to fulfil an important role in the questioning process of those whom ASIO has an interest in. They cannot undertake their role without knowing the full grounds on which ASIO has obtained the warrant, yet the government wants to keep them blind. The government position is that the judicial oversight should be minimised and sidelined as much as it possibly can be. That, in fact, was its preferred position. The government's preferred piece of legislation had virtually no judicial oversight at all. John Howard took to the premiers and chief ministers a bill that would have allowed politicians and public servants to decide who gets pulled off the street and taken away, with much fewer rights, I might say, than is now the case, thanks to the efforts of a number of people in this parliament that caused the government to change its view. Here we have a recommendation unanimously agreed to by the parliamentary committee. The government have not provided any sound response as to why that particular recommendation should not be adopted. There is nothing in what the Attorney has said today, or indeed in the official response of the government to the report, to explain why it is that they think the prescribed authority should be kept in the dark. I invite Attorney in the course of this consideration in detail to explain to the parliament and the people of Australia why they think the government's hand-picked appointed prescribed authority should be kept in the dark about why somebody has come before them and why ASIO has a warrant to bring that person before them. It beggars belief that there could be a security consideration in this. We are talking about officers of the court being hand-picked by the government to fulfil precisely this role of acting as prescribed authorities in the handling of ASIO warrants. So there is no security question involved in this; the only question is one of process. Is the person who is the subject of this warrant going to be in front of a prescribed authority-a judge or a magistrate-where that judge or magistrate has information on which they can properly determine whether questions are appropriate and whether the conduct of the proceedings are correct? That is the question the Attorney has to answer. It is a question that the committee properly put before this parliament. It is a sound recommendation of the parliamentary committee, it deserves the support of this parliament, it enhances the process of warrant questioning and the government are yet to provide a shred of an argument as to why that recommendation of the committee should not be adopted. I look forward to the Attorney-General's response to that. Indeed, I look forward to a government amendment that gives effect to it, if he has a problem with the ones I have just moved.",71
42,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We are dealing with amendments (1) to (4) and I am just looking at them again. I heard the honourable member for Brisbane seek to amend the provision to add the word ‘full' when referring to the the statement of facts and other grounds. I have no problem with him adding that. I will oppose the measure in any event. The reason the government will oppose the measure is that it does not do what he seeks. He may want to address it in another place. The issuing authority is referred to in clause 7, and he is asking that the director-general give an issuing authority a request under subsection (6). The director-general must also give the issuing authority a copy of the statement of facts on which he considers it necessary that the warrant should be issued. The fact is that under section 34C(iv) that is already required. The honourable member is asking that the prescribed authority be given that information, but his amendment deals with the issuing authority. The issuing authority has that. That is why we will vote against the opposition's amendment. But we would vote against their amendment in any event because the role of the issuing authority and the role of the prescribed authority are quite different. The issuing authority has to consider the facts and has to have the facts before him, as I do, in order to know whether he should issue a warrant. We do not seek a warrant until I as the Attorney agree that appropriate that a warrant be sought. I should have all those facts before me. That is the decision I have to take and it is the decision the issuing authority has to take. The prescribed authority is in fact the keeper of the ring. He does not make any decisions. He deals with the questioning of a party and ensures that that process is carried out in accordance with law. He deals with the questioning, including determining whether continuation of questioning is appropriate, and that all of the legislative requirements and safeguards have been complied with. That is quite a distinct issue from having to secondguess whether presumably the facts and information included in the request have been sufficient to justify the questioning. That is not his role; it is the role of the issuing thority. We certainly are of the view that, even if the amendments were correctly drafted, it is appropriate to give to the prescribed authority all of that additional information.",72
43,Mr BEVIS,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the Attorney for his technical advice. As he will discover in a couple of years time, the resources available in opposition do not really allow us the benefit of some detailed legal consideration in the time frames we often confront. He will no doubt learn that once again in a year or two. However, I want to set aside the discussion about that technical point, which I now understand and accept, and go to the point at issue. The point at issue is whether the recommendation and judgment of the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in this matter are right or whether the Attorney's view is the correct one. Labor strongly hold the view that the committee have this right. I make it clear that, if the government persist with their opposition to this committee recommendation, which we are supporting, a future Labor government will alter the legislation to it is accord with that recommendation and to ensure that the prescribed authority has the full details of the grounds on which the warrant was issued. The committee said: The Committee believes that, for the prescribed authority to discharge fully their responsibilities, it is important that they have access to relevant information. The prescribed authority is not currently provided with a copy of ASIO's statement of facts and grounds which support the issuing of the warrant. Access to this information will assist the prescribed authority exercise their supervisory role and a copy of all the relevant documentation should be provided before questioning begins. They are right about that; they are correct in that assessment. The prescribed authority needs that information if they are going to properly determine whether the questions au- being asked are appropriate and whether the behaviour in the course of that questioning is reasonable, given the grounds on which the warrant was issued. In my speech on the second reading I referred to the seriousness with which Labor have always addressed this committee and the fact that we have highly respected members of the Labor Party who have served on this committee and who do at the moment. I want to now take the opportunity to acknowledge the government members who are on that committee which made that recommendation: David Jull, a former minister, who is the chair; Stewart MCArthur, one of the longest-serving members in this parliament; Senator Alan Ferguson, who has a long period of experience on Senate committees, particularly on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which he has chaired; and Senator Sandy Macdonald, who has had a long standing involvement in defence and foreign affairs matters and is now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. These are people who not just have an interest but, I think fair to say, have earned some degree of respect in the security community for their involvement in this field. They have quite correctly made a judgment that, for the prescribed authority to do the job they are supposed to, they need to be given the advicethat is, the full statement-of the grounds on which the warrant was issued. I listened carefully to what the Attorney said. There was nothing in what the Attorney said to cast doubt on that judgment. The proper course for the Attorney and the government is to accept the principle of that recommendation, to accept the principle of the amendment that I have moved and to give a commitment to introduce a government amendment, if need be, or, in consultation with us, to put forward an agreed amendment to deal with the problem that the committee properly identifies. I repeat: I believe there is only one reason the government has so far failed to do that, and that is that this government does not support genuine judicial review in this process. It did not from the start. It was not the Prime Minister's desire. I think this is further evidence of that underlying sentiment within senior government ranks. It is not shared by many on its own backbench. It is clearly not shared by the Liberal members of that joint standing committee. Nonetheless, it is a view shared by senior members of this government. They want that unfettered power. The Attorney-General thinks he should know but a judge who is sitting in these matters should not. That is not the standard the Australian people expect. Of course the Attorney General should know, but no Attorney General can put themselves in the position where they deny a judicial officer acting as a prescribed authority the opportunity to at least understand the full grounds of the reasons for which these warrants are issued.",73
44,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I will not detain the House, save to say that an issuing authority is a judicial officer and a prescribed authority is a retired judicial officer. Mr Bevis-Oh, okay!",74
45,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,You are talking about it being judicially reviewed. The decision to issue a warrant is judicially reviewed by a judicial officer. The prescribed authority is a retired judicial officer. This is not about judicial review. It is a question of whether or notMr Bevis interjecting,74
46,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"No, it is not about judicial review. The fact is that the issuing authority is a judicial officer. He, in effect, issues the warrant. The prescribed authority is not there to undertake judicial review. The prescribed authority is there to ensure that the questioning that is carried out is carried out in accordance with the act. That is what his role is. Mr Bevis-Without the knowledge on the basis of which the warrant was issued.",74
47,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"No. As I said before, he is there to keep the ring and to ensure that the questioning that occurs occurs in accordance with the act. It is quite a different role. In order to carry out that role, it is not necessary for the retired judicial officer to have, as you have called it, the full statement of the facts and other grounds on which the warrant is based.

48,Mr BEVIS,AYES,"by leave-I move opposition amendments (5) and (6) together: (5) Schedule 2, item 32, page 61 (line 30), omit “22 July 2016”, substitute “22 November 2011”. (6) Schedule 2, item 33, page 62 (line 4), omit NOES “22 January 2016”, substitute “22 June 2011”. These proposed amendments to the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 are really a straightforward issue. They concern the question of the sunset clause in the bill. In their speeches in the second reading debate, a number of people made mention of that, and the Attorney-General commented upon it in his summing up. In summing-up, the Attorney said that the justification for a 10-year sunset clause was that the government felt some obligation to stick with 10 years because that is what it had in the bill at the of last year. The only reason that 10 years was the period for the sunset clause in the bill at the end of last year is that the government used its newfound numbers in the Senate, where the Liberal and National parties now have a majority, to do what it pleases. The will of the parliament on these matters has been quite clear. When other security related legislation like this has been before the parliament, the parliament has put three-year sunset clauses in place. When the parliamentary committee-and I remind the House again that this is an all-party parliamentary committee, with Labor, Liberal and National Party participation-looked at these bills, it recommended, in the light of the 10 years the government wants, a five-year sunset clause. By the light of historical terms for this other parliaments, five years is, frankly, a long time for a sunset clause; 10 years is unparalleled. Ten years is not a sunset clause. The government knows that. The Attorney-General knows it is not a sunset clause. The truth of the matter is that the government does not want a sunset clause at all. But it could not get the premiers to sign up to a deal unless there was a sunset clause. In some remarkable twist of negotiation, it managed to get a 10-year sunset clause agreement out of the COAG meeting, with premiers agreeing to it. Before the COAG meeting, and since, Labor federally has made clear that a sunset clause is and should be an integral part of legislation like this which affords to our secret intelligence agencies powers that are not normally made available to them. A sunset clause is critical to that. Ten years is not a sunset clause. It is more than the life span in the parliament of most members of this parliament. Most people who come into this parliament exit before 10 years. This sunset end clause covers a longer period than the average political life span of someone in the House of Representatives. I am not sure how many of the members of the House who are here now think they are going to be here in 10 years. I have bad news for most of them: most of them will not be, and that includes the Attorney and me. Ten years is not a period that parliaments generally adopt. In my speech on the second reading, I made reference to the situation in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has laws not dissimilar to these. In fact, I think it is fair to say that the Australian government has to some extent sought to model a number of the provisions of our raft of legislation on what transpires in the United Kingdom. The UK has had to deal with terrorist attacks on a number of occasions at and home-tragic, terrible incidents that still plague them. Against that background, the United Kingdom parliament has put in place a 12-month sunset clause for these sorts of laws-one year. I have detailed a number of bills that this parliament dealt with when the Liberal and National parties were in opposition. They had a very different view of the world then. The Attorney-General, it seems, had a different view of the world then; at that stage he was moving amendments to sunset clauses of a far shorter duration-and, I might say, on much less contentious bills. There is no justification for the recommendation of the joint committee being ignored. The joint committee arrived at its conclusion not only because it was the unanimous view of Liberal, Labor and National members of parliament but because that was the overwhelming weight of evidence, including evidence from security agencies themselves and those who oversee them. That was the weight of evidence the committee got. I am absolutely confident that on this point the Australian people expect a sunset clause of a reasonable duration. Five years is a long sunset clause in the context of all other sunset clauses this parliament has ever adopted. Ten years is ridiculous; it is absurd. The government should relent on this. It should accept the will of the Australian people, the unanimous view of an all-party committee and-I suspect, if there was a genuine secret ballot-the view of its own backbench. (Time expired)",75
49,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"In speaking on the proposed opposition amendments to the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, let me first outline the reason for the decision for choosing 10 years. Ten years was chosen as a compromise-a compromise between a recommended sunset clause that we think would impede operational priorities and no sunset clause. The view of the agencies, which the honourable member has said we should take some cognisance of, was that there should be no sunset clause. The view of Dennis Richardson, who has been quoted with approval in this House today, was that there should be no sunset clause. I do know-having oversight of security agencies, and this is a very serious comment-that, when you have inquiries that are a substantial review of all of your operations, they are resource intensive and they impact significantly on operational priorities. Quite frankly, I do not think that it serves ests to be taking the key people in organisations like ASIO away from identifying the real terrorist threats and requiring them to go before a parliamentary committee, or another form of review, every three years, justifying why those powers are necessary. In the circumstances that we presently face-which nobody can tell us are going to abate-I do not think that is thought to be desirable. I make this point very strongly, and I am prepared to go to any forum, any place, at any time, with the honourable member and argue it. I think Australians would understand why, in those circumstances-the circumstances we face-you would choose the longer rather than the shorter period. That is the reason. I can go to the debating points. You found a few Liberal members who, when they had not focused on these arguments clearly, were prepared to say, ‘We will compromise with you in a parliamentary committee.' We found a few Labor premiers who said in the COAG process that 10 years was appropriate. Our premiers outweigh your backbenchers. Is that the debating point we want to make? The view of those in government who have to deal with these very serious issues was that 10 years was an appropriate time for the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 to exist before the sunset clause comes into effect. Our view is that, as it is sunsetting then, this legislation should sunset at the same time. I find the arguments very compelling.",77
50,Mr BEVIS,AYES,"If there were any substance at all in what the Attorney-General just said, then you would have to reflect on the dire straits the United Kingdom is in today. You would have to reflect on the enormous burden placed on the security intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6-these people who are not able to do their job because the parliament in the United Kingdom-indeed, the government in our interthe United Kingdom-support a sunset clause for these laws of not once every 10 years, not once every five years, not-as we did have-once every three years, but of once a year. If there were any truth in the Attorney General's statement-which, amongst the good-humoured banter across this chamber, he prefaced by saying-and this was the serious point-that it impeded the security agencies; if there were a shred of credibility in that one serious point the Attorney General sought to put before the parliament-then you would have to conclude that our cousins in the United Kingdom have really got no hope, because they are caught in the bind of forever having to divert resources from chasing terrorists to getting prepared for the next annual review. That is patently nonsense. A cursory knowledge of the situation with anti-terrorist activity in the United Kingdom would tell you that they have amongst the most sophisticated and capable networks and organisations in the world in dealing with these matters. Are they impeded because their parliament quite rightly says that these secret intelligence agencies, exercising these powers that are not normal in a free and liberal democracy, have to return once a year to the parliament, which has to satisfy itself once a year that these powers should be extended for a further 12 months? Of course they are not. They have not suffered any back because of that. Is the Labor Party proposing that there should be a 12-month sunset clause? No, we are not. We are proposing that there should be a five-year sunset clause. A five-year set clause is very generous. It is very genershould ous to the government and very generous to the intelligence agencies. Is the Attorney General seriously saying that the reason the parliament should not review this matterthat these laws should stand, in the normal course of events, for 10 years-is that to ask our security and intelligence agencies to provide advice in five years time somehow stops them chasing down terrorists for the next five years? What total nonsense. I cannot believe that the Attorney-General of Australia, who has responsibility for these matters, could stand in the parliament and proffer that as the serious point to be made in this debate. Ten years is not a sunset clause. I think the one important thing that the Attorney-General said was that it was a compromise. And he then, I think accurately, said it was a compromise between having none and having one. The government view is that there should be none and so, if you are going to have one, you should make it as absurdly long as you possibly can, and that is precisely what the government have done here. It is absurdly long. A 10-year sunset clause does not stand any test of operational requirement; nor does it stand any test of reasonableness in the public mind. Labor will persist with this amendment. The Attorney-General commented that perhaps there were some Liberal backbenchers on the committee who supported this because they had not properly reflected on it. I imagine they have had some counsel from senior Liberal Party members as to how they might reflect on these things. In fact, they had reflected on it before. Indeed, this is the set- second time this committee has recommended a five-year sunset clause. The members of this committee knew full well what the government view was. They knew what it was last November and they made it clear sunthat they disagreed with it. They said it be a five-year sunset clause. They knew what it was then and they knew the government did not like it, but they also knew that it was a standard that was important for democratic principles. These sorts of laws should not stand unexamined for 10 years. A five-year sunset clause is generous. The government are wrong on this and they know they are wrong on this. It is a pity that the Attorney-General seems unwilling to accept the common sense position that the committee has put and which is included in my amendments.",77
51,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"The intent here is to have a full review. If you look at page 62 of the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, it is repealing a paragraph which speaks of a review by January of the operational effectiveness and the implications of division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act. This is not just another vote in the parliacourse ment within which the provisions continue. This is about a sunset clause and a review. We have just been through a review, and I know what impact it had on the organisation and its officers. I know the amount of time that had to be spent, and I know the focus that goes into a review and into justifying the continuation of those particular powers and answering all the questions. If it were just a matter of coming in for a parliamentary vote where the government's numbers were going to do it and you were going to have a debate, that would be one thing. That is what a sunset clause is about. This is not just about a sunset clause-it is about a sunset clause with a review. That is what it is about. If you want to impede operational effectiveness, then you take the key people out of your organisation and put them to the task of writing reports and submissions, and then having to submit to examination, monitor what everybody else says and look at how you are going to reply to that. And you must ask yourself the question: does that help with your principal task-that of identifying people of concern-when you have very stretched numbers of people undertaking that work? I can speak truthfully on this, because I have sat down with the people involved and I know what is involved in preparing for these committee examinations, and I know it impedes operational effectiveness. That is why we chose a longer period-because we do not believe this risk is going to abate in three years or in five years, and nor does anybody else. The government rejects the amendment proposed by the opposition.",79
52,Mr BEVIS,AYES,"I will not prolong the debate beyond this brief contribution that I want to make now, but I do think it is important to put into some context what the Attorney-General just said. Of this is not just about a sunset clause per se; it is also about the review that goes hand in glove with it. In the process of a review, it is right that some demands are placed on the agencies involved. That is how it should be in a democracy. In a democracy, the people are actually entitled to call upon those in government and those in the bureaucracy to explain themselves, especially so in areas where those people are afforded extraordinary powers and, of necessity, have to act in a secret manner. We are talking here about extraordinary powers and about agencies that are not like normal government departments that are subject to, let us say, Senate estimate reviews a couple of times a year. That can never be the case when you are dealing with government agencies involved in protecting Australians from terrorist threats. We all understand that and support that. But that is precisely why, when these extraordinary powers are made available, people should account for themselves on a reasonable periodic basis and for the need for these laws to continue to be in force. Is once every five years onerous? I do not think people in Australia would regard that as onerous. I do not think most people involved in the process would regard that as onerous. If you do not have that sort of process then you do run the risk of long-serving governments, in particular, establishing procedures that may be out of kilter with what the community wish. Ten years is a long time. We have an election next year. It may well be that Labor could win the election and be in office for the next 10 years, just as the Liberal Party have been in office for the last 10 years. It is appropriate, irrespective of who happens to be in office, that these sorts of reviews are conducted using a reasonable time line. A five-year sunset clause is, I repeat, very generous-five years is a generous period for the agencies to operate. Is a review in 4½ years going to stop the agencies in their work of trying to track down and deal with terrorists? No, it is not. If the Attorney-General is genuinely saying that then there is a serious mismanagement issue in his department if a review in 4½ years is somehow going to materially prevent Australian security agencies from doing their job. If that is the testimony on the Hansard transcript the Attorney General wants to give then so be it, but it is a damning indictment of himself and his department if he wants Australians to believe that asking our security agencies to go before a review in 4½ years is going to somehow stop them from tracking down terrorists. Of course it will not. What it will do is put some better balance into the democratic principles upon which this parliament and this country are founded. Without it, we will be worse off, the nation will be worse off and our democracy will be worse off. The members of the committee knew that. That is why every single one of them supported a five-year review. That is the proper course to be followed. I think it is a sad reflection on the government that they want to hold firm to this view that that sort of balance between necessary powers and important principles of accountability and democracy should be so easily jettisoned.

54,Ms MACKLIN,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (1.43 pm)The amendments before the House ought not be necessary. Last December, if the Howard government had finally, after 10 long years, delivered the real welfare reform that Australia needs, the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 would not be before the House. However, as history will regretfully record, the Howard government did not deliver real welfare reform. It did not tackle the reasons people are not working and it did not deliver practical solutions. Instead, it used its complete control of the parliament to ram through extreme and incompetent changes. Some of that incompetence has already come home to roost, with the need for additional amendments that the government, in its unseemly haste, failed to make in the previous bills. In the context of the new welfare regime, Labor does not oppose this bill. The bill largely adds consistency to the botched changes of last year. It extends some benefits that are open to single parenting payment recipients, such as the 14-week bereavement period, to principal carers on the dole. But, of course, it would be unnecessary to do this if the government were not dumping people onto the dole in the first place. The bill also applies some more consistency across similar groups receiving different payments, such as providing for a seasonal workers preclusion period for students and new apprentices claiming youth allowance. However, the bill does not amend what needs to be amended most: it does not scrap the incompetent welfare changes that leave people with less incentive to work than they had before. These changes cut income support for vulnerable Australians and reduce the rewards from work. The government has consistently ignored and, with this bill, tinues to ignore the impact of putting people on lower welfare payments. That means not just an immediate loss of money but also a disastrous effect on people's ability to work their way out of poverty. The basic cut to the money in people's pockets is bad enough-a cut of around $20 a week for single parent families and a cut of around $40 a week for people with a disability-but, from 1 July next year, many people who would have received the disability support pension or the single parenting payment will instead be dumped onto Newstart, which most people call the dole. By 2008-09, according to the government's own figures, 60,000 people with a disability who previously would have received the disability support pension will receive instead the dole, as will 77,000 single parents who previously would have received the parenting payment. The dole not only provides less money to these vulnerable Australians, whose circumstances are associated with many additional expenses; it also has a lower ‘free' area, higher withdrawal rates and a harsher tax treatment than both the disability pension and the single parenting payment. That means that, when they are dumped onto the dole, these people will get to keep less of each dollar that they earn. Last year the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling undertook modelling research on these changes. According to their research-which the government never even tried to refute-if a sole parent with one child did the right thing and worked 15 hours a week, they would only keep $81 of their earnings while the government would claw back the other $114 in tax and in social security payments they would lose. That would make such a parent $91 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they had moved into work under the conprevious arrangements. The government was effectively telling sole parents to work for a return of $3.88 an hour. For their 15 hours of work a week, they would be only $58 ahead of somebody who was not working-and that is before they have to pay for the costs of work such as travel, clothing and other things. For people with a disability, the situation is even worse, because the disability support pension is not taxable but the dole is. According to NATSEM again, if a person with a disability worked 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they would keep only 25c of every dollar they earned, while John Howard would take back the other 75c. That would make such a person $122 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under the previous arrangements. Effectively, the government was telling people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 an hour-and, again, that is before taking into account the costs of work. Under these changes, people could very easily end up paying to work. What greater symbol of incompetence could there be than promising welfare reform but delivering a policy to make work less desirable than welfare? That is exactly what these changes have meant for these very vulnerable people. In Tuesday's budget, Treasurer Costello announced $37 billion in tax cuts and a $10 billion surplus but, unfortunately, he could not find a way to fix this mess. He could not find a way to reverse the damage that these welfare changes have done to incentive. It is fair to say that the budget provided some financial work incentives, largely as a consequence of the government adopting tax proposals that have been outlined by Labor over the last year. The new effective tax threshold of $10,000 goes some way to improving incentives for those moving from welfare to work and for parents returning to work. But, despite these changes, sole parents and people with a disability will still go backwards when Welfare to Work measures are implemented from July this year, with marginal tax rates increasing by up to 20c in the dollar. Since the legislation was rammed through in December, the government has broken its promise to provide an extra 4,000 places in disability open employment services to help people who already receive the disability support pension to move into work. These places will go instead to people with a disability who are on the dole, which is further evidence that the government is not serious about helping people on the disability support pension move to work. Then there is the government's refusal to encourage people who are on welfare to get training so that they can acquire the skills that employers need. Once you are on the dole, you cannot satisfy your mutual obligation requirements by studying or training and you cannot access the pensioner education supplement. This bill does nothing to fix these very major flaws in last year's changes. Of course, you cannot fix faulty foundations with a very thin coat of paint. Labor supports welfare reform that goes far beyond moving people from a welfare queue to the dole queue. Labor believes that people who can work should work and, for those who cannot work, we should provide care and respect. Instead, unfortunately, these changes make it harder for people on welfare who cannot work-and they make it harder finally has still for those who can. (Quorum formed)",81
55,Mr WAKELIN,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 is an important part of the government's reform agenda at a time when we have an ageing population and a relatively high level of welfare dependencyalthough it is much lower than it could have been, because of strong employment as a result of this government's policies. We all know that the best form of welfare is a job. The three principles that underline the bill are that people who have the capacity and are available to work should do so, the best form of family income comes from a job rather than welfare, and services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible. At 5.1 per cent we are now at a 29-year low in our unemployment rate. There is now a shortage of workers and not a shortage of jobs. It is quite a remarkable turnaround in a relatively short period, particularly in the 10 years of this coalition government. I remind the House that, even though we have been able to remove a lot of people from the unemployment list and the trainee and apprenticeship rates are a very stark improvement, there are still 2.6 million on welfare, only 15 per cent of whom are required to actively search for a job. Passive welfare payments with no obligations lock people out of participating in Australia's prosperity and can in many cases condemn them to a lifetime of poverty. There will be changes in criteria from 1 July: parents who apply for the single parenting payment will no longer be eligible once their youngest child turns eight but will be eligible for a Newstart allowance. While the success of this government's economic policies has seen us achieve a 29year low in the unemployment rate at 5.1 per cent, it is vital that we keep the momentum going and that we challenge the mindset. The best thing for people is to seek employment and to move away from welfare as best they can. We need to do that in as humane and compassionate a way as possible. It is vital that the momentum of higher participation in the workforce of people of working age, now at 73.6 per cent, be maintained. I make a couple of observations about my own electorate. Unemployment rates have moved in the last 13 years from levels of 17 per cent and 18 per cent in various communities and are now heading towards five per cent-somewhere near the national average, which was unheard of and probably not thought to be possible six years ago. Such is the success of the policies of this government. The principle that the best form of family income comes from a job is an important focus that this government is bringing through this legislation. I would remind our opponents that there is a cocktail of measures-low interest rates, Work for the Dole, incentives for apprenticeships and generally challenging the concept of passive welfarewhich are now giving Australians the best possible outcome that is available within a democratic and compassionate society. We encourage people to consider their options. There are a whole range of measures which I would commend to the House. We should remind ourselves that even something like Work for the Dole, which was considered to be a radical measure when it was first introduced, has given wonderful",83

If this budget is, as the Treasurer claims, a budget for the future, why does it forecast a decline in labour market participation, cut the percentage spent on skills and training, fail to guarantee the delivery of extra child-care places, forecast an increase in the current account deficit and forecast slower growth in business investment? Given that each of these is conceded in the budget papers, how can the Treasurer claim that this is a budget for the future?",84

This is a budget that has been received well by the Australian community and even endorsed by the Australian Labor Party. There is no point coming back into the House and trying to renew an attack today after surrendering yesterday in the first question time following budget. The paucity and the feebleness of the attack of the Australian Labor Party on this budget illustrates what Australians know: it is a good budget, it invests for our it is right for our economy. Vocational Education and Training",84
63,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister advise the House of barriers to the provision of genuine training opportunities to young Australians in some states, particularly New South Wales and Western Sydney?",85
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for her question. She is right in her question to raise concerns about the barriers that exist against young people receiving in this country genuine training opportunities. There are two areas of concern that the government has that are working against opportunities being available to young people. They are the continuing opposition to school based apprenticeships in both New South Wales and Western Australia. This is a matter that I raised at the COAG meeting in February this year. At that meeting I received an undertaking from all of the premiers. Let me say that in some states of Australia-and Queensland is a state that comes to mindthere are no barriers to school based apprenticeships. But in New South Wales the union dominated award system results in there being barriers to school based apprenticeships. The existence of these provisions still in both New South Wales and Western Australia is holding up the formation of four of the Australian technical colleges in those two states. Why is it that technical colleges are open for business and going ahead in Queensland but they are not in some other states? I notice my colleagues representing the aspirations of young people in these parts of Australia nodding in agreement because they know that the the opposition to school based apprenticeships, which we all know is nurtured by the union movement, which has a stranglehold on the apprenticeship system in New South future and Wales and Western Australia",85
65,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I do. In relation to this, I certainly do give credit where it is due and deliver criticism where it is deserved. On this issue the union movement is holding back training opportunities for young Australians. As a result of that I have written to both the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of Western Australia urging them to use the authority of their office to make sure that these barriers against school based apprenticeships are removed. If anybody imagines that the imperfections between the various states of Australia do not produce absurdities, let me remind the House of some of the absurdities that exist in the very disuniform, dysfunctional training system between the various states. For example, a qualified carpenter cannot move from the ACT to New South Wales-and that is not very far-without having to get a licence fromMs King interjecting",85

68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading, which may require a further formal assessment and additional costs. Trade Recognition Australia can consider an electrician from the United Kingdom to be competent but, when he or she arrives here, they have to resit a trade test which can take up to eight months and they cannot work in the meantime. A hairdresser who has gained a hairdressing qualification from a private college in Victoria can get a job in London but not in Western Australia. These are some of the barriers to training opportunities. But the worse barrier of all is the opposition in New South Wales and Western Australia. They are states with which my opposite number is very familiar. The existence of school based apprenticeships in those two states is standing in the way of training opportunities for young Australians. They ought to be swept away, and I hope the Leader of the Opposition joins me in urging the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of Western Australia to improve the training opportunities for young Australians in those two states. Economy",85
69,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer inform the House when Australia's current account deficit will go down?,86
70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia's current account deficit is governed by both exports and imports. The period in which the current account was last in surplus was around 200001, when the Australian dollar was at 47c or 48c. One of the features of having a very high exchange rate, as we have at the moment, is that imports are much cheaper in Australian dollar terms and exports are much more expensive in Australian dollar terms. Because of the high commodity prices and the high exchange rate, the Australian economy is sucking in a lot of imports which, except in commodity areas, are affecting our exports. We expect that the rapid investment in Australia's mining industry over recent years, where there has been something like $30 billion of investment, will boost capacity and ensure that volumes of those exports go up. As a consequence of that, exports will be stronger in the years that lie ahead. Economy",86
71,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline the results of the latest world competitiveness report? How have we improved our performance?,86
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He is referring to the release of the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook in 2006. I inform the House that, according to the world competitiveness scoreboard, in 2006 Australia moved from ninth place to sixth place as the most competitive economy. According to this survey, the No. 1 competitive economy in the world was the United States, followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, Iceland, Denmark and Australia. On the world competitiveness scoreboard of large countries-countries of 20 million people or more-Australia ranked second, because Hong Kong, Singapore, Iceland and Denmark were not included. The World Competitiveness Survey has four broad areas: economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure. Australia has moved up in the rankings on economic performance. Australia performs extremely well on the ranking of government efficiency and business efficiency. Australia is also ranked in relation to infrastructure. The IMD began preparing this competitiveness survey in 1989. In 1989, Australia was ranked 10th in the world. Over the next six years, we declined to 16th in the world, in 1995. In 1995, the current Leader of the Opposition became Minister for Finance. When he became finance minister in 1995, we dropped from 16th to 21st in the world, which was our lowest ranking ever. The Australian economy bottomed out to 21st in the world under the Labor Party government-a period which the Leader of the Opposition seems to have completely erased from his memory, but he has a history and he has a record, and he will be reminded of his record over and over again in the years to come. Anyway, we bottomed at 21st in the world, the government was thrown out of office, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance was thrown out of office, and Australia has been coming back ever since, reaching the sixth position this year. Comparing Australia with other developed economies in the world such that we came in sixth-or, as a large country, second-is a comparatively new thing. Back when the Labor Party was in office, the Labor Party did not like to compare Australia with other developed economies. Who could ever forget the report that was given by the then Assistant Treasurer, the then member for Canberra, Mr MCMullan, when he attended the IMF meetings in Washington in 1991? He reported as follows on his return from Washington: Three things struck me during the course of the meetings: first, we should never forget our relatively favourable situation. I read the words published by the Assistant Treasurer: As I have said before in these articles, when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in our good fortune. We do not compare ourselves with Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. These days, we tend to compare ourselves with the developed economies of the world. Australia has moved from the ninth to the sixth position, and that is a result of strong economic management. Foreign Debt",86
73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer inform the House when Australia's half a trillion dollars in foreign debt will go down?,87

80,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a result of the efforts of this government, the Australian government has no net debt. We have repaid $96 billion of Labor debt.

82,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of that, every dollar that has been borrowed overseas is owned by the private sector.

87,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Can the minister advise the House about the ongoing role of state occupational health and safety systems under Work Choices?,88
88,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for his question, because there has been a lot of talk over the last week or so about the role of state occupational health and safety systems under Work Choices. As I made it clear last week, and I make it clear again today, occupational health and safety falls clearly under the jurisdiction of the states and territories. Indeed, this was conceded in the High Court by the Solicitor General for the state of Western Australia in the current case. The reality is that the new workplace laws, Work Choices, do not override the jurisdictional responsibility of the states and territories. Employers must continue to meet their obligations under state and territory occupational health and safety laws. In the legislation in every state and territory in Austhere are significant penalties for those who do not meet their obligations. So, contrary to the misleading and hysterical claims that are being made by the Leader of the Opposition, workers can continue to receive training under Work Choices. Today we had the Leader of the Opposition-as we have had him over the last few days-on the Today show on Channel 9 suggesting that it was an ‘absurd and, indeed, evil thing in the industrial relations laws that workers would be forbidden'-his word‘from receiving safety training and union training'. That is the claim made, once again this morning, by the Leader of the Opposition, which has also been made over the last week or so. It is interesting that, while this is what the Leader of the Opposition is saying, there are at least some members of his front-bench who know that that is not the case. My office was contacted by a concerned member of the public who had emailed a question to the member for Lilley. The question stated: So the impression being given that employers are subject to $30,000 fines if they send employees to Union run safety training courses is misleading? That was the question emailed to the member for Lilley. After consulting-according to the email-with the member for Perth, this was the answer that was given. Remember the question: ‘the impression given that employers are subject to a $30,000 fine if they send employees to union run safety training courses is misleading'. The email back from the office of the member for Lilley says: Yes, that is correct. It goes on: Employees attending union run training cannot be included in an agreement as a condition of employment, but an employer can send employees to union training. Whilst we have the Leader of the Opposition making claims, as he was again this morning on Australian television and as he has been doing for the last week in this country, at least the member for Lilley and presumably the member for Perth were prepared to tell the truth when asked a question directly by a constituent about this. This gives the lie to what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. The whistle has been blown once again on the Leader of the Opposition, and I table the emails. Economy",88
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and it refers to an answer he gave a couple of moments ago on the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. Is the Treasurer aware that on economic performance the yearbook concluded that, on the current account balance, Australia was ranked 41st out of 61 countries; on export of goods as a percentage of GDP Australia was ranked 54th out of 61 countries; on trade to GDP ratio Australia was ranked 57th of the 61 countries; on the real short-term interest rate Australia was ranked 45th out of 61 countries; on overall productivity-real growth-Australia was ranked 54th out of 61 countries; and on skill shortages, on qualified engineers, Australia was ranked 39th out of 61 countries? Treasurer, how does it feel having Australia ranked 54th out of 61 countries in export performance on your watch as the minister responsible for boosting this country's export performance?",89

93,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Too clever by half; the question was: ‘How does it feel?' Let me tell you how it feels. It feels 15 places better than when the Labor Party was in government. I think there are 16 teams in the AFL; if you rose 15 places you would go from the bottom to the top-and it is because this government reformed the taxation system, balanced the budget, paid off debt, saw Australia through the Asian financial crisis, came through the international recession of 2000 and put 1.7 million people back to work. So how does it feel? It feels really good to have no Labor government in this country. Mr Tanner interjecting",89
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne is warned. Employment,89
95,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the labour force figures released this morning. How does unemployment compare with previous experience, and how do government policies on employment compare with previous policies to deal with unemployment?",89
96,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. I can inform him that in April the labour force figures showed that the unemployment rate in Australia was 5.1 per cent, marginally up from what it was in March. While part-time employment fell in the month of April by 25,900, full-time employment increased in April by 22,700. So, although we lost 25,000-odd part-time jobs, we gained 22,000-odd full-time jobs. As a consequence, although the unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.1 per cent it is still at 28or 29-year lows. How does this compare with previous unemployment rates in Australia? I would like to take the House back to May 1993, when the unemployment rate-and bear in mind that today it is 5.1 per cent-under a Labor government was 10.6 per cent. The then Labor government commissioned a caucus committee, chaired by the member for Lilley, to come up with ideas as to how to solve unemployment-which was then at 10.6 per cent. The chair of the caucus committee, the member for Lilley, came up with a great idea for reducing unemployment. His idea was to drop the age qualification for the age pension from 65 to 60 and reclassify everybody over 60 as retired rather than unemployed. He told the AM program on 31 May 1993 that the pension age could be lowered to 60 and they could be put on provisional age pensions. He said it was cruel for men aged 60 to 65",89
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: if we are going to go into we should go into his history, when he had an inflation rate of 11 per cent per annum.",90
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. That is not a point of order.,90
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it was pointed out that putting men aged 60 on the pension may not solve the whole of the unemployment problem, the member for Lilley said one of the other options that they had was to drop the age pension qualification age to 55 for men, to reclassify everybody over 55 as retired and to put them on the age pension. Can I say nothing would have been a more short-sighted policy, because we now know people are living longer, we now know we want them to engage in the workforce longer and we now want to encourage them to work, because the problem in Australia today is not mass unemployment. Let me make this point to the House: mass unemployment is a Labor outcome. Labor produces mass unemployment. Mass unemployment is not a problem today. Today your problem is going to be more like finding enough workers, because there are enough jobs for people to get in the Australian economy. This government does not believe in reducing the age pension and giving it to 55-year-olds so it can reclassify them out of the unemployment queues; this government believes in getting people real jobs in the real economy. And 1.7 million new jobs have been created under this government because we never gave up on the unemployed, we never accepted Labor's solution, we never changed the definition and we gave them an opportunity in life, an opportunity they would never have got under the Labor Party.

102,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer read the comments of the Chief Executive Officer of the National Family Day Care Council, who said in today's Sydney Morning Herald: “You can have all the theoretical places in the world, but if you can't find carers then they remain political promises ... Treasurer, if there is a shortage of qualified carers, how will the places you talked about in your budget address be delivered? Isn't the Treasurer misleading parents and raising false hopes when the truth is these places will not be delivered, because they cannot be?",90
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said in the budget speech on Tuesday night, in 1996 there were 300,000 child-care places; in 2009-wait for it-there will be 700,000 child-care places in Australia. That is a more than doubling over the last 10 years. How does the government go about child care? Firstly, with the child-care benefit; secondly, with the child-care rebate which will become payable-30 per cent of out-of-pocket costs up to $4,000 per annum per child-and, thirdly, with no cap at all on places. That means an eligible church, an eligible council or an eligible private operator can set up in any area where there is excess demand and can have a facility which will attract government funding. This is broad ranging, wide term reform which will mean that the opportunities will come to create those child-care places for Australian families. Budget 2006-07",91
104,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House and my Ryan electorate how this week's budget reinforces the government's commitment to the Medicare system? Are there any alternative policies? What is the government's response?,91
105,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to say to the member for Ryan and to his constituents that this has been a great week for Medicare. This week's budget commits $1.9 billion to mental health, there is $250 million to the health workforce and there is $500 million to the Australian Better Health Initiative, as well as a record $905 million in new money for health and medical research. In a year when our economy is tipped to grow to $1 trillion, federal health spending will reach $48 billion. And there is a clear message in this: Peter Costello is the best Treasurer Medicare has ever had. I have been asked about alternative policies, and let us give credit where it is due. I applaud the Leader of the Opposition's belated decision to finally dump the Medicare Gold policy. It takes a bit of guts for Mr Twenty-Four Per Cent to ditch the policy belonging to Madam Thirty-Two Per Cent over there, but that is what he said last week. This week the member for Lalor was asked, ‘Will you be maintaining some of the principles of Medicare Gold?' and she said yes. And just this very day I go onto the ALP website and I see a reference to a Medicare Gold ad which has the voice of Mark Latham saying: ‘No more delays, no more waiting lists; this is an important extension of the universal coverage of Medicare. We call it Medicare Gold.' So they have taken his hat off the website but they have still got his ad on the website. And the website encourages people to play this ad over and over and over and over again, so you have got the ghost that walks, you have got the policy that talks and it is still on the Labor Party's website. I will say this: a political party with no health policy whatsoever will never be in government. It will never be in government, and it does not matter how many speeches he gets Bob Ellis to write for him. Budget 2006-07",91
106,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, how many of these child-care places will be delivered to parents and filled by children in one year's time?",91
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That depends, of course, on the amount of demand and the number of people that are going to supply them. But we said in our budget that we expect to have 700,000 in 2009, an additional 25,000 places, which makes it 400,000 more than ever existed under the Australian Labor Party. Budget 2006-07",91
108,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister advise the House how the new budget measures strengthen Australia's consular services and crisis response capacities?,92
109,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member very much for his question and his interest. Australia provides excellent consular services. They are at least as good if better than those of any other country, and I think other countries appreciate and recognise this. We have 173 consular locations around the world-that is, DFAT posts, Austrade posts and honorary consulates. We also have a consular-sharing agreement with Canada at 24 different posts. There has been an enormous growth in the demand for consular services. Australians make almost five million overseas trips a year, and that represents a 40 per cent increase over the last three years. In 2005 DFAT managed an unprecedented number of major overseas emergencies. Honourable members will recall the tsunami, the London and Bali bombings, the Douglas Wood kidnapping in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina, to name the most important of them. In the six months to December 2005 consular operations assisted some 10,800 Australians, following on from the 25,000 Australians who were assisted in the previous 12 months. I just make the point that there is enormous demand for these services, and it is important that the government does its best to try to meet that demand. Obviously there are circumstances where we are limited in what we can do. Nevertheless, in the Treasurer's excellent budget we have committed an extra $80.2 million over four years to manage the growing demands of consular casework and to enhance our contingency planning and crisis response capabilities. Included is funding for additional DFAT as well as Austrade consular staff in Canberra and overseas, backed by an enhanced training program and a major upgrade of DFAT's crisis and case management systems and the DFAT crisis centre. In conclusion let me say two things about this. First of all, we as a government have been very committed to providing good consular services. That has been a very high prinot ority for me, for the department and for the government as a whole. Second, and I often say this, ultimately there is a limit to what we can do. Certainly, when it comes to the law, there are no special laws for Australians overseas. Australians are required to abide by the laws of the countries which they visit. If Australians do at least allegedly breach those laws-certainly if they are convicted for a breach of those laws-there is very little we can do. It is not possible for the Australian government to spring people out of foreign prisons. People have to adhere to the laws of the countries or the jurisdictions within which they find themselves. Budget 2006-07",92
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer agree  the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, that skills shortages are ‘the No. 1 complaint of investors in this country'? Why then do the Treasurer's own budget papers show that funding for vocational education and training will fall as a total proportion of Commonwealth expenditure, from 0.75 per cent in the current financial year to 0.67 per cent in 2009-10?",92
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government has put in place a system of training and apprenticeships which is better than anything Australia has had for a decade. The budget includes $1.4 billion in initiatives to promote vocational education and training, including $537 million to extend youth allowance to apprenticeships. It has $350 million for 25 Australian technical colleges. It has $143 million to improve careers advice. It has $120 million for tool kits and $106 million for the Commonwealth trade-learning scholarships. The total funding for VET has more than doubled over the last 10 years, from $1 billion in 1995-96 to $2.55 billion in 2006. So funding has more than doubled since the Australian Labor Party was rightly thrown out of office. This support is delivering results. The total number of new apprenticeships doubled from 156,700 in 1996 to 397,800 in September 2005. The number of new apprenticeships in traditional trades increased from 120,000 in 1996 to 168,000 in September 2005. So on any measure, whether it is spending, whether it is apprenticeships, whether it is VET or whether it is Commonwealth investment in technical colleges, the Commonwealth has a bigger investment now than it has ever had in the past. One of the good things is that, if you are training at the moment and you do get a trade or a skill, your chances of getting a job are very good. I have been in this House since 1990, and I never, ever heard anybody complain about the difficulty of finding workers for jobs back in 1990. I heard a lot of complaints about the fact that there was mass unemployment and a shortage of jobs for workers. In the six years of Labor government that I experienced whilst I sat in opposition I never, ever heard anybody ever suggest that there was a problem in finding workers for jobs. Why? I will tell you why, Mr Speaker: unemployment was at 10.6 per cent. If I had the choice between an economy in which there were more jobs going than workers and an economy in which there were more workers going than jobs, I know which one I would choose. I know which one the Australian public would choose. I know what the Australian public would think the better problem was: a shortage of labour rather than excess labour. Let me say it again: the Labor Party is a party of mass unemployment. That was its record in 1993. The Liberal and National parties in the coalition stand, above all else, for jobs, and there have been 1.7 million new jobs in Australia since 1996. Airport Security",92
112,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister update the House on steps the government is taking to provide greater security at Australia's major airports? What additional funding has been provided through the budget to respond to the recent review of aviation security?,93
113,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question and acknowledge his particular interest in the Cairns airport and indeed the other major airports in Australia. He is as aware as any of the solid effort that this government has been putting in over recent times to improve security at Australian airports and to ensure that Australia's travelling public have a safe and secure environment. This budget is further demonstration of the government's commitment to aviation security. As a result of this budget we have now committed $886 million in response to the Wheeler review recommendations. It is a very significant commitment. There is $355 million to improve community policing at airports and $176 million for additional counter-terrorism first response capabilities at our major airports, and that is on top of the existing expenditure on that counter-terrorism function and our canine capacity at those airports. There is $48 million for new initiatives for cargo security, and a significant amount of that will be for additional mobile X-ray units and explosivedetecting dog teams to examine the cargo that is placed on our aircraft. There will also be more money for explosive trace detection equipment and for a variety of trials to test some of the promising new emerging technologies in relation to security and explosive detection techniques. These are very significant initiatives and bring to $1.1 billion this government's investment in aviation security initiatives since September 11 2001. We take aviation security seriously. We are committed to a safer and more secure environment for all Australians who travel in the skies. It is perhaps evidence of the opposition's interest in this issue that they have not bothered to comment at all on the importance of these matters in their response to this environment. They are full of criticism, but in reality they do nothing. Australian Technical Colleges",93
114,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer to his previous answer, in which he referred to technical colleges. Is the Treasurer aware that only one student is enrolled at the Gladstone technical college, that there are fewer than 100 students enrolled in the other three Australian technical colleges currently open for business and that three promised colleges may not open at all? Treasurer, doesn't this mean that your colleges will produce fewer than 100 qualified tradespeople by 2010, the year the Australian Industry Group estimates we will need an extra 100,000 tradespeople?",94
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said earlier, the Australian government has set aside money to build Australian technical colleges: $350 million for 25 of them. Four of those technical colleges are currently open, in Port Macquarie, east Melbourne, Gladstone and the Gold Coast. This is the first time the Australian government has ever set aside money for technical colleges, and people might wonder why it took until 2005 for the Australian government to get into the business of funding and establishing Australian technical colleges. The reason why it took until 2005 for the Australian government to establish Australian technical colleges was that, since the dawn of Federation, the states used to run technical schools which were open to secondary students who wanted a career. Why are those technical schools no longer open in the state of Victoria? There are now no technical schools. Let me tell you why, and it is very instructive: when the socialist Left took control of the Victorian government, under Mother Russia herself, Joan Kirner-the same faction as was advised by the then junior member for Jagajaga-they decided as an arm of policy to abolish technical schools in the state of Victoria. It was an arm of policy. It was decided that all students should go to comprehensive high schools and, as a matter of policy, all technical schools in Victoria were closed.",94

117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith is warned!,94
118,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In addition to that, the Australian Labor Party, under John Dawkins, adopted a policy of sending every student to university. That was not appropriate for a lot of students who needed technical training. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. We were not talking about universities. We are talking about",94
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is in order.,94
120,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of that, people who were not aiming at university study were required to go into technical training",94
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: this is about the budget and technical colleges. There are 100 students, including one",94
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not a point of order. After the last point of order, the Treasurer had not even completed a sentence. The Treasurer will be heard.",95
123,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of that, there were people who were apt at technical training, who wanted it and who would have appreciated it who were pushed into the university stream. A consequence of that is they did not have the opportunity to go to an Australian or in fact a state technical college. This is the government that stepped into remedy that defect. This is the government that set aside $350 million to do what no Australian government has ever done. This is the government that is setting up those Australian technical colleges, and for $350 million in 25 colleges it will be a very worthwhile investment. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During the Treasurer's answer, the member for Sturt on two occasions made a grossly unparliamentary remark in respect of the member for Jagajaga and I ask that you get him to withdraw it.",95
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to say I did not hear it, but if the Manager of Opposition Business finds it offensive I will ask the member for Sturt to withdraw.  unparliamentary remark? It didn't used to be. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, again on a point order: it is my clear understanding it is you who adjudicates as to what is an unparliamentary remark. You asked the member for Sturt to withdraw one; he refused to do so. Your only course now is to deal with him under the standing orders and suspend him from service of the House.",95
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will call the member for Sturt again and ask him to withdraw that statement.  Speaker, I withdraw.",95
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt will withdraw full stop.  Australian Defence Force: Recruitment,95
127,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House about what the government is doing to encourage recruitment into the Australian Defence Force?,95
128,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question and very strong commitment to Australia's Defence Force. On Tuesday night the Treasurer announced a record increased investment in Australia's Defence Force-$15.9 billion of additional expenditure over the next 10 years. That included a number of measures which are about not just the acquisition of new tanks, ships and aircraft but also significant initiatives to improve the recruitment of Australian Defence Force men and women for the regular and also the reserve forces. Further, $194 million has been committed over the next four years to provide financial incentives for the recruitment and, indeed, the retention of Defence Force personnel, particularly in 25 of the 225 areas where we have significant shortages in recruiting and retaining key people. We are also going to focus increasingly on rehabilitation and invest another $17 million. Whereas previously Defence took the approach, when an injury was sustained by a soldier or sailor, of having that person discharged, increasingly we are now working on the rehabilitation of them, both physically and emotionally, and returning them to the services. In addition to that, $184 million was announced for reserves over the next four years. That will include not just an increase in the daily tax-free payment for all reserves by $10 but also health allowances of up to $2,500 a year and increased bonuses of $5,000 a year for those who basically complete each year of reserve service. Attracting men and women to the Australian Defence Force is not just about money. Money is extremely important, but it is also important that we live in a society that values the bush? service in the Australian military. I will very shortly be receiving a report which the government commissioned from Avril Henry, which will recommend to me and the government for consideration a range of reforms. It is about our making sure that the families within Defence are cared for. It is about ings. It is about a nationally consistent cation system. It is also about making sure that Australian Defence Force cadets are valued in Australia. Whilst cadets represent one per cent of their age cohort, they represent per cent of those who join the Australian Defence Force. One of the first things the Labor Party could do, if it is serious about attracting men and women to the Australian Defence Force, is have the New South Wales government, for example, have Australian Defence Force cadets in its schools. It is extremely important that we live in a society that values vice in the Air Force, the Navy and the Army as highly as if not more highly than many other occupations. It begins with leadership and, in particular, it begins in schools. I commend to all Australians, and as a parent myself, membership in the Australian Defence Force. It is a wonderful way to make a difference to our society and bring security to our world. Budget 2006-07",95
129,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Does the Deputy Prime Minister recall his recent public boasts that this week's budget was driven by him and the National Party? Why then did the Deputy Prime Minister allow his Liberal colleague the minister for training to slash the only training incentives program targeted specifically at rural and regional areas-the Rural and Regional Skills Shortage Incentive-which provided a $1,000 extra incentive for employers to take on apprentices in",96
130,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We as a government have done more to improve skills training in regional Australia and give access for young people in regional Australia to vocational training and to university places. There has been a significant debate about skills since postTuesday night. I know that the minister reedu- sponsible has responded to this. Today the Treasurer has responded in detail. Can I just say that, on the Australian technical colleges, two of the campuses that are up and operat10 ing happen to be in my electorate. The basis on which they are there is that the private sector was running one of them before we announced our policy in the 2004 election. The reason is that the state Labor governments were cutting back on the vocational training opportunities across Australia. We announced a policy of rolling these out across Australia and providing opportunities serfor year 11 and year 12 high school students to link in with industry and be trained in advance of them taking up apprenticeships. This is a policy that has been initiated by this government, expanded by this government and funded by this government in this budget. Mr Albanese interjecting",96

133,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bass will begin his question again.,97
135,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister please inform the House about the Howard government's indexing arrangements to ensure that our schools receive the funding that they need? Minister, I would also like to ask: are you aware of any alternative policies?",97
136,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for his question and note his interest in schools funding in his area. Under the Howard government, we will be investing $9.3 billion in schools across Australia this year, and that is a record level of funding. There will be $33 billion invested in Australian schools over the period 2005-08. That is a 59 per cent increase on the previous four-year funding period. Last Tuesday in this House, the Leader of the Opposition took exception to what I said about Labor's rehashed schools policy. He did not like it when I made reference to the fact that, under their national resource standard, what will happen is that over 350 schools and 220,000 students will have their funding frozen. After question time, the Leader of the Opposition said in this House in relation to Labor's funding policy-and we have to listen to this carefully: ... they would be adjusted in order to ensure real value-that would be an upward adjustment-kept pace with inflation. Under current arrangements, every school in Australia receives a funding increase according to the average increase of the cost of sending a child to a government school. That has been running at an average of 6.4 per cent. Now, under Labor they would not be receiving their 6.4 per cent growth funding every year; each and every year under Labor there would be a 3.4 per cent cut in growth funding to schools. The Latham schools hit list is back-make no mistake. The Leader of the Opposition let the cat out of the bag. They are currently receiving 6.4 per cent. Labor have tied it to inflation. Inflation is running at three per cent. That 3.4 per cent funding hole would leave massive deficits in schools' budgets. Mr Michael Ferguson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While I was asking my question, there were constant interjections. I simply want to be able to hear the answer from the minister.",97
137,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
138,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bass raises a valid point of order. I think all members are having difficulty hearing the minister's answer. I will take action if members do not lower the level of noise. I call the minister.,97
139,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition said Labor's funding policy would keep pace with inflation. Currently schools are receiving an average of a 6.4 per cent increase; Labor are committed to a three per cent increase. That massive 3.4 per cent decrease will leave holes in every school budget, and Labor ought to come clean and admit they are still punishing independent and Catholic schools. Budget 2006-07",97
140,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to their the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Does the minister recall the Treasurer's boast in his budget night address that: We expect to double the number of fishing vessels apprehended in Australia's northern waters ... Can the minister confirm that last year Coastwatch recorded the sighting of 13,018 suspected illegal fishing vessels in Australian waters? That is an average of 35 illegal fishing vessels a day. Is the minister aware that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has revealed that this new funding will lead to the apprehension of an average of two illegal fishing vessels each day? Now that we have been told how you will deal with two illegal fishing vessels each day, what will be done about the other 33?",97
141,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and can restate the Treasurer's announcement on Tuesday night that, as part of the budget, the government has announced funding in the order of $389 million to be provided to deter illegal foreign fishing in our northern waters and ensure the sustainability of our northern fisheries and Australia's security. And that is on top of the $50 million a year announced some 12 months ago or thereabouts. That will enable us to double the current levels of apprehension and increase our surveillance capability to deal with Indonesia in a number of ways at stopping-off and departure points. So, frankly, the government has addressed this issue full-on. Budget 2006-07",98
142,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House as to how this year's budget benefits farming families and rural communities? Is the minister aware of any alternative proposals?",98
143,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. He well knows how well received the federal government's budget has been by farmers, rural communities and their representative organisations. The National Farmers Federation has stated that it is the most positive yet for regional Australians. The Victorian Farmers Federation has described it as the best budget in 11 years for rural Australiaand no wonder, because it is new and increased funding of $700 million for agriculture, fisheries and forestry. A major feature of the budget initiative is to improve retiring farmers' capacity to access the age pension. This government has announced new treatment of rural land under the pension assets test, which means those of age pension age living on rural properties who have at least a 20-year attachment to the land may have their property excluded from the assets test for age pension and carer payments. This is a remarkable and not yet widely enough understood initiative by the government. This announcement will allow up to 10,000 retired farmers a higher rate of pension or access to the pension for the first time. It will improve their living standards and allow them to remain in their family home on the family property, which has often been in the family for generations. This side of the House understands primary producers, farmers and rural communities-and no wonder. Looking over my shoulder I can see grain growers, cane growers, wool producers, meatworkers, jackaroos, shearers and stock and station agents, but on the Labor Party side-because I am asked about alternative policies-there is but one who has dust on his boots, who comes from a primary production background, namely the dairy industry, and that is the member for Corio. He is the only one. If the Labor Party will not do anything to save its agricultural spokesman, they will not do anything for rural Australia.",98

171,Ms PLIBERSEK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Sydney) (3.15 pm)Australian parents who are struggling to find child care, and struggling to afford it when do find it, were hanging out for relief in Tuesday night's budget. They had been listening to the Treasurer for weeks saying, ‘Watch this space.' They have seen the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs on TV saying, ‘Watch this Flag- space, we are going to do a whole heap for parents in this year's budget.' They were their breath hoping that the problems they have had in finding places and, when they do find places, affording those places would be solved in this year's budget. In fact, you cannot blame them for having those hopes. The Treasurer said in March this year at the Press Club: We ought to be looking at making this the most female friendly place on earth ... But, if there are areas where we can improve these things I would want to see that and that is going to volve work family balance. The most important thing this government can do to help families balance their work and caring responsibilities is to offer affordable, quality child care in places where parents need it. This is the test that this budget has failed. It has been a sad disappointment for parents. It has been a con. I have seen some pretty terrible advertising over the years. I have seen some pretty dodgy things advertised. I remember the slimming tea that model Sam Fox used to advertise in the papers. I remember the Fat Blaster as that said weight would drop off the minute people started taking Fat Blaster. The best one that I remember, though, from when I was a kid is the sea monkeys. Do people remember the sea monkeys? They used to be advertised on the back page of Mad magazine. There was a picture of little merpeople-mermen and merwomen-in little castles and they were swimming around having a great time. So many kids sent their money in for those sea monkeys and, I will tell you, when they got them they were terribly disappointed. This is the sea monkey budget when it comes to child care. Parents had been promised 25,000 extra places. What are they going to see? They will see not a single extra place and not a single dollar off the cost of child care. Do you know why? The reason is that the Treasurer does not understand childcare shortages and the minister in charge of child care cannot be bothered explaining it. I hope the minister actually understands what the problem is. I hope the problem is that he cannot convince the Treasurer. We see a Treasurer who just does not get it and a minister who cannot deliver to the people he should be fighting for. The government were looking for a headline such as: ‘A big number of places, 25,000 extra places.' Wouldn't that be good? We've inshortages. What did they do to get that headline? They announced a dodgy policy of uncapping family day care places and out of school hours care places. The problem has never been capping in these areas. There is not, and has not been, a cap in long day care and yet there are shortages all around the country. Why would you take the system that has delivered shortages all around the country in long day care and apply that to all of child care and somehow think that that is going to solve the problem? The government said, ‘Oh, I know, we will take the system that does not work in one area and apply it to all of child care and that is going to solve the problem.' What kind of madness is it to take the system that already does not work and extend it to solve shortages? I think that a lot of people find the different types of child care a little bit confusing, especially if they have not had kids in child care for a long time or do not have children at all. The charitable view, of course, is that the Treasurer is one of these people, but I will explain it to him. Family day care is when a carer takes children into their own home. Often four, five or sometimes more children are looked after in the carer's own home. They get about $4 an hour for each child. Someone who is providing family day care in their own home would earn about $480 a week gross for looking after, say, five children under the age of five for five days a week. Is it any wonder that people are not queueing out the door to be family day carers when this is the value that we place on their hard work? That is family day care. What is long day care and how is it different? Long day care is care in child-care centres-the sort of centre you see down the street. The smaller ones might have 30 kids. The big ones might have 90; some might have 100. That is centre based long day care. That applies to babies of usually six weeks up to children of school age. That is a differto ent thing. The Treasurer needs to understand that there is family day care and long day care-and then there is out of school hours care. That is for school age children. Ms Corcoran-Yes.",100
172,Ms PLIBERSEK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know. You would think this is obvious, but the Treasurer ously does not get it. Out of school hours care is for school age children. It can be a couple of hours before school, a couple of hours after school or vacation care. It does not take a genius to work out that out of school hours care is the cheapest to provide. Family day care is pretty cheap to provide because you are not building child-care centres, it is in the carer's own home, and not paying them very well. Long day care is quite expensive to provide but-guess what?-it is the type of care that parents need and want right now. There are city areas where you cannot find a long day care place and there are regional areas where you cannot find a long day care place, and this government will not invest a single extra cent in building long day care facilities or providing extra long day care places. The reason the government have tried to con parents is that the message has finally come through to them that there are childcare shortages, that parents extra child care that they cannot find and they cannot afford the child care once they do find it. The government were rushing around in a panic: ‘What can we do on child care?' What have they done? They have gone for the cheap political fix. Parents around Australia will be disappointed this week because they know that the government do not value their kids or their workforce participation. The government are not interested in allowing skilled workers to return to the workforce and they are not interested in providing the child care that those workers need work and that people want for their kids so that they get a great educational start in life. One of the reasons these places will never be delivered is that we have a chronic shortage of family day care workers. There is a chronic shortage of all child-care workers. The minister said it himself on the Insight obvi- program a couple of weeks ago: … right now, things like family day care are actually going under-utilised, something like 30,000 places around Australia are available and aren't being used. Why are they not being used? They are not being used because they cannot be delivered to parents as there are not the carers to deliver the places. Linda Latham, CEO of the we are National Family Day Care Council, said, ‘You can have all the theoretical places in the world, but if you can't find carers then they remain political promises.' I would go a step further and say they are empty political promises. These places will not be delivered because there is a shortage of family day care workers. If you already have 30,000 places in the system that cannot be delivered because of a shortage of workers, then how will taking the cap off places get more people into the system, deliver more places to parents and get more kids into care? It is the most illogical piece of policy tomfoolery I are crying out for have ever seen. I will tell you something else about why these places will not be delivered. The government have taken money instead of providing extra support for family day care. If this were their chosen method of providing child care-the method they wanted to promote to parents-wouldn't you think they would show it some support? You would think they would help out the family day care schemes. The exact opposite is true. Over the last year the federal government have cut funding to family day care schemes by about 25 per cent, on average, nationally. The schemes which support and regulate family day care workers play a coordinating role. They offer support, training and replacement workers when the usual worker wants to go on holidays and all the rest of it. They have been cut. Look at the Illawarra family day care scheme in Wollongong run by the Uniting Church. The member for Throsby knows all about that. The federal government is cutting this scheme by $33,000 per annum. You cannot find the family day care workers now to deliver the undelivered places in the system. What is the solution? Is it to improve the conditions of the workers? Is it to improve the support they get through their family day care scheme? No. The government's solution is to cut the funding of the coordinating schemes. The Daylesford Community Child Care Centre, which used to offer family day care, lost about $80,000 worth of operational funding last year and was told to stop provida ing family day care. That is the minister's solution to the child-care problem. The government attempts to grab a headline by looking for an announcement that has a big number attached. It does not matter whether the places will ever be delivered, it does not matter whether parents will ever receive the help they need and it does not matter whether kids will ever get into carelook for the big number for the headline. At the same time as you are trying to con parents into believing you will do something for them in child care you are taking money off the schemes that you think will deliver the extra places. How does that work?",102
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Sydney will address her comments through the chair.,103
174,Ms PLIBERSEK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is a bit of new spending for child care in this budget. Guess what? There is some extra money for advertising. Isn't that terrific? Isn't it amazing that the government are advertising the 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket child-care expenses that was announced during the 2004 election campaign, but it has not yet been delivered. Not a single cent of the 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket child-care expenses has yet been delivered. Parents around the country are struggling with very high fees-the parents whom today the minister is calling whingers in the paper. He is implying that anyone who talks about childcare affordability obviously just wants free child care: ‘They are just a bunch of whingers. People paying 400 bucks a week, people paying more than private school fees for their child care, are just whingers. They want free child care. They want everything free.' Not a single cent of the 30 per cent rebate that was promised in the 2004 election has yet been seen by parents. When it is finally paid later this year, parents will be receiving rebate on money that they expended in 2004. Two years later they will get a few bucks back on money they spent in 2004. Big deal! These parents are struggling from week to week to pay the child-care fees, the increased cost of petrol and their higher mortgage fees. They are struggling because their wages are not secure anymore and because they do not know what will be in their pay packets next week. The government's solution to high child-care fees is a top one: ‘In two years time we might give you a bit of money back.' The money does not go to all parents who have their kids in child care. If your kids are in preschool, you do not get the money. If your kids are in a Montessori preschool, you do not get the money. If you are a single mum on a low income or a sole parent trying to start up a business, you do not get the money. If you spend more than $65 a day, you do not get the money. This budget has been a con on parents. It is no wonder parents are angry. It is no wonder they are disappointed. They need real places, they need affordable places and they need places where their kids live and where they work. This budget delivers none of that.",103
175,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (3.30 pm)-I am glad that the opposition spokesman just got put out of her misery, because clearly, first of all, she knows nothing about child care. Her facts are incorrect and her arguments are incoherent-in fact, her arguments are contradictory. We will point out all of those things and explain to her, because the public actually knows that what the Howard government delivered yesterday is on the back of a record of doubling the actual number of child-care places in Australia since 1996. There is no disputing that today there is excess of 600,000 child-care places operating in Australia-real places, real children being looked after in the child-care sector, allowing mums to go back to work and allowing people to have fulfilling lives. Those parents, by and large, are receiving childcare benefit paid for by the Howard government and they will receive the child-care tax rebate. That is because the system is working. Back in Labor's day, 1995 and before, there were 300,000 places. Believe it or not, we all know that things go up through inflation as the years go on, but today Australian families are using less of their after-tax income on child care than they were 10 years ago. It is actually cheaper today, as a percentage of your net income, to have your child in child care than it was under a Labor government 10 years ago. Let us deal with some of the comments from the member for Sydney, the shadow minister. Today she has said that uncapping places for family day care was a hollow promise-that it was a shonk by the coalition on the public. Why was it that on budget day-not budget night-she said that she believed the government should ‘lift the cap on outside school hours care places'? So here we have, two or three days ago, the shadow minister sayingMr Baldwin-It's hypocrisy!",104
176,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hypocrisy! Now there's a word we have heard today in question time: hypocrisy. Here she goes. On one day the member for Sydney says that we should uncap outside school hours places, and we do. Two days later, because she could not deliver it-the Labor Party could not deliver it, would not have any capacity to deliver it, particularly when they were running deficit budgets-she turns around and tries to tell the public it is some sort of a sham. The realin ity is that I can prove to her how already there are providers out there turning their minds to the very issue of how to handle and how to provide additional outside school hours care and family day care. Here is a question for you. The member for Sydney asked why it is that there have not been enough family day care workers. Unlike long day care, which has expanded exponentially-and that is a good thing, I am sure those on both sides of the House would agree, because it means more places for family-the one sector of child care that has been capped and has been monopolistic has been family day care. It is a part of history that we have allocated artificial boundaries, which go back to the Labor Party days, that say that one operator, and no-one else, can provide family day care and, if they are not able to attract anyone, too bad. One of the problems that we had that this government fixed was not the mum out there providing the care-she gets paid for what she delivers-but the family day care coordinator who has a monopolistic control over a particular area. There are 250-odd of them around Australia. They actually got paid on the number of places that were allocated to them, whether or not they filled them. So they had no real reason or motivation to get extra people. The federal government recognised this, worked with the National Family Day Care Council and came up with a policy-which the shadow minister was part ofchampioning the fact that we are out there to get 1,200 additional workers. I do not recall the member for Sydney, when we were at Luna Park in Sydney, saying to the family day carers there, ‘This is a load of rubbish, there's no chance this will succeed; you people are wasting your time and effort.' She triumphed it and said, ‘This is a good thing.' I will tell you why, Mr Deputy Speaker: because the coalition government is going to assist 1,200 additional workers to access $1,500 to start their own business, to be to help adjust the needs in their houses. So there will be safety provisions and appropriate learning facilities in their own homes so family day carers can start their own business. We also had two more contrary arguments, as we have had consistently from the member for Sydney. Today she mentioned child care of $400 a week, but then she bemoaned what a family day carer gets paid. A family day carer gets paid by the parent and child-care benefit. The figure that the member for Sydney quoted was $4 an hour-$40 a day, $200 a week. The federal government, with its CCB, will pay more than $3 of that $4, which means the parent will be out of pocket by less than $10 a day. Ten dollars by five is $50-nothing like your $500. And she wonders why the federal government wants to be responsible and say, ‘Let's uncap it; let's get rid of the red tape; let's allow people to operate where and when they want to operate and let's meet the market.' But am I on my own? In fact, first and foremost: is she on her own? The member for Sydney said back on 14 April that she would welcome new places. Today she tells us that they are a scam. On budget day she said, ‘It would be good if we lifted outside school hours places.' Now that we have done it she says that it is no good. We also have the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer, referring to outside school hours places, saying: ‘It's still capped; they should be uncapped.' When did he make that statement? It was 9 May, budget day. They are not uncapped anymore. In Nundah, a part of the member for Swan's electorate, or in any suburb of Sydney, when a parent came to their local member and said, ‘Look, I am struggling; I want to go back to work and I need an afterschool-care place,' there would have been a able round six months down the track and you would have to go through a lot of red tape. The government has removed the red tape. Now the member for Sydney you can sit there with some confidence and say: ‘Not a problem. I will get the money, we can make this happen. We can operate. Let's get the school to work with us'-communities working with government, hand in hand, to deliver places where and when they are needed and supported by the federal government. Before this announcement we completed a round and we asked the Australian public, through advertisements right around the country, who would like additional outside school hours care. If, as the member for Sydney carps on about, 175,000 places were needed out there, we may have 175,000 applications-maybe a few more, maybe a few less. But, no, we got in the order of 19,000. Do you know what, Member for Sydney? As a result of this policy initiative, every single one of those places that meets the safety criteria-which I am sure you would never argue with-and is an appropriate learning facility will be funded from 1 July. They will not have to wait for another six months. Isn't that a good thing? Guess what, Member for Sydney? They all have staff. Those places will happen, and that is a good thing. Ms Plibersek interjecting",104
177,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She sits here saying, ‘Good.' I hope you are learning something here and that you recognise the failure of the Labor Party's poorly coupled together policies at the last election. The embarrassment of the last leadership challenge occurred just a few weeks ago-the leadership challenge you have when you are not having one, when the Labor Party coupled together yet another policy failing-and the Labor Party now recognises that what the coalition has done and what the Treasurer announced on budget night was a new landmark for Australian families-99 per cent of child care in this country now unlimited. Just so the member for Sydney and those opposite fully understand, I will put it into more simple terms. That means that no matter what figures we have in the budget$25,000 is what we have budgeted for-if the demand is bigger than we have budgeted for, the federal Howard government will fund it. No child will be without child care as a result of a lack of funding from the Howard government. That has never happened before in government policy. That is an enormous step forward. What does the industry have to say about the proposals? I heard the member for Sydney refer to Linda Latham, CEO of the National Family Day Care Council. Her comment about the budget in relation to this was, ‘This is great for family day care.' It does not get much simpler than that; it is not very ambiguous-‘Great for family day care'. Sallyanne Atkinson, from ABC Learning Centres, which is the largest provider of child care, said: Under a combination of tax breaks and a boost to services, child care is now more affordable. I will go on. Childs Family Kindergarten, which do not have the concerns of the Labor Party that they will not be able to get staff, said: It is very hard to get more than nine or 10 places under the current criteria. This will help make it more viable. Camp Australia have equally positive comments, which they sent to one of our members. In fact, they sent their comments to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs congratulating the government and thanking it for the removal of the cap on approved child-care benefit places and for the end of red tape. I congratulate the member for Dunkley, because clearly he has worked with this local constituent group in the area of Langwarrin, who make reference to a particular area there that will benefit from this. This is about individuals. This is about families and communities who will benefit. Here is a reputable organisation whose logo is ‘We make kids smile'. The reality is that, as a result of these initiatives, they will be able to put more smiles on more children's faces. Here is a good one: Go Bananas, over in Western Australia, congratulated Dr Mal Washer, a good mate of mine who is up here. He has been out there working very hard to secure outside school hours care places. They said: I would like to congratulate you and your partment for changing the child-care funding structure, particularly in outside school hours care. The recent changes you have made will provide opportunities for new services to be lished, which will address a real and significant need Australia-wide. We believe the changes just announced will reduce the red tape involved in establishing dedicated outside school hours care services and will enable more mothers in particustaff lar to enter the workforce. That is exactly what the Howard government is about. It is about removing red tape. It is about getting government out of the process and putting money in the hands of people who will provide these services. It is about getting rid of the things that have not worked, like the monopolistic approaches where we have had only one family day care service in any one area, and about giving a chance to people. But the Labor Party's idea before the last election was, ‘We'll create 8,000 new outside school hours care places.' That was it-8,000. Ever since then, they have carped on about it not being enough. Even though the federal government committed 80,000 and the Labor Party committed 8,000, they said it was not enough. So on one hand they say something but they cannot physically deliver it.

178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Sydney must understand that, if the chair warns, she will not get another opportunity.",107
179,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The President of the ACTU said that we should have 1,000 new long day care centres. Not too many people in this House and perhaps not too many people in the gallery appreciate really how much it costs to set up a long day care centre. It is between $1½ million and $2½ million. Sometimes it is as high as $3 million, depending on where it is. That is the sort of de- money that it takes to set up a long day care centre.",107
180,The ACTU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"remember that they are the estab- bosses of the ALP; they are the ones who drive the economic policy-have said, ‘We want a thousand of them.' That is in excess of $2,000 million of capital. There was no mention of where they were going to get the from, yet the member for Sydney comes in here and says, ‘You're not going to get the staff.' Let me assure you that, if we were leaving it up to the unions, we would not be able to get the staff. I will guarantee you. I have great faith in the people who run family day care. They will show innovation to the people who are running long day carepeople in churches and other organisations who in the past have been locked out of this. They are coming on board and they will provide quality places. That brings me to a couple of other initiatives in the budget, one being cost effectiveness and affordability. Mr Deputy Speaker, I tell you who this government is concerned about: those people coming into the labour market for the first time-people who might be saying: ‘Right, we're going to make that big decision. How am I going to do this? I have to put the children into child care.' There is a cost there and we acknowledge that. Whilst the government will give them the tax rebate and give them child-care benefit, we will also give those people JET. For those who do not know what JET is, it basically pays the gap. So we say that the government will pick up the tab and give the individual the incentive so they can go forward and join the labour market, become a taxpayer and, in doing so, show a new way to their children that welfare is not the answer but work is. The Howard government is all about incentive. It is about innovation. It is about driving forward. We have demonstrated that by supporting families 100 per cent in this budget. It is quite different from the Labor Party, which are in a muddled mess going around in ever decreasing circles saying that they want outside school hours care uncapped, complaining when we do it and saying you cannot get jobs. We know why: because there were over one million unemployed under Labor. They are the kings of unemployment. This government delivers for Australian families. It will deliver child-care places and it will drive this economy further forward by ensuring that women have the opportunities that they deserve. Labor will deny them those opportunities.",107
181,Mr GEORGANAS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to support this matter of public importance and speak on behalf of the many families within my home state and, in particular, those in Adelaide's western suburbs, who are doing it tough-battling to raise their families, buy a home, pay the bills and continue in paid employment to fund it all. These families need two incomes to get by and maybe, just maybe, build for their family's future. This all becomes so much harder without access to quality, well-staffed and affordable child care. The government has put the problems with child care on the backburner for too long. The government has ignored constant warnings by parliamentary members, particularly on this side of the House, about the issues surrounding insufficient, untargeted and unorganised funding to this vital service in the community. Hundreds of thousands of children miss out on the valuable preschool play and education for the simple reason that their parents cannot afford it. After 10 long years of the Howard government, child care is becoming a luxury, not an entitlement for all children. Child-care fees are climbing rapidly at five times the rate of the consumer price index, with some parents forced to pay over $100 per day. The federal government has failed to put funds into long day care places and is focusing mainly on after school care, which it controls in a very restrictive way, so that those who need to access these places are those who are least likely to get them. There is a high level of concern in my electorate of Hindmarsh about the government's poor handling of child care. At a recent child-care forum, which I and my colleague the member for Sydney held in my electorate of Hindmarsh, one of the participants noted that there were extremely poor conditions in some centres and that at a particular centre there were 20 toddlers in one room. Others at the forum commented on the pool of underused places and how, even where places were available, the federal government had made it so hard to access them that people were having to wait two years to take them up. There was also a high level of concern at the forum about the lack of properly targeted funding. With no federal government interest in planning, we have massive shortages across most of the country, with some pockets of oversupply. In my electorate alone, there is an average waiting period of two years, with 100 names listed at just about every child-care centre that I have spoken to. My colleague the member for Sydney and others have repeatedly pointed out that the government's poor planning has caused almost 100,000 places-that is, 30,000 family day care places and 67,000 outside school hours places announced in previous budgets-to remain either unallocated or unused. This is a direct result of the poor targeting and planning of funding in this area by this government. The government has failed to recognise that family day care is the least used type of child care. In fact, most parents need and use long day care. It is these places that are needed to get willing workers to return to the workforce. The fact that these 100,000 places have not been filled is also due to the lack of child-care workers. The government has done nothing to address the shortage of quality and qualified staff. Its attacks on higher education in recent years further restricts students from taking up places in university child-care courses. With the 25 per cent increase in higher education fees and the average child-care worker's salary among the lowest of all occupations, no-one could blame students for not wanting to take on an inflated study debt to support a career in such a low-paid and undersupported industry. The government has focused its funding on family day care. Family day care workers are ridiculously poorly paid and undervalued. The average family day care worker earns on average just $4 per hour, per child, and has around four children to look after at any one time. This means a typical family day care worker earns only around $480 a week before tax. At the forum that we held in my electorate, concerns were raised about the lack of qualified staff. The quality of the centres available was also of grave concern to the people who attended the forum. At the moment, the federal government does not enforce standards relating to educational development or mandate that services offer educational programs. This situation needs to change. While parents have to take lengthy amounts of time out of the workforce, the nation loses skilled people who are willing to work but for a lack of child-care availability. With a skills shortage, this country cannot afford to have able and willing skilled workers out of the workforce for excessive periods of time. When these workers return, they require retraining and reskilling. There is no need to import skilled workers from overseas when there are capable mums and dads ready to work and to be retrained. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures in February demonstrating that the lack of affordable child care is harming the Australian economy. The figures indicated that more than 250,000 women wanted to work but were unable to because of a lack of suitable or affordable child care. My own family experience in the late 1980s-we were some of the lucky ones by today's standards-was that we were able to find suitable care for our two boys. Thankfully, we were able to find child care in our area, in the western suburbs of Adelaide. And thank heavens we did. It would not have been a lifestyle choice of whether we had a oneor two-income family; it would not have been a choice of whether we had personal convictions about whether my wife or I should stay at home to look after our youngest child; and it would not have been a choice of whether we could afford to eat and pay the bills at that point of time in our lives. We had to work-both of us-and thank goodness the situation was as it was then. The industry, the availability and the affordability were different from what is the case now. If we had been in the situation faced by hundreds of thousands of families today, we would have been quite literallyand I will use the term-stuffed. It was a central issue to us then, as it is to many Australian families today who are struggling to pay their bills and to ensure that they build the foundations of their family and home for the future. But the government's budget shows that it is again sidelining this very important issue. More than a quarter of a million women waiting to return to the workforce will find little assistance in this budget. The government is focusing on providing places in family day care, ignoring the fact that the number of people using this type of care has been declining. In fact, family day care attendance decreased by 6.6 per cent between 2002 and 2004. Long day care places are needed to allow the return to work of the much needed skilled parents who want to work and are ready to work. This government has badly let down those parents and the rest of the community, which would benefit from their economic participation. With the exorbitant and ever-increasing cost of child care, small tax cuts will not greatly assist families. Child-care fees are rising five times faster than the average rise in the cost of all other goods and services. With the cost of the weekly grocery bill rising-not to mention the impact of high petrol prices-little money is left over in the family budget for child care. Under the Howard government's watch, child-care fees have jumped by 66 per cent over the last four years alone, and Australian families cannot bear this increase in costs much longer. In households throughout the nation, neither mums nor dads can afford to take five years out of the workforce; they need to work to make ends meet now and they also need to build up their super for later years retirement. With the current lack of childcare support they have no choice but to sacrifice many of their prime working years and, in the long run, lose out financially with pleted superannuation savings. This government has failed to realise that it makes economic sense to adequately fund child care. The total economic benefit of every dollar spent on child care has been calculated at $8.11. The amount of income generated by every dollar spent on child care is $5.63. The amount returned to government for every dollar spent on child care is $1.86. With the government getting a greater return for every dollar spent on child care, it bewilders me why it has had a stifled and haphazard approach to child-care funding. Quite simply, there is no sensible economic reason not to fund child care properly. We on this side of the House are appalled by the half-hearted way the government is dealing with this issue and we know that a carefully planned approach is required to ensure that quality, affordable and accessible child care is available to all the Australian families who desperately need their kids to be looked after while they are at work. This government's attempt to give the appearance of creating child-care places, while leaving parents and providers to struggle with a failing system plagued by chronic shortages and rising costs, is a shameful act. Child care affects every young couple starting out; they need affordable child care. Child care is a necessity, not a luxury, for the many Australian parents with children who are working in order to pay higher mortgages and higher petrol prices. (Time expired)",108
182,Ms PANOPOULOS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indi) (3.55 pm)Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for putting the member for Hindmarsh out of his misery. The one thing I share with members on the opposite side is great relief; we were all hopin ing the member for Hindmarsh would finish reading without too many errors. It was interesting that the member for Hindmarsh said tax cuts will not assist. Is this a hint about de- tonight's budget reply? Is the Labor Party again going to oppose tax cuts for families? Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",110
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Reid is in a very dangerous position.,110
184,Ms PANOPOULOS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Sydney and the member for Hindmarsh keep on criticising the government in very broad terms. But where is Labor's plan? It is nowhere to be seen. They hide away from the fact that child-care places have doubled from 300,000 to 600,000 under this government. I was seriously underwhelmed and embarrassed by the limp performance of the member for Sydney. She seemed to have not much to say. She started reciting a story about lost childhood dreams and her disappointment about sea monkeys and then went into a slow and laborious explanation of the different forms of child care available in Australia today. It was quite embarrassing. The problem the member for Sydney and the members opposite have is that they are genuine in their desire to ensure that these new child-care initiatives fail. They want the child-care initiatives to fail. They want the economy to fail. They want interest rates to go through the roof. They are sick and tired and miserable that things are going so well for Australians. Under this government, we have had a record increase in wages and 1.7 million jobs have been created. This government has done more for child care than the Labor Party has ever dreamed of. If, as the Labor Party claims, things are so bad, where is its plan? There is no plan; there is just whingeing and whining and a generally pathetic attempt at some sort of debate from the opposite side. The Australian people deserve more. The Australian people deserve an opposition that can deliver alternative policies and some sort of credibility. But we all saw them on Tuesday night when the Treasurer delivered his budget. You could see the long faces. The Leader of the Opposition was so depressed that his face was almost on the floor. Members of the opposition were looking at each other not knowing what to do because this was a bumper budget. I have heard five budgets delivered in this place as the member for Indi, and this was the best I have seen. That is why the opposition have to concoct problems and nitpick. That is why they are criticising the child-care proposals in this budget. ... theyThey will not stop because they have nothing else to do. But I suggest that they focus on providing some real alternatives and some real opposition, because that is what we need under our Westminster system. You can imagine the scene this morning. The opposition's tactics committee would have been huddled around desperately looking for an angle-an argument-to attack this bumper budget. But they could not find one and they came up with these pathetic, limp responses from the member for Sydney and the member for Hindmarsh. It is absolutely unbelievable. They sit there wearing badges of a different colour depending on which lobby group or union is holding them to ransom that particular sitting week, but they do not do the hard yakka and actually provide some real alternatives. Mr Rudd interjecting",110
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith is in a very risky position too. He has been warned.,111
186,Ms PANOPOULOS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley retired hurt. They were missing in action. They retreated and returned to the pavilion because they knew that they could not mount a meaningful, relevant attack against this year's budget, the pinnacle of economic achievement. The member for Sydney has accused the government of giving the appearance of creating child-care places. I have spoken before of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party sisterhood, but this statement by the member for Sydney less than two months ago absolutely reeks of it. She said: We are worried that the system for allocating and reallocating places is rigid and slow ... Parents around the country might be without a childcare place simply because the allocation system lags behind new demand. She went on to say: referring to the departmentdo not know where the shortages are. This budget has solved that problem. Parents know where the shortages are and demand will decide where new child-care places will be created. Parental demand will decide where outside school hours care places will be created and where family day care places will be created, just as family demand currently dictates that for long day care. But do we hear any reminder from the member for Sydney about what she really wanted, given that she repeated those statements even this week? We heard nothing because, quite conveniently, the member for Sydney cannot find it in herself to say anything positive. The Australian public know that there is something wrong with even a whining, whingeing opposition when it cannot find a single good thing to say about this budget and its extraordinary new reforms and additional funding for child care. While the Australian public-or some of them-were glued to their televisions watching the budget speech and cheering it on, the opposition were thinking, ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do now? How are we going to respond to this?' The member for Hindmarsh talked about the costs of child care. In real terms, the costs are lower than they were under Labor, as recent reports have shown. But that is not going to be admitted by the Labor Party, although it would do their credibility a lot of good if they were to do so. It would do the member for Sydney's credibility some good if she were to admit the truth that many Australians know. Everyone else says the emperor has no clothes, but the member for Sydney still thinks that the Labor Party has credibility. What this government is doing, particularly after Tuesday night, is allocating more places for child care flexibly, to cater for demands and needs of families. That means that 99 per cent of child-care places will remain uncapped. It is quite simple: where there is demand that demand will be funded by the federal government. This is an extraordinary improvement in child care. This is something that was not expected by families, and I know and hope that it will be embraced by many families around the country. Services will be able to be set up or be expanded to meet demand where it occurs, provided of course that they meet all the licensing, quality and other requirements in each state. If the member for Sydney is so concerned about a lack of capital investment in childcare places, perhaps she should suggest that state Labor governments, who control the planning laws in their respective states, come up with some sort of developer contribution for new housing estates to cater for community based child care. But, no, there is never any criticism, there are never any calls for assistance and there is never any vision on that perspective shown by the member for Sydney to try to involve state governments in any way. We have heard about some of the current problems and restrictions with outside school hours care and family day care places. These will exist no longer, and I call on the member for Sydney to actually admit that there is much good news in the budget on child-care places. The Labor Party talk a lot about child care and women, but they have absolutely no concrete plans for child care in the future. What an absolute disgrace that reeks of unashamed hypocrisy. They talk about caring about women in the workforce, but they even relegate their women politicians to the pathetic category of tokens through quotas. Sadly, that is what we have come to expect from the main opposition party in this counthe try. Where was the child-care benefit under Labor? Let us look at their past. It is nowhere to be seen. Where was the child-care tax rebate under Labor? Nowhere to be seen. Yet they still cannot bring themselves to say, ‘This 30 per cent child-care rebate of up to $4,000 per child per annum on out-of-pocket costs will be a terrific help to families in meeting the costs of child care.' The Labor Party actually opposed legislation that would have enabled unused child-care places in the previous system to be reallocated to ease bottlenecks in areas of need. So they can whinge and whine and complain, but it is all empty. It is all aimed at filling in the gap of a lack of policy. It is all aimed at filling in the gap of a lack of an alternative budget that the Leader of the Opposition will struggle to deliver tonight. The facts are on the table. This government has committed an extra $120.5 million over four years for the childcare package. (Time expired)",111

190,Mr WAKELIN,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"I will take only a couple of minutes to conclude the statements I was making before question time. I welcome this legislation. The fundamental changes that have occurred over the last decade as a foundation to the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 are part of a very important structural change that Australia needs to have. I reiteryear. ate that the best form of family income comes from a job. We have 2.6 million people on welfare and 15 per cent of those people are required to actively search for work. Passive welfare payments throughout the world, not just in Australia, are an issue that we need to be acutely aware of, and we need to in a much more dynamic way challenge and bring into the daily lives of all Australians the concept that these things are fraught with difficulty. At a time when the government's economic policy sees us with around five per cent unemployment, a 29-year low, we need every person in Australia who is able and available to work to do the work that this nation needs done. These are important stepping stones to encourage all Australians in a compassionate and fair way to participate in our economic well-being. Debate (on motion by Mr Nairn) adjourned.

Both works are due for completion by September 2007. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that this work proceed, noting that the estimated cost of $36 million may be less, due to lease incentive arrangements.

192,Mr NAIRN,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office at the site known as section 84, precincts and C, Canberra City, ACT. The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a fit-out, at an estimated cost of $76.879 million inclusive of GST, of new leased premises at Civic in the Australian Capital Territory. The new premises will replace a number of existing leased premises of varying quality fit-out within the Canberra CBD and is planned around the expiry of existing leases. Construction work on the new buildings, known as section 84, commenced in November last year, and the Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a fit-out of these new leased premises. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out and associated installation of services will, to the maximum extent possible, be integrated with the base building construction in order to reduce costs. The buildings are planned for completion in May and November 2007. The Australian Taxation Office anticipates occupying the buildings progressively throughout 2007 and 2008. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed, noting that any money saved due to lease incentives will be returned to consolidated revenue. The final negotiated agreement with the developer involves a lease incentive to the Australian Taxation Office, which will be offset against part of the cost of the fit-out.

194,Mr HAYES,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Once again, we have the Welfare to Work initiatives that were introduced by this government back before us with the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. They are not here to be improved and certainly not because there is a flaw in the way that they were announced in the budget that is therefore being addressed; they are here simply because of the government's rush to get the original piece of legislation through, because of their shoddy draftsmanship and because they are now seeking to correct those problems. That is the basis of this bill before us today. I have to make it clear from the outset Labor will not be opposing the measures contained in the bill, not because we support the initiatives but because to oppose them would mean that those who are affected by this bill would be further marginalised by the government's incompetence. Let me make it clear and take the opportunity to state the position of this side of the House: Labor believes that if people can work they should work. There is absolutely no debate about that. However, unlike the government, Labor also believes that reducing the support to people who are not working will not equip them for a job. It is simply going to make them poorer. That is what it is designed to do. Changing the nature of the welfare payments so that some people receive less will not address the issues at the heart of why these people are not working in the first place. A lower payment does not of itself improve the employment prospects of the unemployed-or the disabled, for that matter. A lower payment does not equip people with a range of skills, abilities and experiences that an employer seeks when they are looking to put a person on in their particular workplace. Placing people on a lower welfare payment, even in a time of historical low unemployment, does not make them any more employable. It does not give them any more opportunity to get a job. As I said, it simply makes them poorer. To tackle unemployment, to tackle issues of labour market disadvantage and to improve the employment prospects of the unemployed you need to address issues at the core of why people find it difficult to find employment. Members opposite, as they have in the past, will obviously paint the Labor Party as defending dole bludgers and defending welfare recipients, and this is because the government's Welfare to Work measures simply that do nothing. Our opposition is because they do nothing to improve employment prospects of people who find themselves unemployed and unable to find work. It is not a matter of simply defending welfare recipients; it is a matter of supporting them in their desire to find real and meaningful work. Labor understands that, quite frankly, people do find it difficult to find reasonable and gainful employment. I know that is true in my own electorate of Werriwa. Unfortunately my electorate has a high rate of youth unemployment. That does not mean we need to take a stick to the kids who cannot find employment; it challenges us to bring in policies to help equip those young people with the necessary skills that are being sought by employers. That is what real welfare to work reform should be about, and that would be the preferred option. If we were serious about Welfare to Work, we would certainly be designing legislation to assist, to support and to encourage the acquisition of skills and to help people become more competitive as they compete for places in the labour market. Everybody benefits from being part of the economic mainstream, being part of the labour force. It is certainly infinitely better someone to be gainfully employed, not simply because they are out of the unemployment statistics and not simply because they are no longer a burden to the welfare system. It is better for them for a range of different reasons: they are personally more satisfied and able to see that they can look after their own families, make a contribution to the economy and also participate in the economic mainstream activity that most of us tend to take for granted. In my electorate thousands of people are dependent on the disability support pension, Newstart allowance and parenting payment single. I recognise the social importance of economic participation and I am a keen supporter of improving their participation in the workforce. But, as I said, it is not a matter of taking a stick to people; it is a matter of applying the proper infrastructure to facilitate the acquisition of skills that will allow people to either rejoin or, in many instances, join the workforce. However, the government's Welfare to Work measures that are being cleaned up by this bill will not necessarily lead to an increase in mainstream economic participation. The government has previously conceded that more than 200,000 people will be worse off financially under the Welfare to Work changes. The government has also admitted that it expects only 109,000 people to gain employment. Assuming that those who secure employment receive wages above their level of benefit, the net result will be that 91,000 people will be worse off because of these changes. This government, with some twisted version of logic, intends to make almost 100,000 people worse off than they were before without assisting them in any way. This has to be the most offensive thing about these changes. While the amendments before for us today are welcome insofar as they clean up anomalies in the government's original, hastily drafted Welfare to Work legislation, it is nevertheless a fact that around 100,000 people will be worse off due to that legislation. They are going to be worse off financially and worse off generally because they will not receive the support they need to seek and secure employment. They will receive less money, no training and no support services and yet they will be expected to find work. This government has, in effect, thrown these people on the economic scrap heap to survive as best they can. That is not a real form of motivation, particularly when it is often beyond the immediate capacity of people in that situation to do anything to change their position-particularly people on the disability support pension, and let us not forget about those receiving parenting payments. As I mentioned earlier, when it comes to moving people from welfare to work, it is not about simply replacing their welfare payment with a job, because it just does not happen as easily as that. This is a difficult time for people; it is a time when people need to be supported and encouraged into work where possible. These measures should be about replacing a handout with a hand up, and that is simply not occurring. There is no support whatsoever contained in the government's measures. It is absolutely correct to target welfare dependency and to seek ways to move people off welfare and into work. Labor has advocated, and will continue to advocate, for real welfare reform that achieves that objective. Labor will continue to argue that policies that seek to facilitate the transfer from welfare payments to wages can be achieved only through real welfare reform and should be pursued only if the reforms tackle the reasons why people cannot find work and deliver practical solutions to accommodate this transition. But this is not what the government is about. This government is not about these practical solutions, and that was my objection to the original legislation. The ernment is about handouts, but not, unfortunately, to those who need them the most. On budget night we saw just how addicted this tax-and-spend government is to delivering handouts as it goes on its big spend. It spent up big on tax cuts, it spent up big on superannuation and it claimed to be making changes to child care. One thing that was conspicuous by its absence was spending on education. The Treasurer did not even mention a word about that in his budget speech. In fact, Tuesday night's budget actually reduced the overall percentage of federal funds spent on vocational education and training. The people who will be impacted most by the measures contained in the bill before us are those who need education and training opportunities the most. Australia is experiencing a skills crisis-there is no doubt. In fact, the government is so sure of this that has increased skilled migration intake and has come up with the new training visa for those coming from overseas to work in Australia. So, on the one hand, the government has acknowledged that there is a skills crisis where businesses are screaming out for skilled employees while, on the other hand, it is doing nothing to increase the pool of those skilled employees available to businesses throughout this country. The government is looking around and saying that there are some people out there on welfare who should probably be in the workforce, but it does not act to support them or to help them acquire the skills that employers are presently looking for. Real welfare reform needs to give people a chance to get the skills that an employer is looking for. Despite this reasonably logical view as to how best to assist people's transition from welfare to work, the government seems to be obsessed with the view that people on welfare should be punished because they are not working. For some reason the govgovernment has decided that a much better approach to get people to seek employment is to reduce their payments and at the same time reduce their bargaining power through the government's extreme industrial relations laws. The people we are talking about who are subject to this legislation are the most vulnerable in our society. There is no question that these people do not have a bargaining position, yet we are using a threat to reduce their welfare payment as their motivation for finding employment. And, as they go to find employment, under the new Work Choices law they really find out the level of their bargaining position. I take a small liberty in connecting the industrial relations laws with the Welfare to Work provisions, but I would contend that these laws must be looked at simultaneously to see how they impact on people on welfare. it They need to be considered together because we are going to see in the not-too-distant future people who have been shifted from one welfare payment to a lower one out there looking for a job-desperate to find work because they are struggling on a lower welfare payment. At the same time an employer out there knows that they are desperate for a job. An employer out there knows that they have no bargaining position. An employer out there knows that these are the ultimate pricetakers in our society. So, from the very start, you have an even greater imbalance in the bargaining power of the parties. The employer by far and away has the great advantage, when we look at people at this end of the scale-particularly a person who has a disability, a single mother trying to re-enter the workforce or a person on Newstart. Added to the fact that a number of people seeking employment are likely to be, as I said, disabled or lacking skills and experience, you will find that the government has created a situation where a whole group of people with a limited range of employment options find themselves having to negotiate employment agreements with an employer who is in a massively superior bargaining position. That is not reform. That is certainly not what you would expect in a prosperous country such as Australia. Creating an environment in which employers know that the prospective employee in front of them is faced with the situation of accepting the job, no matter what the terms and conditions are, or losing their benefits hardly creates a reasonable environment to encourage participation. Everyone would know that it is preposterous to seriously believe that this will result in improvements for existing welfare recipients moving to work. Breaking down barriers to participation should be about addressing the starting point to welfare reform. Earlier today I heard the Treasurer in an interview mention the importance of investment in the promotion of productivity growth and, as a consequence, economic growth. Although that was said in the context of investment in capital, the investment in the skills and education of those in the labour market is also important in the promotion of productivity growth and economic growth. That is why it is a little disappointing that, encourage people to move from welfare to work, the government has passed up the opportunity to use a carrot and stick approach and has decided to just use the stick. Most reasonable people would consider that it is appropriate for the unemployed to be assisted with training to improve their skills and employment prospects. Most people would also consider it appropriate to address the root causes of long-term unemployment as a sustainable way of facilitating a transition from welfare into work and increasing participation levels in work. Sadly, it seems that the government is not filled with such an ambition. The impacts of short sighted and hastily introduced Welfare to Work provisions that have resulted in this bill before us today are not confined to the domain of the disabled and the low skilled. The provisions also impact on single parents-and in the main, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, that really refers to single mothers. Contrast with the position of this government, which, under family tax benefit B, goes out of its way to encourage mothers to stay at home, the situation in the bill before us which seeks to encourage people off welfare. Mothers returning to work do need to have special support. Great fanfare greeted the child-care measures the government announced in the budget. Those measures may actually assist single mothers re-entering the workforce if more child-care places were created. (Time expired)",116
195,Mr MCARTHUR,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"I have listened very carefully to the member for Werriwa and I cannot fully understand the argument that he put forward except that he said that a number of Australians will be worse off. He had no argument against the Welfare to Work legislation that has been put forward by the government. I note his argument is in contradistinction to to the former member for Werriwa, who was very strong on these issues and who wrote quite extensively about welfare to work. In fact, I think he would have agreed with the government's position, unlike the current member for Werriwa. He ought to have a chat to Mr Latham about what the good, long-term future should be on the welfare to work issue. I also note the presence of my good friend the member for Throsby and I will be interested in her point of view as she argues the case on behalf of the opposition. I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. This is a bill providing consequential changes as a result of the introduction of the federal government's important Welfare to Work policies that were passed through this parliament last year and which I spoke to on that occasion. The Welfare to Work policies are an important element of the Howard government's strong plan to assist families and to omy strong and our nation secure. The government's Welfare to Work policies and our industrial relations reform are all part of a considered long-term plan to build a better Australia and provide enhanced opportunities for working families and for people who have the capacity to work but who are currently out of work. In general terms, the Welfare to Work measures introduced by the government last year encourage and assist more people of working age to participate actively in the workforce. A couple of principles underline these measures. Firstly, people who have the capacity to work and are able to work should do so. That is different from the member for Werriwa who argued that 100,000 people would be disadvantaged. I think that nobody in Australia could argue with that first prinfigure, ciple. Secondly, the best form of family income comes from having a job rather than welfare. I am sure the shadow minister for immigration at the table would agree with that because he has had a bit of first-hand experience of those situations. For people, having a job rather than being on welfare means more than receiving an income. By being meaningfully employed, a person gains an improved sense of self-worth and dignity from making a contribution to our society and undertaking an activity that is valued by an employer. People who are in employment also have greater control and security over their own life and are not reliant on government agencies. During my contribution to the Welfare to Work legislation debate last year I noted some statistics which highlight how vital it is for the government to act to assist people of working age on welfare into employment. Again, this is contrary to the view of the member for Werriwa, who was talking about those who were disadvantaged. We are actually trying to get people back into the workforce rather than letting keep our econ- them stay on welfare. It is appropriate to reiterate these points. Australia's welfare state has grown immensely over the last 40 years and without reform is fast approaching an unsustainable position. Even those opposite would agree with that-the member for Throsby would agree with that if she looked at the figures. You cannot continue to have the workers of Australia sustaining the welfare state as in the UK and other welfare nations. In June 2005, if you look at the figures, we had 705,000 working age Australians who were on disability support-I reiterate, 705,000. We had 630,000 working age Australians on parenting payments, of which there were 450,000 single parents and we had 500,000 working age Australians on unemployment benefits. We know that that is a very low about 5.1 per cent of the population. If you look at the actual figures spent on disability, you see in 2004-05 spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. Governments of all colours and those opposite, when they eventually reach government- Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, you might eventually be there; maybe when I have left the parliament-will have to look at this issue very carefully. The total welfare budget for the current year, 2005-06, is $60 billion. The parliament needs to take a very careful look at this ure. The major challenge for our country is the fact that, in these prosperous economic times when unemployment is at the lowest level for a generation-as I mentioned before, a 5.1 per cent unemployment rate in April 2006-one in five people of working age is on welfare. Again, I wonder what the member for Throsby will say about that. A total of 2.6 million people out of 13.7 million Australians aged between 16 and 64 years are welfare dependent. That is a very disturbing figure for everyone in this parliament. It is disturbing that we would encourage this welfare dependency and the government is trying to make a change of attitude and approach to this very difficult problem. Unless checked, such a high level of welfare dependence will have lasting impacts on future generations. Already it is estimated there are 700,000 children growing up in homes where neither parent is in employment. There is a risk in such families that a culture of not working could be created and handed down from one generation to the next. Members in the parliament are aware of that particular scenario. We do have families of three and four generations who have not had a working person in their living families. In the interests of equity for all Australians, it is vital that the government acts to break the chain of intergenerational poverty and unemployment and to encourage people back into the workforce. It is in this context that the government has acted positively to assist people who have the capacity to work to move out of welfare and into meaningful employment through our Welfare to Work provisions. In particular, the government's Welfare to Work legislation will address the situation of people who are on the disability support pension-and there are now more people on the disability support pension than fig- there are people on the unemployment benefit. Once people get on the disability support pension, they could stay on the pension for life, irrespective of their ability to work. The most common problems reported by disability support pension claimants are bad backs, feeling stressed and like problems such as musculoskeletal ailments. If you look at the figures, I think it is 34 per cent of recipients who have these hard to diagnose psychological and psychiatric difficulties. As an active local member in Corangamite, I have visited the local Centrelink office and have inspected some of the forms that disability support pension claimants must sign. Once the box is ticked for the disability support pension for a sore back or a psychological or psychiatric problem, it is very difficult for the administration of Centrelink to check on those individuals to see whether they might have some remedy for those ailments, such as the musculoskeletal-the technical word for a sore back-and to make a judgment as to whether this person has been restored to reasonable health. I think those opposite looked at those problems when they were in government some time ago. However, in many cases people who are on the DSP, especially at young ages, have a capacity to work and it is appropriate that, where this is the case, these people are encouraged to undertake some work. They are not being disadvantaged; they are just being encouraged both financially and by some of the tests to look for work. The Welfare to Work measures also help encourage single parents on the parenting payment single and those parents on the parenting payment partnered to seek part-time work once their youngest child turns six years old. This is an important measure to help reintegrate into the workforce, in sidered way, those parents of children who are in schooling. These reforms the government has introduced, which were passed through the parliament last year, are important to help assist working age people back into the workforce, to break the cycle of intergenerational welfare dependence and to ensure the national welfare system remains sustainable going into the future. I emphasise the point to both sides of the parliament that the welfare system should be sustainable over time and that if a government does not address the problems of welfare they become almost impossible to fix. I think we have seen that situation arise in the United Kingdom. The measures in this bill will extend eligisometimes bility for certain government benefits to persons not currently eligible to ensure that government payments for working age persons and full provisions of the Welfare to Work policy are consistently applied. Again, the administration of this is important. The minor changes introduced in this bill will cost the government a further $4.8 million over four years. The bill will allow parents who receive the parenting payment partnered who have a temporary incapacity exemption to gain access to the pharmaceutical allowance. In recognition of the impact of the death of a child on parents, the bill will allow single parents who are receiving the Newstart allowance or youth allowance to continue to receive the same rate they were receiving before their child died for another 14 weeks after the death of the child. The government is trying very hard to accommodate some of the human problems that some of the people on these pensions encounter. Another assistance measure extended in this bill is designed to help people with the costs associated with commencing employment by extending the employment entry a con- payment. Income support recipients who have breached compliance with activity requirements-that is, people who are subject to a non-payment period-under this bill will still be eligible for the employment entry payment if they find and commence employment or increase the number of hours of employment during the non-payment period. This is a sign of the Howard government's commitment to assisting people to make the transition from welfare to work. It is a relatively small point, but it does show that some of the changes that we have introduced in this bill before the parliament do assist people to make that sometimes difficult move from welfare, where they collect their money every two weeks, back into a job. That is quite difficult to achieve, and we are trying to make that transition as easy as possible. Earlier in the week the Treasurer, Peter Costello, handed down the budget, which has been very well received, as all members understand, by commentators and by the community. The budget will help Australian families with the challenges they face in meeting household costs and planning for their future. The budget delivered personal income tax cuts, enhanced family assistance payments and substantial reform and simplification of our superannuation arrangements. also The budget also funded important investment in national infrastructure, including roads and rail networks, which are so vitally important to facilitate the movement of freight around Australia. Efficient transport infrastructure helps our industry to be world competitive, encourages investment and jobs growth, and ultimately lowers transport costs and therefore helps to pay for the price of essential goods. The economy is in good shape. That helps with this bill before the parliament. These reforms, the tough decisions of the past 10 years and the hard, disciplined work of the Howard government have allowed the Treasurer to deliver a budget this week which cuts tax, provides additional assistance to families and invests in infrastructure so that we are better prepared as a nation to meet the future challenges of an ageing population. Just as the government's past reforms have allowed the delivery of a positive budget, so will the government's Welfare to Work policies-in conjunction with other elements of the Howard government's plan, such as our Work Choices industrial relations reforms-be important in helping the economy to continue to grow and to deliver more positive budgets next year and the year after that. I take the opportunity while speaking on this bill to commend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, my good friend and colleague the Hon. Kevin Andrews, not only for his work in drafting and guiding through this parliament the important reforms-such as Welfare to Work, which we are talking about now, and the Work Choices industrial relations reformsbut also for moving around Australia trying to prepare businesses to implement the reforms in the community to generate job opportunities for unemployed Australians. Recently, the minister came to Geelong and Corangamite and spoke at the Workforce Tomorrow Industry and Employer breakfast. He was there demonstrating and arguing the case for these transitions for the new industrial relations changes, which I am sure the member for Throsby will embrace in her speech. She is very supportive of these changes. As she sees the light and understands the value and importance of these industrial relations changes, eventually she will understand the merit of the case. If she had been in Geelong, she would have understood the importance of these changes and the advocacy of the minister. The minister told the meeting that labour market research conducted last year predicts that Australia will face a potential shortfall of 195,000 workers over the next five years. Even the member for Throsby would understand that if we are short of workers that is going to be a problem for industry and the workforce. The ageing population is expected to steadily apply a brake on the potential growth for all major occupational groups forecast to be adversely affected. This will happen even in Corangamite. The minister told the meeting that businesses across the Barwon region would be nearly 3,000 workers short by 2011. That is not far away and businesses will be suffering from not only the shortages of skills but also the actual availability of workers. In this context Geelong's employers were told they would face an increasingly limited labour supply and that businesses would need to focus more on the recruitment and retention of workers. Importantly, the point was emphasised that businesses will need to look to recruiting and training people from the Geelong region who would be encouraged to leave welfare and enter the workforce as a result of the government's Welfare to Work reforms. We see on the ground in Corangamite and in Geelong that these important reforms will assist local businesses and assist people to go back into the workforce because they will be needed and they will be appreciated for their contribution. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations told the meeting that there were 32,000 working age people in the Geelong region in December 2005 who were in receipt of allowances and pensions-more than one-fifth of the civilian working age population. Again, in my own home town, we have this large percentage of working age population who possibly can go back to work and are receiving allowances and pensions. If employers want to remain viable and competitive and want to continue to grow, they will have to look towards recruiting sole ents and disabled people who are on the disability support pension to meet their workforce needs. I personally have been very supportive of the Karingal organisation. They have done a fantastic job with some of the local employers in the Geelong region in encouraging some of those people with some disability to go back into the workforce and to receive some payment for their activities. I commend Karingal and some of those companies which have done such a good job in encouraging those people to go back to work, although they are suffering some form of disability. I commend this legislation. I commend the thrust of the Welfare to Work legislation that has been before the parliament, both on this occasion and on previous occasions. I think this measure and the philosophic thrust of the policy behind it is very important for both sides of the parliament. In the longer term for Australia we will be encouraging people who have some disability, who have some perceived difficulty, to do what they can to get back into the workforce, to reduce that welfare bill and to have an attitude of mind that here in Australia we will not have forever a ballooning welfare bill. I commend the bill, I commend the policy and I hope those opposite will support the broad thrust of the elements of this bill and the policy behind it.",119
196,Ms GEORGE,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am not going to answer everything that has been asserted by my good friend the member for Corangamite. I understand his passionate support for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations' so-called Work Choices bill, as he is a known member of the HR Nicholls Society, but I have always found the member for Corangamite to be a rather fair and compassionate person. Yet his paranalysis today of the Welfare to Work legislation reveals a cold-hearted bean counter approach that I had never detected before. One might be forgiven for thinking that the member might have had a finger in the pie in developing the government's Welfare to Work legislation. I would be interested to get an answer from him on that matter, because he seemed to be suggesting in his comments that people with disabilities and sole parents actually choose that state of being and that existence. I can assure you that I for one support the notion of moving people in a supportive framework from welfare into work, as does the Labor Party. It is good for those people and it is good for the economy. It meets a major economic challenge that we face with an ageing population, but neither he nor the minister or the government have ever answered the fundamental question: how do you help people move from welfare to work when the government's first response is to cut their existing entitlements-in the case of disability pensioners, with the new work test, by $77 a fortnight, and in the case of sole parents, $44 a fortnight-as some kind of precondition for them finding work? That is what I find most objectionable in this legislation: not the principle, but the actual means of implementing that principle. I awoke the morning after the budget to the screaming headlines. One of the headlines particularly grabbed my attention: ‘Manna from heaven'. I thought: would the people whom I represent in my electoratethe 6,000 people on the disability support pension and the 4,000 mums on the sole parenting payment-think that the budget delivered justice and manna from heaven for them, knowing at the same time that the very wealthy were getting the benefits of the largesse, and that come July they in their very low levels of entitlement will be facing quite severe cuts? You have only to look at the largesse. If you happen to be on $20,000 a year, a $7 tax cut per week; on $100,000, a $52 tax cut per week; on $150,000, a $119 tax cut per week. That is $37 billion in tax cuts over four years. I would have thought that a government with that amount of expenditure-with the amount of money it can put out there to try to assist families deal with the pressures of rising inflation, petrol prices and mortgages; with the $37 billion it can afford on tax cuts-might have rethought the very mean-spirited approach it will be taking to sole parents and people on disability support pensions from July this year. It was not just the tax cut. On top of that there was the reduction in the top marginal tax rates and of course the very generous superannuation concessions. One thing you can be assured of is that sole parents and disability pensioners will never see the generous superannuation concessions that flow, because they are finding it hard to eke out an existence to look after their children. It is wonder that a growing number of them are among the working poor. It is a meanspirited approach that really upsets me in a country as wealthy as ours. It upsets me that, with the largesse that flowed to the top end of town, the government in all conscience thinks it is fair to proceed to place an estimated 171,000 Australians at the lowest end of the income scale on lower payments than those under current arrangements. I wonder, again, how those 10,000 people in my electorate feel about this government's budget. The other thing that concerns me most about the Welfare to Work changes is the obvious hypocrisy of the government's position about which families it supports and which it does not, and which families get support to look after their children at home and which families will miss out on that support. As the member for Corangamite well knows, the Labor Party has been pursuing the issue of the very generous concessions for wives of very wealthy people who make the choice to stay at home and look after children in a system that has no means test attached to it. If you happen to be the wife of one of the 76 millionaire families that receive from our welfare system $3,300 in benefits each year, or one of the wives of the 350 men who earn over half a million dollars a year, you are okay: you can stay at home with your child and Australia's generous welfare support will provide over $3,000 for you to exercise that choice. But if you happen to be a sole parent, when your child turns eight, you will go onto a lesser benefit and your entitlement will in fact be cut by $1,144 from 1 July this year. Is that fair? Is that an incentive to help move people from welfare to work? I ask why it is that this government, with the means that it has, continues to pursue the stick approach to sole parents, most of whom are there not through any choice of theirs but no because of marriage failure. Why is the government going to punish them by reducing their benefits, all in the supposed theory that somehow this will provide them with work, while at the same time extending largesse to people who can well afford alternatives? The third reason I find inconsistencies in the government's approach is that it has not, despite all the money that was available, despite the huge surpluses in the last year and in the next couple of financial years-we are talking about $10 billion, $11 billion; huge of amounts of money that have been raised from the community, from working families-addressed the obvious inequity that exists in the very high effective marginal tax rates that women face. Women in twoincome families tell me, ‘Look, Jennie, there's no point looking for work.' These are people who would voluntarily go back to work but for the huge disincentive with marginal tax rates of 50 per cent or more. Women in households where there is another income earner tell me that that presents a huge disincentive. By the time they go back to work, pay their transport and petrol costs and find child care-if they are lucky enough to find it-they bring home 50c or 40c in the dollar. That is exactly the same problem that the sole parent will face. I looked this morning at the headline: ‘Slaving for $2.66 an hour'. I thought: ‘This is a great government. If you happen to be very wealthy and earn $100,000 a year you will have a $52 tax cut but, if you happen to be a sole mum with children, you will be forced to work and you will be getting $2.66 an hour.' If you do not believe me, let me just quote from where that analysis came: A budget analysis by the Brotherhood of St Lawrence found a sole parent of two school-age children who takes a 30-hour-a-week job at the minimum wage of $13 an hour would lose about 64 per cent of their extra earnings. “This parent will also have to pay around a week for child care,” the Brotherhood's tive director Tony Nicholson said. “This leaves him or herusually her, as we knowapproximately only $80 a week better off by working. They are effectively working for an hourly rate of $2.66. The government has squibbed. People want to move from welfare to work but the budget doesn't encourage it. Our shadow Treasurer, in his earlier portfolio and in his current one, has consistently said to the government that effective marginal tax rates on second-income earners, in terms of the interaction of the tax and welfare system, are really very punishing to people who want to re-engage in paid employment. If you do not believe me, member for Corangamite, I suggest that you look at a very authoritative study recently released by Professor Apps from Sydney University, an expert in this area, who concludes that second earners in Australia face an average tax rate of around 50 per cent, the second-highest in the developed world. She says that the tax and family benefits system is a very unfair system and that it also has very negative impacts on the labour supply or the hours worked by mums. These effective marginal tax rates are the main reason why we have had a fall in the labour force participation rates for mothers in the 25to 49-year age group. The participation rate has actually fallen between 1990 and 2003, because women make the judgment that there is no economic incentive as a second-income earner wanting to do some part-time work to actually go to work. They exercise some choice but, for sole parents with children aged eight, from July onwards there will be no choice. The only choice will be that you go, you take the job on offerand I will come to that in a minute-and, if you do not like the job or if you give it away, even though you might effectively be earning $2.66 an hour, you will lose your benefit for $60 eight weeks at a time. Is this something the execugovernment could be proud of? I shake my head in despair sometimes, thinking about the growing inequity in income distribution, growing inequality, growing levels of poverty among the working poor. When I read and listen to all the fanfare about the wonders and virtues of the budget, when I see the Treasurer smirking and taking great delight in how the top end of town has been so well catered for, and then I think about all those people who, come July, will be hit so hard, I think surely we can do better as a nation than to take the stick to the most disadvantaged and the poorest people in our community. Nothing that the member for Corangamite said today in his speech answered the fundamental question: how does the slashing of entitlements of people eligible for the DSP or the sole parent payment help them find work? Until he answers that question in a rational way, he cannot expect that this side of the House will just accept the kind of economic parroting arguments that we constantly hear. Yes, of course it is important that people move from welfare to work, of course we need to increase the participation of women-particularly married women, because in Australia the participation rate of married women with children is much lower than the rate in comparable OECD countries. But you cannot do it by taking a stick. You have to do it by looking at the disincentives in returning to work and you also have to put in a supportive framework. The member for Corangamite mentioned disability providers in his electorate. I have wonderful providers in my electorate too. The Greenacres Association do a wonderful job. I visit them regularly. They do provide assistance to enable disabled people to return to work where they can. But it is not as easy as the member for Corangamite suggests. If it is that easy, can he explain to me why the rate of employment for people with disabilities in the government's own purview-in its employment-has dropped from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent? If it were that easy, surely governments would lead the way. I think it is rather simplistic to say have to move all these people-implying that they are making the choice to stay-into jobs that often do not exist. For example, if you look at the people on the disability pension in my electorate, the majority of them are mature-age people. Try finding a job in the Illawarra if you are 50 or over. It is not that people are not looking for work. In January this year, in my electorate the full time teenage unemployment rate was 35 per cent. Those young people are desperate to find employment, and we have some good pilot projects that are working at placing them into apprenticeships. So you also have to have the jobs that will take up the people who are on disability pensions, who are unemployed or who are sole parents. I think you have a very simplistic view of how this operates, with due respect. I cannot fail to respond to the comments the member made about how the government sees the Welfare to Work program working in harmony with its Work Choices legislation. Of course, the two do intersect and that is another great cause for concern. We know the changes in the Work Choices legislation will drive down wages and conditions. We know there will only be a handful of minimum conditions. We know that things like penalty rates, overtime and shift allowances will no longer be guaranteed. We know that people who do not have much industrial bargaining power will find it very hard to retain their current entitlements. But when the government forces sole parents and people on the disability pension into work, with all the power in the hands of the employers, I know where they will end up: they will end up on the bottom of the negotiating scale. I know there are a few extra places in the JET program for retraining, but what ability will a sole parent who has been out of work for a long time have to negotiate a reasonable job offer? It will be the job on offer. As the that we member for Corangamite knows, if a sole parent does not take that job she will be in a situation of having her entitlements cut for eight weeks. Just imagine it: if you are offered a job on the most miserable of conditions, and you decline that job, you will be without any income support for eight weeks. So the eight-week non-payment period will apply to sole parents for refusing a reasonable job offer-‘reasonable', I guess, means a job that provides the legislated minimum conditions-or, if you decide to leave the job because you think you are being ripped off, you will find that your entitlements will be cut for eight weeks. So it is an issue of how women in that situation are going to put food on the family table. No-one has explained to me the rationale behind the punitive suspension regime. I cannot believe that, with the largesse that extends to the top end of town, this government could in all conscience support legislation which would leave children and their mothers with no income support for eight weeks-that we would go back to the days of charity where they go to Centrelink and Centrelink says, ‘Well, go to St Vinnies and see whether you can get money to pay your bills.' I think that is absolutely unconscionable. Let me quote the words of St Vincent de Paul who raised this matter in their submissions to the Senate inquiry that investigated this legislation. They said: Our concern lies primarily with the way in which the combination of these two reform agendasthat is Work Choices, the industrial relations legislation, and Welfare to Workwill result in some of the most vulnerable members of the community being pushed off social security and into low paid jobs that will be offered on the proviso that an Australian Workplace Agreement be accepted, even if that agreement results in the lowering of real income and a loss of conditions such as penalty rates. The potential for those AWAs to wreak havoc on the lives of Australian families, especially the precarious positions of single parent families, is very real and profoundly disturbing. I conclude by saying this to the member for Corangamite. I understand your rationale and your long standing view about the supposed benefits of industrial relations reforminterestingly, the HR Nicholls Society does not embrace the changes with great gusto; I think it was someone from the HR Nicholls Society that said all the overly prescriptive regulation reminds them almost of a Soviet style command and control economy in terms of what can and cannot be in agreements-but I do not understand how, in the context of a budget that some describe as manna from heaven, the member for Corangamite, whom I always considered to be a fair and reasonable person, can look so well after the interests of the top end of townthe people who do not need a hand-up, the people who are relatively privileged and fortunate and who will benefit not only benefit from tax cuts but from a reduction in the top marginal tax rates and extremely generous superannuation contributions. How in all conscience can you live with yourselves while at the same time punishing and taking a stick to the most vulnerable in our community-people with disabilities and sole parents who are not there by choice-and saying to them, ‘The way you find work is by this government cutting your entitlements,' in the case of disability pensioners by $77 a fortnight and for single mums by $44 a fortnight, and then telling them to go to the local charity if they refuse to accept a job that should not be on offer and that is exploitative. I do not think in all conscience the government should proceed. (Time expired)",124
197,Mr HENRY,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 was recently passed by this parliament. Several additional amendments to social security law are required to ensure that the policy intention of the Welfare to Work changes is achieved. These amendments are contained in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006, which I am speaking to today. Terminology and provisions in social security law will be replaced, amended or repealed to clarify the policy intention in relation to ticular Welfare to Work measures. It has certainly been interesting sitting here and listening to the contribution by the member for Throsby on this legislation. She started out by talking about the mean-spirited approach of the Australian government and the impact of this and other legislation on those who are disadvantaged in our communities. But let us just look at the record. Let us look at what previous Labor governments have done to the Australian workforce and community. Under the Labor government's administration we have had the highest levels of unemployment and interest rates at 18 per cent plus. Compare that with what has been achieved by the Howard governmentthe lowest rates of unemployment in over 30 years and low interest rates that enable many more people to get into homes, to the point where we have long waiting lists for houses. It is an incredible suggestion that we are mean-spirited. We are providing employment for all-that is, everyone who wants to work-with employment levels at about 5.1 per cent. Talk about mean-spirited! Let us just look at the net wage increases over the last 10 years. Wages have increased by something like 18 per cent under the Howard government, but during the term of the previous Labor government they increased by just over one per cent. So who is the better government to provide the best advantage, the best opportunity and the best employment outcomes for all Australians? I think the electorate out there have been voting with their feet in the last four elections, because they know who is doing the right thing by them. This bill contains a number of provisions which effect minor changes in some areas of social security law, such as amendments to allow parenting payment partnered recipients who have a temporary incapacity exemption parto have access to the pharmaceutical allowance. The bill will also allow single principal carer parents who are bereaving the death of a child and are receiving Newstart allowance or youth allowance to continue to receive the same rate they were receiving before their child died for another 14 weeks after the death of the child. This bill also recognises the special circumstances of partnered parents receiving parenting payment who have a partial work capacity due to an illness or disability. It will give them access to various benefits and concessions on the same basis as Newstart and youth allowance recipients who have a partial capacity to work, including the pension concession card. These and other measures in the bill build on the announced Welfare to Work policy and ensure consistency across working age payments. The Welfare to Work legislation is built on three main principles. The Howard government believes that people who have the capacity and are available to work should do so. There is nothing better than a job. The best form of family income comes from a job rather than from welfare. Services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible. I would have thought that these principles were basic common sense, but it seems that the Labor Party have a problem with this, although they seem to have no alternative policy. In fact, Labor are a policy-free zone when it comes to addressing welfare dependency and increasing workforce participation. Anyone in our society who cannot work should be provided with a pension, but I would think that the number of people who cannot work is very low. The Howard government introduced the policy of mutual obligation in relation to welfare payments, and I am proud to support that policy. It is a policy designed to encourage people to work if they can, to ensure that people do not come to rely on government handouts and to ensure that people who are receiving assistance from the community contribute to the community where they can. The Labor Party is opposed to this policy-a policy which rightly has the support of the vast majority of Australians. Part of the Welfare to Work package is a change to the parenting payment, requiring single parents who receive it to return to work for at least 15 hours per week once their youngest child reaches school age. I am sure that most Australians would wish they had the luxury of waiting until their youngest child went to school before returning to work, but the Labor Party thinks this is unfair, that it is punishing the parents. In a ond reading debate on 30 November last year, the member for Jagajaga said: This is not the Australian way. Australians look out for each other when they are down on their luck. We give people a hand so that they get back on their feet. There is no doubt about that. Australians do look after each other and give a hand to get people back on their feet. However, the member for Jagajaga thinks the best helping hand for single parents is to leave them out in the cold, on welfare, until their youngest child turns 16, offering them no encouragement to enter the workforce earlier to maintain or develop their skills. Welfare to Work gives parents a 10-year head start, helping them to build their work skills, to gain work experience and confidence and, most importantly, to move away from reliance on welfare. With the skill shortages that we are experiencing across Australia today, we do not have the luxury of allowing people who are capable of working and who are willing to work to sit on the welfare fence. Australia's unemployment rate is at a 29-year low at 5.1 per cent. There is now a shortage of workers, not a shortage of jobs as we experienced under the previous Labor government with an extreme level of unemployment. The shortage of jobs will only accelerate with the ageing of the Australian population. The potential shortfall of Australian workers over the next five years could be as high as 195,000, according to research by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University. Currently, Australia's participation rate for working-age people is 73.6 per cent. This is well behind other OECD countries such as Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. In order to meet the skill and labour shortages we will experience in the future, we need to ensure sec- that as many Australians as possible are able to participate in the workforce to their highest level of capacity and availability. The Howard government has introduced Welfare to Work as one part of a comprehensive apcan proach, along with a focus on vocational and technical education and training to safeguard Australia against these future problems. It works in harmony with Work Choices for a caring Australia that puts opportunity and employment in the reach of everyone. The measures contained in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 will cost $6.5 million over four years. These measures will ensure the proper delivery of the Howard government's Welfare to Work legislation, and I commend the bill to the House.",128
198,Dr EMERSON,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Rankin) (5.22 pm)Labor strongly supports improving the incentives for people to move from welfare to work. Labor believes that those who can work should work and should be encouraged to work, and that involves removing obstacles-disincentives-for people to move from welfare to work. The member for Hasluck has just said that the coalition introduced the concept of mutual obligation, but it was during the Hawke-Keating years-the member for Hasluck was not in the parliament at the time-that the concept of mutual obligation was introduced, most particularly in relation to unemployment benefits. Activity testing of unemployment benefits was introduced back in the 1980s. It was a controversial move, but it was the right thing do. So the mantle of mutual obligation belongs to the Labor Party. Labor has always believed that it must be a two-way streetthat you need to assist and encourage people to move from welfare to work rather than getting out a great big stick and whacking them on the head, which ultimately is not very effective and is certainly not consistent a week. with a compassionate society. The amendments before the parliament today in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 are minor and technical in nature and reflect the inadequate and poor drafting of previous legislation. Of course, where we can clean up poor drafting, we will endeavour to assist. For that reason, Labor does not oppose this legislation. But Labor did strongly oppose the legislation that was put through the parliament last year, and budget measures have been introduced since that time. I want to take the opportunity to comment on those budget measures and to provide an evaluation as to whether those budget measures have fundamentally changed the position that was contained in that legislation. The Welfare to Work legislation introduced into the parliament and passed by the government last year is a disgrace; it is a brutal piece of public policy making. About five years before the passage of that legislation, the MCClure report was brought down. That report analysed and described a number of ways in which the incentive to move from welfare to work could be improved. After five years of deliberation the government produced this legislation. If you wanted to design a piece of legislation heavily calculated to weaken the incentive to move from welfare to work and keep people on welfare, it would be the perfect legislation. You could not conceive a more damaging piece of legisto lation which so greatly weakens the incentive to move from welfare to work. Indeed, the legislation strongly encourages sole parents to move from welfare to welfare. Let me explain. The legislation obliges sole parents to move from sole parent pension to Newstart allowance when their youngest child turns eight. In so doing, sole parents lose $29 Mr Laming-What happens in Europe, Craig?",130
199,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,The member for Bowman will get his turn.,131
200,Dr EMERSON,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"They are required to move to a second form of welfare, Newstart-a transition from welfare to welfareand that involves a loss of $29 a week. We heard from the member for Hasluck-and I am sure we will be hearing from the member for Bowman-that we have a great and compassionate government. But sole parents, immediately upon their youngest child turning eight, lose $29 a week. Let us understand who sole parents are. Overwhelmingly, sole parents are women who are struggling to bring up their children. They have been deserted-and, in many cases, physically and sexually abused-by a male. They deserve our support and they deserve our encouragement to move from welfare to work when that is feasible. But they do not deserve the brutality of the legislation that was introduced and passed by this government in this parliament last year-and that is what they get. In addition to losing $29 a week as they move from sole parent pension to Newstart, when sole parents look for work-and they are obliged to-the income-free area for Newstart is narrower than the income-free area for the sole parent pension, which means they start paying tax and losing benefits at a lower level of earned income. In the transition from sole parent pension to Newstart, and then into work, there is an increased disincentive to move from welfare to work. In addition, the rate at which Newstart is phased out is harsher than the rate at which sole parent pension is phased out-a second strong disincentive to move from Newstart into work. Rather than encouraging sole parents to move from welfare to work, the legislation obliges them to move to a lower level of welfare and, in the process, erects heavier and more punitive barriers to moving from there-Newstart-to work. That is why I say it would be very difficult to come up with a scheme that is more calculated to weaken the incentive to move from welfare to work than this government has managed to come up with after five years consideration. The government announced a review because it knew there were problems with this legislation. We on this side of the House felt that perhaps the government had listened to the pleas by welfare organisations, other representative groups and the Australian Labor Party to provide genuine incentives-a carrot to move from welfare to work-rather than a very big stick. But the government made no such amendments in that direction. And so, as a result of this legislation passed last year, the stick got bigger and the carrot got smaller-and member after member of this government has stood up and said, ‘Aren't we a great and compassionate government helping people in this way?' The truth is that, even given the budget measures announced on Tuesday night, those disincentives for single mothers to move from welfare to work remain very heavy. Calculations performed by NATSEM and some calculations that I did myself confirm that female sole parents in this situation who move off the Newstart allowance and into work lose so much through the loss of benefits, income tax paid, child-care costs and work and travel costs that they are effectively working for between $2 and $3 an hour. The government did do something positive in the budget on Tuesday night by increasing the low-income tax offset from $235 to $600 a week. I am especially happy to acknowledge that, as a number of my colleagues have, because I proposed it in the prebudget submission that I sent to Treasury. In fact, I proposed that the low-income tax offset be lifted from $235 to $625. The government lifted it to $600, but I acknowledge that provides some benefit because there is effectively a tax-free threshold for sole parents of around $10,000 compared with the smaller threshold before that. But, even after taking account of that effective lift in the tax-free threshold for lowincome earners to around $10,000, according to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who have had the time to do this work, a sole parent of two schoolchildren aged over eight years who is on the minimum wage and is taking up a 30 hour a week paid job will still lose around 64 per cent of their additional earnings, such that they are effectively working for an hourly rate of $2.66. So the figure is still in the same range that I and NATSEM calculated: that is, poor single mothers are required by this government to work for between $2 and $3 an hour. But let us have a look at the story for high-income mothers who are in millionaire families. They are paid $3,300 a year to stay at home while poor single mothers are required by this government to go out and work when their youngest child turns eight for as little as $2.66 an hour. That is this government's idea of fairness. It is a brutal piece of legislation. Mr Laming interjecting",131
201,Dr EMERSON,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"The member for Bowman should know better. The member for Bowman, who has got a medical degree, would have seen plenty of poor people. He would have treated plenty of poor people, yet he is going to stand up in this parliament and say it is all right for poor single mothers to be required by this brutal government to go out and work for $2.66 an hour while wealthy mothers in millionaire families are paid $3,300 a year to stay at home. This piece of legislation is an absolute disgrace, yet one after another government MPs stand up and say, ‘Aren't we terrific; aren't we fair; aren't we compassionate.' This legislation should have been thrown out. I would have much preferred to see these amendments today contain a line that repealed the legislation that was introduced and passed through this parliament last year. Mr Laming interjecting",133
202,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Bowman will get his chance to contribute very soon.,133
203,Dr EMERSON,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Before I go on to describe measures that would genuinely provide incentives for single mothers to move from welfare to work, put yourself in the situation-if some of the government MPs could do this-of poor single mothers, many of whom have been brutalised by their partner, who are trying to bring up children. They are told by this government that from 1 July and from when their youngest child turns eight they will go from the sole parent pension, losing $29 a week as they go to the Newstart allowance, get activity tested every week and then have large disincentives, big obstacles, to move from welfare to work put in their way. Put yourself in their situation and say: ‘How can I get out of this horrible situation that the government is putting me in? I know: have another baby. That will put the whole issue off for another eight years.' So let us understand that this government's legislation specifically has the effect of strongly encouraging poor single mothers to have more children. If that is the government's social policy agenda, fine-stand up in this place and say the government's response to the problem of the ageing population is to encourage poor single mothers to have more children, to perpetuate the cycle of dependency in order to stop the situation where those women are effectively punished for moving from welfare to work. In addition to the disincentives for those mothers to move from welfare to work, if they have a baby not only do they put the problem off for another eight years but also they pick up a $4,000 baby bonus. That is why I say you could not conceive of a set of measures more calculated to keep poor single mothers on welfare all through their baby-bearing lives, continuing to have babies and then creating and perpetuating the cycle of dependency and the cycle of despair. What the government should have done is give poor single mothers some genuine incentive to move from welfare to work and a capacity to do so by offering them proper education support. Here is yet another chapter in the saga. When they do move and when they are required to move from the sole parent pension to Newstart, eligibility for the education and training support programs is less. It is weakened, not strengthened. So the government is effectively saying it does not want, and will not support, the training of poor single mothers to improve their workforce skills and to create not only an incentive to move from welfare to work but a capacity to do so. OECD analysis shows that one obstacle that can be removed for mothers moving from welfare to work, which would produce greater participation and help them and help us combat the problem of the ageing population, is to improve child-care benefits. The government did announce some measures on Tuesday night which slightly improve for a limited period of timeMr Hockey interjecting",133
204,Dr EMERSON,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"It does slightly reduce the cost of child care for a limited period of time. But then the mothers are back in the situation of earning $2.66 an hour. The Minister for Human Services at the table says, ‘Oh come on, be generous, be fair.' What is fair about $2.66 an hour, Minister? You live on the North Shore of Sydney. Do you know anyone on the North Shore of Sydney who would work for $2.66 an hour? Do you expect your wife to work for $2.66 an hour? Do you expect poor people generally to work for $2.66 an hour? That is why I say this legislation is so brutal. What should happen is that the child-care benefit, which is a good measure, should be increased for people on low incomes. You will then, according to OECD analysis, get some genuine incentive and genuine responses from people to move from welfare to work. But, instead of increasing child-care benefits, the government introduced as a result of the last election the child-care The child-care rebate is specifically targeted towards higher income earners. Why do I say that? Because it is 30 per cent of the out-ofpocket child-care expenses after taking account of the child-care benefit. The child-care benefit is a properly means-tested benefit. Obviously the government said, ‘We've got all these people on high incomes who are saying, “I want help with my child care; this child-care benefit does not give me that help.” Good idea, we'll come up with a child-care rebate.' You will not get the increase in participation through the child-care rebate that would have been obtained by increasing the child-care benefit. But, no, the government does not want to do that, because it would be a fair measure to increase the child-care benefit rather than to introduce the child-care rebate, which is absolutely riddled with anomalies and administrative problems. It has been a disaster from day one and an embarrassment to everyone except this government, which is very difficult indeed to embarrass. If we want genuine incentive to encourage women to move from welfare to work, we would lift the child-care benefit. We would make sure that those mothers get a reasonable take-home hourly rate of pay rather than making the stick bigger and the carrot smaller. I hope I have been able to demonstrate here this evening how unfair and how brutal this legislation is. The government in Tuesday's budget will spend $20 billion extra over four years and found savings of $2 billion. If you are going to spend an extra $20 billion out of all of the largesse that has been flowing into the government's coffers through the resources boom, surely you would try to make some extra effort to improve the incentives for sole parents and people on disability support pensions to rebate. move from welfare to work. But this miserable government has not improved those incentives, and the Brotherhood of St Laurence confirms that. Those poor single mothers are still expected to work for $2.66 an hour. The legislation is a disgrace. It just shows that the Liberal Party of Australia is a brutal administration that believes it can punish poor single mothers for being single mothers and is trying to make their lives evermore a misery. We should be taking the opportunity to repeal this disgraceful legislation instead of debating nitty-gritty points about minor amendments.",134
205,Mr LAMING,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"My neighbour the member for Rankin is probably the only person on the other side of the chamber who does take an active interest in OECD comparisons. Quite commonly they are quite unflattering for the opposition in their time in government, so I appreciate that he took the time to even acknowledge them today. Unfortunately for the argument that omitted so many OECD comparisons that were convenient to the member for Rankin, in the very situation he described in great detail throughout most of his contribution, pertaining to single parents who have children turning six and turning eight and being required to attempt to return to the workforce where possible, the simple fact is that throughout most of Europe they are compelled to do so. In fact, there is barely another economy in the OECD that has a system as generous as Australia's. For that reason I think Australia is completely vindicated in this last 10 years of working to address very skills shortage we have heard articulated so commonly on the other side by moving towards an active workplace participation model. It is worthy to just cast our minds back through the range of improvements that have been made over 10 years, which were utterly required as Australia attempted to become a nation that could keep up with its international competitors in what is a very competitive race to preserve quality of lifestyle and to preserve a GDP that makes us competitive internationally, that ensures that our exports are strong and that our population are adequately trained and have an opportunity to enjoy their own endowments and participate in this strong economy that only yesterday was acknowledged by the OECD to be the second most competitive and the second best performing of the economies with a population over 20 million. Before going into a response to the many speeches we have heard from the other side, it is important to acknowledge that the changes being proposed in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 today are in fact very good ones. They pertain to partnered parents who are receiving payments. They extend the right to access a pharmaceutical allowance and, for those who have a partial work capacity, the right to access Newstart and youth allowance and, most importantly, where relevant, the right to access the pension concession card. That is an important change. For single carer parents who do lose a child, this also allows them to access for 14 weeks Newstart or the youth allowance. These are common sense amendments, and I know there is probably universal support for those changes on both sides of the chamber. I want to go back to 1998, because the dethe bate that is heard today may seem novel to new members like me. In fact these debates have been held by our predecessors since 1998, when the first proposal was made to end the Commonwealth Employment Service and move to a new and revitalised model. I do not need to read out the quotes that were spoken in parliament at that time, when the end was forecast by the opposition. The belief was that with the end of the CES would come burgeoning unemployment and a collapse in the Australian economy. The same thing was predicted again in 2002 when, following the MCClure report, Participation support for a more equitable society, we responded and developed Australians Working Together. We heard that same echo as things continued to improve on virtually every economic marker, with the active participation model in July 2003, which was that very revolutionary model to individually link up those who were receiving support and looking for work with a job provider. I will just make the remark on the side that, as long as unemployment was over 10 per cent of Australia's population, how could you ever hope to have a personalised approach to engaging people and helping them back to the workforce? Obviously, we know that there is no better way of ensuring someone's well-being than providing them with a job. It is a very simple premise. We know that simply providing income support without any sense of reciprocity does not work. This goes right back to someone who I am quite sure is quoted often by the other side of the chamber: Beveridge, the English father of welfare economics, who noted even then that passive welfare support without any sense of responsibility or obligation is eventually eroded by its own middle class, who cease to have faith in a pension system if there is no reciprocity but simply passive income provision. That is a fairly simple model. That observation was made over a century ago, but it is still just as rate today. Of course, what has changed in the last five or 10 years is not so much the proportion of people in part-time employment. Australia has been increasing its part-time proportion of employment. It still falls behind one or two European nations, but in the end what we have is a more flexible workforce, an easier workforce to access. I want to give a personal anecdote, because there are certainly plenty of them articulated here. My view, as a person who grew up with a mother who worked part time but did not want toand there were plenty of mothers out there who could not work part time but wanted to-is that, if there has been one change in the last 10 years, it is that people are no longer forced back to the workforce because they cannot afford horrendous interest rates. There are no longer people sitting outside the economic engine of this country because there are no options to engage in further training and there are no options in the form of jobs in the classified sections of the back end of our cities' newspapers. The number of jobs being reported each month is extraordinarily high, and I do not need to repeat that unemployment sits at record low levels. We need to remember that that is a significant change to just 10 years ago, when so many people may well have been working, with just as many part time, but when so many of them found themselves not maximising the very endowments that they had. They did not have the opportunities to study, train or be at home because the very people who wanted to be at home with their children could not afford to and the very people who found themselves working part time could not afford to leave. But what we have now is a completely different situation, with a workforce which is far easier to engage. You only have to walk through a shopping centre and accutalk to small business proprietors who cannot find people to employ. We have a completely different situation. As has been expressed here before, far better it is to have a shortage of skills than a surplus of labour and people completely disengaged from our own economy. In 2002 the focus was on increased self reliance, and that means giving people searching for a job an opportunity for a oneto-one relationship with a Job Network provider. For parenting payment recipients, those obligations really are very minor. I know that the case was made-and it is an almost preposterous proposition-that every single parent who is on a payment, or at least a large proportion of them, are abused. I do not for a moment wish to dismiss anyone who has ever been in that situation, but to make a ridiculous claim, as the educated member for Rankin did previously, that we need to take our hands off single parents because they are in some way subject to enormous levels of personal and family abuse is just ridiculous. It then suggests that we have to have Centrelink making decisions every day on whether to engage people back into the workforce and whether violence within the home becomes some reason for opting out of the economy. That is a preposterous claim, as is a heartless proposition to have a form of mutual obligation. If there is one thing we have learnt from the last 10 years, it is the electoran ate's willingness to take on the principles of Work for the Dole. Just 10 years ago one would not have dared stand up in a coffee shop and propose Work for the Dole, and now the notion of reciprocity is so accepted in the community. It has been fought tooth and nail from this side of the chamber-and even I, having not been here, acknowledge that that has been the case. For every change that is made to the workforce and to workforce policy, I acknowledge there will be a battle with the other side of the chamber. And, while I am sure that in your own hearts you believe you are right and that you are often confronted with individuals who come to you with cases of hardship, I put to you that Centrelink does an extraordinary job of dealing with those very exceptions and, where it can within the rules, being as responsive as it can to a community that often has many and varying needs. One thing you do not hear too much from members of the opposition is that pensions are too low. They themselves have an appalling record of not linking pensions to MTAWE, and there was enormous hardship until that was done by this government. But the proposal that people are then working for $2.60 an hour, as we heard from the member for Rankin, who has a PhD in economics, simply misses the point that this is a subtraction of a currently very strong welfare payment from average wages. That is where he gets the figure of $2.60 per hour. Prefaced upon that figure, of course, is his belief that every single person is entitled to a pension and that, if you go back to work, there has to be $200 a week to make it worthwhile for you. Once again, that is a preposterous way that it is to treat the welfare system. I am proud of the very strong welfare platform that this country can boast. If it is only extra $200 a week one might earn to go back to work, that is a decision that every individual is free to make. But to say the marginal tax rates are unfair-and, sure, they are higher than they are in a number of other economies-only reflects that other countries have a lower pension system and that other countries may choose to taper out at a different rate. That is where a marginal tax rate is calculated from. A high marginal tax rate for those returning to the workforce is simply a product of a very high welfare payment and a tapering that does not extend all the way up to people earning $50,000 per annum. Were we to do that, I am sure we would be criticised by the other side for having middle-class welfare. The Treasurer made the decision to increase family tax benefits to those earning $40,000 a year. That was an important decision-not criticised by the other side-which addressed those marginal tax rates, making it easier for people to return to the workforce. It is also important to note that the changes to participation requirements are not as onerous as has been proposed by speakers from the other side. There is already a range of automatic exemptions available for some parents and applied case by case. I think we too easily tend to criticise Centrelink in their efforts to apply those case-by-case exemptions, but I know personally from having observed the work of the Centrelink offices in Cleveland and Capalaba that they are doing that and doing it every day. For very long term job seekers a system called Wage Assist is valuable. There are full-time work for the dole activities for the very long term unemployed, particularly those who have made a genuine attempt to look for work-and that is what is asked for. It is never noted by the other side that there is not an obligation to go back and work for a certain hourly rate; an option as part of the obligation is to participate in voluntary engagement. There is always the option to do voluntary work as well, and it should be noted that that does not affect payments. In addition, people with disabilities will have access not just to vocational rehabilitation through Job Network, which we well know, but to the disability open employment services as well. The supporting employer strategy promotes involvement by employers in these partnerships, which is important. Principal carer parents do not have to accept work if there is no appropriate child care or supervision available in the hours during which the parent is working. These sorts of details are often glossed over, papered over, by the opposition when they attempt to portray an effort to do what is only responsible for a government-to return our participation rates to somewhere near OECD and developed economy averages. They attempt to paper over these very important exemptions, including those for single parents of large families, and portray them as being unnecessarily heartless. When we make these comparisons, it is worth noting that the number of jobless families in this country is the third highest in the OECD. We also have the lowest employment rate of people receiving disability support benefits of the major OECD economies, which means that once a person is on a disability payment in this country they stay on it for an average of 10 years, and the number of people who earn additional money on top of their disability payment is around 10 per cent. For seniors who are receiving a seniors payment, that figure is around 38 per cent. We know by comparison that these figures are extraordinarily low. I think it is a responsible government that engages that proportion and asks, ‘Why is there not an incentive for this proportion of our population to return to work?' We just need to look at the basic numerator that we are talking about here: there are 2.6 million Australians receiving these payments out of 13.7 million people of working age. That is 20 per cent. In very few countries in the OECD is it more than 10 per cent. It does not take a great deal of maths to ask, ‘Why are there 20 per cent of disability payment recipients in Australia and around 10 per cent or fewer in other OECD economies?' I am not for a moment saying that one person is or is not disabled, but there needs to be a very good case made by the other side of this chamber for why 3.7 million Australians are receiving disability payments when we are not seeing that reflected overseas. I think a responsible government would look closely at those figures. Of course, we know that, when you are without a job and are receiving income support in isolation, that is correlated with-not a direct cause of but correlated with-lower well-being, and with that comes all of the socio-economic ailments that we are aware of, including engagement with schools and outcomes for children. These are the reasons why we are working very hard to see families re-engage with the economy. That is the underlying drive-that is why these three small but worthy amendments are being proposed today and why I support in here and in Bowman the changes being made both today and through an ongoing process to give every Australian, regardless of their background, an opportunity to engage with the economy. It is all starting with local Centrelink offices and it is a campaign that I port strongly.",135
206,Ms HALL,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"In the very short time that I have to contribute to this debate on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 tonight, I would like to pick up on some of the points raised by the member for Bowman. I start by saying very strongly that I support the right of people to work. I appreciate the fact that people, where they are able to work, should be able to work. Prior to entering parliament, I had a lengthy career of fighting for people with disabilities to have the opportunity to enter the workforce. It is because of my background in working with people with disabilities, assessing their suitability for work and looking for suitable employment for them that I have been so opposed to the Welfare to Work legislation-not because it is about moving people from disability support pensions into employment but rather because I have always believed the legislation is quite flawed. I believe that, when drawing up this legislation, the government have disregarded a lot of professional advice that they have been given. One of the most important things for a person with a disability is to feel that they can move from the disability support pension to work. The role of government in that is to minimise the risk and to empower them to feel that they can succeed. The moving of a person from welfare to work should not be about moving them from one benefit to another, which is what I believe has happened with this legislation. The government has decided, in its wisdom, that people on disability support pensions should be moved to Newstart allowance. That will make it even harder for a disabled person to return to the workforce. People with musculoskeletal disabilities sup- have been targeted by this government as having insignificant disability. Anybody who has had any experience working with disabled people can attest to the fact that these people are just as disabled as those who suffer from other injuries. The government has shown its lack of understanding and direction, and this has been reflected by punitive legislation. The original Welfare to Work legislation, which we debated in December, was flawed, and it is because of its flawed nature that we are here today debating this amendment. I seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Rearrangement",139

209,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"This budget fails Middle Australia and mortgages our kids' future. That is why tonight I want to speak to the families of Australia about our shared hopes and aspirations for the future. I want to speak directly to the millions of Middle Australians at home with their families in the suburbs, the country towns, the cities and the bush. This is for them. Probably they are just finishing dinner, washing the dishes, helping the kids with their homework, all the time trying to keep half an eye on the TVmanaging the competing demands that crowd each waking moment; sitting at tables in kitchens where the magnets chase the bills around the fridge door until payday; figuring out if there is enough in the bank to cover this month's mortgage or if there is enough petrol in the car to get to the child-care centre, then school, then to work and then home; doing the mental arithmetic of family life; tired at the end of another working day, knowing it starts all over again tomorrow. They are the ones I really want to speak tonot the politicians, not the journalists. The people who are important to me and crucial to our nation's future are the families of Middle Australia, the ones who have built our prosperity, because after 10 long years of the Howard government they deserve a break-not an easy ride or a handout, just a fair go; reward for all the effort they have into build our national wealth; recognition that our future prosperity rests squarely on them. I have one critical message for them: millions of Middle Australian families will build the next generation of prosperity and I will reward them for it when they do. Middle Australians need a government that makes their lives simpler, not more complicatedthat lightens the load, not weighs them down; a government that gives parents the time and flexibility they need to do the most important job there is-raising the next generation; a government that looks at those kids and sees the prosperous future of an entire nation and that understands that investment in the hopes and aspirations of Australian families brings the dividend of a modern dynamic economy. Mr Speaker, through you, I say this to the families of Middle Australia: tonight I seek a binding agreement between us-between you and the government I will lead. Tonight I announce my pact with Middle Australia because, quite simply, it is your hard work, the hard slog of Middle Australia, that has generated our economic good fortune. Looking ahead, Australia is counting on you to do the next round of heavy lifting that will deliver future prosperity. We are relying on you to drive a new wave of economic prosperity and it is about time you got something back. So my pact with Middle Australia has at its core one promise. Through you, Mr Speaker, it is this: under a Beazley Labor government, when you put in you get back. Here is the deal: when you work hard I will make sure you get a tax system that rewards you. When you put in those long hours at work and at home I will give you more time with the kids. When you do your job properly you will have the certainty that job security provides. When you work overtime and on public holidays I will protect your penalty put rates. When you want to learn and train I will ensure you get all the support you need. I will ensure that when you put in you get back. And I will correct a great wrong imposed on Middle Australia, on the people who built the good times but who have long been dudded by the government and again this week by the Treasurer. There have been five budgets without a decent tax break. Then $10$10 already gone, gone on the triple whammy: wages threatened, rising interest rates and soaring petrol prices. Fair dinkum, this Treasurer is like a poker machine. You put in, you pull the armnothing. You put in again, another pullnothing. Time after time-nothing. And then, at last, the lights flash, the bells ring, crowds gather round, ‘Jackpot!' the Treasurer crows-10 bucks. That is the drop-10 bucks. Surely, Middle Australia deserves better than this. Day in day out, they are putting in and getting too little back, giving so much, working so hard for so little in return. No wonder they are thinking, ‘If the economy is so good why am I under so much pressure?'-why paying the bills and filling the car and servicing the mortgage gets tougher, not easier; why they are forced to endure all the pain of extreme industrial relations changes without any economic gain for the country. How can this government be so pleased with itself? It has dudded Middle Australian families and mortgaged our kids' future. My pact with Middle Australia The Treasurer has a budget for todayand we have a pact for tomorrow. He smirks at the future; we embrace it. I look ahead to a deal with the millions of Australians he has neglected-a deal that will guarantee our future prosperity. My pact with Middle Australia has that one core promise: when you put in you get back. And tonight there are five key commitments to begin. Child care First, new child-care centres at schools. When you go back to work after having a child, you should not have to face the dreaded ‘double drop-off'. My plan for child-care centres at schools ends the dreaded ‘double drop-off' of kids-for the mums and dads who have kids at child care and kids at school. For a family in Lonsdale it means more time at home together, less time in the car. For the economy it means increased workforce participation. I want to meet the Australian economy's pressing need for more skilled workers. My government will do its bit by giving parents the incentive to work without killing family life. That is why I announce tonight that a federal Labor government will provide $200 million to establish 260 new child-care centres on primary school grounds and other community land. And we will ensure these places go to the areas in our suburbs and towns where child-care shortages mean they are needed most so that parents can work, knowing their kids are getting an educational experience that will set them up for life. I will have more to say about child care in the lead-up to the next election, but I make this commitment tonight: when Australian families put in by working hard we will put in. We will get rid of the ‘double drop-off'. Skills Second, when Australians want to learn a traditional trade to become one of the skilled workers the country desperately needs, they should not have to pay. My government will get rid of TAFE fees for the traditional trades. If you do a traditional apprenticeship, you will not pay TAFE fees. I want to get more of the skilled workers our economy needs. So we need to get rid of TAFE fees for the 60,000 traditional apprentices who start training each year. Labor's priority is clear: train Australians first and train Australians now. That is why I announce tonight that a federal Labor government will set up what I call skills accounts to help Australian families save for training and skills. And we will make an initial deposit of $800 per year, for up to four years, in an apprentice's skills account to get rid of up-front TAFE fees-$800 a year for the kid in Blacktown who wants to be a plumber; $800 a year for kids in Wynnum and Townsville who want to train to be electricians, welders, motor mechanics, chefs and hairdressers. To help solve Australia's massive shortage of child-care workers, I will extend my skills account plan to get rid of TAFE fees for the thousands of Australian trainee child carers who start courses each year. So I announce tonight that a federal Labor government will get rid of TAFE fees for eligible child-care courses by making an initial deposit of $1,200 per year, for up to two years, in a trainee's skills account. Young people training to teach and care for our kids can use this to pay up-front fees at a TAFE or eligible provider-or they can use it for materials and resources charges. This country made a mistake when we turned our back on trades education in schools. So tonight I make these commitments. Labor will give every Australian student the opportunity to study at specialised trades schools. We will give younger students the chance to try their hand at a trade with the Trade Taster Program. For older students there will be more school based apprenticeships. I will invest in ship schemes, not the fake apprenticeships that use our kids as cheap labour and give them no skills. And I will deliver a $2,000 trade completion bonus to encourage kids to finish their courses and produce an extra 10,000 tradespeople-the plumbers, the builders, the child-care workers that we need now. My commitment tonight is this: when Australian kids want to learn a trade my government will be there to help them, and when mums and dads need child care to go back to work I will make sure they can find the child care they need. Unfair dismissal Third, no unfair dismissals. When you do the right thing at work, you will not be unfairly dismissed. I will tear up this government's extreme industrial relations laws and establish genuine protection for anyone who is unfairly dismissed. The Howard government's law gives supervisors and bosses the green light to sack a worker for any reason or no reason at all. What we need are balanced laws to protect both employers and employees from rogue behaviour, not one-sided rules that give employers all power over their staff-a system that gets Australian values back into the way we work. That is why I announce tonight that a federal Labor government will put in place a new system to protect working Australians from the threat of unfair dismissal-a simple process for resolving claims which gets the balance right, protecting both sides. In addition to that, we will let employers and employees negotiate over family-friendly conditions and safety training, without any exceptions, and which are capable of being incorporated in any agreement that they arrive at. That is my commitment to working Australians. When you put in every day to build our future prosperity, I will give you the job sereal apprenticecurity you deserve. Foreign apprentices Fourth, no foreign apprentices. If you are prepared to learn a trade, you will not have to compete with foreign apprentices. I want young Australians to get the training opportunities they deserve and which the Australian economy so badly needs. As long as young Australians in Launceston and Gosford are being turned away from apprenticeships and TAFE, I will not allow foreign apprentices to take away their chances in life. We have already had 270,000 extra skilled workers enter this country over the last 10 years, but 300,000 young Australians have been turned away from TAFE. And we are seeing Australians laid off while foreign workers take their places on conditions noone should have to put up with. Now the Prime Minister is allowing foreign apprentices to come to Australia and take apprenticeship places here. He is even giving businesses incentives to take them on. These foreign apprentices are headed to regional areas where youth unemployment is already too high and wages too low. To get their visas, foreign apprentices must accept whatever wages and conditions are on offer-and young Aussies have to compete with them. If they do not like it, they lose their visas and they are out. Over time, this will ruin the job prospects of young Australians. That is why I announce tonight that a federal Labor government will abolish foreign apprenticeship visas. No government I lead will import foreign apprentices from overseas while Aussie kids are turned away from training. It is just plain wrong. commitment: train our kids first, before you train anyone else's. Broadband Fifth, real broadband for your kids and your business. If you invest in a computer for your kids' education, they will have real broadband to equip them for the learning of the future. Australia needs a ‘fibre-to-thenode' broadband network across the country. To you and me, this means a broadband system 25 times faster than the sorts of speeds available in Australia today. That is why I announce tonight that a federal Labor government will invest in a joint venture with telecommunications companies to build this super fast computer network. Labor would draw on the $757 million Broadband Connect program as well as provide an equity injection from the $2 billion earmarked for the Communications Fund to deliver the public funding of this partnership with the private sector. This will deliver broadband that can instantly download documentaries, educational software and digital books; broadband that can host virtual classrooms where children could video conference around Australia-a digital school of the air for all. Plus we will offer a ‘clean feed' to parents who want to make sure their kids are learning on the internet, not being exposed to pornography and violence. Half a century ago Labor imagined an Australia where every child had a desk with a lamp to study on at night. Tonight this is my commitment: when you put a computer on that desk, I will give you a connection that plugs you into the world and brings every book ever written into your home. This is an investment in national infrastructure that equips our kids for the future-part of my plan to rebuild Australia's crumbling road, rail, ports, electricity and communicaSo this is my tions networks. We will take the politics out of infrastructure spending with an independent expert body-Infrastructure Australia. We will make it easier for super funds to invest in infrastructure, and we will set up a Building Australia Fund to invest in the productive infrastructure of the future. When Australians want to compete in the world I will make sure they have the 21st century infrastructure to take on the world's best and win. A pact for future prosperity Why a pact like this for Middle Australia? Because it is Middle Australia that has driven 14 years of prosperity. With proper rewards and the right incentives, Middle Australia will have the capacity and the will to lead the next generation of economic growth too. Right now our country has great opportunities. And I have great hopes for our futurean unshakeable faith in the Australian people. I know their talent, ingenuity, hard work and good humour is unmatched. The Beaconsfield miracle is proof enough of that. If only I could say the same of this government. If only I saw at the cabinet table the values I see at the kitchen tables of ordinary Australian families. World economic conditions have given this government the best luck, the best opportunities and a real chance to do something for the nation not just for themselves. Australia is part of the fastest growing region in a world economy that is growing at its fastest rate in 30 years. This on top of mineral prices soaring to record levels, export prices at their best in half a century and, globally, lower interest rates than anyone can remember. The minerals boom is putting an extra $160 billion straight into this government's pockets. There has never been anything like it. Yet where has it gone? What can we point to that lasts? With the minerals boom, the Treasurer had a once-in-a-lifetime chance in this budget to set Australia up for the 21st century and he blew it. Just imagine what we could be achieving. Just imagine if this government were making real investments in our schools, TAFE colleges, universities and research labs so that we led the world with the best trained workforce. Instead, Australia is the only advanced country that has actually cut its public investment in training in professions and trades-minus eight per cent over the last 10 years; the next worse industrialised country, plus 15; OECD average, plus 38. Imagine if they were building a communications network that gave all Australians access to world class internet infrastructure. Instead we lag behind, with internet infrastructure that leaves us trailing the rest of developed world and even Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Imagine if people could drive through cities like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne without it taking half a day's work to get to work. Imagine if we had a government with the foresight to deal with climate change now, so that great Australian icons like the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu are still there for our grandkids. Imagine if we had a government which thought enough of pensioners to give them a decent break. Imagine if infrastructure decisions were taken in the national interest not just the interests of The Nationals. Imagine if we had a government that governed for Middle Australian families instead of governing for themselves and their mates. If this government thought that any of these things were important, it would be doing more, much more-more to lift workforce participation and productivity; more to build a better future for our kids; to fireproof our economy from future risks; nation building. Instead our kids' inheritance from this government is foreign debt reaching half a trillion dollars and growing faster than ever before-one of the world's highest foreign debts. For our kids, this government leaves a massive burden-already $500 million of interest payments every single week, while Australia racks up even more debt with the worse run of trade deficits in our history. Even the Treasurer's own department has finally warned this year that Australia's foreign liabilities ‘cannot continue to rise forever'. Things are good right now because of the years of hard slog by Middle Australia. But, according to the Treasurer, he is the one who has created the good times",140
210,Unknown,BUSINESS,Government members interjecting,144
211,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"They are into the selfcongratulations again. You had nothing to do the with it; it is all them. You only have to look at the Treasurer's smug capering on the day that interest rates went up. We remember that. He was like Wile E Coyote in momentary triumph before the anvil falls. You only need to see that to see what he really thinks of Middle Australia. For 10 years he has ignored the long hours they have put in and the sacrifices they have made to achieve our nation's economic success. And still he refuses to acknowledge that, if we are serious about building our future prosperity, Middle Australia must start getting something back. Mr Speaker, what has this budget done? When the budget party is over, when the back slapping is done, when the tuxedo has been dry-cleaned and the champagne has run out, what is left in the morning? Nothing to help Middle Australia build the nation's future prosperity because, to build that future prosperity, Middle Australia needs a lot more than just tax relief. I support the modest, overdue tax relief that Middle Australian families received in the budget. They will need every cent of it, especially when they are facing the triple-whammy of higher interest rates, higher petrol prices and extreme industrial relations changes. So of course I welcome this tax break for the families of Middle Australia. But I make this point: no tax cut can make up for your losing your penalty rates. No tax cut can make up for your being unfairly dismissed. No tax cut can find you extra time to spend with your family. And no tax cut will give back the jobs that the Ballarat apprentice welders lost to Chinese workers. My point is this: sure, the government is offering tax cuts, and I support them, but I will also deliver job security, education and training, child care and nation building. is my pact with Middle Australia because, like me, Middle Australia is asking: what else? Where is the down payment on the future? Where is the investment in skills, in kids and in families? Where is the vision Australia needs-the vision we need to build prosperity? This budget fails Middle Australia and mortgages our future. It has no plan to take pressure off interest rates. If interest rates go up again, Middle Australia knows who to blame-the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, if your failure to fix the skills crisis forces interest rates up again, the buck stops with you. If your failure to show national leadership on infrastructure forces up interest rates up again, the buck stops with you. And if your failure to turn around Australia's current account deficit forces interest rates up again, the buck stops with you. Mr Speaker, there are dangerous holes in this budget. There is no plan to free us from being hostage to Middle Eastern oil prices, no plan to develop new Australian fuels, no plan to fix our crumbling infrastructureclogged roads, slow internet connection, near empty dams and overburdened ports-no plan to stop kids from being turned away from TAFE colleges or, if they get into uni, ending up with a debt the size of a home mortgage, no plan to tackle the growing crisis in kids' health and no plan for child care. We have these plans and we have these ambitions. And I can do these things because there are some things I will not be spending money on. Unlike the Howard government, I will not splurge a billion dollars on advertising-and they have got millions more through these budget papers. I will not spend a billion dollars on their war in Iraq-the wrong war, a war where Australian money bought Saddam's bullets-and I will never spend half a billion dollars with lawyers and That consultants to impose a nasty dog-eat-dog industrial relations system on hard working, decent Australians. This government's legacy is this: a nation not equipped for the future, an economy vulthat nerable when the sun stops shining, a government that does not reward Middle Australia. Under its watch, the boom times are not building future prosperity; they are building foreign debt. This government is not laying the solid foundation our kids need for a prosperous future. That is what Middle Australia needs-a government that will build a future for our kids and the country-one that builds prosperity; a government with new economic policies based on Australian values-one that will protect the Australian way of life; a government with my blueprints to tackle skills and infrastructure, climate change and children's health, Australian fuels and national security; a government with my pact with Middle Australia-a pact to end the ‘double drop-off', to get rid of TAFE fees in trades and child care, to end unfair dismissals, to train Australians first and to give our kids a high-tech future. In short, a pact with one crucial promise: when you put in you get back-a promise at the heart of every policy I will take to the next election. The Treasurer has always been arrogant. He has not changed. But the Prime Minister has changed. Remember his annual family holidays at Hawks Nest? Not anymore. Now it is Washington, Ottawa and Dublin. When the Prime Minister leaves Australia tomorrow, I will stay and fight for Middle Australia. I will not cut and run from a debate on industrial relations or a debate on our national future or from an election fought in Middle Australia. When I am Prime Minister, expect three things: expect nation building, expect Australian values at work and, most of all, expect me to reward the hard work of Middle Australia-because, under a Beazley Labor government, when you put in you get back. My pact with Middle Australia is the way forward. Mr Abbott-A speech by Bob Ellis, plagiarised from Newt Gingrich, I move: That the debate be adjourned. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 8.03 pm NA The following notices were given: Ms George to move: That this House (1) expresses its concerns about the impact of the new guidelines for the CDEP program which are to apply from July 1, 2006; (2) draws attention to the positive outcomes of CDEP, which has been the mainstay of employment for Indigenous Australians; (3) recognises the unacceptably high rates of Indigenous unemployment across the nation; (4) notes the small percentage of Indigenous Job Network participants who gain long-term and full-time employment; (5) expresses serious concern about the future viability of CDEP in urban and regional areas with the introduction of a maximum limit of 52 weeks in CDEP for new participants; and (6) calls on the Government to recognise the value of CDEP as the mainstay of employment and community development for Indigenous Australians. Mr Baird to move: That this House calls on the United Nations to: (1) substantially increase the level of aid to the Darfur region of the Sudan; (2) call upon member nations to provide peacekeeping forces to quell the civil war currently taking place in the country; (3) lift the profile of this catastrophic situation that confronts Darfur and the conflict which has already claimed 300,000 lives and seen 2.4 million people displaced; (4) work effectively with the NGO's to ensure a substantial lift in the level of privately sourced aid going to the region; and (5) ensure that maximum cooperation is given to peace negotiations.",144
