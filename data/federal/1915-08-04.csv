Assent to the following Bills reported :War Loan Bill (So. 2) /United Kingdom}. Loan (Kalgoorlie to Fort Augusta Railway) Bill. Appropriation Bill 1914-15. NA DECLARATION"" OF WAR.",5
1,Mr FISHER,ANNIVERSARY OE THE,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.8] - B y leave, I move That we, the Representatives of tha Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, do, on the expiration of a year of war, present to His Majesty our most loyal servioe, and record our unchanging determination to continue to a victorious end the' struggle for the maintenance of the ideals of Liberty and Justice whioh are the oommon and sacred cause of the Allied Nations. This is a fitting occasion for the renewal by this Parliament, representing as it does the Commonwealth of Australia, of our pledge of loyalty to Hie Majesty, and for a declaration to all our brothers of the British race and to the nations with whioh we are allied, of our undaunted determination to 'see the war through to a successful end. When the war broke out many thought, that the year would see its close; today no one would predict when it will finish. It is enough to say thab a successful end will be our aim and object. We are determined to make every sacrifice neces- . sary to achieve it . The war has involved eleven nations. Fighting has taken place on three continents-Americ a and Australia alone have been spared the spilling of blood. But, though Australian territory haa remained unviolated, Australia's sons are acting their part at the seat of war. Our justification for the-part that we are playing in the conflict is thab our interests, equally with those of the Mother Country, are involved. And Australia has no cause to feel other than flattered at the way in which her sons have responded to the call of arms-75,00 0 of th© best and bravest have gone to the fron t overseas. More than 40,000 are undergoing training here in preparation for despatch. Those of them who have been privileged to meet the foe face to face have well upheld the honour of their country. Indeed, they have added lustre to her name, and have gained imperishable renown for themselves. But all has not yet been done that must be done. No one can foresee the necessities of even the hour, and we know not what the future will demand, but whatever the sacrifices that we may have to make, let them be made cheerfully. Par better that we should die than be under the servitude of the nation which is our enemy. A singular series of incidents marked the commencement of the war. Servia found herself in difficulties with Austria, and Bussia took her part. many thereupon declared war against Russia. But she did not immediately commence to make war upon that country. Her first step was to invade-no t Russia; not even Servia; but Luxembourg, a neutral state. She then demanded of France what that country proposed to do, and when France replied that it was her intention to protect her own interests, Germany declared war against Prance. Yet the first blow fell-no t upon France, but upon Belgium, with whom Germany had no quarrel. In neither case did Germany attack in the first instance the nation against which she had declared war. Having declared war on Russia, she fell upon Luxembourg. Having declared war upon France, she fell upon Belgium. That fact in itself condemns that nation in the eyes of every free and freedom-loving people in the world. Whatever the military power and prestige of the Germans, it is the duty of the rest of mankind to put the German nation into its proper place. I believe that Australians will do i war more than the most optimistic of us could, before war began, have believed possible. I believe, too, that our patriotism will rise to the measure of our requirements. It becomes us all, whatever may be our position, our wealth, or our ability of personal service, to do what we can to maintain our just cause. To repeat what I said at the very beginning, Australia in this business must be with the Mother Country and for her, to our last man and to our last shilling.",5
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ANNIVERSARY OE THE,"Parramatta) [3.10],-It was only on my return to Melbourne today that I learned of the intention of the Prime Minister to submit this motion, and I did so with unalloyed satisfaction. It is meet that on this anniversary of the declaration of war we should express our unchanged and unchanging determination to see the thing through. That seems to me to be the keynote of the right honourable gentleman's motion and of his speech. There is only one thing for us to do, and that is to continue to strive to the uttermost, with all our will and all our strength, u n t i l the war is over, to w in the victory for the cause of justice and humanity. Ours is uot the rdle of merely an outside interested spectator. Ger- We are in this war through and through. It is our war as much as it is the war of the Allies-as much as it is the war of the Empire at large. After a tragic year of fighting and' struggling, the causes still remain, and' so many of our best have been laid low that we owe it to them to continue the work they have carried on sosuccessfully, adding fresh laurels to our national fame, and covering themselves with an imperishable glory. Belgium still remains under the heel of the oppressor. That was one of the reasonswhy we sprang to arms. It is worthwhile remembering that in the hour of her trial Belgium appealed, not to her next door neighbour, but to us who are far away. Her appeal was to the Britisb Empire, for protection, for preservation, for security. Belgium still exists- a fugitive nation, a suffering nation, a bleeding nation, a nation bereft of home, bereft almost of government, bereft of all those things that make for our national pride and honour. While ever Belgium n this is in that position we must not relax a single effort. We must see her through. We must avenge her f ullv and completely for all that she has suffered in the interests of humanity. Then, that swaggering, blustering, theatrical monarch is still astride a section of Europe, boasting of his destructive sword and all that it is to accomplish. I hope we shall see the proper sequel to that boasting soon. I imagine that when our great armies get moving thoroughly, when our grand reI serve has been properly mobilized, that we may break the blade of that sword, or, any rate, make it Of non-effect. These are causes for which we are still fighting, and for which we must continue to fight. There are other considerations, too, which come home to us at this moment. Our own Empire is threatened. Our own old home-that home we all hail from, and are so proud of-that home which is the centre of all our parliamentary institueloquent tions and of nearly everything that we revere. That fact alone must surely make an appeal to us as parliamentarians. other thoughts come to mind as one conplunge siders that old home, with its freedom, ita pieties, its associations, its history, its literature. If there be one thing more than another for which the British Empire has always stood, it is for its love of liberty and of law; and it is that of liberty that has been one of our most inspiring motives in this mighty make it do so? war. Our own Australia is at stake, too, with all its freedom, its sunshine, its prospects, and all that it connotes for a wider, wiser, and more humane civilization than this world has yet seen. It is for the future that we fight, well as for the maintenance the traditions of the past. I hope wheat before the House? nothing will interfere to make for' an inconclusive peace. To stop the war at present by any means whatever would be tihe greatest tragedy which could happen to civilization. We cannot have a repetition of this struggle. We must finish it while we are at it, no matter its cost may be, and, therefore, I welcome the expression- I put all the heart and soul of my being into that expression"" unchanging determination."" It does not need many words to commend a motion of this kind. We are all of one heart and purpose in the prosecution of the war to a successful conclusion, and on this annifor versary of its outbreak we are more determe mined than ever to maintain those ideals for which our Empire stands, and for which we are associated with our Allies. Onward lies peace and progress and proswould perity and national honour. To hesitate at this time would be to earn the contempt of the generations that are to come for having toyed with our glorious heritage and risked their destiny. That, I trust, shall never be said of us; and, therefore, Mr Joseph Cook. second this motion with the greatest possible heartiness, and I hope we shall carry at it unanimously, and with acclamation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Ordered That the foregoing resolution be forwarded through His Excellency the Governor General. REFERENDA PROPOSALS.",6

9,Mr TUDOR,ANNIVERSARY OE THE,"The honourable member Melbourne, on the 30th June, asked to prepare a return showing the exports of a number of items from Australia from August, 1914, to June, 1915. I have had the return prepared, but I point out to the honourable member that a return covering any series of months is, as a rule, inconclusive unless it can he compared with similar months for previous years. I would also point out that included in these exports are the foodstuffs required for provisioning the transports which have recently left our shores. COMMONWEALTH OT AUSTRALIA.

18,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CAS E OF JULIUSBLAU,"I do not there wish to name either the persons or ciations concerned.

21,Mr GREGORY,CAS E OF JULIUSBLAU,"In view of the answer just given by the Prime Minister to the question addressed to him by the honourable member for Flinders, I wish to ask him whether a resolution passed by the Clerks Union, and published in the Argus of 24th ultimo, which is supposed to have been sent to him, has yet reached him. The resolution is as follows: Further, the union wishes to impress upon the Federal Ministry and the Federal Labour party",9

I do not know what were the terms of the resolution, or whether any treasonable statement was made in it . I do not understand the interest displayed in this matter.

If so, will the honourable gentleman state what action, if any, has been taken?",10
30,Mr JENSEN,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,"Actio n was immediately taken to bring under the notice of the authorities concerned the statement contained in the question put by the honourable member, and I think that the trouble has been remedied. AUSTRALIAN WAR LOAN.",10
31,Mr HIGGS,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,"Has the Treasurer seen a statement published in the Melbourne Herald of Monday last, which may possibly have the effect of deterring people from investing in the present issue of the Australian War Loan? The statement in question was to the effect that the right honourable gentleman had been asked whether there was a probability of those now investing in the loan being given, later on "" a more equitable advance ""- a higher rate of interest, I presume-and that the Prime Minister's answer was non-committal. H ad the Herald any ground for making such a statement, and does not the right honourable gentleman think that it is calculated to have a prejudicial effect upon the success of the Australian War Loan? If he has not yet made a statement on the subright ject, will he now state emphatically his an inquiry view as to whether those now investing in tihe present issue will be likely to secure, later on, a higher rate of in terest? I hand the Prime Minister a copy of the statement in question. WORKSHOPS. Mr FISHER - I had not seen before the statement which the honourable member has just handed to me. I find that it was published in the "" Markets and' M o n e y "" column, a column that deals more with markets than with money. Those investors who are waiting for a higher rate of interest, on the second instalment of the loan, will be disappointed. So far as the Government are concerned, that point has been settled definitely and distinctly, and our decision has been conveyed frequently to the public and the people concerned. It is a mischievous thing for any writer, claiming to have financial knowledge, to say that my statement was non-committal. My statement was direct, and my only doubt is as to whether the interest to be paid is not too high. WAR LOAN.",10
32,Mr KELLY,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,"Is the Prime Minister aware that trustees in the various States find some difficulty in investing in the War Loan owing to the State Parliaments not having taken action ? Will the right honourable gentleman endeavour to expedite such State action in order to get a more ready response to the loan ? Mr FISHER ' - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for asking this question. All the State Governments have agreed to take action, and as the State Parliaments are in session, I was hoping that they would deal with this matter as one of urgency. I will communicate further with the State Premiers this afternoon. NURSES ' UNIFORMS .  Minister received any communication from any of the firms who are said to have overcharged for nurses' outfits?

34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,What steps have the Government taken?,11
35,Mr FISHER,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,That question should be addressed to the Minister for the Navy. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. GIFTS FOR SOLDIERS.,11
36,Mr CHANTER,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,"Is the Minister for the Navy aware that there are con-tinuous rumours that the gifts of the people of Australia to the Red Cross Society are not being distributed to the soldiers at the front as gifts, but are being charged for? Will the Minister inquire into this statement, and if he finds it to be true, take action to see that the practice is discontinued ? If the statement is not true, will the Minister make a public pronouncement to that effect at once?",11
37,Mr JENSEN,EXPERIMENTS AT NEWPORT,"I made the statement in this House last week,"" I think, that all these goods sent to the front are distributed to the soldiers as gifts. My opinion is that many of these rumours are unfounded, but if the honourable member knows of any specific case of the kind he has indicated, and will mention it to me, I will have it investigated.

40,Mr HAMPSON,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"In view of the action of the Government of New South Wales in absolutely prohibiting the export of butter from that State, and of the Government of Queensland in preventing the export of meat to other Australian States, and also the claim of the Victorian Government to control the export of meat, will the Attorney-General state what action the Commonwealth Government contemplate taking to prevent the existing functions of the Commonwealth being exercised by the States?",11
41,Mr HUGHES,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"It does not come within the province of a State Government to prohibit the export of any commodity unless the State has previously acquired that commodity. As to Commonwealth action, until some person who is aggrieved makes complaint the Commonwealth Government cannot act. Under - the Wheat Acquisition Act of New South Wales, * the same position arose. The Commonwealth Government were waited upon by a deputation of persons who had been prevented from sending wheat across the border. We asked those citizens to make a definite and detailed statement of their position. They did so, and upon that statement we took action. We shall take what action we can in regard to> export-and I confess that the remedy does not appear very clear on the face of it-whe n any citizens claim that they have been refused permission to trade freely throughout Australia. WAR CENSUS SCHEDULE . Mr FE2STTON - Will the Attorney General say whether the Wa r Committee have come to a final decision in regard to the second schedule of the War Census Bill? If so, is a copy of the finally the approved schedule available to honourable members ?",11
42,Mr HUGHES,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"The War Committee had approved of the schedule, but some' re-arrangement of the questions relating to the values of land and improvements thereon have 'been suggested by Mr . Knibbs and the Commissioner of Land Tax, Mr MCKay. The Committee has been this afternoon considering these questions, and has adjourned, but will re-assemble later on in order to settle them. The schedule in substance, however, has been settled, and for the honourable member's information I may say that there have no radical changes. No other information than that which was contemplated when the schedule was before the Chamber is being sought. The arrangements by the Committee are in the direction of making the questions clearer and more in telligible to the public. The amendments .are in their nature verbal. LIVERPOOL CAMP.",11
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"Will the Government lay on the table the report of Mr Justice Rich on the Liverpool Camp, and, if so, when ?",12
44,Mr JENSEN,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"So far as I know, the report is not completed. SUGAR INDUSTRY .",12
45,Mr GROOM,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"Some time ago the At torney-General made a preliminary announcement with regard to the arrange-, ments for the acquisition of Queensland sugar, and promised to make a further statement. Is the honourable gentleman now in a position to make that statement, and also to inform the House as to the nature of the arrangements he has made with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ?",12
46,Mr HUGHES,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"As to"" the first part of the question, Mr Clarke, the representative of the Commerce Branch of the Department of Trade and Customs, went to Queensland last week to settle a number of points in dispute between the Government and the various millers. These have been practically all settled; and matters are now proceeding quite harmoniously. I yesterday supplied the Premier of Queensland with a detailed statement so far as the Commonwealth's financial position in this matter is concerned; and when I hear from that gentleman I shall make the full statement available. I may say that, although I have no doubt that the agreement between the Company and the Commonwealth is legally binding, it has not yet been drawn up in the ordinary form of a legal document. The points, however, have been, practically, all settled. I saw Mr Knox in reference to the matter today. There is no reason why, as soon as I have heard from Mr . Ryan, the Premier of Queensland, the document should not be signed and made available to Parliament. SMALL ARMS FACTORY .",12
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"I desire to ask a question in reference to the Small Arms Factory, and, perhaps, as this is a matter of policy, the Prime Minister per person to address the question to. Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the notification already made by the Government is having very serious consequences in Lithgow-that things are becoming unsettled, and people are prevented from building houses and providing other accommodation for those who work at the Factory ? In the next place, will the Prim© Minister submit to th© House the proposal embodied in the recommendation of the Public Works Committee to remove the Small Arms Factory, or rather to build another factory at Canberra; and, if so, when?",12

I further asked whether the recommendation would first be submitted to the House?",12
55,Mr FISHER,STATE GOVERNMEN T,"In the first place, the removal of the Factory from Lithgow is not involved; it is a matter of duplicating the Factory, and I understand that the facilities in our own Federal Territory are greater than elsewhere for the erection of a new Factory, with the object is the proof doubling the output.",12

92,Mr HUGHES,TRANSPORT OF WOUNDED TO,"I have, already answered that question, but perhaps I had a better make the situation quite clear. The present position is that, with a fluctuating of wheat market, with wheat values possibly falling, we have a stiffening freight market. It is very obvious that if there nare twenty or t h i r t y operators on that market, higher freight values may result, higher freight values may spell r u in to the farmers of Australia. For this reason we have arranged that there shall only one operator acting on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. That is the position. Every man would do the is same in his own business.

One provides for the f u r ther definition of what a dependant is. Under it , the term dependant means the wife or widow and children of a soldier, and such other members of his family as were wholly or in part dependent on his earnings at any time during the period of twelve months prior to his enlistment. We propose also to make the further provision that a child who, on attaining the age of sixteen years, is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, unable to earn a livelihood, may then be granted a further pension as' a dependant, during the remainder of his or her life. That is, of course, provided the child was dependent at the time her father was killed or totally incapacitated.",18
108,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Darling Downs) [4.14]. - I hope the Minister will permit me to draw his attention to the fact that the honourable member for Richmond raised the question of the amount which had been contributed to the support of the dependant by a soldier prior to his death or permanent incapacity. The honourable member's point was that, in the event of a person contributing to the support of a dependant for a period of twelve months prior to his death or permanent incapacity, a certain definite sum, if that sum did not exceed the amount stated in the schedule, the Commissioner should take the sum as evidence of the extent to which the person was dependent, and make the pension at least that amount.",19
109,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,That point will be considered in this proposed amendment.,19
110,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The Bill is going to the Senate now, and will come back for f u r ther consideration, when we shall have to consider the amendments made by the Senate; but the reason I mention the matter briefly now is that it may save discussion in another place. I do not think any time will be lost by having the position stated clearly.",19
111,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If the honourable member reads the proposed amendments, he will see that they embrace what he has in mind.",19
112,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I do not .think they do. It seems to me that the amendments only deal with the definition of what is a dependant, and not with the point raised by the honourable member for Richmond, which was, I tliink, originally mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta.",19
113,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I informed the honourable member for Richmond that I could not give any promise regarding the whole 06 his amendment, but I think the amendments to be made embrace a good deal of what he had in mind. A dependant will now be able to explain to the Commissioner what he or she received from thedeceased or incapacitated soldier.",19
114,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Accordin g to the present law, that evidence can be given. The trouble is that the Commissioner is notbound to award the amount contributed.. A dependant'may say, "" I was in receipt of £ 1 a week,"" and the Commissionermay award 10s. That is the trouble.",19

I quite agree that it seemsextraordinary that any Commissioner should set aside specific evidence on sucfa a point. The amendment foreshadowed! by the Minister seems to cover the point, raised by the honourable member for Gippsland that a dependant means the wife o r widow and children of a soldier. The idea, was that a wife and child shall be regarded as dependants without being called upon to give proof of the fact.",19
119,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Yes .,19
120,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"As I understand it , theV position wil l be this, if the amendment is accepted: A widow and a child, no mat- ter how much their income from private*' sources may be, will be absolutely entitled) to pensions, according to schedule rates,, without their other income being taken in to consideration.",19
121,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,At full rates!,19
122,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Yes . That is the in tention of this amendment, and the M in ister indicates that I am stating the position clearly. I think it is what the House, desires *",19
123,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Gippsland) [4.20] - When the Bill was being discussed in Committee the other night, the desire was that a widow or child should be entitled to ensiou as a right and not as a dependant, have not seen the proposed amending, ment, but it seemed to me while the am Minister was reading it that it would again group up ""wives and children"" with '"" dependants."" The difficulty could overcome by an amendment of section of the principal Act , which is the operawlio tive provision so far as the payment pensions is concerned. It declares that the Commonwealth "" shall, subject to this Act, be liable to pay to the member his dependants or both "" a pension. we substituted for those words the words *' shall be liable to pay to the member, his wife, child, or his dependants "" our £ 52 per year? intention would be made clear. sire expressed by the Committee when Bill was before us last week was that the entitled. widow and children of deceased soldiers should receive their pensions as of right, matter. and that it should not be necessary them to prove that they were wholly or in part dependent upon the deceased. the Bill be amended to carry out that intention, we shall be satisfied.",19
124,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Barrier) [4.22] - I very glad that the Government propose in another place so to amend the Bill as source. to make it clear that the widow and children of a deceased soldier shall be t it l e d to the full pension payable in respect of a man of his rank. ment, however, while excellent as far as it goes, does not go far enough.",20
125,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,What about the widowed mother ?,20
126,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"That was the point which I was about to refer. reasonable that the first call should be made upon unmarried rather than upon - married men with families, and there can be no doubt that the majority who have need of one? gone so far are young unmarried men. That being so, the Bill , as proposed be amended in this respect, will not apply to the majority of our men at the front. T recognise that there are difficulties the way of achieving the object I have in view; but unless we place widowed mothers in the same position - widows and children of deceased soldiers, we shall have not merely anomalies, but that. very serious hardships. The honourable rmember for Fawkner cited a case which was very much to the point. He told of a young fellow who was practically the mainstay of his mother, and who desired to go to the front. His mother was the very anxious that he should go, but he pressed her for permission to enlist, say"" Never mind, mother; if I go, and killed, you will be provided for ; you will receive a pension of .£52 a year.'' He went, and was killed, but because his be widowed mother was not wholly dependent 3 upon him, since she had two daughters were able to contribute to her supof port, she was deprived of the pension.",20
127,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Unde r the Bill as proposed to be amended, if that mother can or show that she was dependent to some exI f tent upon the young man prior to his enlistment, she will receive a pension.",20
128,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The full pension-the The de- Mr JENSEN - Sh e will receive by way the of pension the amount to which she is,20
129,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"That is quite another Tliat means that she will not for receive £ 1 a week, although the widow of such a man would do so. The honourable If member for Richmond last week told us of the mother of a young man killed at the front who had been awarded a pension am of only £ 2 6 per year, because she was drawing £ 26 per annum from another",20
130,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Commissioner will enhave extensive powers under the Act.,20
131,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"He will ; but the reThe amendgulations must be drafted in accordance with the Act , and it would be unfair for this House to find f a u l t with the administration later on if it allowed the Bil l to be framed in such a way that reto gulations under it contained provisions It seems to which they objected.",20
132,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Would the honourable member wish the Government to give a pension to a person who was not really in,20
133,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I . have taken up the to stand that payment of the full pension, according to the rank of the man, .should be absolutely assured-that it should be in regarded as part and parcel of the conditions of enlistment. The full pension should be payable as of right just as is as the the maternity allowance.",20
134,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No country could do,20
135,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Then it is unfair to accept the services of those who are willus ing to volunteer, and not to make adequate provision for those whom they leave behind. If conscription were in force the not position would be different. But we are appealing to men to volunteer, and the vast majority of those who remain at home have quite as much at stake as those who go.",20
136,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,What country is doing as much for its men as Australia is doing 1,21
137,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Why should we not do what is right, irrespective of what other countries may he doing? If China elects to pay its men only a few pence per day, is that any reason why we should do the same?",21
138,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I had in mind, China, hut Great-Britain and Canada.",21
139,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Our soldiers are receiving better pay than any others at the front, and we have in force the best of all war pension measures. Do not cripple the Government altogether.",21
140,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I do not wish to cripple the Government. The Minister asked a few moments ago whether I desired that these pensions should he payable to persons whether they were in need of them or not. I would remind him that the amendment proposed to be made in another place will give the widow of a deceased soldier the right to a pension whether she requires it or not. Why should not a widowed mother be placed in the same position? Why should a soldier's widow who is receiving £5,000 a year be able to draw the full pension, while the mother of a deceased soldier who has an income of only £26 a year is to be allowed to draw only half the pension? I am not blaming the Government for the amendment they propose to make; my only complaint is that it does not go Ioff ahissoldier far enough. The Government are undoubtedly right in applying this principle to the widows and children of deceased soldiers, but they should extend it to the widowed mothers of deceased soldiers. I possessions know of a young fellow who is under age, and who is extremely anxious to enlist. His widowed mother is not at present pendent upon him. 'She is sacrificing herself in order to enable him to go to the University, in the hope that he will qualify for a profession, and will ultimately be in a position to maintain But if he goes to the front, and is killed, his widowed mother will receive since she will not be able to show that she was dependent upon him at of his enlistment.",21
141,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If the widowed mother of a deceased soldier can show was dependent upon him, she will receive the pension, or if she can show that she was partially dependent upon him she will receive a proportionate allowance.",21
142,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,But why should the widow of a soldier he entitled to draw the full pension?,21
143,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Because she was entirely dependent upon her husband.,21
144,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No such condition is imposed by the proposed amendment.,21
145,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If the mother becomes denot. pendent within five years, she will be entitled to a pension.",21
146,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Quite so; but if she is in receipt of £26 per annum, she cannot receive, by way of pension, more than a further £26. Then, again, if a soldier returns from the front incapacitated, is he to draw the full pension, irrespective of any income to which he may be entitled? The honourable member for Wimmera has handed to me a regulation under the principal Act, which suggests that those who come back incapacitated do not necessarily receive the full pension. They have to answer a question as to whether they are entitled to any other pension or superannuation allowance. Why is sucb a question asked?",21
147,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It is understood that if a soldier is incapacitated he has a right to a pension.,21
148,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,He has to prove that he - is incapacitated.,21
149,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,That is so.,21
150,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I think that is right. is wounded, but by the time return to Australia is well and strong again, there is an end to the matter; but if he is permanently incapacitated, is he entitled as of right to the pension, or has he to give an account of his ?",21
151,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I do not think he has todegive an account of what he has. He is entitled to the pension as a right.,21
152,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Then why should the regulations cast any doubt on the subject?,21
153,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,This is a matter to be her. dealt with by the regulations.,21
154,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"And they cannot be more nothing, expansive than the Act.",21
155,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No . They must be the time based on the Act itself.,21
156,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Sometime s regulations, do not correctly interpret the Act under that she which they are made.",21
157,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Owing to a misapprehension, a regulation that was not really in accordance with the Act might be drafted and put in force. It would be manifestly unfair to find fault with the administration of the Act because of any question put to a soldier or his dependants under regulations that were in conformity with the Act as passed by us, but which did not embody what was the actual intention of the Legislature. ""We should have a definite assurance from the Minister-one way or the other.",22
158,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"So far as I know from the Attorney-General, any incapacitated .soldier can draw a pension as a right.'",22
159,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If we have an assurance from the Minister that no question will be asked as to the soldier's ability to maintain himself, and that all he will be required to prove will be his incapacitation, I shall be satisfied. Whilst I am pleased that widows and fatherless ""children are to receive their pensions as .a matter of right, I am sorry that the .Minister .does not propose to accord the widowed mother the same treatment.",22
160,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Wimmera) [4.37] I welcome an amendment to meet some - of the cases mentioned by honourable members when this Bill was before the House last week-, but, like the honourable member 'for Barrier, I regret that the Minister has - not seen fit to extend the scope of the amendment, in order to include also the widowed mother.",22
161,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Unde r the existing provisions of the Act the widowed mother will receive a pension if she can prove that she ds dependent.,22
162,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Sh e has to prove dependence, and if she has any other income a corresponding deduction is made from the total amount of pension which she would otherwise receive. I hold a letter from a widow, whose only son went to the front as a first lieutenant. Prior to joining the Expeditionary Forces he was helping to maintain his mother, and he told her that if he were killed she would be - entitled to a pension of £91. This young man was killed whilst fighting with the now .famous 3rd Brigade. The mother - states that she gave him willingly for his country, but she has living at home with her three daughters. One of them is attending school, and the others are learn.iug some avocation, which will enable them to support themselves later on. Meanwhile they are chiefly dependent on their mother. The mother is the widow of a clergyman, and is in receipt of £1 per week, and that amount has been deducted from the pension, of £91 to which she would have been entitled but for this small income. The son who has to support his mother stands in quite as honourable a position as a husband supporting his wife. The mother is equally dependent on the son, and I cannot see how the Government can separate the relationship of the widowed mother to her son, who is her sole support, and the relationship of a wife to her husband. If consideration is to be extended to the widow and children, the same consideration should be given to widowed mothers. I do not urge that all parents should receive pensions regardless of their financial position, but I venture to say that not more than 25 per cent, of the total numher of widows would he found to he well provided for apart from the help received from the son. The allowance of £1 per week received by the clergyman's widow to whom I have referred, is probably not more than sufficient to pay house rent, and she would require the ful l pension to which she was entitled through the loss of her son to maintain herself and three daughters. It is difficult to prove what proportion of widows are dependent on their sons, but if statistics could be obtained they would probably show that fully three-fourths of the widows are so dependent.",22
163,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,If a widow is dependent she will get the pension.,22
164,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Will the Minister assure the House that if a widowed mother is ahle to show that she was partly dependent upon the earnings of her son before he went to the war she will be entitled to the ful l pension?,22
165,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,We propose to move an amendment in another place to make the Act read that dependant means the wife or widow and children of a soldier.,22
166,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The widowed mother is justly entitled to the same treatment, and I hope the Minister will promise to widen the amendment in that direction.",22
167,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Maribyrnong) [4.45] I desire to say a few words on the subject dealt with by the last three speakers. The following letter has been received f r.om the Treasury by the widowed mother of a young soldier who fell at the front : T. have to inform you that you have been granted a war pension of £26 per annum. The Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, Railway Buildings, Flinders-street, Melbourne, is being instructed to make arrangements for payment. Prior to her son going to the front, this widowed mother had been obliged to support an invalid husband for a number of years. The young soldier was an only son and, I believe, the only child of the family. The mother is well advanced in years.",22
168,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Sh e must be drawing another pension.,23
169,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No .,23
170,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Did the son contribute fco her support?,23
171,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Yes ; he was practically her only support.,23
172,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Do you know the whole circumstances of the case? Perhaps the woman has not told you her own position or that of her husband.,23
173,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I met the lady only through being called upon to assist in drawing up her claim for a pension. I know her circumstances, and if any woman is entitled to full consideration under the War Pensions Act, this one is.",23
174,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,There must have been some reason for the Board awarding only. £26.,23
175,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"In these days of high cost of living, the woman has to pay 15s. for board and lodging with a pension of only 10s. per week.",23
176,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Sh e must have other in come, or she would have been awarded £52.",23
177,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I am safe in saying that this mother is full y fifty-five years of age, and, owing to her severe struggle in life in having to nurse and help to maintain an invalid husband, she has so worn herself down that she is not fit to undertake work to earn her living. While she may be able to earn a few shillings today, in a few years she will be almost wholly dependent on the pension of 10s, per week.",23
178,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If the honourable member will supply me with the woman's name, T will have inquiries made.",23
179,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Eve n if she has a few extra shillings coming in , I consider that she is still entitled to a full pension. The position of the widowed mother is often much harder than that of the woman who loses her husband. The great bulk of the men who have gone to thewar are under t h i r ty years of age,, and, except in rare cases, the wives of, our soldiers are young women, full of vigour, and able to undertake work to earn their own living. The widowed, mother, on the other hand, is often in* her declining years. In this case themyther has, if I may so put it , a more rightfu l claim to consideration thanwould a younger woman.",23
180,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"A mother in her declining years has a right to another pension, as well as this.",23
181,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,That is true.,23
182,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Surely that must be taken into consideration?,23
183,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"But this mother has. not reached that stage. At any rate, in. such times as these, under a Bill of thiskind, we may afford, I think, to treat the mother very well indeed. I shall give the Minister the name of the woman to whom I have referred, and I think he will regard it as an exceptionally hard case,, though there are many others like it . I do not wish to utter anything in the nature of a threat, but if an amendment is not made here, I hope our friends in . another place will make one, thus assuring to the widowed mother rights to» which I think she is entitled.",23
184,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Melbourne Ports)[4.51] - ^ In fixing the machinery for a. measure of this kind, a certain amountof common sense ought to be exercised,, as was done in the case of the In v a l i d and Old-age Pensions Act. There ought to be left with some man the right to discriminate, because, as we all know, it is very hard to pass any Act of Parliament, that will have universal effect. Every case ought to be dealt with on its merits ;, and, in view of the circumstances related by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, it would appear that the Act, as it is at present, is not elastic enough.",23
185,Mr JEWSEW,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Commissioner hasextensive powers under the Bill .,23
186,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The trouble is that the Commissioner is an official. Under theInvali d and Old-age Pensions Act there is a Deputy-Commissioner in every State; and, unfortunately, in some of the States,, these Deputy-Commissioners deem ittheir duty to save as much as they can to the taxpayers. They do not administer ?the Act according to its spirit, but confine themselves strictly to the letter, and bave an idea that they are doing a service to their country if they can deprive some individual of a pension."" This may seem rather a nasty charge to make; but such is the fact. In Victoria, we have, I suppose, actually the best man in Australia for a position of the kind. He deals with - every case on its merits; and I understand that, because of this, he is not popular as an official. From what I have heard, however, if any one endeavours to take down "" the Department, he is more severe on the delinquent than, perhaps, is any of the other officials-, but, at any rate, he never throws obstacles in the way - of claimants. What we require under Acts of this kind is sympathetic administration ; and all of the thousands,, and tens of thousands, of cases ought to be - dealt with on their merits. In my own - constituency there is a dear old soul who has two sons at the front. Like a good - many Australians, they were, when at home, prone to travel about a great deal, >but they always did what they, could for their mother, though it might be in rather ra careless manner. However, when they went to the front they both made arrangements to allow her so much, and the old lady naturally thought that she would have a right to a separation allowance. Of course, like many others similarly circumstanced, she could not make an affi «davit that she was solely dependent on her sons; but she found that her other tsources of income vanished in view of a feeling that she was getting a separation allowance ou account of her sons. At - present the position, so far as this old lady is concerned, is not so acute; but it - would be very different with her if anything were to happen to her sons. If the Defence Department will accept no responsibility now, it will he hard to fix - any responsibility upon them in the future, in the absence of proof that the - mother was absolutely dependent on these men for her support.' The war has reached such a phase that it is not decent for us to "" split hairs "" in this way. Of - course, every one thinks that some one else should hear the brunt of the necessary taxation; but when we urge men to go to the front, surely we, as a nation, - can afford to put cheeseparing on one side ..in the case of dependants aud semi-dependants. It was found necessary to amend the original Act, and now we have before us further proposed amendments, which, I admit, make the measure much more generous. There is no doubt that, as time goes on, experience will show the necessity for further amendments; and I hope the Minister will take special note of the cases that have been mentioned.",23
187,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Commissioner must be controlled by the Act.,24
188,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"No Parliament yet has passed an Act sufficiently comprehensive to cover every possible case; and we must not forget that, in connection with mothers and wives and children,, there is as much sentiment as business. If we cannot cover cases of the kind to which reference has been made, I do not care to be asked to mount a platform and ask men to go to the front. When I have done so, I have promised that the interests of those left behind shall be looked after, and I expect that promise to be honoured. There is another case which is interesting. A constituent of mine, whose wife had two brothers at the front, enlisted; and the brothers made arrangements for so much to be paid to the mother. While in camp the husband - who , by the way, had two childrenbecame sick, and arrived at the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that, owing to the state of his eyes, it was of no use for him to go to the front. One of his. tent-mates wrote an anonymous letter to the Department alleging that this man had put tobacco juice in his eyes in order to make them bad; and I must say that I am surprised that the Department should take any noticeof anonymous letters, the' writers of which can only be described as ""things."" Even if it were evident that a man had done something of this kind, his wife and children should not suffer; but he is now in gaol, and those dependent on him are without support. My contention is that wives, children, and other dependants should receive consideration irrespective' of anything that the husband or son has done. I know that in this respect the Act has already been considerably broadened; and I suggest that, failing the Commissioner, there should be an appeal to somebody or other, in order to insure that each case shall be considered on its merits: otherwise, I am afraid the Act will not commend itself to those who are asked to urge men to go to the front .",24
189,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"South Sydney) [5.2] While I congratulate the Government on its effort to decentralize the administration, and to make the Act more liberal, I think there are certain blemishes that ought to be removed. I think that the widowed mother ought to be placed on the same footing as the w if e; and there is no doubt, from what we have heard during the debate, that that is the wish of the majority of honourable members.",25

In another case, a woman whose son is at the front was refused any allowance because she rents a large house, portions of which she sublets in order to enable herself to live rent free.",25
194,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Why should ""she have an allowance if she, as is admitted, has other .income ?",25

197,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"What we are trying to do is to remove anomalies in the Act ; and I suggest that the two cases which I have cited are hard cases for which provision should be made. I believe that the country would endorse our action if we placed widowed mothers on the same plane as wives. A mother is often called upon to make a greater sacrifice than is made by a wife. As a rule, the soldier's wife is a young woman, while his mother has spent her strength in the bringing up of her family, and, on the death of her son, loses her sole support. Should we, when a son has given his life for the country, cavil at the payment of a. small pension to his mother 1 In my opinion, the widowed mother should be on the same footing as the wife, and the aged father who has become too infirm to work, and depends on his sons for his support, should be in the same position as""?he widowed mother.

Question resolved in the affirmative. members Bill read a third time. INSCRIBED STOCK BILL . SECOND READING .",25
198,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and .Treasurer) [5.10] - I move<That this Bill be now read a second time. This is purely a machinery measure to make necessary amendments in the In scribed Stock Act 1911-13, and to extend its provisions in certain directions. Section 5 of the principal Act limits, the rate of interest on stock to £ 3 10s. per centum per annum, and obviously, as we are now asking the public to lend us money at per cent., it is necessary tr> amend this provision, which is done by clause 2. Then, again, as at present stock cannot be legally transferred in any amount lessthan £50, to popularize Commonwealth loans it is proposed to amend the principal' Act to allow of transfers of stock in suchamounts as may be approved by the Governor General. Thus we intend to provide for the transference of small amountsof stock and for the conversion of bonds into inscribed stock, and of stock intobonds as may suit the convenience of the» lender. In connection with the issue of Commonwealth loans it is important that the-, lenders should know how they stand in relation to taxation. We are satisfied that the States cannot impose taxation upon interest received from Commonwealth securities, - and it is the intention of the Government that persons who lend money to the Commonwealth shall not becompelled to pay back to us in the form of taxation what they receive as in terest. The Bill provides that stockand bonds and interest thereon shall not be liable to stamp duty under any law of the Commonwealth or of a State, and' that the interest shall not be liable toeither State or Commonwealth income tax. There may be a difference of opinion as to the wisdom of this arrangement; but, in my opinion, it is best to make the interest on the Commonwealth loan free from taxation.",25
199,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Why should it be free from taxation ?,26
200,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The lenders, both small and great, will know that during the term of the loan they will receive.the net rate of interest which we offer for their money, and that, however other securities may fluctuate, this investment will not change in value owing to any alteration in taxation. affects the credit of the country, it is advisable that it should not fluctuate in value for such a reason.",26
201,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Where is revenue to come from in the future if Government securities are not to be taxed?,26
202,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,H a p p i l y the Commonwealth has not yet borrowed money from any private person.,26
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Prime Minister seems confident that he will not have to do any borrowing in respect to other matters.,26
204,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I do not pretend to any great financial knowledge beyond the advice I receive and my own rough and ready experience, but I ask the people of Australia to believe that there is no hope of financing the present situation without heavy borrowing. We declared this afternoon that we would see the war through to the bitter end, and I know of no way in which sufficient revenue can be raised by taxation to finance our obligations. Imagine what it would cost if we had to raise and equip 200,000 men. We could not do that out of revenue. T t is therefore our duty to make the credit of the Commonwealth such that our citizens, rich and poor, will be willing to invest their money in Commonwealth loans. who cannot fight at the front will be given an opportunity to make sacrifices to assist the financing of the Commonwealth obligations. The proposal to exempt from in come tax interest on the loan is made to secure the absolute certainty of the whole amount being subscribed. In my opinion it was a right thing to offer to pay 4$ per cent, interest for the money borrowed, and the fact that the short-termed I m perial loan is down to £ 9 7 f gives an idea of the state of the money market. Honourable members will recollect that last year we passed an A ct imposing duty of probate on the estates of deceased persons. This Bill provides that war loan holdings shall be accepted at par for the payment of such duty. This should prove a great convenience.. When a large estate has to be realized to pay probate duty, the market is often unnecessarily disturbed; but the acceptance of war loan stock at par for the payment of such duty will prevent that, and will prove of distinct advantage to the beneficiaries. This statement deals with practically all the provisions of the Bill , which is purely a machinery measure, and has been conAs the loan sidered very carefully, so that, I think, the whole ground is covered.",26
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Parramatta) [5.20] - I understand that the Bill is in tended to adjust machinery which has been in existence for some time to the new and extraordinary conditions that we have to face, and it may therefore be allowed to pass. No doubt the proposal to exempt from taxation interest on the war loan is debatable. On the whole, the exemption ought to give satisfaction, as I understand that all the States free their loan transactions from income tax. Whether, in these circumstances, and at this time, that should be done, is a point that is open to argument.",26
206,Mr FISHEK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I admit that.,26
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"At the same time, the real way of looking at it is that the exemption is part of the price we have to pay for the loan. What it will amount to when some of the higher graduations that have been suggested in the papers are concerned, I do not pretend to say. Instead of 4^ per oent., we may be paying actually 5 per cent., or something like that.",26
208,Mr FISHEE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"It may be more than that. I would ask the righ t honourable gentleman to consider what the position Those would be if the investment were made out of this year's income, and 25 per cent, were deducted by way of taxation from that income before"" its investment. If a person whose income is involved in the. higher grade of taxation desired to invest in this loan, he would have only 75 per cent, of his income to invest. Can the honourable member calculate the interest on that?",26
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I hope we may soon have the right honourable gentleman's full financial proposals belore us.,26
210,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Nex t week.,27
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"This Bill provides for the necessary machinery, no matter what the amount of the tax or the loan may be. This machinery is necessary for the purpose of floating loans of any kind, both now and hereafter; and it follows on the old beaten track kept to for so many years by all the States, though the Commonwealth is entering upon a new career.",27
212,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,We have uot yet been on the market at all.,27
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"My honourable friend is always saying that, and I am always trying to remind him that he may have to go on to the market yet, even, in connection with the note issue, the full sequel of which has not yet appeared, though it will appear by-and-by. It is scarcely worthwhile opening up that debatable ground at the present juncture, and though the Treasurer has difficulties ahead, we need only concern ourselves with what is immediately before us in the way of adequately financing our war preparations. An y proposal to do that will, I hope, always commend itself to the House, and to the reasoned judgment of the people as a whole.",27
214,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Darling Downs) [5.25]. - As the Treasurer has pointed out, this Bill simply makes an amendment in the existing law, in order that he may have the elasticity he desires in connection with the proposed loan flotation. Under the existing law, the Treasurer is limited to the payment of 3^ per cent, interest, and the Government's aim is to remove that restriction so as to be able to offer higher rates of interest, in order to attract the requisite loan money for the purpose of carrying on the war.",27
215,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The honourable member is quite right.,27
216,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I think no one will adversely criticise that proposal. Further elasticity is to be sought by repealing section 32. The present position is that no transfer of stock of a smaller amount than £50 can be made without the permission of the Treasurer. passed, that provision will be repealed.",27
217,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The now proposed minimum is £ 1 0 , but we may come down to £5.",27
218,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The law at the present time makes £ 5 0 the minimum.,27
219,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,That is so.,27
220,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The Bill also will enable the Government to issue Treasurybonds from time to time. Under the existing Act, that provision does not exist, and it is for that reason that section 5 1 A is inserted in this Bill . The clause gives as wide a direction as the Government could desire. A most material point is that mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta providing that in terest on the loan shall not be liable to income tax under either Commonwealth or State laws. That is to say, that it is the intention of the Government, if the Commonwealth income tax is imposed, that people need not include the sum received as loan interest in their income returns as part of their taxable incomes.",27
221,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,That is so.,27
222,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"It will not be subject to taxation, not even if it has the effect of placing an individual in a higher scale.",27
223,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No .,27
224,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It w i ll not affect the income as to taxation in any way.,27
225,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No .,27
226,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Tha b provision will undoubtedly come as a considerable relief, also the declaration that the States must not lay hands upon this in terest income for their purposes either. It has been already held in the High Court that the States have no power to tax the incomes of Federal servants. That is the law at the present time. The law gives a general protection to Commonwealth instrumentalities and agencies. If the States had power to tax they would have the power to destroy. They would have the power to impede and hinder Federal agencies, and I think the Prime Minister is quite right in his statement that if the States had power of taxation, and sought to exercise it to an'unlimited extent, they might considerably impair Commonwealth securities. I think it is only fair and proper that the Commonwealth should seek to throw some protection over its own instrumentalities.",27
227,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"May I say-and in this I am expressing but my own opinion that I think it is a mistake that the GoI f this Bill is vernment of a country, which has the defence of the country to maintain, should be limited in regard to its taxation.",27
228,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,We have no limitation in our power of taxation. The States have very serious limitations. It is a question as to the extent to which we should exercise it .,27
229,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The power of taxation is an independent one.,28
230,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Commonwealth power is an independent power.,28
231,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"So , too, the State.",28
232,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"But the State is restricted, inasmuch as it has no power of taxation in regard to Customs and Excise.",28
233,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I put, in all friendliness, - the question as to whether a Government, responsible for the defence of the nation, should have any limitation placed upon its power of taxation over any citizen within its country.",28
234,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The point is that the States have no assets.,28
235,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"As a matter of fact, under our existing Constitution the Commonwealth has practically unlimited powers of taxation; but the point raised here is that the States have also their own powers of taxation, which might be exercised in a manner calculated to impede or hinder, or impair, Commonwealth instrumentalities or agencies. What is being done in this declaratory clause is to make it clear to the States that, as far as this loan is concerned, the citizens of Australia will have unlimited power of investment without being interfered with in any way-that they will have full freedom of action for the purposes of investment. So far as the Commonwealth public services are concerned, similar freedom and immunity exists, but the Commonwealth very properly maintains this position: That all public servants and officials shall be upon the same footing as the rest of the citizens of the Commonwealth, and the States were given power by Commonwealth legislation to tax their incomes just as they tax the incomes of the other residents within their States. In that way equity is done. But here we are dealing with an entirely different problem. The war has. to be financed, and as Australia is thrown upon her own resources, the desire is to induce everybody who has capital to assist in financing this war, and the desire of the Government in making this exemption is to encourage people, not only from motives of patriotism, but .from motives of self-interest to come in. To that extent I can see no objection to the proposition, although it would be open to argument, were we dealing with the subject of loan interest apart from the war. I think the Government, if this measure becomes law, will obtain the elasticity that they desire, and the proposal is one which will receive assistance, rather than hostility, from me.",28
236,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Bendigo) [5.33] Any one who has followed the history of Federation must feel a sense of disappointment that, after all that was said regarding the credit of the Commonwealth in the matter of borrowing money, and as to the ability of the Commonwealth to borrow money at lower rates of interest than any of the States, we should now be offering terms very much higher than any of the States have offered for a long time.",28
237,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,That is on account of the war.,28
238,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I know we are in exceptional times.,28
239,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Can the honourable member give an instance where the rate is lower ?,28
240,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Not in recent loans.,28
241,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Withi n a year of the war.,28
242,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I suppose if we take the whole of the State loans of Vietoria, the rate offered in this loan is higher than has been paid by the States.",28
243,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No .,28
244,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I think the right honourable gentleman will find that it is so. The State of Victoria does not pay 4£ per cent, interest for all the loans running at the present time.",28
245,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Recen t loans.,28
246,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I am not talking about recent loans.,28
247,Mr FISHEE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The honourable member is not taking into account the expenses of flotation, which often run to about £2 10s.",28
248,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I recognise that we are passing through exceptional times, but I express my sense of disappointment that the Commonwealth, on the first occasion of its entering the money market, is not going to realise the expectations of those who took an active part in the advocacy of Federation, that it would be able to raise, at 3 per cent., all the money it required. ' Even in this time of crisis, it should be possible to float a loan of £20,000,000 at per cent, without offering investors additional inducements. The Government, however, are holding out the special inducement that interest on this loan shall be free from income tax and stamp duty. It is rumoured in the press that the in come tax rates will run up to 5s. in the £ 1 in the case of incomes in excess of £7,500 per annum, so that a large in vestor in this loan, who draws from it by way of interest £10,000 per annum, will receive a g if t amounting probably to over £1,000 per annum. He will secure over 5 per cent, for his money.",28
249,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If the amount invested had been accumulated out of his income this year, it would be taxed. Mr HAMPSON' - The Government would collect income tax on the amount he had earned during the previous twelve months, but this loan will run over fifty years.",29
250,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No . The currency of the loan is ten years.,29
251,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"During the whole of that time, investors in it , having regard to the exemption from income tax and stamp duty, will earn 5 per cent. The Herald a few days ago reported a meeting of a prosperous mining company - the A l Gold Mines Company No Liability-at which a dividend representing £16,229 in respect of the preceding twelve months was declared. One of the speakers at that meeting was Mr L . A . Adamson, who, I think, is a member of the Legislative Council of Victoria, and who, according to the Herald, said that if the proposed taxation became law, the only plan would be for the company to invest its money in £ 1 0 Treasury-bonds, which would be free of income tax, and these bonds could be distributed, instead of cheques, among the shareholders. there any chance of the tax being evaded in that way?",29
252,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Not the slightest. The gentleman in question was merely blowing bubbles in the air.,29
253,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Treasurer has told us that the war can be financed only by borrowing as proposed by the Government.,29
254,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I said that that was my opinion. . Mr HAMPSON - The honourable member for Calare, who, I understand, is interested in banking, made the interesting statement that the Associated Banks, if allowed to issue their own notes, would - be prepared to provide this £20,000,000.",29
255,Mr ARCHIBAL D,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Associated Banks did not say anything of the kind.,29
256,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The honourable member informed the House that he was speaking on behalf of a banker in New South Wales.,29
257,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Some old woman.,29
258,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Such statements cannot be brushed aside in that way.,29
259,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It was only so much nonsense.,29
260,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Does the Treasurer say that the Associated Banks could not raise the money in the 6ircumstances in dicated by the honourable member?,29
261,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"They could not float a loan of £20,000,000.",29
262,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Not if they were allowed to issue their own paper money in respect of it ?,29
263,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It would be bad business.,29
264,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It seemed to me that if the Associated Banks could do such a thing the Commonwealth Government should be able to finance the war in the same way.,29
265,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,We have done it beyond the dreams of the most sanguine.,29
266,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The Treasurer is referring to the note issue with its gold backing. Would it be unbusiness-like to have a special war note issue, coupled with direct taxation, to provide a f u n d to redeem a certain amount per annum?",29
267,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"It would be a delightful way of financing the war if the honourable member could tell us how the necessary money, could be raised by taxation.",29
268,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If we desired to raise £20,000,000, could we not obtain the money in the way I have mentioned, at Is the same time inmosine a snecial tax to enable us to redeem it at the rate of £1,000,000 per annum? Does the Treasurer say that that would not be a sound, business-like proposition? .",29
269,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,When the taxation measures are introduced it will be for the honourable member to say whether he is in favour of increasing the proposed taxation to nrovide such a sinking fund . My own opinion is that to do such a thing would be to cripple the country for a time.,29
270,Mr HAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I differ from that view. I have heard what Germany has been able to do hy means of her internal note issue, and if she can do it I fail to understand why we should not be ahle to act similarly. Another point to which I wish to draw attention is the effect which the floating of this loan at' a high rate of interest is likely to have on the States when they desire to borrow in the same market. Then, again, is it not likely that money IIOAV invested on mortgage, in industry, and in various companies will he withdrawn and invested in the war loan, to the detriment of the country? - Mr FISHER - That objection would annly also to taxation. What is the tions of the community. point of the honourable member's criti cism ? Mr HAMPSON"" - I contend that be withdrawn ? since the Commonwealth is offering 4£ per cent, it should not be necessary f to hold out these extra inducements to the people to invest in a war loan, and that, instead of going into the market borrow, we might have financed the war in another way.",29
271,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Wilmot ) [5.43] I have no onnosition to offer to the pronosed war loan. I am very Treasurer has decided to raise it , and I hope and believe that there will be demand for our inscribed stock. At same time, we cannot close our eyes the fact that the floating of a loan £20,000,000 on the local market must more or less entrench upon the working capital of the country. I am afraid that 4^ per cent. many people from whom it is expected to collect heavy income tax will avoid that tax to a large extent by investing in this loan. This might prove highly detrimental to many small farmers who haVe mortgages on their property. vestor who has loaned £20,000 or £30,000 is various amounts upon the security of farming properties will probably call in that money if it is now fallin g due, and put it into the Government war loan. If that is done to any extent farmers will suffer very serious hardship. not obtainable at anything like the rate at which it could be secured some years ago. It may be said that even if no war - loan were floated, mortgagees would call Bill . in their mortgages as they fell due, - ask the farmers to pay a higher interest.",30

273,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I have not, but I believe there are mortgagees who are prepared to renew existing mortgages at 5 per cent, for some considerable time. If , instead of doing so, they decide to invest in the war loan, mortgagors will be placed in a difficulty, since it is hard to raise money at 5 per cent., even on the best of landed securities. I am concerned regarding the position of the small farmers, who are the backbone of the country, and represent one of the most deserving sec",30

No one can be ignorant of many of the great difficulties which confront the Treasurer at the present time. He has our sympathy. But this is a time of stress.",30

282,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Angas) [5.50] - I notice that the Treasurer is issuing bonds, but I am not aware whether he intends to allow any registration. Treasury-bills very often are issued so that scrip can pass from hand to hand; but tliere is also power to register at the Treasury, and then the coupons must be endorsed, or they will not be capable of being cashed. That is a protection to the public.",31

287,Mr EISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The Commonwealth Bank will accept and keep the securities free of charge.,31
288,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"That seems a roundabout way of attaining the same object. There is a simpler method-registration , to prevent cashing without endorsement. I think there is an idea abroad that Commonwealth securities are exempt from State taxation. I believe that is correct, but a reciprocal obligation applies, and_ the State cannot tax a document of instrumentality without the Commonwealth's permission, the Commonwealth cannot tax without the State's permission. I do not know whether the Treasurer has cometo any arrangementwith the States.",31
289,Mr EISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I shall not give up any port adopted. of the Commonwealth's powers.,31
290,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I quite agree with that view; but the States are as much within their sphere of taxation as we are, although the paramount consideration at present is that of defence. In this Bill we say that there is to be no taxation of income derived from scrip which the Commonwealth issues. The States, seeing a Commonwealth loan being issued at 4£ per cent., are raising their rates terest. ""Within the last week the State Treasurers have discussed the issue of Treasury-bills, bearing interest at 44 per cent., on what they consider to be as good terms as the Commonwealth offers. Do the Commonwealth Government intend to try to tax income derived from State securities 1 The States are entitled to know the Government's intentions in that respect, so that there need be no uncertainty about the competitive value of the stock they place on the market. I suggest that there ought to be a common understanding between the Treasurers of the States and the Commonwealth.",31
291,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Our loan is for expenditure on defence of the country, and we must maintain all our rights.",31
292,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"In other words, we reserve the right to tax the securities of the States, although we say the States are not to tax Commonwealth securities, and we plead, in justification of that attitude, the necessities of defence. I quite appreciate the Treasurer's position. He was confronted by States anxious to' borrow, and there is a lack of financial coordination, which, no doubt, has hampered him. Steps should be taken to check that competition in the one market between organs of government in an emergency such as the present. We are obliged to deny to the States a right which we seek for ourselves, simply because we are driven by the competitive conditions on the market to adopt that course. I do not intend to say anything in justification or criticism of that policy; but I hope that some understanding may if be arrived at between the Treasurer and the States, so that when they float their stocks the exact value of them in relation to taxation will be known.

295,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It seems that we are handing over a very big power to the Government.,31

300,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [ 6 . 0 ] - I move That this Bill bu now read a second time. Although this Bill contains a number of clauses, it is entirely a machinery measure. Under the present Act , the Treasurer is obliged to pay interest quarterly on all loans. These payments are too frequent, and in these times are found very inconvenient. The main purpose of this Bill is to enable the Treasurer to establish a current account of Treasury-bills, interest to be paid on the daily balance, instead of issuing a separate Treasurybill on each occasion on which advances .are made from the Australian Notes Account. This will obviate a great deal of - complication and detail.",32
301,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Darling Downs) [6.2] The Bill goes much further than the Treasurer has indicated. Under section 8 of the Australian Notes Act , moneys which are derived from the issue of the notes are paid into the Australian Notes Fund, and money standing to the credit of that account is held by the Treasurer. Not less than one-quarter of the amount must be kept in gold. The balance may be invested by the Treasurer, either on - deposit or in securities of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, or any State. If Treasury-bills are issued under the A ct at the present moment, the Treasurer may invest portion of the Notes Fund in such bills, and then he has to hold in his possession those securities, so that every time money is borrowed from the Notes Account a separate bill has to be deposited, and interest paid on it - quarterly. This B i ll removes the provision for quarterly payments of interest, and provides that when the Treasurer desires to borrow money from the Notes Fund he need not issue a Treasury-bill at all.",32
302,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"If I issued a Treasurybill, I would have to use it for loan purposes.",32
303,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Yes ; but the intention of the Australian Notes Act was that the currency should be secured by having either gold, bank deposits or securities of the Commonwealth or States, or of the United Kingdom-that was the whole basis. Under the Bill , the Treasurer, so far as moneys which are borrowed from the Notes Fund are concerned, need not issue any Treasury-bills; and probably what he would do would be to practically niake a book entry. As a matter of fact, it would be a regular current account with the Commonwealth, pretty much as a current account in a bank; and from time to time, when the Treasurer borrowed, there would be a debit, and when the loan was refunded tliere would be a credit to the Treasury. I understand the reason for the alteration.",32
304,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It makes it more mobile. We safeguard the Notes Fund in the Bill .,32
305,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"As a matter of convenience to the Treasurer, this Bill will give great relief; and no doubt it will facilitate very much his arrangements with the Treasury. But there rs another aspect which the Treasurer ought to consider. The intention of the Australian Notes Act was to regulate currency-to provide a note currency backed up by the credit of the whole Commonwealth. The Treasurer, in his capacity of Treasurer, is a sort of trustee for the currency fund .",32
306,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,He ' is not a sort of trustee-h e is one.,32
307,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"He is, in effect, made""so by the Act. In Queensland, where this idea was originally carried out, there was created an entirely independent board, consisting of the Speaker, the Treasurer, and a third person appointed under the Treasury-Bills Act 1893 which authorized the issue of Treasury-bills to secure the retirement of notes. I cannot help feeling that, if there were an independent board vested with entire control of the currency, they would insist on having a bond for every penny that was borrowed. Tliere is, to some extent, a dangerthough it may not be at present a serious danger-that people might confuse the relationship of the Treasurer in his capacity as trustee for the notes account, and as the custodian of the Consolidated Revenue. There may be a danger of - weakening in the public mind the feeling of security in the basis of our currency legislation in such abolition of the machinery provision requiring the deposit of securities.",32
308,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I should be the last to do anything of that kind .,33
309,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I think the Treasurer may urge in reply that the Bill is only permissive, and not compulsory. Although the Act provides that this account-keeping can be carried out, it is only optional with the Treasurer; he, as custodian of the Notes Fund, will still have power to require Treasury-bills if necessary.",33
310,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Do you not see the difficulty of issuing Treasury-bills ?,33
311,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I see the difficulty which arises from the fact that the Treasurer, in his capacity as Treasurer, is continually making loans from himself as trustee of the f u n d. If there were a separate independent body, such as a corporation, there is no doubt they would take the stand that for every penny issued there would have to be a bond to represent it .",33
312,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The honourable member must be careful; he spoke of loans from the Treasurer to myself as Treasurer.,33
313,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The difficulty arises from the fact that the Treasurer occupies two capacities.,33
314,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,How would it do to have two Treasurers?,33
315,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I think I expressed my opinion, on a former occasion, that it would have been better to constitute an independent currency commission. However, what I have pointed out seems to me to suggest the only element of danger, though, of course, I speak without any actual experience on the Treasury side. "" Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [6.12]. - The Treasury-bills Act gives the Governor General in Council power to issue Treasury-bills for raising by way of loan any money authority to borrow which has been granted by an Act. there is authority to borrow money in this way, Treasury-bills cannot be issued. I now have to refer to what has become very common in the Treasury, namely, borrowing from the Notes F u n d ; but I think that the provision in the measure cannot give the Treasurer any power to borrow money from the Notes Fund, unless for purposes which have been authorized by an Act of Parliament.",33
316,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Certainl y not.,33
317,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"At the same time, I think the Prime Minister will agree that what is proposed makes the dealings between the' Treasurer and the note issue a little more loose-if I may use such a word.",33
318,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,Sa y that it makes it more flexible.,33
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Ver y well, I shall use the word ""flexible."" In fact, it has become a practice of the Treasury to treat the note issue f u n d , so long as the money is available, as a sort of current account, though I am inclined to think that payments into the current account are not so common at present. I do not know that it is wise for the Treasurer to do this. B y this Bill the Treasurer can borrow from the Notes Trust Fund and merely make a book entry; and those in charge of the gold have no negotiable documents representing the gold issued. Say that £100,000 in sovereigns is taken out of the Notes Trust Fund for the purposes of the Treasury under authority of a Loan Act, there will , under this Bill , be no negotiable documents held by the custodians of the gold representing that number of sovereigns. This comes about because the right honourable gentleman is the custodian of the gold, and at the same time Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The practice to which I have been accustomed when the State or Commonwealth Government has borrowed from Trust Funds, has been to deposit a negotiable document to the value of the sum borrowed; so that if the worse came to the worse, money could be raised on it , or it could be sold. Of course, I know that under existing circumstances such a document could be made out by the Treasurer at any time. If there were a rush on theTreasury for gold, he could at once make, out such an instrument as I speak of, and have it negotiated; but the practice has been to lodge such a document at thetime the money is borrowed. The TreaUnless surer proposes merely to keep a debtor and creditor account of the transactions.",33
320,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,To the extent to which those transactions affect the Consolidated Revenue.,33
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"No doubt themethod proposed is the easier method ;but I am not sure that it is the wiserone. If there were a Commissioner in : charge of the notes gold, he. would require the deposit of a negotiable document as security for any advance",33
322,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,He would get a certificate.,34
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"But , in this case, no provision is made for the issue of even a certificate. There are to be merely book entries.",34
324,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,There will be a check on all transactions.,34
325,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Some tangible negotiable security should be given when money is borrowed from the Notes Fund. Another matter to which I direct attention is the inadvisability of having con- . tinual borrowing transactions from the Notes Fund. If the Treasurer were dealing with a financial institution, he would not borrow one day and pay back the next, and have a series of' small transactions; he would borrow a considerable sum to carry him on for a certain period.",34
326,Mr ABCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,This is an excepa check on the Treasurer. tional time.,34
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Yes ; but the bill? fewer the transactions in connection with with itself. the Notes Fund the better. There should not be daily borrowings, but rowings now and again in considerable sums as the money is required. would be better than to treat the three-fourths available as a current account. port adopted. At the same time, I am not prepared to ask the House to oppose this proposal.",34

I should not make any reduction below one-third without communicating my purpose to the House. As to the other point, it is only a small amount that will be dealt with in the way proposed.",34
329,Mr GHOOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Will there be TreasuryEndeavour, bills for the larger amounts?",34
330,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"No . The right honorserving able member for Swan spoke as if we had no need for daily transcer who died in South Australia. actions, but he does not know what hapothers pens in these times. We have to finance the States as well as the Commonwealth, and the call for defence expenditure have to be met most unexpectedly. Happily there are plenty of resources. Should there seem to be any danger i the present practice, I shall give the House an opportunity of considering it . - Mr GROOM - When a large sum is involved for any specific purpose, will Treasury-bills be issued ?",34
331,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,No . Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. ' Clause 3 (Borrowing money from Australian Notes Account without issue of Treasury-bills).,34
332,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Angas) [6.23] - The effect of the Bill is practically to l i m it the Treasurer to the amount of the Treasury, notes issued. Another effect that there is not so very mucn in is that if you do not give Treasury-bills, and there is an appreciation of value, you will deprive the Treasurer of the advantage which he might gain by going into the market. But he reserves to himself the power to fix the interest. The interest is Why should it not be up to the level of the TreasuryThen the Bill will be consistent As it is, you might have 4 per cent, interest, and the whole merely borsecurity would be gone.

SECOND READING .",34
333,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Wide Bay-Prime [6.25] - I . That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of the Bill is to provide for compensation to certain people who have suffered in various ways. Some of the men to whose relatives compensation is proposed to be paid lost their lives on the one was a military officer who, unfortunately, lost Iris life while in Canada, and another is a special allowance to the widow of a military offiThe are persons who have suffered in exceptional circumstances, and the Executive, after the closest investigation into* may those circumstances, think they are entitled to compensation. I shall not give details, but I assure honourable members n that great care has been exercised by the Government, and that they feel justified in asking that this Bill should be passed.",34
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Parramatta) [6.2S] - I rise to support the Bill very cordially. The amounts do not appear to he excessive, but, on the contrary, seem to be small. I would like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the - case of the widow of Colonel Le Mesurier. That seems to be very small indeed. Last year we gave to the representatives of a gentleman a little higher, nominally in command, an amount, I think, of £1,200 or £1,500; but for Colonel Le Mesurier's widow the amount provided is only £362. I do not want to make any distinctions at all; but I see that the father - of J. Hamilton, formerly labourer at Woodlark Island, is to get £390",35
335,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It has been based on an actuarial computation.,35
336,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I understand that Hamilton did not come under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and this is the amount lie would have received under that Act.",35
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I am not - complaining that it is too much; but I am saying that the widow of Colonel Le Mesurier should, I think, have received better treatment. That officer went through the Boer War, and was one of our coolest and most intrepid troop leaders. He fought many a brave battle, and his whole ambitions were centred in the Defence Department. I know that his widow is not well off, and I cannot help feeling that the Government might have been a little more generous.",35
338,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Hi s widow is dead, and the provision should, therefore, be for the - children of the widow.",35
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,I was not aware that she was dead.,35

342,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,We were not aware that - she had died.,35
343,Mr EISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,The amendment can be made in Committee.,35
344,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Kooyong) [6.30] - I want to bring under notice the case of Harrisson. If I remember rightly, he was the biologist on the Endeavour. We are all aware of the deplorable circumstances connected with that vessel. In that case, in addition to £500 under the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act, it is now intended to vote only £20. I can only ask that the full circumstances of this particular case, and of the widow, be investigated.",35
345,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"The amount fixed is equal to two years' pay in each case-Harris son, Pirn, and Dannevig.",35
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"What I cannot understand is, in the case of these men we are giving compensation equal to two years' salary, and in the case of an ordinary labourer three years.",35
347,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I cannot pretend, at the present moment, to bring all the circumstances before my honourable friends, because I have not the facts before me; hut I would ask that this case - whic h I know is a very serious onemight be looked into a little further.",35
348,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Darling Downs) [6.32]. - I would plead with the Prime Minister that, as the principle of the Workmen's Compensation Act is compensation on the basis of three years' pay, in the case .of Pim, Harrisson, and Dannevig the rule should not have been departed from. I think in Colonel Reade's case the recommendation was considerably more.  about the officers; but you have not a word to say about the privates.",35
349,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,It is grossly unfair for the honourable member to say that. Are not the officers entitled to justice?  men; and you are not saying a word about them.,35
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"As a matter of fact, they are provided for, and their representatives get compensation on the basis of three years' wages.",35
351,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"I understood that this was a deliberative assembly, in which we were entitled to put each case before the Committee; but, according io the honourable member for Maranoa, it is an offence to claim fair treatment for certain people. In regard to the cases mentioned, and particularly the cases of Mrs Pim and Mrs Harrisson, I would ask the Prime Minister if he does not think that more sympathetic consideration could be given by the Government?

353,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,"Brisbane) [6.40]. - I appeal to the Prime Minister to give us an adjournment over next week. We have been anticipating a recess for several weeks past. It was fully believed that, by the end of July at least, honourable members coming from distant States would have ttn opportunity to visit their constituencies. We have been here now for four months, and it is but fair that honourable members coming from distant electorates should be given such an opportunity. I should not press my request if there was any hope that the House would adjourn after next week. If a financial statement is made next week it will probably he followed.by a long discussion. There are many reasons why it would be well to adjourn over next week.  the sentiments of the honourable member for Brisbane. Some honourable members have heen four months away from Queensland, and others four months away from Western Austraha, whilst members from the other States are able to get to their homes every week-end. If honourable members had known that there would be only half a day's work this week many of them could have taken a week off from Priday last.",36
