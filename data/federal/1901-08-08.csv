External Affairs) - The announcement you have made. I am sure, by every honourable member. Not only is it in itself a that, sosoon begun its members should be stricken to death; but in the present instance there are circum'stances which mon lot of sympathizeand member for Darling Downs was a very old parliamentarian. or nearly the land,.and certainly here. In that House, and his name will be recorded as Spouse of Rrpirsentatibrs . Thursday, S August, 1901. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., MEMBER DECEASED.",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is with very deep I have to announce to the House,14
2,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"Hunter-Minister for to the House, Mr Speaker, will, be received with profound grief thing more than ordinarily painful after this Parliamentshould have work, one of its most respected take the event out of the comthose miseries with which we all which we all deplore. The late He was, I think, the oldest oldest parliamentarian in Queensthe oldest parliamentarian sense he was the father of the the mover of the - first Address-in Reply ever moved in this Chamber. By great applies/ tion and unwearied industry he made himself a master of parliamentary law and usage, and he was instructed by the fulness of his experience in not only the methods of Parliament, but also in the higher aspects of public poliey. During his membership of this House, he earned the unfeigned respect of honourable members in all parts of the Chamber. I am loth to establish a precedent for a motion for adjournment on occasions like this, because, while I know that honourable members are, as a rule, quite ready to pay that mark of respect to deceased colleagues, I am equally convinced that old servants of the public, if they could be consulted in the matter, would wish that their departure should not be marked by any disturbance of public business. Therefore, it is with rather divided feelings that I shall presently propose the adjournment of the House. But, before we adjourn, I think that it is necessary to convey to the public, and to the widow and family of: the late member, an expression nf our sense of the loss which the Commonwealth has sustained by his death, and our feeling of sympathy with those who are near and dear to him. I therefore moveThftt this House desires to record its profound regret at the tans which tihe Commonwealth suffers in the death of the Henior member of the House I the honourable W. H. Groom, and expresses its sincere condolence with his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. That Mr Speaker be requested to convey the foregoing resolution lo Mrs Groom. Sir W f LLTAMMCMILLAN (Wentworth) - On behalf of honourable members on this side of the House, I join with the Prime Minister in expressing my profound sorrow at the death of one of its most estimable members, and I desire to add to what he has said my expression, on behalf of the Opposition, of our deep sympathy with the widow and family who have sustained such an irreparableloss. As I represent a different State from that represented by the late honourable member, I have not had .an opportunity of knowing very much of his public career, but I met him on several occasions since this Parliament assembled in Melbourne, and I can say from my observation of him that we have lost one of the most experienced and matured minds in the House, to say nothing of his other qualities. One could not be in contact with the honourable member for five minutes without being conscious of the kindness of his disposition and the urbanity and friendliness of manner which marked his intercourse with all with whom lie was brought into association. I deplore the loss of this House, and of the great State of Queensland, which has lost such an able representative, at a time when some of the most serious questions affecting the industrial life of that country are about to receive the attention of. this Parliament. His ripe and matured, judgment would have been of inestimable service in guiding us to safe conclusions.",14
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown," I feel that we are not far enough away from the event which made us members of the Commonwealth Parliament to forget our associations with the State Legislatures, and as one who has been a member of the Legislature of Queensland, I endorse all that has been said regarding our deceased colleague. The late member for Darling Downs was a notable person before I entered the public life of Queensland, and although that) was so, no one could be more unassuming, nor more willing and capable to give advice to young members of the Assembly. He occupied the high position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland with honour to himself and credit to the Parliament for a period of five years, and he had a unique public career, and has lef t a record, which, I think, is not to be surpassed in the public life of any country. For 39 years he was successful in every electoral contest which he entered, and he left the constituency of Toowoomba only tb represent the district of Darling Downs in this House. ' I know that it was a wrench to him to leave the State Assembly to come here, but he felt that it was a duty he owed to those for whom he had worked, and to tlte district which, with a statesman's foresight, he had long before seen was likely to be a very important part of the great' State of Queensland. He fought for the Darling Downs district under ridicule and opposition which today is incomprehensible, but its development has verified his words and ideas, and no statesman could desire more than to see that his life work was not in vain. I feel, as the honourable member for Wentworth has said, that Queensland has lost a representative which she can ill afford to lose at the present time, but the fact that the late member for Darling Downs was so devoted to his public duties, that when well up in years he was willing to leave his home to serve his country, is a higher eulogy of his character than any we can pass upon it . I have nothing more to sav, except to add, on behalf of myself and the party to which I belong, our expression of sorrow for those who have been bereaved, and a trust that his widow will receive that blessing from the Giver of all good things which will enable her to bear her sorrow with fortitude and patience. Question resolved in the affirmative. SPECIAL ADJOURNMEN T. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",15
4,Mr BARTON,Unknown," Consequent on the motion which has just been passed, I have to make a proposal, for the furtherance of public business, to the House, which I am quite confident will be assented to by honourable members. This is the second time in a week that this House has adjourned because of a grave reason, and I am going to ask honourable members to assent, with concurrence, to . a motion that this House at its rising adjourn t ill tomorrow, at half-past ten o'clock, in order that the time that has been lost, no doubt for urgent reasons, may nevertheless be somewhat retrieved. I shall ask for the whole of tomorrow, and if honourable members who are i u charge of business other than public business will assent to that, and I tli ink they will, the public business will proceed beyond the usual time of meeting and until the ordinary hour of adjournment. I am quite sure that there is enough good feeling-that , in fact, there is abundant good feeling-o n the part of' the honourable member who has charge of the principal private business for tomorrow, to induce him to fall in with this proposal. I therefore moveTh>tt the House at its rising adjourn till tomorrow at half past ten o'clock, Government business then to take precedence of all other business.",16
5,Mr CONROY,Unknown,T s it intended that Government business should occupy the whole day?,16
6,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"Yes. Although the honourable member who has charge of the principal business for tomorrow is not here, I am sure that he will fall in with the proposal.",16
7,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I think that the proposal of the Prime Minister is quite reasonable under the circumstances, and considering' that only two hours of tomorrow's sitting would be devoted to private business in the ordinary way, it would be vastly better to give the whole of the time to public business. I quite agree with the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. FUNERAL OF THE LATE Mn. W. H. GROOM.",16
8,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I m o v e That the House do now adjourn. I may inform honourable members that the body of our deceased fellow member will be conveyed to the railway station, to be taken thence to Queensland by the express, at a quarter past five this afternoon. I am now sending for the information necessary to enable honourable members to pay their last tribute of respect to the remains of Mr, Groom, and if honourable members will do me the favour to inquire about three o'clock, I expect then to be able to give them fuller particulars. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 2.45 p.m.",16
