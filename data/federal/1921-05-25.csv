1,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"Parramatta-Acting. Prime Minister and Treasurer) :[3.1]' - I am sure that - we all deeply regret the cause of the absence of Mr. Deputy Speaker, who is suffering a bereavementwhich will probably keep him from the House for the rest of the week. Mr Speaker himself, I understand, is not yet well enough to attend, and in all probability will not be here for some little time yet. In these unfortunate circumstances I move That the Honourable Frederick William Bamford do take the Chair of the House to act as Speaker for this day, and for. each day on which Mr Deputy Speaker is absent.",19
2,Mr JAMES PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"Maranoa) [3.2]. - - I have much pleasure in proposing that Mr Charlton, the honourable member for Hunter, do take the Chair until the return of Mr Speaker, or Mr Deputy Speaker.",19

9,Mr JAMES PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been drawn to a letter in this morning's Melbourne newspapers, signed "" C. R. Rolleston, Lieutenant-Commander, R.N., retired,"", in which the writer states that he wrote to the right honourable gentleman regarding the Commission that is lost, stolen, or strayed in what was German New Guinea, and received an acknowledgment of his letter ? Does the Acting Prime Minister intend to allow Lieutenant}-Commander Rolleston to interview him, or has he anything to say to the House about the Commission ?",19
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I received a communication from Lieutenant-Commander Rolleston, which had, I think, to do with the causes of his resignation from the Commission. I have sent two radios to the Administrator of New Guinea, but have had no reply yet.",19
11,Mr JAMES PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,Then they must be lost.,19
12,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"If the Commission is doing, its work, it is lost for the time being. In the interior of New Guinea there are not the up-to-date appliances for communication that we enjoy in these more favoured regions.",19
13,Mr JAMES PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,The Commission has a wireless plant with it.,19
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"That may be so, but I have not been able to get into Bamtouch with the members of the Commission. LOAN TO QUEENSLAND. Chair RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT: DEVELOPMENT OF BURNETT LANDS.",19
15,Mr HIGGS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, with a view to relieving the distress caused by unemployment in Queensland, where there are 5,000 men out of work, he will advance to that State, by way of loan, a portion of the £2,000,000 to be expended by the State Government upon the construction of a railway through the Upper Burnett, Callide Valley, and Prairie Lands, Mr H . S. Gullett having reported that it is estimated that three years will be' occupied in the construction of this railway. Will the right honourable gentleman, advance, say, £250,000 forthwith, and the balance,of the £2,000,000 in instalments of £250,000 every four months?",19
16,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"Muc h as I should like to help the unemployed, who I know to he numerous throughout the Commonwealth, as well as in Queensland, I cannot advance money for the purpose desired. Many objects are very desirable in themselves, and among them the proposals which. Mr Gullett has recommended. No one questions the merits of these proposals-, but, notwithstanding that admission, it is impossible for me to make loan funds available for the railway referred to, and I much regret to have to say "" No "" to this request. The other day I had a telegram from Mr .Stopford, the representative of Mount Morgan in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, who asked me if I would contribute pound for pound in connection with the offer of the Queensland Ministry of £1,000 per week in reduced railway freights for the assistance of-the miners, but it must be clear to any one who considers the matter calmly that it is the function of the State Government to deal with these matters. I have no money to spare for that purpose. I very much regret to have to refuse these requests, and I hope that something may turn up soon to set these industrial enterprises going again.",20
17,Mr JH CATTS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,The honourable ber is like Mr Micawber.,20
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"My suggestion is that those concerned with these tries should be allowed to settle their differences round a table. I believe that if they were permitted to do that, the miners of Mount Morgan and of other places would soon be at work again. FELLMONGERIN G INDUSTRY,",20
19,Mr JOWETT,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he has yet received a report of the proceedings of the conference at which I introduced a deputation of fellmongers to Sir John Higgins last week for the purshall pose of discussing with him the question of the release of fellmongered skin from the restrictions imposed upon the sale and export of wool as the result of the resolution which was adopted this Parliament about three weets ago. I also ask whether he has received any advice of the result of the meeting yesterday of the Federated Fellmongers of Australia when that body passed a strong resolution requesting that fellmongered skin wool should be freed from those restrictions. Further, is he aware of the very serious state of the fellmongering industry in Australia at the present moment, and of the fact that no less than four fellmongers' establishments have closed, and have announced their intention not to re-open until the industry has been freed from these restrictions?",20
20,Mr MASSYGREENE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I have not received the information of which the honourable member speaks. As he is aware, the fellmongers saw me in conjunction with the Acting Prime Minister a little while ago. As the result of that interview a further interview was arranged with Sir John Higgins, at which one of my officers attended. He reported to me that the fellmongers were fully satisfied with the results attained at the conference, and were prepared to continue operations.",20
21,Mr JOWETT,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"They held a meeting yesterday at which they said they were not satisfied. - Mr MASSYGREENE - I have mentioned the last oflicial intimation which reached me. if any new development has arisen, I shall be glad to look into it. The sole desire memof the Government is to carry out the scheme decided upon by Parliament in a manner that will benefit the industry without placing any undue obstacle in industhe way of any branch of it. PRICE OF BUTTER.",20
22,Mr BLAKELEY,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it is a fact that Australian butter is being sold in London for 190s. per cwt., whilst the same quality of butter is being sold in New South Wales for 196s. per cwt., and in Victoria for 205s. 4d. per cwt.., and, if so, will he take the necessary steps to insure that the people of this country he able to purchase Australian butter at the same price as that at which wools it can be purchased in London?",20
23,Mr MASSYGREENE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"The only Australian butter upon the London market at the by present time of which I have any knowledge is butter which was sent home as the result of the Imperial contract for the purchase of that commodity. . The British Government paid 274s. per for that butter, and, of course, we have no control over the price at which they shall sell it . If they feel obliged it at a lower price than that at which military. they purchased it, the matter is one over which we have no control whatever. SPEECH BYPEI ME MINISTER.",20
24,Mr MCGRATH,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that 3,000 words of a speech delivered by the Prime Minister in this Chamber were cabled to England at the cost of the Commonwealth, and whether, later on, 4,000 words of that speech were cabled from Colombo at the cost of the Commonwealth. I also desire to know whether it is true that the Commonwealth is paying for advertising the right honourable gentleman?",21
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I believe that the statement which has been published in at least one newspaper here, to the effect that 4,000 words of the Prime Minister's speech were cabled from Colombo, is a pure invention. It is not correct at all. PRIME MINISTER: EXPENSES IN LONDON.",21
26,Mr JH CATTS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether any sum has been allocated for the expenses of the Prime Minister in London, and, if so, what is the amount?",21

28,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"The stateshould ments in question, so far as I am informed, are absolutely incorrect. There were no Defence motor cars used upon that occasion. As a matter of fact there [351] was only one Defence motor ambulance cwt. out of the garage upon that day.  the Defence ambulance was there shows to sell that the riot was engineered by the UPPER BURNETT, CALLIDE VALLEY, AND PRAIRIE LANDS: PAPER. RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION.",21
29,Mr HIGGS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, in view of the widespread interest taken in Queensland in the proposal to open up the Upper Burnett, Callide Valley, and Prairie Lands, the Minister will have printed Mr H . S. Gullett's report on the proposal that the Commonwealth Government should lend to the State of Queensland the sum of £2,000,000 for railway construction?",21
30,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I lay the report on the table. I thought that there was a Printing Committee here to supervise proposals for printing. Personally, I have no objection to Mr Gullett's report being printed.",21
31,Mr HIGGS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,Will the honourable gentleman move that it be printed?,21
32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I will. At the same time. I understood that these matters were dealt with by the Printing Committee. No doubt there is very much interest exhibited in Queensland in Mr Gullett's report, and as there are demands for it, I move That the report be printed.",21
33,Mr JAMES PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"Surely to goodness this matter will be referred to the Printing Committee before the motion is carried. If it be not, and the members of the Printing Committee are worth their salt,, they will resign, because, by the adoption of the motion, we shall have taken their functions out of their hands.",21
34,Mr BLAKELEY,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,What nonsense!' .,21
35,Mr JAMES PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I have no oband jection to the paper being printed, but seeing that we have appointed a Committee to deal specifically with the question of the printing of papers, the matter surely be referred to it .",21
36,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING, I would point out to the honourable member that it is a common practice here for a Minister to move that a paper be printed. . Whenever that course is adopted the matter is entirely taken out of the hands of ihe. Printing Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative^ FEDERAL CAPITAL. ERECTION OF BUILDINGS.,21
37,Mr BLAKELEY,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"I ask the for Works and Railways whether it is a fact that up to the present no cottages have been completed at Canberra, and that very few have actually been started. Further, will he take the necessary steps to see that the erection of these cottages and the carrying out of other works is expedited by getting the necessary labour at the Capital site ?",22
38,Mr GROOM,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"The position is that I did not receive a report from Canberra last week, but three cottages near the power-house were almost completed several days ago. Altogether in that area ten cottages have been authorized. Progress is taking place rapidly with regard to the other twenty.",22

45,Mr MATHEWS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,^-IS i l .the . intention of the Government to .proceed with the erection of houses and other buildings the Capital site without submitting those works to the Public Works Committee ?,22
46,Mr GROOM,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"The Act specifically - the lays it down that any works involving expenditure of £25,000 and upwards must be referred to the Public Works Committee.",22
47,Mr MATHEWS,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,"But are you going to keep these matters down to less than £25,000 ? _",22
48,Mr GROOM,APPOINTMEN T OF ACTING,The practice as set forth in the Act will be followed in 'connection with all works at the Federal Capital.,22

However, if the buyer wants to export i the at must show that he has paid the Bawra reserve price for it, or, he will be. required to enter into an undertaking, if person concerned - is sending it for an consignment abroad, that he will not sell it abroad below the Bawra prices.

75,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Kooyong) [3.35] - I Tegret that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has taken every opportunity to refer to the woollen manufacturers as the shocking example of those who have made exorbitant profits. The honourable member stated that as in some cases the profits made by the woollen manufacturers ranged from 20 per cent, to 45 per cent., and that in one instance it was 90 per cent., he was desirous of having the duty reduced so that manufacturers would, be prevented from making undue profits in future. In other words, assuming 'the figures are correct, the effect would be that those who made small profits were to be punished alike with those who had been more fortunate. If the honourable member will look into the history of the woollen industry in Australia- I speak particularly as regards Victoria-h e will see that the early experience of those who embarked in this industry was disastrous ""We admired those who endeavoured to establish the industry in Australia with great courage and enterprise under difficult conditions; but it must be remembered that during the first years they suffered heavy financial losses, and, in many cases, capital had to be written down, and companies reconstructed. Even during 1914 the average profit earned did not exceed 2£ per cent.; and if the honourable member for Dampier will take the trouble to average the profits made by these manufacturers from the beginning TARIFF.

76,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I admit that early reports were not available; but I can assure the honourable member that, as an ex-Minister for Customs, and one who has hadoccasion to give some attention to this matter, the experience of the woollen manufacturers during the early stages was surrounded with many difficulties; and why they should be selected for special animadversion it is difficult to say. . At most, the charge is that they made certaiu profits during the war period, but nothing like those made by manufacturers abroad.",26
77,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If undue profits were made abroad, that is no justification for local manufacturers making - excessive profits. - Sir ROBERT BEST,-Perhaps not; but it is better .that our manufacturers should make that .profit rather than that the foreign, manufacturers who send their goods here! . But I beg honourable members to bear in mind that during the war period, the woollen, manufacturers of Australia were under the rigid control of the Government. . '",26
78,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That does not say much for the Government. ,.",26
79,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Thei r factories were practically taken over by the Government, who fixed the price to be paid for the output.",27
80,Mr RICHABD EOSTBB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,EO T a time.,27
81,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"For the whole period. The Government fixed the price to be paid for the woollens manufactured, - and the proprietors of these undertakings were instructed to go ahead with the manufacture of cloth, flannels and blankets, with the result that for a considerable portion of the war period many manufacturers were working three shifts per day, because it was essential that - they should put forth their best efforts. When it is said that during a' period of three years woollen manufacturers made profits amounting almost to their capital representing upwards of a million of money-'honorabl e members must recall that, for a time, they were working three shifts, and the profit made should really be spread over a normal period of eight or nine years. The price at which they were to .be paid for their output was fixed by the Government, and they were therefore, justified in going full speed ahead and making as much as they legitimately could, and is there any one in this House who will say that the manufacturers were responsible or blameworthy?",27
82,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,For military cloth only.,27
83,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They were not allowed to produce anything else.,27
84,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They were in the State ; of New South Wales.,27
85,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I do not think so.,27
86,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Yes . Sir ROBERT BEST.'-Then it . must have' been very little - When I speak of cloth I include blankets and flannels and everything of the kind required for war purposes. I speak subject to 'correction, but I believe that the whole of the output of every description was taken by the Government. If some, was permitted to go into private channels, the' amount was very small indeed. Honourable members should hear in mind that what the manufacturers did was done' under rigid Government control, and my* honourable friend ""was, therefore, not justified in the 'Severity of his censure. I remind honourable members' again that the local manufacturers' profits were .comparativiely small when compared with the profits made by manufacturers abroad whose imports were pouring into Australia.",27
87,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The Government's orders were a perfect godsend to the local manufacturers.,27
88,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That is so. They could not have carried on had not the exigencies' of war enabled them to benefit by a vast output. They had been struggling in the past, but, the Government fixing prices, they produced to the best of their ability, and, as I have said, they worked their machinery three shifts to meet the demands made upon them.",27
89,Mr HILL,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They had the advantage of being able to secure their wool at a price below the flat rate.,27
90,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That is so, but I remind the honourable member that the Government, in fixing the price of their goods, had due knowledge of and regard to that fact.",27
91,Mr WIENHOLT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Thei r profits were so great in one instance that the Government stepped in and took 80 per cent, of them.",27
92,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member refers to the production of wool tops, but I am speaking now as to the production of cloth. The imports of woollen goods for the year ended 28th February, 1920, were valued at upwards of £2,000,000.",27
93,Mr GIBSON,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Because of the high prices.,27
94,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That , to some extent, was the reason; but I point out that the imports of woollen goods for the year ended 28th February, 1921, were valued at £6,675,000, or more than three 'times the value of the previous year's importations.",27
95,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Woollen s alone?,27
96,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Yes , ""woollens, or containing wool, n.e.i."" The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) said something about the price, but there was very little difference in the price during the twelve-month periods ending 28th February, 1920, and '28th February, 1921. Under the existing Tariff, during the twelve - months of its operation, the imports of woollens and goods containing wool were more than three times the previous year's importations, and reached in value the vast sum of £6,675,000. That is a circumstance which cannot be ignored in the consideration of the Tariff. Since the war thera has been a vast extension of the woollen trade. Our home consumption represents only %\ per cent, of the Australian clip.",27
97,Mr HILL,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,How much greater would the local consumption have been had the woollen mills sold direct to the retailers .instead of to Flinders-lane ?,28
98,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That question .is hardly involved in the present discussion, hut I may say that there is much fallacious argument indulged in concerning the cost of distribution. It is believed to be very high,- as the rate is frequently said to be from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent., but if honourable members asked the woollen manufacturers whether they could afford to distribute their own goods, even if they were paid the extra cost mentioned, which the wholesale houses now get, they would tell them that they could not do so.",28
99,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The trouble is in many cases that they have not sufficient capital.,28
100,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Of course they have not.,28
101,Mr HILL,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Not to distribute for cash?,28
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"My honourable friend will remember that it is the special duty of the' distributing houses to distribute all classes of goods, and they are, therefore, able to distribute any particular class of goods more cheaply than the manufacturer of those goods could hope to do. There are, no doubt, individual instances where, if persons could buy at the mills, they could obtain cloth more cheaply than under existing conditions, when the cost of distribution has to be added. But if there were no organized commercial system of the distribution of goods, the result to manufacturers would be disastrous.",28
103,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Some mills distribute every yard of cloth they make.,28
104,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"In individual cases that may be so; but that assumes the possession by the manufacturers of capital and organization for the purpose. I have said that at present the local consumption represents only 2^ per cent, of the Australian clip. For years we have sent away greasy wool to the extent of something like 97£ per cent, of our clip. That is a grave reflection upou ourselves. I am not an idealist; and while I would not say that it is possible within the next ten, twelve, or even fifteen years for us to expect to send away, the whole of our wool in fabric form, I do say that we should work towards the realization of that ideal as fast as we can. We should send away our wool in wool tops or yarn, and ultimately, I hope, in cloth, or other manufactured .goods. It is only by giving the greatest encouragement to our woollen manufacturers that we can hope to do so. We have been pleased to learn that a considerable amount has been expended since the war in laying down woollen mill plants in this country. We have the assurance of the Minister, who speaks officially, that there is every prospect that other woollen mill plants will be laid down in the near future. Bear in,mind, this expressed intention is on the basis of the existing schedule, which is a reason why it should not be reduced.",28
105,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,We want more competition badly.,28
106,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"We want every competition, and this is the way to secure internal competition, which is what we want. If we can get plant after plant installed in Australia by the encouragement of this great key industry, we shall be making great strides. The fact that it is a key industry, and that British manufacturers and others desire to establish woollen factories in Australia, which is the objective of a Tariff, more than justifies the Tariff now proposed. I have heard the complaint that it is insufficient for their purposesthat they could invest their capital with much greater confidence if they received greater encouragement. We have before us, however, the proposal set out in the schedule; but, nevertheless, I feel justified at this stage in pointing out that there are considerable importations of coatings, trouserings, and other like piece goods which are entering into serious competition with the output of our own mills. We have to look at this matter from a broad stand-point, and since British manufacturers are turning their attention, to Australia, where our wool is immediately available for their use, and where every facility for working it up is offered, I can only say that, if they are. going to establish plants here, and bring out skilled workmen to lay down new industries, we should be prepared to afford them every encouragement. We have to look not only to the establishment of newwoollen mills, but also to associated industries such as fellmongering, glue making, tanning, and other industries that are directly associated with that now under consideration. I have pleasure in supporting the Minister's proposal.",28
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Then the honourable member is not going to move for an increased duty?,29
108,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No ; if I remember rightly the schedule before us provides ""for only a very small increase in the General Tariff.",29
109,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It provides for an increase of 30 per cent.,29
110,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The duty in a respect of imports from Great Britain is the same as that in the Tariff of 1914, but there is a slight increase in the general Tariff. In the circumstances, therefore, increasing the Minister's proposals are very and I shall support them.",29
111,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Grampians) [3.53] I desire to speak on behalf of a very impricesportant Australian industry which has already been much antagonized.,29
112,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,We have beard also the honourable member speak against the Australian woollen industry.,29
113,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable memported ber has never heard me say a word against the Australian woollen mills.,29
114,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,We have heard project the honourable member complain of the prices charged for Australian woollens.,29
115,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I have said a great' deal as to the prices which the people Australia are charged for their clothes; but this matter is altogether different from the question of the prices at which the Australian woollen mills sell their producte. I hope, therefore, that honourable member will withdraw his observation that he has heard me say seven years. anything against Australian woollen mills or the prices charged by the mills themthat selves.",29
116,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I will.,29
117,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I wish to refer briefly to the charge that is constantly being made that during the war the woollen mills of Australia made very large proexaggerated fits. I was pleased to hear the honordustry. able member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) refer to this aspect of the matter rigid control? in his opening remarks. Many of us are exceedingly anxious that the woollenindustry of Australia ehall be developed to a much greater extent than it has been, and since the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) and, possibly, others may be under the impression that I am opposed to the expansion of the woollen industry, I propose to quote certain remarks made by me at a conference, held on 10th December last, as the result of efforts made by my friend, Mr Stirling Taylor, Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, to inaugurate a campaign for the purpose of increasing the number of woollen mills in the Commonwealth. As delegate to that conference it fell to my lot to move the following resolution:That this meeting cordially endorses the proposal of the Prime Minister to have inaugurated a propaganda for the purpose of largely the woollen and worsted manufacmodest, turing industries of Australia. In support of that motion I am quoted as having said with reference to We enjoyed, during the war, the benefit of the cheapest wool in the world. We should have obtained the benefit of the cheapest clothes in the world. What is the cause of the high prices of suits? It is due to the fact that too great a percentage of the cloth is imand the natural remedy is to encourage the increased manufacture of woollen and worsted goods here. The time has come for the citizens of Australia to be interested in the by good propaganda work, and, in endeavouring to have mills established, we should, as far as possible, concentrate our efforts on country towns. of The actual fact with regard to the prices charged by woollen manufacturers in Australia is that during the whole period of the war and subsequently they sold their cloth at the cheapest prices at which the cloth was procurable in any part of the world. That is their record for the last",29
118,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,But is it a fact during three years of the war their profits actually exceeded the amount of their capital?,29
119,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"(f t may be; but taking the returns for such a short period as three years, one might arrive at a totally view of the profits of any in",29
120,Mr FOLET,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Then why cavil at the,29
121,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am dealing, not with the question of rigid control, hut am dealing entirely with the question of the desirableness of increasing the luanufacture of woollen goods in Australia. I rose mainly to reply to the campaign of antagonism to the Australian woollen industry which has been so sedulously fostered in different parts of the Commonwealth, on the ground that the local mills are charging excessive prices for their cloth. matter of fact, their prices during the war and subsequently were below those charged in any other country.",30
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Seeing that certain mills during the war wiped out tlieir capital cost, should they not be selling much cheaper at the present time?",30
123,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It may be that certain mills did wipe out their capital post during the war, but that, of course, cannot apply to mill-owners who have not yet built their mills. I am dealing with Ibe question of the extension of the industry which is so highly desirable in the interests of the whole of the people. I confess that I took up shares in the industry, not that I desired to make any profit, but rather to encourage its expansion. I certainly hope that the industry will be profitable; unless it is, we cannot expect an expansion of it.",30
124,Mr BKENNAN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Does the honourable member think that if no woollen goods, had been imported during the war we would have been assured of woollen goods at cheap rates here?",30
125,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I do not know. am not at all sure that if no woollen, goods had been imported we should have got our clothes any cheaper. Even if the Australian woollen manufacturer had not raised his prices by one penny per yard, I do not thank we should have heen able, under the circumstances, to buy our madeup articles at prices lower than have prevailed. The trouble is not the price charged by the manufacturer.",30
126,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Who is the,30
127,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The trouble arises between the persons to whom the manufacturer sells his cloth and the purchasers of suits of clothes'. As to the question by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr : Eichard Poster), I can only say that ' l am not so much concerned with what has been done by those woollen manufacturers who have made large profits, during the war. There is no doubt that these manu1 facturers are much stronger financially than ever before; but my deep concern is for the prospects of millswhich we hope to see established in the future.. It would not matter whether countless millions had been made during the past' few years; we have to consider what reasonable prospects there are of fair. profits in the case of mills which are to be estabAs a lished. We must remember that our local mills manufacture only a very small quantity of the wool produced.""in Australia.",30
128,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,What do. you consider fair profits?,30
129,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I - am"" not now discussing the question of fair profits; no doubt we shall have an opportunity to consider that matter at some future time, when I hope all honourable members will confine themselves' to the subject under discussion.",30
130,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Is not 10 per cent, a fair profit?",30
131,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member may think so, but I candidly say that I would not invest my capital,, nor would I advise my friends to invest theirs, in a venture if the maximum profit had to be 10 per cent.",30
132,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I mean the dividend.,30
133,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"In the present state of the world's industry and commerce,* I do not think people teould be induced to I invest if the profits or' dividends were limited to 10 per cent. If X' were consulted by a friend as to whether he should embark his capital in a new venture, requiring new "" machinery and plant, and faced with all the other initial'difficulties, and it was understood that legislation would be proposed to liniit ' the profits or dividends.to 10 per cent.,""! should either shrug my shoulders and walk away, or advise him not' to take up such a 1 culprit? foolish speculation. In my opinion, such limitation of profits and dividends is the surest way to hamper industrial enterprises ",30
134,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I S not. 10 percent a very good thing?,30
135,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I can only repeat that if the honourable memberthinks so, I do not, under the circumstances. ' - Ma-. LIVINGSTON - Why not share the profits with-the - workmen in-the mills? Mm. JOWETT - Ifithferhonorabl e member favours such a step, no doubt he will have an opportunity at some time or - other in this Parliament Of moving to that effect, but that is not the proposal before us mow. We are considering the establishment of new mills, involving ""the purchase of new machinery and' plant, for the manufacture of niore of our wool than is manufactured at present. It is well known that during the war the prices charged by the woollen manufacturers to their customers were lower than, in .any other part of the-world; and this' I take it, is, at all events,' some reply to the charge of making undue profits There is another aspect of the question which I think it very important we should note. ETo doubt, during the last three or four years the people of Australia have had to Day extortionate and unjust rates for their clothes.. I do not propose to go into details now to show how that position .has arisen, exicept to say that, as far as I am aware, there is not one tailor in Yictoria, at all events, who is able to buy his cloth at the mills; there is not one mill able to sell its output to the retail tailor.",30
136,Mr JAMES PAGE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The mills say that they have no cloth for sale.,31
137,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The process is that the mills have to sell to the large wholesale houses in Flinders-lane, Melbourne, and York-street, Sydney-that is the position into which the industry has drifted. By some . means or other the original' cost of the cloth, after leaving the mills, and as between the wholesale house and the tailor, is almost lost or hidden in the multitude of added .charges.",31
138,Mr EICHARD POSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It is not cloth, but the wool.",31
139,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am inclined to think that it is the cloth as well as the wool. Many cases have been brought under my notice of cloth sold by the manufacturer at an exceedingly moderate price, and yet it is unobtainable by the retail tailor except at a very greatly enhanced price. In my opinion, these excessive and extortionate prices, which are still being charged, are due to a set of circumstances entirely independent of the manufacturing cost of the cloth; and, therefore, I do not think it is fair to charge the manufacturers with taking undue advantage of their position during the war. By way of illustration, I wish to show the extreme difficulty of the position from the point of view of both the wool-grower and of the ultimate. consumer. At present, raw wool is selling at the lowest price known for many years-almos t at the lowest level-ye t it is found that the prices of various articles of clothing, instead of decreasing, are actually increasing. I do not think the manufacturers are getting any more for their cloth. . Mr EILEY - There is "" an honourable ? understanding."" - Mr JOWETT - I am not prepared to say even that; the reason may be one quite independent of that suggested.",31
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The manufacturers' overhead costs have increased enormously.,31
141,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"There is no doubt about that; so much so that, while the manufacturer may be getting his wool cheaper, it costs more than it did to turn out the cloth. That, I understand, is what ,the manufacturers say. However, I have been asked by tradesmen in country towns to lay before the Committee some considerations involved in this matter; and I think it is only proper that we should be fully advised of the facts. One tradesman in a country town informs me that for flannels, which last year cost him Is. 6d., he is now charged 2s. 3d. This tradesman does not buy from the manufacturer; as I haye already indicated, he cannot do so. This same man gives several similar instances, but with these I do not propose to engage honourable members. I am informed, however, ""that there has been a general rise the in the cost of cloth and flannel, as compared with last year, although wool is now very much lower in price. The explanation given is that a good deal of this cloth is made from wool that was [bought prior to the 30th June last.",31
142,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Thre e years ago, probably.",31
143,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That may be so.,31
144,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Eve n if that were so, they ought to average the price, and be fair.",31
145,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and now that it is possible to buy the' raw wool so much, cheaper, and in view of the fact that, so far as we know, manufacturing costs have not increased very materially during the last twelve montlis, the time ought not to be far distant when the cost of cloth and flannels to country drapers and storekeepers should be greatly reduced>",31
146,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Price s ought to be reduced now, because for a long time mills have been buying on hand-tomouth methods.",32
147,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"In that case we ought to have cheaper clothing before long. It is perfectly clear that we cannot expect a revival in the wool industry, or any revival in the manufacturing industry, until the people of Australia, particularly those whose incomes are not large, are able to obtain clothing at reasonable prices.",32
148,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,We hope to see a good many new mills established in country districts at an early date.,32
149,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I hope so, too. Therefore, I intend to support the proposals of the Government as outlined in this item. At present prices for clothing-and this is what concerns people particularly-ar e preposterous. Apparently there are in the trade some , people who, if they got the cloth for nothing, would not allow the general public to have clothing at a reasonable price. I have in my hand an account from a tailor for the making up of two suits of clothes for a friend of mine, who, in the ordinary course of business, obtained elsewhere the suit lengths with the object of having the material made up.",32
150,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"B y a Collins-street firm, I suppose.",32
151,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No , not by a Collinsstreet firm. For the making of these two suits of clothes the tailor's account amounted to £16, or £ 8 per suit.",32
152,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Do not forget trimmings.,32
153,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I give the trimmings in, too. Perhaps my friend's tailor also provided the sewing thread.",32
154,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That firm ought to be under Vice-Regal patronage.,32
155,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"As a matter of fact, I believe it is. Indeed, I hardly know of any firm of standing that is not under Vice-Regal patronage.",32
156,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That would be a fair price for a good tailor to charge.,32
157,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who, I believe, knows a good deal about the business, declares that £ 8 per suit would be a fair charge for the making up of material. I do not agree with him. But here is the difficult position in which we find ourselves. The whole world is suffering because people are being charged preposterous prices for clothing, and there is a general disinclination to buy mew suits of clothes until prices recede to a reasonable level, with the result that mills are partially idle all over the world. Australia is probably the one country in the world where the woollen manufacturers are fully employed. I am delighted to think that, as regards Australia, this is so. But so long as people are prepared to pay preposterous prices- I note that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, referring to the case I have just quoted, says the price is fair-so long will this deplorable state of affairs continue. This brings me to another point. The other day while walking down Collins-street with a friend, I mentioned this particular case, and he said to me, ""Well, I cannot get a suit of clothes from my tailor for less than £14 14s."" I then took him to an establishment, not far away where suits of clothes are advertised as made to order for £5 5s. It is quite likely that they may not be made in the same expensive fashion as my friend's suits are, but in the shop windows we saw a splendid display of exceedingly good tweeds-Australia n tweeds,. I suppose-suit s being advertised at £5 5s., made to order after measure.",32
158,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Thos e suits never see an inch-tape.,32
159,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"There was a very fine range of good tweeds. the Mr MATHEWS - I will wager anything you like that suits made at that price aTe never touched by the hand of a journeyman tailor.  how they would be worth any more, though I may be a bad judge.",32
160,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"'It is suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that these suitsadvertised at £5 5s. to measure, could not have been made to measure or cut in the ordinary fashion and sold at that-figure.",32
161,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The suits you get for £5 5s. now are fit only for iron-holders.,33
162,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The cloth is excellent, and it is idle to suggest, if I may say so, that because the suits are sold at £5 5s. they cannot be cut and measured in the ordinary way.",33
163,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They are made of blotting paper. *,33
164,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,No . They are made of good cloth. No doubt the honourable member will remember reading some evidence given by a tailor before a Royal Commission in Sydney not very long ago. This man advertised suits of clothes made to order for £5 5s.,33
165,Mr RICHARD EOSTEE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They would be made in a factory.,33
166,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That may be so. This man stated in his evidence that he was charged only 28s. 6d. for these suits, which he bought from a manufacturer of ready-made suits. I suppose that they were cut up and made up by machinery, but they did not cost that tailor more than £ 1 8s. 6d. per suit.",33
167,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I cap assure the honourable member that the tweed must have been stolen, and that nothing could have been paid for the making up of the suits.",33
168,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I do not believe that the tweed was stolen, or that no wages were paid for the making up of the suits. The makers simply did not demand exorbitant profits for the services they rendered.",33
169,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It is a fairy yarn.,33
170,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It is not.' This evidence was given before the Fair Prices Commission in Sydney, as the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) can bear me out.",33
171,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That is correct.,33
172,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I am reminded by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) about the information furnished to those honourable members who paid a visit to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. We saw the wool from which the cloth was made. It was good Australian' wool. We saw the cloth in every process of manufacture. It was good cloth. The manager assured us that it was sent to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory to be turned into civilian suits of clothes for returned soldiers at a cost of under 30s.,33
173,Mr JAMES PAGE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I will get the honourable member one of those suits if he will undertake to wear it.,33
174,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I regret that I cannot accept the kind offer of my honourable friend-at least not on the spur of the moment. I merely mention these facts in order to show' that the actual cost of the cloth is not the greatest element in the price of a suit of clothes. The colossal difficulty, is how to arrive at a remedy. My own view is that the high prices which so many people are willing to pay are due to ignorance and folly on the part of those consumers who will not take the trouble to go from one district where high prices are asked into another district where they can buy to advantage. I support the proposed duties in the schedule, but there are one or two articles now imported which escape high duties which are serious competitors with the product of our own woollen mills. One is cotton tweed. This, I understand, is made wholly of cotton, but is got up in such a fashion that people buy it under the belief that it contains a certain amount of wool. It is a serious competitor with our own woollen tweed3. The very name ""tweed,"" when applied to cotton goods, is a fraud.",33
175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It is a competitor because cotton tweeds are worn by people who cannot afford to buy a better article.,33
176,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It is a competitor because some people cannot tell the difference between cotton tweeds and woollen tweeds. Another article is a worsted cloth or flannel which contains an admixture of cotton, and is bought by people under the 'belief that it is composed entirely of wool.",33
177,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,A small percentage of cotton is not hurtful.,33
178,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Possibly ; but when a woman who is buying flannel for her children wants woollen flannel, she ought to be able to get it and not a cloth made partly of cotton. Considerable quantities of goods which are imported under the Tariff heading of woollen-piece goods contain cotton ",33
179,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Considerabl e quantities of such goods are made in Australia.,33
180,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That is another point, hut we are not now dealing with goods manufactured in Australia. In any case, even if some of the mills in Australia use a certain proportion of cotton in the manufacture of blankets or flannels, it is done because they are obliged to compete with similar imported goods. A higher duty should be placed on woollen goods containing cotton in order to discourage their importation. We cannot expect increased sums of money to be invested in our woollen mills, which are engaged in the manufacture of cloth wholly from wool, if they are to be called upon to compete with imported goods which people buy under the belief that they are composed entirely of wool, but which contain both wool and cotton.",34
181,Mr RICHABD POSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The importer should be compelled to state on the article what it contains.,34
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Unde r the Commerce Act, a flannel or material of that kind must be described. If an article contains cotton as well as wool, it must 'bear that impress on it when it comes into the country.",34
183,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Yes ; but what steps are taken to insure that the nature of the goods is stamped on the article when the housewife buys it?,34
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Unfortunatel y we have not the constitutional power to control that, but it is within the purview of the States.",34
185,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The States can do it?,34
186,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They are doing it .,34
187,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"J s it impossible for the Commonwealth to protect the woman - who goes to buy cloth made of wool to be made into clothes for her children ? The sale of woollen goods adulterated with cotton in such a way as to lead the purchaser to believe that the article is pure wool amounts to fraud, for I say unhesitatingly that usually no man or woman willingly buys flannel or worsted goods in the knowledge that they contain cotton.",34
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"There are some well known mixtures of wool and Gotton, such as Vyella.",34
189,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"On e person in. ten may know that the article she is buying is partly wool and partly cotton, but in rpgard to the bulk of cotton mixtures, I believe the people are having imposed upon them a mild fraud. I would have preferred a proposal to place a higher duty on worsted goods, and all others containing cotton, than is imposed on purely Avoollen goods.",34
190,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,What are the .unfortunate people to do who cannot buy woollen goods?,34
191,Mr JOWETT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The unfortunate people are those who are defrauded into buying something that is not all wool, and they ought to be protected.",34
192,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"South Sydney) [4.32] - I was pleased to hear the last two speakers say that they are anxious to protect the manufacturers, but I heard not a word from them about the protection of the public. Factories for the manufacture of woollen goods have been established in the Commonwealth, but of what advantage to the people were they during the war? They were of no help to the country at all, because they regulated the price of their goods according to the price of the imported article. If imported cloth cost 30s. or 35s. per.yard, the price of the locally made article was raised to the same figure. There was no competition between the manufacturers, jmd the fact of having these industries in' our midst did not help to keep prices down. We have been told that some of the factories worked three shifts during the war; if so, they were trebling their turnover and profits, and could afford to be generous by reducing the price to the consumer. In answer to a question I asked during the war, I was told that the highest price received by the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong for best navy-blue sergewas 6s. 6d. per yard. That factory is operated under model conditions; it pays the highest prices for its wool, and the highest wages for its labour. Yet of thethree prices of material given to me in answer to my question, the highest was 6s. 6d.",34
193,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member makes me smile.,34
194,Mr LIB TEE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The cloths quoted in thereply to the honourable member were not the best made by the factory.,34
195,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"My question related to the best cloths, and the prices I received varied from, I think, 5s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. I understand that the lowest figureat which cloth could be purchased from. the private woollen mills during the war was 12s. to 13s. per yard, or 100 per cent, more than was being received for product of the Commonwealth Mill at Geelong.",34
196,Mr GBEGOKY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Were we not told that the Geelong mill was producing at 4s. imposing high, duties. per yard?",35
197,Mr EILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"At any rate, the Geepeople long mill was making a profit at half price which the private manufacturers were charging. I am anxious to see dustries established in the Commonclothes because of the high prices. wealth; but what protection has the sumer if the manufacturers are to comdoubling bine to manipulate prices? I would be prepared to give local industry every couragement if we could make some law to provide that when manufacturers, combination, raise the price of an article, the duty on imported articles shall be removed, in order >to allow foreign petition to operate. To-day the manumeasure facturers are asking for a duty of 45 cent, on woollen goods; and when we give up prices. them that they do not care what happens to the consumer. As a Parliament we shall be neglecting our duty if we have regard to the interests of only one tion of the community. I do not. care what duty is imposed, so long as the consumer gets a fair deal; but during war the manufacturers gave the Austraber lian, public no consideration. Manufacsaid turers in other countries had to pay prices for their raw wool, high freights, and high wages, whilst the local manuattention facturer had to pay no freights, received his wool at a reasonable price, and had not to contend with any considerable crease in wages. But, on account of the way in which they treated the public, have lost, a good deal of my faith in them. When they say that they cannot sell their products except through Flinders-lane and Yorfcstreet, they disclose a lack organizing capacity. I believe the real explanation is that they .are in combinawar. tion with the wholesalers. If a person applies to a mill for two or three lengths of cloth for suits, he is referred to Flinthe deTS-lane or York-street. I am told by gentleman from <Ohina that in that try there is an unlimited market for tralian woollen goods - Therefore, we ought to encourage - the establishment manufactories'in Australia; but, when do that-, - what guarantee shall we have that the purchasing public of Australia will derive any advantage? Unless the the Government are prepared to introduce a Bill which will give this Parliament some control over prices of goods protected by the Tariff, we shall not be justified in I represent a working-cla3S constituency, in which the cannot afford to pay eight guineas the for a suit of clothes.

I shall vote for the 45 per cent, rate in this case, but on the understanding that comthe Government will bring down a which will enable us to reduce per it in the event of a combination to keep",35
198,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Kalgoorlie) [4.42] - I am not surprised that the honourable secmember for Kooyong (Sir Egbert Best) should ask for high duties on all imports, local but I cannot agree with some of the the statements made by the honourable memfor Grampians (Mr Jowett). He that during the war Australian high manufacturers had had a bad. time. As a matter of fact, that is not so. He drew to the rigid Government control that was then applied to their industry, but that eontrol did not affect the inproduction of woollen manufactures for sale tp civiliansI t applied only to the I production for military purposes, and the effect pf it was that our soldiers were better clothe*! than any others, Had it not. been for our. rigid Government conof trol,, we should have had to pay much more for military clothing. During the Australian manufacturers had this great advantage over British manufacturers, that: they could buy their wool at first appraisement, that is, they got it a - at the lowest price for which wool could counbe obtained within the Empire. Should Ausnot Australianconsumers' have benefitedon that, account ?.' ' If with up-to-date of machinery and wool at a very low price we our manufacturers could not produce cheaply, if is worth considering whether anything is to be gained by a high Tariff on woollens, and whether it will not result in the people of Australia having to pay high prices for clothing. I know of a draper in Perth who bought flannel in New Zealand at 18s. and sold it to a man in Sydney for 22s., by whom it was sold to a Melbourne firm for 28s. before it had left New Zealand. A high Tariff could not prevent dealings of that kind, which increase the price of clothing. Only 2 i per cent, of our wool is manufactured in Australia, and I would like to see more manufactured here; but Australian manufacturers should give fair terms to the Australian users of woollens. If the establishment of woollen mills here is to mean only the making of a few millionaires at the expense of the general community, I say that we shall gain little or nothing from it.",35

200,Mr EOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Interferenc e to prevent imposition upon the public is as likely to come from me as from the honourable member.

203,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,You got in on the flag.,36
204,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am proud of my conat nexion with the flag. I would sooner associated with it than with the red flag. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) said that our manufacupon turers were at a disadvantage when pared with those of other countries, cause the latter used a certain quantity threads. of cotton with their woollen goods; a little later* he told us that Australian manufacturers also used cotfbu, and that they did this because their competitors abroad did it . If it is wrong to adulterate woollen goods, it is as wrong Australian manufacturers as for British manufacturers to do it ; but there is thing in the Tariff to prevent it from being done. Some of the State laws require the quality or contents to be marked on all articles exposed for sale. Such laws prevail in'Western Australia, New South Wales, and, to some extent, in Queensland, and the sooner they become general throughout Australia the better. I hold the view that there is no reason for increasing the duties on woollens. A suit of clothes such as in 1914 a working man paid £ 5 10s. for",36
205,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,£ 3 10s.,36
206,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Ver y few working men in Western Australia paid less than £ 5 or £ 5 10s., and for suits of the same material they would today pay £11 or £12. That is not right. The present high prices will not be reduced by the imposition of a high Tariff. I know of no argument to support the raising of duties on woollens. If our factories are working to their fullest capacity, as they were doing during the war, the profits must be ample, and I do not see why Australian-made cloth should not he sent to Great Britain for sale. The present conditions should induce British woollen manufacturers to establish mills here. The rates of wages have greatly increased in Britain since the war, and now do not differ"" much from those paid here.",36
207,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I do not think that the employees are paid less in Great Britain than in Australia.,36
208,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That being so, should not our manufacturers increase their plants, and do all they can to manufacture goods for export?",36
209,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,There are other factors to be taken into account.,36
210,Mr FOLEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am for keeping out foreign-made goods; but we have had an object-lesson during the past three years least.

Everbody knows comthat the manufactured goods which come befrom Japan can absolutely be torn into After 'Japanese cotton goods but have undergone a single washing one is able to see through them. I have no doubt that there has been profiteering in woollen goods. I do not care whether it has been our manufacturers or our disfor tributors who have been guilty of this practice, but certainly the people of Ausnotralia have not been getting their goods at a price which, would have given the local manufacturer a fair profit, whilst allowing a reasonable cost for distribution.

When entered into an agreement with the Country for the sale of our wool, it was stipulated that our manufacturers should get their wool at the appraised price.

When the Minister knew that it was absolutely imposnot sible to insure an adequate supply of blankets to our people, and when the cheaper class of flannels were urgently required by them, he made no effort to in supply their needs. It is true that he has not increased the duty upon woollen goods coming from the United Kingdom I levied under the 1914 Tariff, but upon so many other lines: he has increased the cost of living to the people. Unless we reduce the cost of living, how shall we get back to normal conditions, when many persons who are now unemployed were employed the mining, pastoral, agricultural, and",38

240,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,There is no such thing as competition in the commercial at world today. Everything is controlled inby combines and understandings:,38
241,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The wider weopen to the door the more we induce competition. do not believe there is an honourable deal. member in this House who would advocate a Free Trade policy. Living conditions in Australia are better than in other countries, but we must take great eare not to cut off the-huge sources of production which have helped to build Australia's prosperity. The Mount Morgan mines have closed down. 1918 that industry turned out more than £1,000,000 worth of copper .and gold. The Mount Cuthbert mines also have closed. They, too, during one year produced more, than £1,000,000 worth of metal. These great mines employed more than 10,000 people. I think that I am making a reasonable computation when I say that every one of those employees carried at least five other people on his back. The Mount Lyell mines have also ceased activity. With the shutting down of these great producing sources it follows that business people involved must be either ruined or compelled to remove elsewhere. Moreover,, our railways are made unprofitable; and if , owing to the cessation of great producing activities, railway revenue falls away, how can the Governments concerned continue to pay employees reasonable wages to meet the high cost of living? When this Parliament makes its. contribution to the maintenance and increase of the cost of living by means of the Tariff, we merely accentuate Australia's wretched condition. Labour has its rights; and I , for one, would strenuously fight for the maintenance of those rights. But if lower - wages must now be accepted by labour-as I believe they must be-w e must do our part by whatever means are possible in reducing r the high cost of living as it bears upon labour. The only way is to bring about more competition. We must endeavour to destroy combines and honourable understandings, whether they be among manufacturers or merchants. It is preposterous,, for instance, that a pair of boots costing 12s. or 13s. in the factory should cost a buyer 30s. in the shop. That is due to want of competition. Mr LAZZARIOT: - Are there not enough boot manufacturers in Australia? Is ""now there not a glut of boots on the market?",38
242,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Australia surely advertisements ought to be exporting boots all over the are world. Hides may be purchased now for l next to nothing. Honourable members 6d. pair. opposite will, perhaps, appreciate the following letter which was recently published in the Argus. The writer saysNotwithstanding the glut of wool, and more particularly of the lower-prieed wools, the people of Australia are still without supplies In of woollen goods in the popular qualities, such as natural flannels and flannel mixtures from Is. 3d. to 2s. 6d. a yard, 'blankets at moderate prices, and tweeds suitable for every-day wear. These are not imported goods, but goods that have for years past been successfully made in large quantities by Australian mills. Winter is now approaching, and no supplies are to be obtaiaied, and people everywhere are asking, ""What is the reason?"" During the war, and since its conclusion, supplies were unavoidably curtailed, the consequence being that considerable quantities are urgently required for immediate use, but up t ill the present none seems to be available, nor (as far as can be ascertained) are likely to be. Is there any reason for this continued scarcity, and, if so, what is the reason? I am today in receipt of a letter from a leading Melbourne warehouse, which I enclose as proof of the correctness of my statement, informing me (in response to an order forthese goods) that they are still unaible to supply men's flannel undershirts, OT natural flannels by the yard, adding that "" flannels are unprocurable *in Melbourne."" It is safe to say that thousands of working men in Victoria alone will want flannel shirts this winter.",39
243,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Does the honourable member believe that the Argus gives a "" damn"" whether the working man has a flannel shirt this winter or not? .",39
244,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"When I notice the way in which some honourable members opposite cast their vote3 upon questions of this kind,, .1 wonder whether they care at all about the poorworking man. However, I am not quoting the Argus, but a letter which appeared in its 'columns; and I would not be quoting it but that all the information which I have obtained goes to bear out the statements of the writer. He continues9 And hundreds of shops are in the same position as ourselves, not having a yard of low or medium priced flannel in stock for their customers. Further, there are practically no stocks of moderately-priced men's ready-made suits, in either the wholesale or retail trade, and, as I am given to understand, there are none of the cheaper makes of strong tweeds available to make them with. Again I say, What is the .reason ?"" The time has come when ample supplies should be forthcoming. As further proof of scarcity, I enclose from leading retailers (which typical of many others), showing that their lowest quoted lines are:-Tlannel'S , 2s. i d . yard; 1} (or double-bed) blankets, 57e. I do not know whether honourable members are aware of the exact nature of the proposal emanating fro m the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. That body is asking, in regard to cotton tweeds, that there he an increase of 6d. per yard, plus 60 per cent. Honourable members are here to see a reasonable thing done by the Australian manufacturer, but it is our duty also to safeguard the interests of the people. Personally, I would not stand for any such proposal as this. Where there are high rates of duty, the people have to pay, and they have to pay twofold. The difference between the amount paid in 1913 and the sum which the public had to pay for the same goods in 1920, owing to increased duties, aggregates £127,000. In 1919-20 the Commonwealth authorities £1,103,000 in duty upon woollens alone. But before those goods could get to the people their prices were increased by 50 to 60 per cent. Without doubt, the Australian manufacturer has taken fullest advantage of the world's market conditions. ' Mr Considine - The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) stated that the Australian manufacturer of woollen materials was not responsible for the high prices charged to the public. It must be the man in between.",39
245,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Eve n that journal which has been doing so much in advocacy of prohibition, namely, the Industrial Australian, showed that the woollen mills of Australia had made a profit amounting to more than the equal of the whole of their capital in less than three years.

There should have been special legislation passed to meet such circumstances.

W it h in the last two or three days at a conference of the Labour, p a r t y - I think it was in Sydney-on e of the leading members of the party said that the working people were no better off, although they are 1 receiving higher wages, than they were before the war.",40
252,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member cannot judge the whole party by the expression of some crank.,40
253,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No . But it shows that there are members of the party to which the honourable member belongs who believe that the wage-earners are no better off today than they were five or six years ago. The position in Australia is exactly the same as it is in other countries. T have in m y possession a statement made by a Canadian manufac-'' Coats turer during the war period, who said that his factory was not built for the honour and glory of God; but for the purpose of making profit for the shareholders. The Canadian Council of Agriculture statesThe twenty-six cotton mills in Canada pay less to their employees than the woollen mills, but they get more in return in the form of profits. It has already been shown, from the evidence submitted at ""Ottawa, last year, that the Dominion Textile Company actually realized 310 per cent, profits on its capital in the year. 1918. The returns to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics show that 25.8 per cent, profit was earned in 1918 upon the capital of the entire Canadian cotton industry. The Canadian cotton manufacturer is not only the Australian grinding these profits out of a poorly paid lot of employees, but also out of every man, woman, and child throughout the Dominion who enters a shop to buy some sort of cotton goods. He enjoys Tariff protection on his manufactured product to the extent of 25 to 32£ per cent.; and, in addition, may import his raw materials, sueh as raw cotton, dyes, & c , free. In the fiscal year 1918-19 some 112,000,000 lbs. of raw cotton, valued at $34,000,000 entered Canada free of duty. In this way twenty-six cotton plants in Canada reap the benefit of both Free Trade and Protection, and in doing so, pay as little as possible to labour, and extract as much as possible in the form of profits.",40
254,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,B y whom was that written?,41
255,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The statement was issued by the Canadian Council of Agriculture. The following is most important, and applies more particularly to this Parliament:For forty years Canada has had government by a class, the class, namely, that was interested in factories. The factory was their only idea. So long as that was left intact they were willing to surrender all else, and pay any blackmail to farmers and labour alike. They lost all political principles, and missed the very aim of life. One of themselves spoke the truth in the sordid expression, "" A factory is not run for the glory of God."" Neither did he know how true a thing he said nor how submersive it was. I believe that in many instances honourable members have been very much impressed by the statements made by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) who,, in collecting his facts, has to depend to a large extent on the assistance of his officers. I have no desire to reflect on the Minister for having made a statement which, on the evidence submitted, has been shown to be incorrect, but he took me to task when I made a statement concerning the first Tariff schedule which I had before me, and rightly so, because I was slightly in error. Honourable members will recollect that when the Minister was introducing the Tariff he at any price. pointed out that Free Trade England allowed certain portions of her trade drift to other countries, and that many men were beneath the sod today of that fact. He went on to savThe manufacture of cardigan jackets and tial duty. other knitted woollen goods is acase in point. These garments were' sorely needed by the troops in the first bitter winter in France, when they went down in hundreds of thousands the Tariff. to pneumonia. England had the wool and the machinery for the manufacture of cardigan jackets, but she had not got, and for a time since 1914. did not produce, the knitting needles for the machines. Tha,t point was questioned at the time by several honourable members. I have before me a copy of a letter from Colonel H . C. Fernyhough, for Director of Equipment ancl Ordnance Stores, ""War Office, dated 28th July, 1920, in which he saysW it h reference to Board of Trade letter No. I . M . 2189 of the 22nd ultimo, I am directed to inform you that exhaustive inquiries have been made respecting the statement which accompanied your letter. . It is probable that the trade were largely dependent on Germany for the supply of hosiery needles before the war, but no difficulties were experienced in obtaining supplies of cardigan jackets from the trade, and, as will be seen from the attached statement, no delay took place in meeting demands fro m France during the early part of the winter 1914. During the period 1st August, 1914, to 31st March, 1915, contracts were placed for over 3,000,000 cardigan jackets, and the whole of this quantity was duly delivered to time, with but very few exceptions.",41
256,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That is one man's statement, which may be contradicted by another.",41
257,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That is a statement from the War Office.,41
258,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I will give the honourable member my authority for my statement.,41
259,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The Minister gave us to understand that men were lying beneath the sod because knitting needles were not available, and that, of course, would impress some honourable members, but it would not have much weight with those who gave the matter careful consideration. I was anxious to quote that letter to prove that the Minister was wrongly advised.",41
260,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I am not so sure about that. We could not get them,41
261,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am not dealing to with the position in Australia. I am referring to the position in England, and because so was the Minister. 1",41
262,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,There is no increase upon the former British preferen,41
263,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,There has been an increase since Parliament last dealt with,41
264,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It has been 30 per oent.,41
265,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am referring to the increase in duty since the House last dealt with. the Tariff. Parliament was not consulted in 1914, and in dealing with increased rates of duty we have to compare the existing rates with those imposed by Parliament, and not by the Minister.' I am quite aware that a short validating Act was passed by Parliament, but the individual increases. were not before honourable members. The reasons for any decreases or increases which have been made since 1911 should'be fully explained to honourable members; but, up to the present, no such information has been given by the Minister. We have always been under the impression that as. industries were established, and we came self-supporting, the duties would decrease; but such has not been the case. t Sir JOSEPH COOK - Does not the honourable member realise that if we reduce our Customs duties, the revenue will suffer.",41
266,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That is not so. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) knows that if the duties are too high he will not get any revenue at all from this source, and that the abnormal conditions which prevail today are not likely to continue for any time.. We are likely to receive au enormous revenue from Customs duties this year; but I . do not think the Treasurer is foolish enough to deny that next year's revenue from Customs will be 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, lower than it is this year, because, with the imposition of heavy Customs duties, .and reduced primary production, it will be impossible for the people to purchase to the same extent.,,",42
267,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member should cheer up; we have had a good rain.,42
268,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The interjection reminds me that without the increase of our primary productions, and the revenue from them all, any discussion we may have about the building up of Australian industries is absolutely useless. I would do nothing to injure Australian industries, but I want to see fair conditions the people of this country, and at the same time to give some help to the Motherland. .  debate on this item is an echo, though a very faint one, of some of the Homeric struggles we have had in this House in the past over the same item. I do not know whether interest in the Tariff has declined, but it has seemed to me that we hear much less on both sides of Tariff questions than we used to do when Tariffs were under consideration in this House in years gone by. It may be that we have all become such convinced Protectionists that there is now only one side to any Tariff question. It may be that the Government are in such an impregnable position that a few honourable members like myself feel that it is quite"" futile to attempt even to criticise them. However, on this particular item I believe it is the duty of honourable members who represent be- large sections of middle and working-class people to make some protest against what appears to me to be a quite unreasonable increase of duty. The manufacture of woollen' fabrics from Australian wool is one which we all desire to see developed. FOT many years past, I have heard of only one method by which it can be developed, and that is by imposing Customs duties on imported articles that come into competition with the products of local factories. I am afraid that the stimulus given to the local industry in that way has not been very effective up to date. If we make the Tariff wall too high, instead of stimulating Australian production we shall create such an artificial and unnatural atmosphere for it that it will languish rather than increase in strength. We heard in past years a great many arguments, put sometimes with a good deal of force, as to the necessity for protecting this and other Australian industries against the sweated and pauperized labour of Great Britain. That was always a very strong argument in the mouths of extreme Protectionists in the old days, when Tariffs were under discussion. They pointed triumphantly to the low wages paid in Great Britain and the long hours of labour there. They contrasted these with Australian conditions, and showed to their own satisfaction that Australia needed Protection on that account. « That argument has gone for by the board. The workers in Great Britain are today obtaining as high wages and working as short hours as are workers in Australia, in this industry in particular. Now that that argument has disappeared, the industrious propagandists who are able to produce a book like that before me, which is called on the outside Tha. Australian .Tariff Handbook, but which on the inside gives a list of industries that need Protection, have been deprived of their strong argument relating to the sweated and pauperized labour of Great Britain, and are compelled to turn to a remoter part of the world to discover a reason why the duty on these goods should be raised still higher, they have discovered that there is danger to this industry from Japan. I suppose that by-and-by, when in the course of events that danger no longer exists, these industrious people will have to travel still further, perhaps to the planet Mars, in order to fortify Australian Protection with another of those menaces which have played such an important part in scaring these people of Australia. Mr OoNsrrjrNE - We shall have wiped out both Protection and Free Trade by that time.",42
269,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I hope before I sit down to make a suggestion which, if adopted, should wipe out one of the worse evils at present existing. I think I may claim to have a fairly extensive knowledge of Tariff matters. I was a member of a Royal Commission appointed in 1904 to go into the whole question of rearranging the Tariff for Australia. The work of that Commission continued until 1907. It took the members of the Commission all over Australia; witnesses of every kind and class were examined at considerable length; and the Commission reported to Parliament the result of its investigations. There was a difference of opinion on the Commission. I can claim that I represented that body of opinion in Australia, stronger then than now, whioh .regarded the interests of the consumers as of some little importance. I was prepared to recognise the necessity of protecting Australian industries against anything and everything in the nature of unfair competition from the outside world. I still maintain that attitude. If ' I can discover that there is unfair competition from the outside world against any Australian industry, that industry will have my protection. But beyond that, I want to say at once, I am not prepared to go. I believe that Australian brains, muscle, and energy are equal to the. best in the world., I believe that, given a fair deal, they can stand against any competition. It seems. to me that those industries in Australia that have best succeeded in the past are those that have had the least measure of Protection.. 'So it will undoubtedly be, so long as Australia remains free and independent.",43
270,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL, I remind the honourable member that sub-item F is before the 'Committee.,43
271,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"l am keeping a great deal more closely to the question than did some of the speakers who preceded me; but, coming directly to the subject of discussion, I want to remind the .Committee that, as a part of the work done by the Tariff Commission, there is a volume before me giving reports dihd recommendations signed by four members of the .Commission, of whom I was one. I look at the volume with mingled feelings of pride and regret, because I happen to have written, most of it myself. I was nearly killed in the process; and if I had had the least idea that it was going to receive so little consideration as it did in subsequent years, I am not sure that I would have sweated my brains very much over it. In this volume there are some observations on Tariff matters that are still of some little interest. One of the observations has reference to the woollen industry, and to the so-called competition that it had to meet at that particular time from Great Britain. With other members of the Commission I went into the question of the cost of sending our wool to Great Britain and bringing it back here in the manufactured form. We found that in those days the cost of shipping our wool to Great Britain, the handling of it at the ports, putting it on the railroads, the cost of railage to the factories in England, the cost of sending it back to Australia in the manufactured form, with all charges for insurance, commission, and everything else, represented a natural protection of about 2'5 per - cent, for the Australian-manufactured article. That natural protection has been very much increased of late. I can safelysay that in regard to these woollen goods it .represents, today no less than 30 per cent. I am putting it at a low figure, and, therefore, - I say . that the actual protection which the Government are proposing for the benefit of the woollen manufacturers of Australia 13 60 per cent. If that is held to be not more than enough I shall be very much surprised, indeed. During the war Australian manufacturers had a magnificent opportunity to commend themselves to the people of Australia. I say without hesitation that the bulk of them failed dismally and disastrously to do so. They not only had their pound of flesh, but, speaking of the bulk of them, they wrung every possible drop of blood out of the unfortunate consumers as well. They have thereby done more to injure the cause of Protection in Australia than anything that has ever been brought against 0 Protection by those opposed to that fiscal policy. That line of action by Australian manufacturers has gone further to open the eyes of the Australian public to some of the evils of the system than anything else that has happened. If the local manufacturers had done the fair thing by the consumers of Australia, as they could well have afforded to do and still have secured handsome profits, I should have been one of the first to say, "" Y o u have vindicated yourselves in circumstances of some little temptation and I am prepared to trust you to a greater extent than ever in the future."" I say now, however, that I am not prepared to trust them to give a fair deal to the consumers of Australia without some method of enabling the consumers to protect themselves. When we look around the shops at the present time and notice the cost of woollen goods, blankets, flannels, and tweeds, we find that the prices asked for them are more than double what they were in pre-war times. We begin to wonder how it is that this is tolerated by the Australian public. The cost of the raw material of the industry is down lower than it was in pre-war times, and yet today the public are paying higher prices than they did before the war for the products of these factories. I say without hesitation that in some cases at any rate there is more profiteering going on in Australia today than there was during the war period.",43
272,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Does the honourable consumer. member say that the price of the raw material is down below the pre-war price ? Mr Fowler.  which wool can be secured today is lower than it was for several years before the war.,44
273,Mr HILL,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It is the same with almost every primary product.  material is lower than it was before the war, whilst the price of the manufactured article is more than double what it was before the war. Why? The cost of labour has slightly increased; but the volume to which I have already referred shows that the cost, of labour play3 relatively a very small part in the production of an industry such as this, where the greater part of the work is done by machinery. In this case it amounts at the most to about 30 per cent. Thus, if the labour costs were doubled, that would not by any means justify the doubling of the price of the manufactured article to the consumers 1 of Australia. While I am inclined to be reminiscent on this topic, I would remind honourable members that I think I was the first to attempt, in_ relation to the protection of Australian industries, to give some protection to the consumer. When the Australian Industries Encouragement Bil l was before the House, a good many years ago, I endeavoured to secure the insertion of clauses which would make the protection of the Australian manufacturer consequent upon fair wages being paid in the industry, and fair prices charged to the consumer. That attempt, owing to our constitutional limitations, failed. I want, however, to suggest to the Minister a method by which that same object could be secured under this Tariff. I suggest that there could be established a body that would keep a watch on the prices-of Australian-made goods in relation to prices for the same classes of goods in Great Britain and America/the two countries from which our competition principally comes-and that when that body reported that prices in Australia did not bear a fair relation to the cost of goods being sold in those two countries, the protection afforded should automatically come down. In that way we would secure the protection of. the",44
274,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I have promised to introduce a Bill somewhat along those lines.,44
275,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If the honourable gentleman has made that promise, I am not so much concerned as to whether or not the protection is high",45
276,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I have definitely promised the House to bring in a Bill, not to do exactly what the honourable member suggests, but to do something, at all events, on the lines mentioned by him.",45
277,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am not concerned with the details, as long as the Minister accepts the principle.",45
278,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I have already promised to do so.,45
279,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I know that the Minister has indicated his intention to move in some way or other to protect the consumer, but I am not aware' that he has given any particular indication of how he is going to achieve that object. I am suggesting a method, because, as has been said from aft sides during this debate, the old-fashioned natural competition is almost at an end in all parts of the world. There are Combines that are international in their operation, and there is no doubt that the Australian, interests in regard to production and, at all events, wholesale distribution, have learned their lesson, in that respect, from the outside world.",45
280,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They are in harmony with economic evolution.,45
281,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"We want economic evolution to evolve on sound lines, and, where necessary, we should give it a little fillip. I am at one with the honourable member in that regard. If the consumer is to be protected in some adequate way, then I am not so much concerned as to whether or not the protection is high. I think, however, we ought to make the Tariff wall against the Mother Country a little lower than we are doing. It is advantage to make the wall so high that in most cases neither the Mother Country nor any other country can get over it, and then to add an ornamental coping and describe that as a preference to the Mother Country. That is in the nature of what we are doing in this Tariff. Taking into consideration the natural protection that Australia on account of her isolated position enjoys, and is likely to enjoy for all time, a very moderate duty is ample for any industry that has a chanceto struggle along. Mr CoNsroiNE - If that is the case, why do you want a Tariff at all ?",45
282,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I do not want a Tariff in the sense that the honourable member suggests. We have before us a Tariff schedule that we are trying to put into shape, and if the honourable member and I were free to carry out our ideas, the alterations might be more drastic than the Committee would be inclined to adopt. I want again to suggest that if we are going to give preference to the Mother Country, it should be something more genuine than is proposed in this Tariff. In the majority of cases the duty is practically prohibitive, so that no preference whatever is given. Now that the objectionable conditions of labour in Great Britain upon which Protectionists used to dilate have disappeared, we might very well be far more generous than we are. I recognise, however, that it is useless for me to attempt to move in that direction, and just as useless to speak; but I am glad to have from the Minister the promise that he proposes to give the consumer some little consideration in connection with this Tariff, and with that promise for the meantime I shall have to be content.",45
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.3] - I should like to deal very briefly with the closing observations made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr Fowler) as to the inadequacy of the preference we are giving to Great Britain. If there is one thing in regard to which I feel strongly it is that where we are giving preference it should be given as far as possible to Britain. 1 propose to show to what extent the preferential provisions of the Tariff in reof no gard to woollen goods have thrown into British hands the great bulk of our import trade. Taking the figures for last year, I find that our total importations of woollen-piece good3 were valued at £3,437,230, and that of those imports no less than £3,331,081 Svorth came from the United Kingdom. That is to say, out of a total importation of practically three and a half million pounds worth of woollen-piece goods, only £106,000 worth came from countries other than the United Kingdom. These figures, I think, are sufficient proof-if proof were needed-that the preference given under the Tariff to British goods is effective. In regard to this great industry, which of all others should be native to Australia, I believe we should be able practically to cut off our importations and to become exporters of woollen-piece goods. I hope to see that position established; I hope that we shall be able, not only to cease importing woollen-piece goods, but to become exporters. Mr RIOHAE D FOSTEE - The honourable gentleman is very optimistic.",45
284,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I believe that to be a possibility, nay, a probability, of the future. I am very hopeful that the rates which we are providing in this Tariff will be effective in that direction. A deal has 'been said about the profits that were made by the woollen mills during the war. Those who have followed the history of our .mills, and have tried to get down to the true reasons for those profits, will have found that at that time the mills were practically not manufacturing for civilian purposes. Practically the whole of their machinery and energies Victoria were at that particular period thrown into the making of khaki d o t h and flan1908 nels required for war purposes. had .been accustomed to working on a definite percentage on turnover which gave them a very moderate profit. The expansion. balance-sheets of the various woollen mills operating in the Commonwealth show that before the war their profits were very moderate. They set to work, no doubt, to make their contracts with the Defence Department on the basis of been a reason. profit in relation to turnover to which they had been accustomed. I do not believe the woollen manufacturers themduties selves realized at the time that by throwits lowest ebb. ing, as they practically did, the whole of their energies into the production of one class of goods they would make more such money than they had done before on the same basis of profit in relation to turnbeen over. Instead of having every day to other change their looms from one .class of manufacture to another, or to spin difthis ferent classes of yarns for different classes of manufactures, they were able to keep the whole of their plant running as one unit concentrated on the turning out one particular class of material. I do not think they realized that in doing this, working their mills twenty-four hours a day instead of eight, they would make very much more money than they had enterprise, done before on the same basis of profit i relation to turnover. I cannot conceive of a more magnificent example of the benefits of massed production than those figures show. You cannot ,get the best results from the manufacture of any particular class of goods unless by massed production.  for this Tariff.",46
285,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"To my mind, it is a very substantial argument in its favour. If we can. so build up our industries that they specialize and concentratei, in stead of turning from one thing to another, we shall be able to get our goods at a very much lower price, and the manufacturers will be able to make more great money. That is an ordinary business proposition which the honourable member will not dispute. Has any honourable member given consideration to the history of the woollen industry in Australia? It was, I believe, about the first manufacturing industry to be established here. It s history goes back to 1801. The first woollen m i ll in was started in 1867, but the in dustry has been of very slow growth. In there were in the Commonwealth exThey actly as many mills manufacturing woollen goods as there were when the war broke out in 1914. There had been no There had been a little growth in their output, and a slight in crease in the number of hands employed; but there they were-twenty-tw o factories in 1908 and twenty-two in 1914. For that lack of growth there must have Mr FOWI . EE - In Victoria, when the were highest, the industry was at",46
286,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am not arguing on that point; I am saying that if this was a magnificent industry for the reaping of profits, surely there would have found many people fallin g over each to invest in it . But the facts are against that view; they show that during long period of our history the growth of the woollen industry has been practically negligible. D u r in g the war",46
287,Mr RIOHAED FOSTEB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,-Before the war of the profits were not unreasonable.,46
288,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"They were not ; they were not only not unreasonable, but, having regard f o the risksof any industrial they were less than in most. n D u r in g the war, it is true, the woollen mills made large profits, and the public / got very little material, indeed, from the mills. As I have already explained, the whole of the energies of the mills were devoted to turning out goods for the Defence Department, and for civilian purposes the deliveries were very small. I remember that during the somewhat chequered period, when I presided over the Department which controlled prices, it was over and over again suggested that we should endeavour to control the prices of Australian woollen goods. But when we came to investigate the position, we found that practically all the woollen piece goods that were being used by the public were imported; there was scarcely any Australian stuff on the market because of this concentration of the mills on military work. If we had tried to (follow the comparatively small portion of the Australian production through the various ramifications of the trade, we should have lost it. What really was the cause, and what I believe is very largely the cause of the tremendous prices being charged to the public for woollen clothing, and woollen garments generally, is that we are still getting a large amount of material from abroad. The retailer, if he has a certain amount of Australian stuff, has got it at a cheaper rate than that at which he gets the imported, for the local manufacturer does not get anything approaching the price that the importer pays for the stuff from overseas. It is a fact that this local material gets mixed up with the imported material, and, I believe, is very often sold as imported by the tailor. The public are not getting the benefit of the fact that we are turning out a lange percentage, at all events, of Australian goods. If we can build up this industry so that we may get practically the whole of our consumption from Australian mills, we shall, soon see an alteration in that state of affairs. So long as we have the stream of imported material coming in, we shall never get the full benefit of our local manufacture. If I accepted the amendment, the only result would be to make it easier to import and more difficult to manufacture, and to put the day of benefit to the consumer so much further away-to put off the day when the Australian: mills will turn out the whole of our requirements. I feel very strongly that,' if we would .only seize it, we have a unique opportunity now to send this industry bounding along the road of prosperity; I mean .prosperity from the point of view of proauction. I wish to see this industry develop in Australia; I wish to see Australia become an exporter, not so much of raw wool as of manufactured woollen goods; and I believe that the day is not far distant, if we will only take our courage in both hands, when that object may be gained. As I have stated, the whole history of the industry is such that one feels that unless we are prepared to give a fair measure of protection, increased protection if honourable members like, on that which we had before the war, we cannot hope for any better results in the future than in the past.",46
289,Mr FOWLEE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Surely we do not need practically 60 per cent, of protection?",47
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I deny altogether that we have anything approaching that protection. Mr FOWI.EE - I can prove it absolutely-up to the hilt.,47
291,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I deny it altogether.,47
292,Mr FOWLEE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Unde r this Tariff the protection is practically 60 per cent.,47
293,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"And the reason for my denial is a very simple one. If the honourable member will take into consideration the cost of moving the goods from one part of Australia to another, and set it against the cost of transit to and from Britain, he will find that there is precious little difference between them.",47
294,Mr FOWLER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Hav e not imported goods to be moved about Australia in the same way?,47
295,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am talking of wholesale transactions, and I repeat that if the honourable member will do as I suggest he will find that there is precious little difference; indeed, I know a great number of cases in which the Australian cost is the greater. I have often heard of the natural protection of which the honourable member speaks, but if he examines the position with an unprejudiced mind, he will find that that protection practically disappears in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred. I do not know that it is necessary for me to say any more at this stage, except that I hope the amendment will not be accepted. I do not propose to raise the British preference rate over the 1914 T a r if f , but leave it exactly where it has been for seven years. I think that the proposal in the Tariff is a very moderate one in the circumstances, and I ask the Committee to adopt it .",47
296,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Melbourne Ports) [ 6 . 1 9 ] - I wish to give notice that I intend to move a further amendment with the object of raising the duties to 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 50 per cent. Australia is the greatest wool producing country in the world. not say that as a Labour man, but merely repeat what is said by my honourable friends opposite, and by the press which supports them. B y those honourable members, and by that press, we are told of the marvellous wealth that is represented by 'our wool production. I can well remember the time when we were told that the only use for our wool was to export it , and that we must have Free Trade in other commodities, so that ships might bring the latter here at substantial profit, and thus be able to take our wool back to the Old Country at lower freights. That was the argument we used to hear t h i r t y or for t y years - ago. I have heard all sorts of statements as to the probable effect of high Protection upon the workers of Australia. I do not think the workers pay the tax at all, so it is of no use to talk to me about the condition of .the poor worker under Protection. If there were no taxes they would get so much less in wages. taxation, we are told, is about £11 per head, representing about £44 per year for the average working man and his family. I am satisfied that if this taxation were lifted he would get £44 less in wages every year. What occurred during the war in the woollen industry? You could go into any of the warehouses in Melbourne and buy material, such as is in the sample I am now exhibiting, very fine tweed, though, perhaps not quite so good in some respects as the best West of England tweed. If I had my way I would not allow one yard of tweed to be imported. I would insist upon the people of this country wearing the Australian material. D u r in g the war the warehousemen in this country sold every yard of this material as imported cloth. I have no consideration for the manufacturers at all, although large sums of money have been spent in my division upon the erection of establishments, equipped with all the necessary machinery for manufacturing the raw material into the finished product. My Only concern is for the men and women who work in such establishments, and who sent me here. Among the manufacturers I have many friends, and, of course, speaking personally, I would not like to see them ruined, but for manufacturers generally, I have no concern whatever. Australia. I do produces immense quantities of raw product in the form of wool, and if we have not the power of organization to handlei t and develop our industries as is done in other countries of the world, then we must be unworthy of our trust.  to develop our industries without artificial aids.",48
297,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"We are told that we do not want artificial help in the building up of our industries. The time for high prices has passed, and so we should do our utmost to assist in the establishment of all those new companies which, we understand, are about to be launched for the development of the textile industry in Australia. In a statement issued by the Bureau of Commerce and Industry recently there is a list of twenty-two woollen textile manufacturing companies that have been registered in Australia since the beginning of 1920. I should like to place that list on record. Our It is as follows : Capital. £ Apsley Mills, Eichmond (Vic.) .. 25,000 Excelsior Knitting Mills (Melb.) .. 20,000 Leicester Knitting Mills, Fitzroy (Vic.) .. .. . . 20,000 Stawell Mills (Vic.) - .. . . 100,000 Beige-Austral Mills (Svdney) .. 20,000 Sinclair Weaving Mills (Vic.) .. 20.000 Cosmos Knitting Mills (N.S.W.) . . 20,000 Alexandra Mills (^T..S.W.) . . . . 50,000 Austral Knitting Mills (N.S.W.) . . 75,000 Tillam and Bochme (Svdney) . . 150,000 Eiverina Co.

It is evident that the people who are associated with these companies can see an opportunity presented for the development of the industry in Australia, but apparently the Government cannot see it . In the beginning of 1918 I introduced to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . Millen) a deputation asking the Government to spend £5,000,000 in the woollen industry for repatriation purposes. If the Government had done that, they would have been in a better position today to repatriate our returned soldiers. The argument used at the time Was that the woollen industry did not offer employment to a large number of men.",48
298,Unknown,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.,49
299,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If every country town in Australia had a woollen m ill turning out some for m of woollen goods, it would add to the stability of these in land to w s , and {considerably ease the labour question. I am asked why, with all our natural protection, we cannot do this or that. When recently I had the pleasure of visiting the Yarra Falls Spinning Mills, I took the opportunity of asking the manager whether he was doing anything in the direction of working up the by-products of the woollen industry, and I mentioned the production of lanoline. He said, "" No ; for several reasons."" First of all, he showed me a large p it , into the duty. which was drained all material that would at some future time be absorbed in the manufacture of lanoline, but he told that it would not pay an establishment like his to introduce the necessary machinery for the treatment of these by-proCapital, ducts. He said that it would take all the f different establishments combined to do so. This is one of the reasons why competitors on the other side of the world can hold their own against us. If we could only treat the whole of the by-products associated with the woollen industry, our position would be considerably improved; but before we could hope to treat these by-products effectively we would need to increase our manufacture of wool into piece goods at least tenfold. However, in the near future, I hope that everything associated with the sheep, except, perhaps, its baa, will be used up by our manufacturers. Those countries which undertake the production of woollen goods to the fullest extent lose very little of the by-products of the industry. To illustrate my argument, let me refer to the operations carried on by the Maize Products Limite d in Melbourne. The company loses nothing in the treatment of maize. It applies such a high degree of perfection to its manufacture that it has even established a coopering branch for turning out its own barrels. If we could so manage our woollen industry that the by-products could be put to use, we certainly would be doing something beneficial to Australia. I do not intend to protract this discussion. We ought to make up our minds as to whether we are Protectionists or not, whether we intend the duties we impose to give us an article produced i u Australia or an imported article, or whether we are merely seeking to establish a revenue Tariff. I have been reminded in this House on several occasions, "" Do not forget we want revenue."" I want no revenue through the Customs. No Protective duty is effective if it produces revenue. W it h the knowledge I have of the woollen trade, I feel that we have arrived at a stage in Australia when we ought to produce a commodity fit for any one to wear, and at a price cheaper than that at which it can be imported.",49
300,Mr GEEGORT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Then we do not require,49
301,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"'The honourable member will persist in that line of talk. me I admit that during the war the duty on woollen goods was inoperative, and that even today it is to a certain degree inoperative. But the honourable member knows as well as I do the peculiar condition of all the industries in the country which is our greatest competitor in respect to the manufacture of woollen goods. Unfortunately, it seems that the coal miners of Great Britain are beaten; and if their wages come down, then wages will come down right throughout Great Britain; and the same conditions will follow in Australia. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) is anxious to see the cost of living kept down, so that wages may be reduced.",49
302,Mr GKEGOEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Yes ; in order that we may carry on our industries.,50
303,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If we lower the cost of living we lower the wages of the workers. The honourable member has said most emphatically during this debate that he was anxious to avoid adding to the cost of living in Australia, because he realized that'wages must come down.",50

305,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member is anxious to see wages reduced so that certain advantages may not be lost to some industries.,50

308,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Before the workers of Australia allow their wages to be cut down by one cent. I hope there will be an industrial upheaval unparalleled in the history of this country, because it will be good-bye to existing organizations the moment a start is made to reduce wages. There are thousands of men in the Labour movement hoping for this, not for the reason advanced by honourable members opposite, but because they believe that it will bring about a crisis will upset our present economic system.",50
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Rubbish !,50
310,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That is what I call bunkum.,50
311,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Honourable members are very innocent. We have honourable members here who wish to see costs kept down so that wages may be cut down. It is the old Free Trade bait at which the workers of Great Britain bit,, and by which they were caught. What is the position of the workers in the Old Country under Free Trade, especially in the woollen industry and in agriculture? There are people in England-w e know them as the submerged tenth-wh o are poorer than any other people in the world.",50
312,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member would not think it fair if I said that his action is taken merely for the purpose of increasing the profits of. the manu,50
313,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I have been told that such is the case. I admit that the effect of these duties will be to increase the profits of the manufacturers unless the Parliament or the people of Australia prevent it. It is up to this Parliament to prevent it or to the people of Australia to demand that this Parliament shall prevent it. If Parliament has not the power to do it, then the people must give it the power.",50
314,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If the manufacturers are to make profits, it would be much better for the profits to go to Australian manufacturers rather than to foreigners.",50
315,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Yes , and we can tax the Australian manufacturers out of all the abnormal profits they are making. If I had the opportunity I would do so.",50
316,Mr BRENNAN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Is there no submerged tenth in New York or Berlin?,50
317,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Of course, there is. There is no virtue in Protection as protection, just the same as there is no virtue in Free Trade as free trade. I am not a Protectionist because I am a Labour man, but I am a Labour man because I know that the workers are the only persons in a country worth considering, and I use a Protective policy as a means to an end. No halo surrounds the word that Protection as far as I am concerned. I repeat that we can tax the manufacturers of Australia if we choose to do so, but, unfortunately, honourable members opposite are not too keen on taxing the big profits of either the manufacturers or the importers.",50
318,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That is not fair.,50
319,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Honourable - members opposite know that importers have made big fortunes, and they know that while we can tax the local manufacturer, we cannot tax the importer. I intend to move an increase to this duty, because I am satisfied that the one - great chance Australia has to pay its enormous debt is to utilize its great natural product, wool, by establishing factories for its treatment in all its phases. Unless something is done to pay our debt, there will be a crisis, and it is because I want to avoid that crisis that I suggest a method by which we can do so. Every town in Australia should run a woollen mill, not only to supply local requirements, but also for the purpose of exporting woollen piece goods, and also for the treatment of the by-products of the industry, and - this can be done when we organize the industry properly.",51
320,Mr WIENHOLT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Moreton) [8.13] I have no intention of going over the ground that has already been traversed by other honourable members, nor am I egotistical enough to think that anything one could say would affect a single vote; but I wish to take the opportunity upon the proposed duty on such an essential commodity as woollen goods of making my position quite plain. dissociate myself altogether from the Protection mad policy that is now being carried into effect in this' Committee. The Minister (Mr Greene) has already earned for himself the reputation of being an Australian MCKinley, but if I may be so bold as to say it, and, without offence, I think that by the time we have gone through the Tariff we shall be able more properly to compare him with the Chinese Emperor, Shih Hwang T i , who built the famous Wall of China to block his Empire out from the rest of the world. There are two considerations in particular which appeal to me. Both the last speakers, who used the words "" Australian genius and Australian industry,"" and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), with whose speech I am very much in accord, made plain that we have not only the finest wool, but also, I believe, in the true Australian worker, the quickest and most intelligent worker in the world, with the possible exception of the American, about whom I cannot speak. Having these two advantages, every claim for a big protective duty is nothing short of a vote of want of confidence in the Australian raw material, the Australian manufacturer, and the Australian worker. When dealing with these already big, and, in many cases, prohibitive duties, we should have regard particularly to the man with a family. Every tax placed upon him under the Tariff may be increased threefold, fivefold, or tenfold, according to the number of his children.. He is the one person above all others for whom we should have regard. When I see the Committee going ""protection mad"" I have at least this consoling thought that, just as the pendulum is swinging to one side now, so surely will it swing to the other side later. I am pleased that a motion for the reduction of the duty has been submitted by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). In supporting the amendment we wish no ill to the woollen manufactories, far from it . There is one mill in my own electorate, but that fact does not prevent me from voting on „ these duties according to my principles. I hope the amendment will be well supported, and that we shall have a fair chance of reducing the duty to a reasonable rate. I Mr LISTER (Corio) [8.19] - I listened with very great interest to the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews). Although I take exception to some of his statements, I think that on the whole he has contributed to the debate something of value, and has given a lead which the Committee should follow. He stated that he was interested only in the workers engaged in the woollen industry, and had - mo particular concern in the persons who have invested their money in it . A statement of that kind is extremely unfortunate, because if ever there was a time when the co-operation of capital and labour wa3 necessary it is now. We cannot develop the industries of the Commonwealth without the aid of capital, and I was surprised .at the remarks of the honourable member, because later he made a special plea for an increase in the Tariff in order ito assist the various companies who have recently - started .manufacturing in Australia. I recognise as much as does any other honourable member the necessity for developing the woollen industry, and I intend to'support the amendment to be proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, because I recognise that if the industry is to progress it must receive even greater protection than it has had in the past. The Minister (Mr Greene) made that clear when he emphasized the stagnation in the industry over a period of years just prior to the war, and he rightly argued that if woollen manufacture were the gold mine which some people believe it to be, much more money would have been invested in it, and there would not have been the cry that has been heard so often lately that the industry is at a standstill, and must be further encouraged. Only a little time ago we had evidence of the interest that other countries are taking in the woollen industry, and we read of visitors from Japan purchasing some of the best stud sheep that money could procure. That action indicates to me that before long we shall have an active competitor in a - people whose workers are employed at wages and under conditions very much below those ruling in Australia. that reason we would be justified in giving further protection to an industry which means so much to the Commonwealth. Some honourable members have taken exception to the proposed duty because they allege some manufacturers have been making inordinate profits. The Minister in his remarks effectively disposed of that argument. During the year 1914 the percentage of profits to turnover in the woollen industry was 12.93 per cent., .which no honourable member will say was exorbitant. Other honourable members have complained of the so-called greed shown by the manufacturers during the war period. Yet, during the years 1915-16-17, the percentage of profit to turnover increased to only 17.59 per cent. Having regard to the fact that in order to get the big turnover the mills were running three shifts, and that the overhead charges were correspondingly decreased, and that the machinery was deteriorating rapidly and could only be replaced at very high prices, that was not an excessive profit. In regard to the cost of manufacture, I know of material manufactured in the mills ,at Geelong and sold at a cost price of lis. per yard, but re-sold to the retailer at from 25s. to 27s. Mr Lister. per yard. The increase appears to be very great, but I am told on most reliable authority that if the manufacturers themselves were'to undertake the distribution of their product they oould not place it on the market at the price at which the wholesalers are selling it today.",51
321,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That is a nice fairy tale.,52
322,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I am told that it is true.,52
323,Sir GEANVILLE RYRIE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member must be "" soft"" to believe that.",52
324,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No stretch of the imagination .is required to believe that statement when one realizes that the manufacturers deal with very few lines. If they had to send their travellers all over the Commonwealth to handle only their products, the cost of distribution would be greater than it is through the medium of the wholesale houses. One explanation of the profits made during the war period was that owing to the demand for war material the products of For the mills were standardized. The mills were turning out only one quality and size of blanket, and that enabled them to produce larger quantities, and naturally make greater profits.",52
325,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Why did they double that their price?,52
326,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"They entered into a contract with the Defence Department at a price that was considered fair. In stead of turning out blankets of thirty-five different grades and sizes, which naturally would have necessitated a considerable amount of extra work, they concentrated on one standard line. Then, although forty qualities and sizes of flannels wore made before the war, only one was made during the war. It is this that probably explains the profits made by the manufacturers.",52
327,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Shoul d they not under tliose circumstances have sold more cheaply?,52
328,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Thei r prices, as has been stated by several speakers, were considerably below those at which similar articles could be obtained anywhere else. They were prices at which the Defence Department were very pleased to get their supplies. Let me read a letter headed "" A warning to Australia,"" which is printed on page 184 of the Australian Tariff Hand-booh, 1919. It reads-f In the January, 1909, issue of the Textile World, of America, appeared a letter from the Montreal Woollen Mill Company of Canada, explaining the difficulty in which the company found itself. The letter was dated'23rd December, 1908, and, addressed to the editor of the journal, read:-""Dea r Sir,- . . . We have been in business for the past thirty years, and have always paid good interest on the capital invested until the last four years. Since the present Liberal party came into power they have lowered the duty from 50 to 23-J per cent., and have practically annihilated the woollen industry. During their stay in power they have, throughtheir Free Trade policy, been the cause of 75 per cent, of the woollen mills closing, and it they stay in power much longer there will be none left, and the once biggest Canadian industry will be no more. We have during the past four years lost money, but have been banging on, expecting a change in the Government which did not come, and we have now decided to liquidate our plant while we can pay 100 cents on the dollar. Do you know what second hand woollen machinery is in the States? If same is low enough, we may be induced to move our machinery, and go over, providing we could secure a good location at a reasonable figure. THE MONTREAL WOOLLEN MILL Co."" I should not like the Australian woollen industry to he in a position of jeopardy similar to the Montreal Company, and when the honourable memher for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) moves to increase these duties I shall support his amendment.",52
329,Mr ROBERT COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Indi) [8.35] It seems to me that the woollen industry is one of our chief industries, and one that we should do our best to develop. That the employees in it have not been giving a fair deal, and that the manufacturers have been charging too much for their goods, is not a reason for withholding support from it. We know that the manufacturers did not play the game during the war, and that they are not playing it now. We know, too, that the employees have obtained practically what they asked for from Wages Boards and the Arbitration Court, and that they have not been playing the game. As a result of the slowing-down policy and profiteering, many of our industries are likely to break down in the near future. The harmless public is being penalized by two profiteering gangs: the employees do not care what wages are, so long as these [352] are continually' ascending, and the manufacturers merely pass on any increases granted by Wages Board or the Arbitration Court, with the addition of, perhaps, 10 per cent., and then ask for further assistance under the Tariff. These two profiteering gangs should be brought to i their knees. But the circumstances which now exist should not prevent us from doing what is reasonable to develop the woollen industry. If properly developed, it wonld be worth upwards of £100,000,000 to Australia. We manufacture about 3 per cent, of our yearly wool product.",53
330,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No ; we utilize for manufacturing in Australia only 2£ per cent, of our production of wool.",53
331,Mr BOWDEN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"We manufacture 50 per cent, of our requirements.",53
332,Mr ROBERT COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No ; nothing like that; only 12 per cent, of our requirements. Australia produces one-fourth of the world's wool and between 62 and 64 per cent, of the world's fine wool, and every member should do what he can to put the woollen industry on a proper footing. We have the climate necessary for the manufacture of woollens, and the Bureau of Science and Industry has been instrumental in starting about thirty-three companies, with a registered capital of about £3,600,000. Many of these companies, like two in my district, are merely waiting for machinery. It is in this matter of machinery that the Government can assist the woollen industry. We wish to know how we can best get the machinery that we need. We have every reason to go ahead with the development of this industry. The time has arrived when the electric power which may be generated by some of our rivers must be taken into consideration. I understand, that an application has been made for a lease in .connection with a hydro-electric power scheme on the Kiewa River. That scheme will provide power for the greater part of Victoria, and the Morwell scheme will furnish the balance. Other States are about to develop their water-power in the same way, and, therefore, it seems to me that we can proceed to establish the woollen industry in our midst with the greatest degree of confidence. I am inclined to grant a preference of 5 per cent. to the - woollen goods of the United Kingdom, in addition to the Minister's proposal, hut I do not care what duty is im- in a week. posed upon those coming from foreign countries.",53
333,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,In this schedule we have given Britain a preference of 15 per cent.,54
334,Mr ROBERT COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"On e honourable member has referred to a nation which is paying only half-a-crown per day to its labourers. We cannot possibly hope to compete with such nations; and for that reason I am prepared to impose a very substantial duty indeed upon goods entering the Commonwealth under the general Tariff. Mr MCGRATH. (Ballarat) [8.42] Earring this debate I have been struck by the .remarkable attitude which has been adopted by certain members of the Country party, and particularly by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook), who talked about the two gangs of profiteers-the manufacturers and the workers. Yoit, sir, will remember-as , indeed, all of us do-the time when the workers of this country were obliged to resort to the weapon of the strike in order to enforce their demands for better wages or for improved industrial conditions. But after years of agitation, Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards Were substituted for that weapon, with the result that today every concession that is obtained by the wage-earner is tained by constitutional methods. In the woollen industry there is a Wages Board consisting of three members, of whom the chairman is usually a representative of the employers. Yet the honourable member for Indi had the temerity to stand up here and impute that the workers are a gang of profiteers. Need I remind him that at the last election it was the workers who put him where he is today, by giving him their second preference votes.",54
335,Mr ROBERT COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"-Are they not going slow? Mr MoGRATH - A greater slander than that the workers of Australia are guilty of going slow was never uttered by an honourable member. The Assistant Miuister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) has recently been amongst the Egyptian workmen, and he knows, as well as anybody, that one Australian workman does more in three days than the workman of any other country does",54
336,Mr CONSTDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"That is not true Mr MoGRATH - The Australian workers have adopted constitutional methods to obtain redress of their grievances, and because they are now getting a decent wage the honourable member for Indi has the temerity to term them a gang of profiteers. I am ashamed to think that any honourable member would utter such a slanderous statement upon the workers of Australia.",54
337,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No doubt there is trouble in the bacon factory. Mr MoGRATH - Probably that is the explanation. The honourable member for Indi may be perturbed about his profits. Did he ever hear of a workman's will being sworn for probate purposes at £lj000? Certainly not. The worker gets only a bare living out of his wages. It is men like the honourable member and others of his class who can die worth £10,000, or £20,000, or £30,,000. I hold no brief for the manufacturing class of this country. I am a Protectionist, but I know only too well how they acted throughout the war period. They made immense profits.",54
338,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,So did members of the importing class.,54
339,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Bot h the importobing and the manufacturing classes took advantage of war conditions to exploit the people. They talked about the conscription of human life and about equality of sacrifice, but whilst our men were away in the fighting line they were intent upon increasing their bank balances. Nevertheless I shall vote for the increased duty which is proposed. If the war has taught us anything, it is that Australia ought to be a manufacturing country. During the war period we were scarcely able to import a single thing, and we demonstrated our capacity to manufacture articles which we had previously imported better than can any other country in the world. There were no soldiers overseas as well clad as were our Australian soldiers, who were equipped throughout with articles produced in the Commonwealth. The boots supplied to our troops were infinitely better than were the boots supplied to the troops of any other nation. There is no reason why we cannot produce sufficient for all the woollen requirements of our own people. I admit that if we impose a very heavy duty upon woollens we shall not he ahle to supply our people with cheap articles. But that is the fault of the people themselves. We have repeatedly asked them to clothe this Parliament with the constitutional power to enable it to establish more Government woollen mills than those at Geelong. As a returned soldier I was able to purchase a suit length of cloth from those mills for 26s.,, and if we possessed the requisite constitutional power every other individual in Australia could be supplied at the same price. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) has said that it costs another 12s. per yard to distribute that cloth. Of course it does if we play into the hands of the Flinders-lane merchants. Mr 'GKEGOBY - If we do what the honcost orable member suggests we might get into a similar position to that which occupied by the Cockatoo Island Dockgrown yard.",54
340,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The administration of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard is still under investigation. But I can quite districts imagine any State or Commonwealth enterprise being made a failure if Ministers wish to bring discredit upon We established the Commonwealth Bank, rate. but fortunately Ministers were sympathetic towards that institution, with the result that it has proved a big success, and that it upheld the credit of this country during five years of war. Similarly our Commonwealth Woollen Mills were established by Ministers to-night who desired to make them a success. It is remarkable that, notwithstanding that we have Ministers side by side with men. vested interests which desire the failure of the Commonwealth Woollen Mill,. the of them. latter has been a gigantic success. And if such is the case with respect to one establishment in Geelong, the same should be applicable tot others if established throughout the Commonwealth.",55
341,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,If they were equally capably managed.,55
342,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If private entercause.we prise can secure capable managers, if the Commonwealth can secure a capable manager at Geelong, the same should be [352]- 2 possible in regard to the establishment of Commonwealth mills all over Australia. All that is required is a man of sympathy, a man with a belief in the venture, one who is as capable, of giving a fair deal to the employees as to the Commonwealth. It wouia be no satisfaction to me to vote for a reduction of duties in order that certain importers might become a little more wealthy by bringing woollen goods into this country. I would prefer to see Australian manufacturers getting richer rather than manufacturers outside of Australia, together with a few importers in our various capital cities. If there must be a monopoly, let the monopoly be an Australian one, where Australians will benefit, and where, in any case, they will be more easily got at and controlled by the Commonwealth authorities. Honourable members on this side are consistent. We candidly admit that Protection is no cure for Australia's industrial evils. I have no doubt but that it will increase the of living. But, at any . rate, I am not like members of the Country party, is who go for Protection upon Australiansugar, bananas, onions, citrus fruits, and currants and raisins, while upon all those things, which do not directly concern their non-manufacturing Traders. they are ""true blue """"Free",55

344,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"And I am very glad I am not like the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook). I look upon myself as a better Australian than the honourable member, who spent the whole of his time in addressing the Committee in slandering Australians; who said that they were not giving a fair day's work for a fair day's pay; who imputed that they were incompetent work",55
345,Mr ROBERT COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Twent y per cent,",55
346,Mr MCGRATH,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"And that they were not able to hold their own with workingmen in other parts of the world. I am surprised that the honourable member should have displayed such disloyalty to his own country. I have faith in Australia. We have great opportunities be-„ have the means to produce and almost everything we require. Yet we hear the honourable member for Indi, and others like him, decrying the Australian workman, talking about the go-slow policy, and direct action, and Bolshevists. Well-known English firms, such as Cadbury's, come out here and establish their factories. Would they do so if they believed that our workmen were of the type indicated by the honourable member for Indi ? The time is not far distant when Australia will not only be manufacturing all her own requirements of woollens, but will be exporting them to various parts of the world. It is with that in mind that I intend to support the Government's proposals.",55
347,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Wakefield) [8.55] - I intend to vote in support of the proposals of the Minister (Mr. Greene). The Tariff is, in effect, the Tariff introduced-so far as the matter of preference to the United Kingdom is concerned-in 1914. On the basis of the Tariff as it exists today, Australia is likely to be benefited by the establishment of branch factories of well-known British firms. One reason why I intend to vote as I have indicated is because I believe that the most effective method by which we can secure reasonable prices for the consumer is by competition-that competition being participated in by some of the most efficient firms in the world. I give my support to the Minister's proposals, .also, because the Committee has been assured of the intention of the Government to prevent exploitation by manufacturers, so far as may be humanly possible.",56
348,Mr BOWDEN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,As far as may be constitutionally possible.,56
349,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I thank the honourable member. That is so. believe in being fair all round. Some honourable members opposite have referred to the Commonwealth mills, and to the wonderful way in which they can produce remarkably cheap materials. All I wish to know is, why did they not do so during the war?",56
350,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They did.,56
351,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"They inaugurated a flat rate, and the other mills had no say; they had to accept or reject that rate. It has been asserted that in three years some of the Australian mills wiped out the whole of their capital costs. That meant, in certain instances, at least, the making f profits as high as 33 0 per cent. And, if that was so, the Commonwealth mill also made a profit of 33 per cent. If there was any profiteering at all, it was shared in by the Commonwealth establishment. I am not complaining of the profits made by the private mills., because they did not fix the prices; and, going back over a period of years, it must be .admitted that those mills did not make undue profits.",56
352,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The Government fixed a flat rate only in respect of military mate'rials, but Australian manufacturers could sell other than those for whatever prices they liked.",56
353,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"A flat rate was fixed for military materials, and, in order to meet the demands upon the mills, those establishments worked three shifts.",56

355,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Very little was made for the civilian members of the community, because the Government commandeered the mills to the tune of three shifts per day for a considerable period. If these mills did so well that they could wipe out their capital cost in three years, which they otherwise could not have done in thirty years, it is time a reduction in price was made.",56
356,Sir ROBERT BEST,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It is more like nine than three years.,56
357,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Some did it in three years, and the honourable member knows it. If these mills were able to defray their capital cost in such a short period, surely they are in a better position to extend their operations than they have ever been before.  I cent, protection?",56
358,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"There is the other side of the question, and on this point I am sure the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) will support me. Since 1914 the overhead costs of these industries have increased by '60 per cent., and taking that into consideration with the other points I have mentioned concerning the assurance that big British companies are likely to establish mills in Australia it would be indiscreet and altogether unwise to amend these rates. In view of the altered conditions we should be obtaining material from Australian mills at a lower rate than we are. There has been very little reduction in the price of tweeds, flannels, and blankets unless it bas taken place within the last few days.",56
359,Mr EILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Woo l has dropped in price.,57
360,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Yes , especially blanket wool, and not only are we not getting a cheaper article, but the supply of blankets and flannels, particularly is altogether inadequate. What is the reason?",57
361,Mr GABB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Because they are not working three shifts for.the public.,57
362,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It is not that. Many of the operatives will not work on Saturday.,57
363,Mr JAMES PAGE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Tell that to old women and not to us.,57
364,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I am tellm ing what I know to be a fact. Many are not working on Saturday because they earn sufficient in five days to keep them going.,57
365,Mr RILEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That does not apply to factories; they work on Saturdays.,57
366,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It applies to Lobethal, in South Australia, where they have difficulty in getting many of the operatives to work at all on Saturdays.",57
367,Mr JAMES PAGE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Where are the men and women who worked three shifts?,57
368,Mr GABB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,They never worked three shifts per day at Lobethal.,57
369,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I did not say they did; I was referring generally to mills on war work, but the manager at Lobethal informed me that the employees would not work on Saturdays. It should he the policy of woollen mill proprietors to come as near as possible to the consumers in the matter cf distribution, and if honourable members are anxious to see the cost of living reduced they should do something in that direction. . Mr ANSTEY - Why not cut out wages?",57
370,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The mills should come as near as possible to the ccnsumers by re-arranging their methods of distribution. The honourable member for Kooyong said it was a difficult matter, and would be altogether too costly for individual mills to deal with retailers. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), who cannot see beyond the boundaries of Geelong, holds a similar opinion. I forget the figure he mentioned, but I know it was extortionate.",57
371,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,It was 12s. a yard.,57
372,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,That is nonsense.,57
373,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I know that the cost of manufacturing certain cloths is 12s. a yard, and that the material is sold today at from 25s. to 27s. per yard.",57
374,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Does that apply to Geelong?,57
375,Mr LISTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,To mills generally.,57
376,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"If it applies to Geelong the mills there need tuning up. Let me inform the honor that if the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent, will be the means of British manufacturing industries becoming established in Australia, and our people receiving cheaper woollen goods, the dut y is more than justified. In the matter of distribution I may inform honourable members that the Lobethal mills in South Australia have never sold their .goods to the wholesale houses, but have gone to the distributors in every part of the State. Perhaps it would interest the honourable member for Corio to know that this factory has not only distributed its goods in South Australia, but its representatives have come over the border into Victoria, and sold their product in competition with goods manufactured in Geelong, notwithstanding that the honourable member says that the Geelong factories cannot afford to meet the cost of distribution. If the Lobethal mills can afford to distribute their product others can. With additional mills established in different parts of the Commonwealth production and competition will increase, and the natural result will b-i that woollen goods will be sold to the consumer at a lower rate.",57
377,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Bourke) [9.9] - I intend to oppose the amendment for a reduction in the rate, and to support one for an increase in the duties proposed by the Minister for Trad© and Customs (Mr Greene). I am going to oppose the amendment for the reasons put forward by the Free Trade member for Swan  proposed rate submitted by the Protectionist gentleman who now occupies the position of Minister for Trade and Customs. I have already given my reasons for supporting the highest Tariff that may be submitted to enable our raw material to be worked up in Australia instead of being sent to other countries for that purpose. From the beginning of this discussion I have not heard any Labour party. stronger reasons furuished for the imtells position of a high Tariff than those subor mitted by honourable members who are opposed to high duties. I desire industries established in the Commonhonorable wealth, not in the interests of the capitalist or the workmen, but in interests of the country generally, not necessarily under a capitalistic regime. I want to see a self-sustained country with manufacturing industries which will furnisli us with a large variety of occupations capable of keeping men fit, so that they will always be in a tion to defend our country.

Even in that State, under the system changed from that which we have to that which we desire, the woollen industry will still be neceshad sary. It will be as absolutely essential cent. to the Bolshevistic State as it is to the capitalistic State. The Red armies of tomorrow will need to be supplied with clothes, and, therefore, I support it. have heard the honourable member for vious Tariff. Indi (Mr Robert Cook) and the honourable member for Wakefield Richard. Foster) talk of the scandalous conduct of the workmen of this country who will not work. They go so slow that their employers are dying of starvation. I listened again to the arguments put forward by the honourable member  in this industry people put in 10s. and draw out f l . He told us that people who started in the industry have, out of their profits, doubled and trebled their Mr Anstey. capital in two or three years. This was in a particular State where half the country and two-thirds of the population are under - the domination of the odious One honourable member us that the workmen will not work, work so slowly that the bosses cannot make any money, and he is answered by to see the honourable member for Swan. The member for Wakefield tella the Committee that the slower the workthe men work the more profits the bosses but make. What an absurdity! Then there is another coantry, England. The honourable member for Wakefield believes in the establishment qf industries in this country and in a Tariff of 40 or 45 per cent, against Jap, Jew, and Gentile, but, posiapparently, he desires competition from What can it not matter to Australia from which country A products come that enter into comwith locally-manufactured goods? our porta and our markets this are flooded with products from overparaseas, how can we be good Australians if on the one hand we say that we must the products of Australia and on the other we wave the flag and say that this it does not matter what goods are brought here from a particular part of iSo far as the exclusion of products from outside is concerned, we have as much right to exclude them if and coming from one country as from another.

379,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No ; we are not coming down. The Tariff now proposed I is higher, and not lower, than the preMT. GREENE - The previous Tariff (Mr was 25 per cent.",58
380,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Eve n with that Tariff in this country, where nobody works, bosses made millions of profits;. There are other countries where the people work, we are told, from early morn to late at night. We read i h the newspapers that the cotton-spinners and weavers of England are accepting a 40 per cent, reduction in wages. Workman after workman, and organization after organization, are accepting reductions' in wages, in order to get a chance in the markets of the world. This is in a country where there is little or no competition between the "" Micks"" and the Methodists, an actual paradise where every one is loyal to the Government. Yet, according to the Minister for Trade and Customs, capitalists are leaving this paradise and coming to - this country where no one works, where some men are earning 8s. a day for shovelling 2 tons of sulphur in. a week, and where we are told that men are getting £17 a week to play poker in a boiler, where men on the wharfs are earning £ 2 per day, and the bricklayers, who previously laid 2,000 bricks a. day, now lay nothing. I can tell the honourable member for Swan, who has told us this story, that under the Tariff it is apparent that we are getting the finest class of immigrants we could get.  the honourable member?",58
381,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I do not know how the honourable member made it out, but I sat here and listened to his story that capitalists in the woollen industry put a certain amount of capital into it and drew it out over, and over again in profits in something like two or three years.  that .at all ",59
382,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Well , I have not been outside the chamber, I have not been downstairs or upstairs. I have a distinct recollection of hearing such a - statement, and I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the honourable member for Swan did not tell the Committee that enormous profits were made by certain people who engaged in the manufacture of woollens.",59
383,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I . say, frankly, that I cannot remember.",59
384,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Does the honourable member withdraw?,59
385,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"No , I do not. The Minister is so dependent on votes from the Country party's corner that he dare not controvert anything said by honourable members of that party. I distinctly remember that the Minister this afternoon answered arguments, which now, apparently, were never used. Did not the honourable gentleman explain the circumstances in which men in certain industries made profits?",59
386,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I was answering the honourable member for Dampier.,59
387,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) aTe birds from the same nest, and we need not argue which of them told the story to which I have referred.",59
388,Mr GBEGOBT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member had better apologize to the honourable member for Swan.,59
389,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I apologize to the honourable member for Swan and heap my deadly insults on the honourable member for Dampier. Here we have a Tariff that is furnishing us with the most desirable class of immigrants-. It is no longer necessary for us to have a forced system of immigration. We need no longer spend scores of thousands of pounds and send immigration agents abroad to various countries of the world to bring workmen to this country when we discover that the imposition of - a .40 peT cent. Tariff will bring out, great capitalists from England to engage in our industries. If we put on another 20 per eent. we shall bring capitalists from all parts of the world to enjoy the results pointed out by the honourable member for Swan. ",59
390,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am wrong; I refer to the honourable member for Dampier. The honourable memher wants to reduce the duty. He would cut down the enormous profits made for the bosses in this paradise by. workmen who do very little work; where we are cursed with all sorts of obnoxious doctrines, with conflicts of various sects, where men will not work, OT play poker in a boiler, or shovel 2 tons of sulphur a week for 8s. a day, and go' to the factory only five days in the week, and work only one out of the five, and where the less the workmen do the greater the profits of the bosses. Why should honprable members furnish such arguments as these? A Tariff, to be worth anything at all, should be such as will maintain the industries of the country. According 'to some of our honourable friends opposite, there is no"" country where working men work fewer hours per day, do less work, and get more pay than they do in Australia. There is no other country in which capitalists engaged in industry are making greater profits, and there is no country in the world to which capitalists are more anxious to come than, this Australia of ours, where, according to the arguments we have just heard, no man ever works. Surely that is a strong argument in favour of a Protectionist Tariff. The honourable member for Dampier says that he is a Protectionist-that he wants a Tariff that will keep out importations from every coun,try except Great Britain. He desires, however, that imports from Great Britain should be allowed to come in free. I do not want to see imports coming in from any country. The fundamental policy of our people should be to make Australia self-contained so far as her industries concerned. I care not by what methods we secure it , or under what system we live-that should be our fundamental gospel.",59
391,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Will the honourable member tell us in what' way these .Protecthey tive duties have improved the conditions of the workers of Australia?,60
392,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable ber puts that question to me despite the fact that he himself has furnished a clear and distinct argument in support of the contention that a Protective Tariff benefits the people of the country. The honorsence able member says that in all other counsible tries the workers receive low wages work long hours, whereas in this counduction try they receive enormous wages, and no work.",60
393,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I did not say that.,60
394,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Then the honourable member differs from some of Eis conalargely freres. The honourable member for Indi establishments. (Mr Robert Cook) has put forward that turer in this city-no view, and the Assistant Minister for Destituency-wh o could not fence (Sir Granville Ryrie) endorses it . the wholesale houses to handle The honourable member for Dampier duct. In his predicament he went spasmodically adopts different views. man There have been a number of manufacyou turers about the precincts of this chamstreet ber who look at the Tariff from the point of view of their own interest.. I do not placed object to any one coming into the lobbies sale houseshe and trying Io convince me that a certain any view is right, especially if they come fuse more to along with the right sort of argument. Manufacturers have furnished many reathat sons why there should be a higher Tariff and to protect the industries . in which they part ofisthe are interested. The views of some of our nationalTariff. these - gentlemen have been expressed by storage for the output the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Lister). He has told us that woollen manufacturers in this country can pay high wages to workmen who will not work-d o not forget that they do not work; they simply look on whilst machines do the work for them-and that they can make good profits by turning out cloth which they sell for 8s., 10s., or 12s. per yard, as the case may be. The general public, however, do not get that cloth for 8s., or 10s., or 12s. a yard. What they have to pay is something like three times the price charged for the cloth at the factory. The people who make the most profits out of the products of our factories are not the manufacturers, who put their brains and their money into their enterprises, nor the workmen emare ployed in those factories, but warehousemen, who do not employ one labourer or invest one penny in the process of manufacturing goods, but simply draw into their warehouses the products of various factories, and sell them over the counter loaded with the blackmail which levy on the general community.",60
395,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Is not the manufacmemturer to blame? When he is given special protection; should he not see that the consumers, in turn, get some benefit?",60
396,Mr ANSTEY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Yes . But in the abof massed production it is imposfor many of our manufacturers to and sell direct to the people. Massed proi n a country like this is of the do greatest importance. Where you have a lot of little industries growing under the influence of the Tariff, the men conducting those industries and possessing only small capital find themselves very at the mercy of the' wholesale i I know of a manufact in my own coninduce any of his proto a in Smith-street, and said, "" Will try to place my goods ?"" The Smithbusiness man agreed to do so, and them all over Australia. No sooner had done so than the big wholetold him that if he put out of those goods they would resupply him with other materials he required. He was blackmailed, could do nothing. That state of affairs not due to any failure on the policy It should be part of to provide common of our factories as a protection, against the Flinders-lane people and that class of retailers who charge the people three times the factory cost of the goods they sell. The honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) recently brought into this building samples of ladies' stockings made in Australia. The employees in the factory receive good wages, and the proprietor is able to get a fair return on his capital by selling these stockings at 12s. per dozen. That is the factory cost, but the people have to pay four times that price for them. The factory cost is doubled, in some cases it is trebled, by the wholesale houses, and then the retailer has to get his profit. I am quite prepared to admit that, given a monopolistic industry, you get exploitation, but the exploitation of the people of Australia is carried out for the most part by ' men who do not put a penny into manufacturing enterprises. It will be necessary for the Government to take other action to protect the people in that respect. Despite the high wages paid, the alleged indifference of our workmen, and the fact that we are told that they work only a few hours per day, the actual costs of the output of our factories are as low as costs in any ether country. What we have toprotect ourselves against is not the cost of the products as sold at our factories, but the exploitation which the people are subjected after the goods leave the factories. The argument raised by those who are opposed to the Minister's proposal, and also raised by the Minister himself, affords me an opportunity to show what this country can do, and to state once more that I am prepared to support the Minister or anybody who raises the Tariff one step higher, not for the benefit of any in dividual, be he the investor of capital or the man who labours, but fundamentally with the object of establishing industries. Under any and every method, I support the establishment of industries which can be better carried on here than in any other country in the world. Mr i m NGSTON (Barker) [9.30] I regard the woollen industry as one of the most important in this country. It is well known that Australia produces not only the finest class of wool in the world, but also the best class of workmen. We are an educated people, SO per cent, of whom are able to have accounts in Savings Banks or other banks. The foundation of this industry is the grower of wool, and then comes the shearer. We know that every shearer is paid according to the result of his labour, as I believe every man in every industry should he paid. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) has told us that few working men, when they die, leave any estate subject to probate duties; but I can in f o rm that honourable member that in my district many of the landholders started as shearers. They have achieved their present position because they bave always been allowed to do their best as good men; and this shows that every man should be paid according to the results of his labour. I should like txf see the woollen industry so established as to make every man employed in it a shareholder in the business and i h the profits, for this provides the strongest incentive for him to give of his best. In Australia today the great mistake is made of always starting new in dustries in the big cities. Why should not the manufacture of wool be conducted in our big wool centres, where there is water running to waste, and every facility for successful operations? All that, is required is to take the workmen there, and house them at cheap rents. to When Mr Smail came to Australia to select the best sites for woollen mills, he traversed the whole of the country, including the south-eastern portion of South Australia, which he described as the best place in the world for the purpose. In that part of Australia there is the necessary water, wood, wool, and so for t h ; but Mr Smail pointed out that there were no conveniences for working - men, including cottages and schools. This had to be admitted; but I pointed out to Mr Smail that in South Australia we had the most beautiful stone to be found in any part of the Empire, and that we can build more cheaply there than elsewhere. It would be easy, I said, to remove the workmen to the mill 5 in the country, and provide schools and other conveniences. However, the tendency is to take all industries into the big cities; and under any immigration policy we may adopt, we must endeavour to get the people, on to the land in the country, for unless this is done Australia can never progress. We require the establishment of many industries, but we cannot hope for them if an educated people is ground down without a proper share of the proceeds of the work they do. What is required is a system something like that adopted at the Sunlight soap works and Cadbury's cocoa factories in England. If the workers in England can be given a share in the profits, why not in Australia? We'all know that the men who are the best paid do the best work. The honourable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) submitted that the manufacturers of wool should be the distributors.",60
397,Mr LISTEE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I did not say that.,62
398,Mr LIVINGSTON,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"When the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) said that that was what the honourable member had contended, the latter offered no contradiction. We all know that it is impossible for manufacturers to do the distributing work; there must be distributors as well as manufacturers, as there have been from time immemorial. I do not believe in low wages, because, in my opinion, our Australian workmen are capable of earning every shilling they receive, and more. As to the proposed duty on onions, if there is a country in the world that can grow this commodity it is Australia, especially in the Western District of toria and the south-east of South Australia. Onions and potatoes are today £3 per ton, and living in.Australia is cheaper than in any other country. We have every necessary of life here, and all that is wanted is proper distribution. So far as food is concerned, there is the greatest trouble in the matter of distribution ; but I hope that before long we shall have cheap woollen goods, for, goodness kuows, clothing and blankets are very badly required at the present time.",62
399,Mr GABB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Angas) [9.36] - It is my intention to oppose the amendment for reduction of duty, and to support the schedule. I understand that one honourable member on - this ' side intends to move for even a higher duty than that proposed by the Minister; but if such an amendment is submitted, I shall oppose it. While a Protectionist, I recognise the truth of the statement made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt), who said that if we go in "" red hot"" for Protection, the pendulum will, in due course, swing back. With that point of view I agree, and I shall oppose any proposed increase which I think gives undue Protection to any > particular item. However, my purpose in rising was not tb state my attitude in regard to items, but to answer a statement made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), who, in a somewhat similar spirit to that displayed by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook), complains that the workers do not seem prepared to do a fair thing.",62
400,Mr ROBERT COOK,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,I said some of them do not.,62
401,Mr GABB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member foiWakefield also had a complaint against the woollen mills because the demand for blankets and flannels is not being met. When he said that, I interjected, ""Why cannot they work three shifts?"" meaning the mills, and the honourable member replied, ""They will not work even one shift,"" meaning the workers. Then the honourable member went on to' refer to the Lobethal Mills. We have done some curious things in South Australia in regard to changing names under the influence of that pseudo-patriotism so much abroad, and the place that was called VicLobethal is now known as Tweedvale. This is in my electorate, and I know the class of people engaged at the woollen mills. They are an industrious country community, affording an example of what honourable members in the Government corner describe as the decentralization of industries. If I am not mistaken, the mills were established in that district because of the known industrial habits of the people, settlers of German origin, and I resent the accusation by the honourable member for Wakefield that they are lazy.",62
402,Mr BOWDEN,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Do they work on a Saturday ?,62
403,Mr GABB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I cannot say; but if they do not, that innovation must be of recent date. If my memory serves me right, during the war that mill was never worked three shifts, and when I interjected that three shifts might be worked now, I had in mind the fact that if in. war ""time the mills in near metropolitan areas were worked three shifts under pressure for the military authorities to supply military needs, the same mills might now work three shifts to - meet the keen demand for blankets and flannels for civilian purposes mentioned by the honourable member for Wakefield. I am satisfied that employees axe available to work the metropolitan mills three shifts, if the"" owners want to do so; but probably the present high prices suit the managers and shareholders, and they are not keen on bringing down the cost too rapidly. A prominent member of the Senate said the other night that wool f OT blankets was recently sold to the manufacturer as low as ^d. per lb., and that the average price was about 3d. I am prepared to accept his statement, because he is intimately associated with the woollen industry, and is, probably,, one of the most prominent woollen experts in Australia. Certainly he is not a Labour man, and therefore, it. cannot be said he would make any statement against the mill-owners unless the position was as he stated. It is up to the woollen manufacturers of this country, if there is an extra demand for blankets and flannel, to try and meet it. I believe in Protection to help our manufacturers to establish industries, but I also want fair treatment for the employees and the consuming public. I hope the schedule will stand, because I am confident that if there is one business in which we can hold our own with the rest of the world, it is the production of woollen goods, provided we give our manufacturers sufficient protection to enable them to become well established.  honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) made some reference a few minutes ago to two Combines that were co-operating in connection with this item. The exact language used by him does not concern me very much, though it seems to have perturbed some honourable members. Reference has also been made to a statement of mine. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) says he is glad that he does not belong to the Corner party. I am sure that we do not envy him his position. He made it clear that he was quite satisfied that the Tariff increased the cost of living, and he is so consistent that he is going to vote for increased duties on these items. honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Poster), to my mind, was just as inconsistent. 'He recognised that if efficiency were insured under a reasonably competitive system, there 'would be no need for this 30 per cent. Tariff, but because other manufacturers propose to come to Australia to join in the Combine to exploit the people of Australia,. he is going to vote for the increases. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) is prepared to defend the working man, whether right or wrong, and he pointed out that the warehousemen are exploiting the people. But what does the warehouseman exploit the people out of? Do not honourable members see clearly that there is a defectiveness within Australia? And is an increased Tariff to remedy this state of affairs. Are we going to continue covering up our incompetence by increasing the Tariff indefinitely? The manager of the Bureau of Commerce knows that, whenever he is prepared to go on with his woollen mill scheme, he can have £1,000 of my capital to help the project; but I still will argue that 25 per cent, duty, together with the other loaded charges in our favour as against manufacturers at the other end of the world, is ample. Honourable members cannot raise, the blacklabbur question in regard to this industry, as they have done in regard to other industries - Our competitors employ white labour^ paid at the same rate .of wages as our own workmen. As a matter of fact, their coal is dearer, and their facilities generally are not so good as in Australia. In these circumstances, - I cannot see why, by asking for increased duties, we should declare our inefficiency. The mere fact that honourable members opposite are asking for such high protection is an admission of. inefficiency. The honourable member for Bourke drew attention to certain figures which I submitted two or three days ago in connection with this item, but I may point out that I was not then referring to companies. I mentioned that the Commonwealth Government, under the War Precautions Act, had commandeered twenty-two of the mills already in existence in Australia, with a capital of £1,144,000, and operated them for two years and four months at a profit of £1,177,000, thus making it possible witihin that period, to pay off the whole of the capital cost, and have £63,000 to the The good. These are. the industries for which increased protection is now asked. It might be said that they were operated under exceptional circumstances; but they did not work-longer than eight hours a Shift. This Shows clearly that woollen manufacture is a natural secondary industry to Australia. It is a libel to say that members of the Corner' party are Pree Traders. If it can be shown that any industry honestly needs protection, we are prepared to concede it. We are ready to consider this question of Tariff duties from all stand-points. There are other industries to be considered, and we want honourable members to apply to them the same line of argument as they would use for their own pet industries. In the interest of Australia. I hope that they will do so.",62
404,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Werriwa) [9.51] I am opposed to any reduction in these duties.,64
405,Mr WIENHOLT,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Will you support an increase ?,64
406,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"-One at a time is ' said to be good fishing. When the proposal for an increase is before the Committee it will be time to state my position in that regard. Honourable members who ask for a reduction of the duty on woollen goods argue that the local manufacturers do not require the protection given and ought to be able to compete with outside goods on a smaller duty, but they lose sight of the fact that the question of the high cost of living or high price of commodities is not solved by the adoption of either a Free Trade or a Protective policy. If we develop our industries by imposing a high Tariff we are justified in doing it , so long as we take steps to prevent the local manufacturer from fleecing the people by making excessive profits, but I repudiate the suggestion of the honourable member for  bers of the Labour party are looking to Protection to solve the question of the high cost of living. Whether we adopt a policy of Protection or Free Trade we shall always have control of prices by Combines either inside or outside Australia. The honourable members for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and Swan (Mr. Prowse) have spoken of the overhead charges of sending our raw material away and bringing it back again in the manufactured state; and^ it is a disgrace to think that our primary productswools, metals, and other lines-hav e to go abroad and be brought back as finished articles.  member imagine that the Australian consumer will get his clothes cheaper by the increasdd duty? « ' Mr Lazzarini - The Labour party will see that he gets his clothes at a reasonable rate.  able member prepared to give the woollen mills conditions under which they will he allowed to exploit us further?",64
407,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am not prepared to do so. If the honourable member and others had followed our advice nine - months ago when we put forward certain suggestions the manufacturers would not be doing this. I have had a long experience in the retail trade, and I know that the Combines and Trusts that bind the retailers most effectively are the importing firms. Of course, we Tealize that these Combines are but the natural development of the growth of commercialism, but nevertheless we must deal with them. The honourable member for Swan has claimed that the manufacture of woollen goods is a natural secondary industry for Australia. He is quite right, and I shall give my support to a duty which will afford it some protection. If a still higher duty is proposed I shall give the matter consideration when the time comes to do so.",64
408,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Barrier) [9.55] - I have listened to the debate on this particular item of the Tariff with a good deal of interest. It has been rather amusing to listen to the arguments put forward on both sides, in the main justifying the itmn in the schedule or an increase in the duty. One honourable member sitting in the corner has denied the allegation that his party is a Free Trade party. It appears to me, after listening to the debate, that there is not a Free Trader in the House.",64
409,Mr HILL,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,Excep t the honourable member.,64
410,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"I am not a Free Trader, nor am I a Protectionist. It seems to me that honourable members want protective duties on the goods they have to sell, and a reduced Tariff or none at all on the commodities or articles they wish to purchase or use.  items whioh the farmers sell that can be protected by ordinary methods.",64
411,Mr CONSTDINE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"The honourable member's party has been very loud in demanding Protection for primary products, and in asking for Pree Trade on agricultural machinery and other items. Other honourable members urge that the present Tariff should be maintained, or that the duties should be higher still. We are treated to the statement that the Australian worker works a jolly sight harder than do workers elsewhere. It is a very dubious compliment from my point of view to hear it said that the Australian engaged in any iudustry can produce more profit foi"" the employing class than do his fellows in other countries. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) takes up the same attitude as myself when he says that it is a case of tweedledum and tweedledee to the working classes, having regard to the conditions under which they are living at present whether they have Protection or Free Trade. That being the case, why should the representatives of the working class support either policy? I think it was Sir George Eeid who labelled the Labour party as "" fiscal atheists "" because they supported either Free Traders or Protectionists so long as their own programme was carried out. I do not agree with the stand-point taken up by .the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey),, but the reason he advanced for representatives of the working classes supporting a Protective Tariff was to my mind the most logical. He said that it would help to develop the country industrially by causing fresh industries to be established, which in time the workers might take over and utilize in their own interests, instead of helping their political and economic enemies to increase their opportunities of exploiting the great masses of the people. My duty, as a representative of the workers, is not to take sides in matters that are tihe exclusive concern of the two divisions of the exploitindustry? ing elements, the importers and manufacturers. If our contention is correct, that the workers, as a class, are exploited in the factories, mines, and workshops, that the fiscal issue is only a question of a high Tariff and high wages or Free Trade and low wages, and that the worker receives, on the average, only sufficient to keep him and his family, irrespective of whether the Protectionist or the Free Trader rules, my duty, as a working-class representative, is not to take sides with either section of the exploiters, but to say, "" Gentlemen, settle it in your own way,"" and to point out to the workers that it is their duty to organize themselves with a view to altering the economic system, eliminate profit making, and utilize the machinery of wealth production in their own interests. In this way they will put an end to these controversies that mean nothing to them.",65
412,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Dampier) [10.2] I have moved a reduction of the duty on woollen goods imported from the United Kingdom, and not one argument has been advanced to show that the duty proposed in the schedule is necessary for the carrying on of woollen manufacture in Australia. The last duty imposed by this Parliament on woollens was 25 per cent., which I ask shall be continued.",65
413,Mr GABB,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,The honourable member has not adduced any argument to prove that the additional duty is not necessary.,65
414,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It has been shown that the manufacturers have made enormous profits, that during the war they did riot care a straw for the interests of the people, and that flannels and blankets are almost unobtainable in Australia today. I am asking for a little concession to the Old Country. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Poster) said that he would support a 30 per cent, duty because of a statement made by the Minister (Mr Greene) regarding the pro-' bability of large firms in England establishing woollen factories in the Commonwealth. In 1891 the Victorian Parliament, which was strongly Protectionist, imposed a 30 per cent, duty on woollens at the instance of the then Minister for Customs (Sir Robert Best). Can 'anybody say that that high duty was beneficial either to Victoria or to the woollen I am satisfied that it was not. When one compares the Tariff of that period and the destitution prevalent in Victoria at about thab time, with the great progress made in New South Wales under a more rational policy, he is justified in assuming that heavy protective duties were not good for Victoria, and will not be good for Australia during the next few yeaTS. Not long after the passing of the MCKinley Tariff in America, Congress went to the country, and the party responsible for the high duties was ignominiously defeated. I am satisfied that the same result will follow the imposition of this Tariff in Australia. I commend to the attention of honourable members the article on "" Imperial Protection"" by M. C. Coates, at page 20, in the book which the Minister has provided for the use of members, and which has been prepared by one who seems to be making a living out of high Protection. If honourable members realized the sacrifices made by the Old Country they would feel that it was their duty to give a little extra preference to our kinsmen overseas. If my amendment is defeated I shall move a further amendment to provide for a reduction of the duty a few years hence. I have always had the impression that these protective duties are needed for only a certain period, and I shall take further action accordingly.

416,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"It might be a senBible thing to do that. My reason for moving the amendment is that, after the late war, as after all wars, the commercial world is in a disturbed condition, and I am fearful of what may take place. I wish Australia to be prepared to meet eventualities; and, in my opinion, if we give this protection, we shall have outside manufacturers coming here to establish industries instead of . confining their operations to Great Britain and other countries.

417,Mr GREGORY,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Dampier) [10.16] - I suggested to the Minister the other day that leather cloth, which in ' the 1914, Tariff is included in item 105A, should beplaced again in that position, instead of in item 105H. I ask the Minister if he has considered the suggestion?",66
418,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL EXPORT AND LOCAL,"Richmond-Minister 8 for Trade and Customs) [10.17] - I have 31 considered it, and have decided that in all the circumstances the article should be dutiable at the rates provided in item 23 105H. A small duty is imposed on it, as AYES. it is an article which comes into direct competition with Australian leather. I move That the item be amended by adding the following words:-""i . Piece goods dutiable at a higher rate than that payable under this subitem, imported for the manufacture of waterproofed piece goods, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, on and after 26th May, 1921, ad val., British, 10; intermediate, 20; general, 25 per cent."" Honourable members will see that waterproofed cloth prepared with rubber, oil, and so on is dutiable at certain rates. It happens that a very light woollen material, which is not manufactured in this country, is used for waterproofing, and under the item as it stands is dutiable at 30, 40, and 45 per cent., the same rates being applicable to waterproofed cloth under subitem H , that is, the raw material for waterproofing is dutiable at the same rates as the finished article. What I now seek to provide is, subject to departmental by-law*, that if place goods coine in higher rat© than these, they are to be oharged at the rate in the. new sub-item, that is to say, we allow manufacturers waterproofing to get the raw material a lower rate of duty than iB oharged vaterproof. They .have the benefit of difference between the rates on watergoing proof material, namely, 30, 40, and 48 per propose it. oent., and those now proposed.
