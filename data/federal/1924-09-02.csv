BRUCE - On . the 22nd August,, 7 the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), brought under comnotice the case of a settler who, on his what discharge from the Darwin Hospital, after a long period of treatment, was presented witli a hospital account for £85, - one for £38 6s., being the doctor's fee for operations performed at the hospital. I am now in a position to inform the dehonorable member that the agreement by the Northern Territory Administration with the Government Medical Officer, wbo bas the right of private practice, provides that all hospital patients shall be treated free of charge by the medical officer, except for major operations and maternity cases. The agreement also provides. that fees charged to patients generally shall not exceed the fees usually charged in rural districts in . states of the Commonwealth. The only account presented by the hospital authorities in the case referred to was for £85, representing the usual hosAct pital fee of 5s. per day for 340 days, and no pressure has been exerted to secure the numbers payment of that amount. The doctor's charge of £38 6s. was for the . two operations performed at the hospital, to and, being within the exception referred to, the Administration cannot prevent sucb a private charge being made, but is in no way associated with its collection. CREAM SEPARATORS. IMPOSITION or ANTI-DUMPING DUTY.  the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) asked the following question : 1.

Duty .. to which is added extra dumping duty £10 12s. 6d-? 2. Seeing that no cream separator has been made in Australia, will the Minister remit this imposition to the dairy fanner? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following informaTariff tion :The matter has been fully considered, and has been decided to revoke the gazettal German cream separators under the Industries Preservation Act. The dumping duty paid in the case referred to will be refunded."" PENSIONS OF SOLDIERS ' DEPENDANTS.",14
24,Dr EARLE PAGE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"On the 1st August the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) asked the following quesclassification tion :Whether the Repatriation Department New South Wales is giving applicants for sion the full benefit of section 22 (d) of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1920, i.e., recognizing "" wholly or in part dependent, activities. &c."" ? I have now been informed that the patriation Department in New South Wales is giving applicants the full of the section referred to. Should, howconstituted. ever, the honourable member be of opinion that the benefit is not being given in any particular case, I shall be glad to be f u r nished with details so that investigation may be made. The following papers were presented:Excise Act-Regulation s amended-Statutor y Rules 1924, No. 117. Northern Territory Acceptance Act and Northern Territory' (Administration) Act. Ordinance of 1924-No . 17-Licensin g TARIFF BOARD BILL . SECOND READING.  Trade and Customs) [ 3 . 1 9 ] - I move That the bill bo now read a second time. In moving the second reading of this bill I wisb to explain in detail the administration of the Department of Trade and Customs, particularly in respect of the Tariff Board, and to reply to some of the criti. - £0 4 0 - cisms of that board that have not only been beard in this House, but bave also . . 2 5 0 appeared in the press and been indulged 1 0 G in by the commercial community. The Tariff Board consists of a chairman who £12 9 6 must be an administrative officer of the of Department of Trade and Customs, and three members who have been chosen ever from the industrial and commercial world. It is purely an advisory body. It s functions are to investigate and report to the Minister on matters defined in the Board Act, the Customs Tariff, and the Industries Preservation Act, all of it which measures deal with matters vital to of the industrial life of Australia, and cover applications for new or altered duties, or bounties, and requests for exemption from duties under the* tariff items in regard to which Parliament has empowered the Minister to give exemptions, proposals for reciprocal treaty agreements, appeals from decisions made by the Comptroller-General in regard to the of goods under the tariff, complaints that manufacturers are taking in uudue advantage of tariff protection to pencharge excessive prices, the operation of deferred duties, and other phases of tariff The investigation of these matters involves an immense amount of Rework which could not possibly be performed by the Minister and the ordinary benefit Customs administration as. at present An essential condition of tariff investigation is' that the authority entrusted with it should be able to make its investigations in the various states. If that authority were fixed in one centre it would be practically impossible for it to obtain reliable information concernPAPEES. ing industries in the other states, with the result that the claims of distant industries would be inadequately represented or else those concerned would suffer great expense and inconvenience through' being obliged to make long journeys to the Seat of Government to present their case. If all tariff investigations were again imposed on the ordinary administration of the Customs Department, it is obvious that they would have to be mainly conducted in one centre with the unsatisfactory results I have mentioned.. The Tariff Board has been able to make periodical visits to the other states and has, in the course of its investigations, visited all the states and has inspected all the more important in dustrial establishments of the Commonwealth. The business people throughout Australia have therefore been able, personally, to place their views before the board not only on matters of tariff revision, but also on all those complicated matters which fall within the scope of its functions. For some unaccountable reason, a tradition has grown up during the last year or two that the Tariff Board abrogates the power of the Minister, and even of Parliament. It has even beeu said that its proceedings, from its inception, have been a gross usurpation of one of the most important functions of Parliament.",15
25,Mr GABB,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"That has been said in this chamber a number of times.  criticism. So far as my knowledge of the board is concerned, that charge is quite unwarranted. The reports and recommendations of the board have never had any effect u n t i l ministerial action has been taken to make them effective. The Minister may reject the recommendations of the board, or he may accept them entirely, or with any modification which he thinks f it . Tbis discretionary power was given to him by Parliament, and he 'is solely responsible to Parliament for the manner in which, he uses it . The Government now proposes to amend the act to make the board part and parcel of our tariff administration until otherwise ordered by Parliament. Ever since the tariff introduced by Sir Willia m Lyne in 1907, power has been given by Parliament to the Minister to exempt goods from duty by departmental by-law under certain concession items, particularly items 174, 219 and 404, and also to classify many hundreds, if not thousands, of articles of importation which are not specifically mentioned in the tariff. W it h the rapidly increasing development of our secondary industries, the discretionary administration of these items requires great care. The power should be exercised only after the fullest inquiry, otherwise young and growing in dustries could easily be throttled by the admission free or at low rates of duty of the thousands of articles that should be classified. Honourable members with a wide experience of the trade of the Commonwealth will know that ever since 1907 certain items of the tariff have given the Minister great discretionary power, for the exercise of which he is solely responsible to Parliament. In this respect, the Minister has no more and noi less power today than he has always had, for the by-law list has always been open for review either for withdrawals or additions. The principal consideration which influences decisions is whether goods of the kind imported can or cannot be commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth. Some attempts have been made in this chamber to frame a definition to cover articles which can be commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth. I consider that such articles are those which can be produced here in a reasonable time and in reasonable quantities, of a quality and at a price which makes competition possible with similar articles manufactured abroad and landed dutypaid in Australia. In view of the in effectiveness of some of the existing tariff rates, consideration must, of course, be given to the higher cost of labour and material for the production of the Australian articles as compared with the imported article. It is utterly impracticable to frame a tariff which would name every known article of commerce. It is essential to have some elastic provision to avoid, for instance, charging duty on machinery not made here, but vital to the expansion of production in Australia. Classification can . be, and has been, used under these items to help the establishment of many new industries. In addition to this discretionary power, which is also added to by further items in the tariff wbicb Parliament has said can be administered only in accordance with departmental by-laws approved by the Minister, in 1921 a measure was passed called the Industries Preservation Act.. Tbis act gave great discretionaiy power to the Minister, after investigation, and report by the Tariff Board, in connection with the imposition of super or dumping duties supplementary to the ordinary tariff duties passed by Parlia'ment. The act provides that dumping duties may be imposed to counteract the various methods adopted by oversea exporters to exploit the Australian market, the effect of which would be to exterminate some of our own industries. Under no circumstances can this be permitted. This act, in my opinion, bas proved a sheet anchor for many of our primary 'and secondary industries. result of the war a violent change - itself. occurred in the international situation Prior to the war the 'competition which our industries had to meet was of a uniform and constant nature, comparatively free from sudden fluctuations or abnorown. mal features. The currency of practically all the cotmtries of the world varied very little from war. 'Tariff legislation could, therefore, be of a more permanent nature, and stand for a number of years without the necessity for many alterations. It will be remembered that during war, owing to ,the difficulties .of transport, Australians were very largely .thrown upon - their .own - resources. A considerentirely able expansion of existing industries .and the 'establisbment of very many aiew dustries took (place.

Honourable members will recollect the position that 'then arose. 'Oversea countries, which during the war bad lost their export markets, immediately sougb't to re-estab'Hsh themselves in countries Australia, where money was plentMu'l and little or no risk in trading was. involved. They found 'that, during - their present - tame. absence from onr market, young industries bad sprung up, and bad taken over much of theiT - business. Immediately attempts were made to dump, and destroy local industries, - so that ""the lost and valuthe able trade 'could be regained. A ""further and greater difficulty arose through great depreciation - otf the currencies'of H>hecaimed.auit,,aiid.,a continental countries of Europe. depreciation placed 'tbem in a - position ito ' Parliament. produce - cbeaply, and, further, 'there the outstanding necessity ""for 'atteiiviing mterkets for - exports which must be - sold of appointing the board. to - enable the countries 'that .were making them 'to rehabilitate <themselv.es.

This - was an 'attempt by Parliament to - protect Australian industries against - tihe exceptional competition arising from various forms of dumping. Its mathe dhinery was admittedly intricate, and needdd to be carefully and reasonably administered. But this legislation covered new ground, and it was immediately .apparent that it was essential to inappoint a special board to effectively deal with it. Bearing in mind the wishes the of the commercial community, freely .exParliapressed an past years, the Government decided ,to give business interests full - inrepresentation-.on the board, and, .therefore, at present it consists of three members of the .commercial community .and I am anerely stating an obvious fact wben I say that, .bad it .not been for the 'direct ancl indirect effiect of the provisions .of the Industries Preser'comvation Act, vour industries would Jiave been .submerged by a ifflood ,of icbeap am-' por.tations ifirom oweiisea countries., and we should bave had the sspectacle of indus- tries .ruined, our national development seriously retarded, ancl thousands .of Auslike tralians (Unable to ;find -.employment.

But few of ms then - realized the iamount of work: the proposed board would bave to do, aud the issue in my *mind was whether the work could better be done by a board, or, as previously, by responsible ' departmental officers. The bill ultimately passed both Houses, and became part of Ihe machinery of the Customs Administration for a period of two years. Last year the act was renewed for a further period of one year, the only amendment being that tke membership of .the board wias increased by one. On 1st March urext the present act .expires by effluxion - of time. .In view of the many criticisms .of the Tariff Board-icritdcism s - wbicb, in my opinion, are based on entirely wrong pr-emises-it will - be of interest to (koaiar-aMe members if iLoseiesr 'to the aetion now being - taken in other icoiuntries in 'OOSMiexion with tariff administration.",16
26,Mr ANSTEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Thos e objections now dead.  may not rise again, .and hope that they will aot do so after I ibave made 'tike position clear. As hjmmvMe members ar* aware, the - Uoited tStates of America has bad .for many years - a -.tariff comanissiora, wbicb is a .permanent 'advisory body with functions similar to <tb®Be <<«if the JGommonwealifeh Tariff 'Board. li s administration involves a 'far more COITIplicated system than that under the effective Australian act, which, T am informed, was - favourably commented upon by the commissioners - of the United States of America wben interviewed by Mr . Br-eokes during his trip abroad last year. South Africa bas appointed a similar body, known as the Board .of Trade and Industries - One of the principal duties of that body is to advise 'the Union Government of any action considered necessary or advisable in - order to assist in the maintenance or the development of industries established, or likely - to be established, in the union. Recently the Indian - Fiscal - Commission reported that it wns desirable to establish a policy of protection in India. The Commission's report laid special stress on the necessity for the organization of a thoroughly competent and impartial ^Tariff Board to investigate ithe conditions - of industries in India, and to recommend which ""industries should the protected, and the extent of the protection .that should be ;gis»esn to them. The proposal i o r a competent aaad impartial laa-iff Board was declared to be the iesaenoe - of the Fiscal 'Commission's report. The Dominiok of Canada bas at present a board tof .officials wbicb deals, .to some extent, with tariff matters, but recently the Prime .Minister of Canada - announced that bas .Government intended to submit to .the Parliament - of the Dominion a proposal for .tine - establishment of .a Tariff .Board. In all these countries the boards appointed,, or to be appointed., for the investigation of tariff problems, are, or will be, permanent bodies. I remind honourable mejubeis that as 'far back as .19.03, the Right Hon. J. Chamberlain was responsible i o r the appointment of a Tariff Commission, which sat mnofficially up to .the time of the .recent great"" war. When the war broke out, the great value are of the investigations made by .the Tariff Commission was recognized by .the Britisb Government, .and in connection with the manufacture of munitions, to which .the people of the Mother Country applied themselves with such vigour .'in the early days of .the war, the experience gained proved of ,great benefit. From the viewpoint of defence .alone, .it is very desirable that all the information possible - shall be .available im.connection with Australiau industries. My close acquaintance witli the - work .of the Tariff Board coiwmces me that the ipr«serrt system is working satisfactorily. Previous ito tke appointment <o£ the 'board, when the departmental system of decisions obtaimed, complaints were made iby merchants and others 'that they 'had to refer their appeals to the same officers - who [bad given the decisions. There was a strong feeling in the commercial community that to deal with tariff matters a board should be appointed, upon which business men sbould be represented. It was considered also that the board should be free from administrative duties, and sbould bave its whole time available for the investigation of tariff problems .in the interests of our primary and secondary industries. Tn ""ruilviiuf the work which the board is 'called upon to do, I sbould like to say asja '-n - that it does not in any way abrogate the powers either of the Parliament or of the Minister. advisory board only, and simply recommendations to the Minister. Minister's power remains intact, so long as he refers certain matters contained in the act to the board before taking action. He need not necessarily follow the recommendations of the board, and, in any case, the Minister is the person responsible to the Government and to Parliament. Honourable members are aware that trade and commerce, in regard to both primary and secondary as wejl as to imports, bas increased during the last few years, and that, as a result, classifications commendations under the elastic visions of the tariff, and concerning many and varying must be numerous, and, at times, intricate. The work .entrusted board really covers the whole range of Australian industries, both primary ancl secondary. It involves inquiries into, and reports upon, approximately, quests yearly, many of which are absolutely vital to our industries, seeing that, they depend largely for their existence upon a proper pathetic consideration of the lems by which they are This Parliament supports a policy of protection, developing present and encouraging the initiation of new industries. Tariff classifications and exemptions should be finalized by the responsible Minister in the interests of Australian industries. In addition to this onerous and responsible work, the consideration of tariff duties ing many hundreds of thousands pounds, the Tariff Board has reported on other subjects within its ambit, such as bounties ""and the development of new industries. The proposed amendments cluded in the bill have been framed as the result of the experience of the working of the act over a period of nearly three years, and among tbem are two important provisions. The first is that oil inquiries in connection with the .revision of the tariff and proposals for bounties must be held in public unless the board is satisfied that it would be against the public interest for evidence given in public. This will give full opportunity for all interested exactly what is talcing place, and enable  those particularly interested to place It is an - their views before the board. The makes second is the repealing of section 37 cf The the original act to remove the limitation of the duration of the board. This must not be confounded with section 4 of the act, in which provision is made for the appointment of members for varying periods from one to five years. The Government's decision to ask Parliament to amend the act in the direction indicated was arrived at after a careful consideration of the conditions necessary to production, make the board as effective a means as enormously possible for the achievement of the purposes that it was intended to fulfil . The and re- bill does not concern the tariff, nor the pro- fiscal policy. The real issue is whether investigations the necessary work that is now done by imports, the Tariff Board can be better done by the departmental officers. If the board to the is dispensed with, we must appoint a body of responsible officials to do its work, but if the principle of the board is accepted by honourable members a board - of responsible officials will not be 1,000 re- necessary. The difference in the expense of the two boards would be little. The personnel of the present board is, very I think, as upright, representative, capand sym- able and well informed as any country prob- could reasonably hope to obtain. surrounded. Whether honourable members accept the principle of a Tariff Board ornot, the industries Minister's powers will be the same-n o more and no less-and he will be solely responsible to this House. But little economy would be effected by abolishing the board, but there would be an increasing difficulty in procovering tecting industries, especially some of involv- our war babies. Honourable members know of well that should the life of the Tariff Board be determined, it would be necessary to provide a number of highly-paid responsible officers to carry on the work in- now being done by that body. This would mean that the commercial community would not be represented at inquiries, and unquestionably the old complaint of want of representation by business men would be heard on all sides. As a result of personal experience I am convinced that the expansion of some Australian primary and secondary industries has been materially helped because of the careful and to be thorough investigations made by the Tariff Board. What is the present posito know tion? The depreciation of currency still exists, the dumping intentions are as keen as ever, and our valuable trade is still urgently desired by outsiders. The removal of the special precautions supplementary to the tariff would immediately result in the crippling, if not destruction, of not only many of our valuable secondary industries, but also some of our primary productions. These special precautions were never more necessary than they are today. There can be no retreat from the stand this Parliament has taken up of safeguarding and encouraging the development of existing industries, and the initiation of new industries. Our importance as a nation depends upon the thoroughness with which we carry out this great national task. The Commonwealth Trade and Customs Department is a great and important department, being charged with administering tariffs and excise that brought into the Commonwealth exchequer last year a revenue of £36,000,000. In the last two months there has been a considerable increase in revenue from these sources, compared with the corresponding period of last year. The Tariff Board is the guard appointed by Parliament to keep a vigilant watch over our industries, to warn the Minister and Parliament of any dangers that threaten the industrial life of the nation, aud to advise as to the means of repelling them. This duty must continue to be necessary as long as our industries ueed protection, and it would be unwise to change the body which should discharge this duty. Another aspect to be considered is that the appointment of the Tariff Board has enabled the producers and manufacturers of states other than Victoria to place their views personally before the board. Previously, this opportunity was not presented to anything like the same extent, and one of the most f r u it f u l sources of dissatisfaction was the lack of opportunity to industries, remote from Melbourne, to place their cases' before the authorities concerned. The Tariff Board system may ""as yet be by no means perfect, but it is being, or has been, adopted by other Anglo-Saxon countries. Taking into consideration the very complicated, responsible, and arduous duties to be performed, no disinterested man with an insight into what is going on, can deny that it is incomparably preferable to the system which it displaced. I believe that the service the Tariff Board will be able to render to the Commonwealth will bo increasingly valuable. For these reasons, therefore, the Tariff Board system should be made permanent. The board has to perform work which no Government, Parliament or Minister can do-wor k which is vitally necessary for the welfare of the nation. From my experience as a responsible Minister. I hold the present members of the board in very high esteem. They are carrying out their arduous duties with great ability, and without fear or favour, in an earnest attempt to do the best they can for Australia. While I am the administrative head of the department under which the board functions, I shall, without inflicting unnecessary pin-pricks on the trading community, endeavour to see that administration is effected in accordance with the will of Parliament, and in strict conformity with the law. My guiding principle will always be the preservation and development of our primary and secondary industries. The Government has also decided that the position of chairman of the Tariff Board shall not be held by the Comptroller-General of Customs. Consequently, the experience and advice of the Comptroller-General will always be independently available to the Minister. Should Parliament make the Tariff Board permanent, the safeguards provided for the administration of this great department will be as humanly perfect as possible. In the administration of the department we shall have, first, investigation, the report, and advice of the Tariff Board, and then, as a further check, the independent experience and assistance of the Comptroller-General. Finally, the Minister will make his decision in accordance with the facts presented to him, and the policy of the Government within the law, and for that decision he will be responsible to Parliament.

27,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Batman) [4.3] - The bill is a short one, with a long tail. Like the bull ant it has its sting in its t a i l , and is poisonous, but unlike that interesting insect, it is not indigenous to Australia, but had its origin abroad, and wilt, serve the interests of foreign capitalists.. £ts purpose is to ratify the: agreement made between His Majesty's* Government of the Commonwealth, of Australia and .Amalgamated Wireless. (.Australasia)' Ltd . The Prime Minister (. Mr Bruce),, who' initroduoed it , stated that it wouldi modify the existing agreement between) the Commonwealth Government, and the compaaiy. In fact,- it does much more than modify that agreement, for it setsup a. new agreement,, in which, all. the objectionable features of the old one are intensified. It will"" relieve the Gompany of. the performance of a number of obligations placed, upon, it by the agreement executed on the28l;li March, 1922.. An interesting' matter of comment is that it proposes to adopt a new agreement already signed. The new agreement bas. been executed, by the parties, who stipulated in it that it should' not have effect until it had been approved by the Commonwealth Parliament. Stiff, it is worthy of note that the previous agreement came before Parliament! unsigned,, and 1' mention the fast now because it occurs to me that the present procednxe is a tactical' party move by the GovernmentAs the agreement already bears the signature of the Prime Minister as an accomplished fact, the gentlemen who sit behind him will be much lesslikely to refuse toendorse it than if it bad not been: signed.",20

T furnished a renOrt dissenting; from the. view of the majority, and' urging that the agreement ought not to have been accepted', on the general grounds w h i c h 1I have already stated to1 day in respect of the present document. I ' may, perhaps', be permitted to» quote a That few words' from that minorit y report, not tHat I ' wish toflatter myself, but because in the light of history that has 1 been' since made, my statement seems to - have Been prophetic. I said, on page 14 of the report- 1 1 Without making any charge against the present contracting party, it is prudent to bear in mind that the shareholders of smaller companies are more often than not also interested in larger corporations, and vice versa. If the' smaller one succeeds in a great venture, the larger ones share the advantages. If the lesser one fails, its losses are limited to itself and its partners. - During the inquiry one gathered that there was at least one large corporation having a fatherly interest in Amalgamated Wireless Limited, without any responsibility to the Commonwealth. It would not be unreasonable to suppose that the shareholders of the larger body cherish a hope that their company will benefit in the result of the experiment ih long-distant radio telegraphy, now proposed to be made largely at the expense of the Commonwealth. I ""do not think that the Commonwealth should even indirectly subsidize capitalists, however influential, and especially foreign capitalists, to so experiment. We have legislated much against trusts and combines. By virtue of this agreement we are likely to make the Commonwealth a cog in the wheel of a very large trust indeed. True, the agreement now provides for certain indemnities and guarantees, ibut "" unforseen circumstances"" and "" impossibility of performance "" are useful phrases when one party seeks relief from its obligations. Further, the prospect of the Commonwealth engaging itself in costly litigation with vested interests to enforce its contracts is neither edifying nor, judged by experience, hopeful. My reference to a large company, of course, referred to the Marconi trust which, at that time, was suspected to be lurking in the background, but which now, if you please, struts upon the stage as the brightest star actor of the piece. The agreement, having been ratified, the matter came before Parliament, and the discussion, especially in regard to the appointment of the seventh ber, created a certain of scandal, reflecting not too pleasantly upon the Government. occasion, the Prime Minister made a speech in which to the best of his not inconsiderable ability he held me up to ridicule as a person whose views on this subject were not worthy of very serious consideration. He told me- I have not forgotten it , although, no doubt every one else has-that he had paid me the compliment of listening to me from the beginning to the end of my speech. Since then I have frequently paid him a similar compliment, and I may add that mine is the greater compliment, since I have, I think, the smaller store of patience. In his speech on the 14th July, 1922, as reported on page 506 of Hansard, the Prime Minister saidThat the practicability of direct wireless communication - with Great Britain is not yet established is undeniable. No man can say Mr Brennan. whether or not this can be done with certainty, and that was the consideration which more than anything else impressed the committee. All of us were seized of the wonderful value to Australia which direct wireless communication with Europe would be, but we were not prepared to risk a great sum of Commonwealth money in such an undertaking on the evidence at present available. The experts examined by the committee are confident that wireless communication with Britain can he established on the basis of a commercial service for 300 days in the year, twelve hours per day, and 20 words per minute. The experts said that such a service was possible if we erected the necessary stations. Wje asked tliem to - adduce evidence in support of their theory, and all they could tell us were the results obtained by what is called "" listening-in"" with their own instruments in Australia. A study of the summarized evidence will show that the experts have obtained very considerable results in that way over periods of weeks, and for many hours per day. With the very inefficient receiving installations at present in existence, they have been able to pick up wireless messages from Bordeaux, Leafield, and other stations in Europe. The committee And this is the passage to which I invite the special attention of honourable memberswore not'satisfied, however, that that evidence was ' sufficient to warrant the Commonwealth spending a great sum of money, and we pointed out that the only basis upon which we could agree to recommend the purchase was that we should have somo guarantee of the service which the Commonwealth would get in return ' for the money expended.",22
32,Mr MATHEWS,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,We are still waiting.,23
33,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"No . We are not mem- waiting for those guarantees, because the amount Marconi trust stepped upon the stage and entered into guarantees satisfactory On that and acceptable to the present Government. ' But nothing has been done under the agreement, and now, two and a half years after the signing of the document, we are asked to release the Marconi people from their obligations. Honourable members, no doubt, admit the triumph of the Prime Minister in that he was able to say, three years ago, that the guarantees would be forthcoming, but, after waiting for three years for. something to be done,, we are now proposing, by legislation, to relieve the company, from those guarantees. The Primo Minister, by marking time and by making a heavy noise with his feet, really persuaded himself that he was making some progress, while in truth and in fact he has made none whatever. . Mr COOK - What are you going to do about it?",23
34,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,It is for members of the Country party to tell us what they are going to do about it . They will be invited to give an answer to that question. The facetious and jocular member for Indi will find himself in a very serious position when this subject is discussed in his own division.,24
35,Mr OKEEFE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Hi s sunnorters will ask him what he is going to do about it .,24
36,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"I advise the honourable member for Indi , for his own good, not to interject. The Amalgamated Wireless Company covenanted to do many things, including those from which it is now being relieved. I find, on page 10 of the existing agreement, that the company undertook(<i) To construct, maintain, and operate in Australia the necessary stations and equipment for a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and tlio United Kingdom. (i>) To provide and operate a system of feeder stations for wireless connection between tlic main high-power stations and the capital cities of all the states. (c) To equip and organize the feeder stations so as to provide communication with merchant ships round the coast of Australia; (c) To arrange for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in the United Kingdom; (/) To provide the main trunk stations in Australia and the United Kingdom within two years from the date of this agreement; The date of the agreement is the 28th March, 1922(g) To arrange within two years from the date of this agreement for the erection and operation of a station in Canada capable of commercial communication with the high power station in Australia, and so equipped as to afford facilities for distributing traffic throughout North America; (ft) To take over within one month after signing this agreement the existing Commonwealth radio stations and to take over many other things belonging to the Commonwealth. Not one of those covenants has the company carried out. I sbould be doing an injustice if I said that it had done nothing. It has taken our cash. Commonwealth capital to the amount of £112,000 has already been invested in the company under this agreement. The company took that without any demur. In that respect it was up-to-time. It bas received £88,000 under the provisions of clause 7 of the principal agreement; that is the balance in its favour referred to by the Prime Miuister in answer to questions that I asked this day. In a word, the company has taken over the whole of our wireless system, all the money we agreed to pay, and an annual subsidy which, I understand, works out at roughly £60,000 a year. So it has not done badly - It has taken everything it could get under the agreement, and has given nothing in return. Mr E . RILEY - And this is a business government!",24
37,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"And that has been allowed by a strictly business government ! What excuse does the company offer for its failure to observe its part of the contract? If honourable members will turn to the schedule to the bill, they will find the following recited : And' whereas at the time of the making of the principal agreement, the parties thereto believed that the British Government would be ready and willing to grant licences for the erection' and operation of a trunk station and other stations in the United Kingdom for communication with Australia. And, whereas the British Government refuses to grant licences for the erection and operation of commercial wireless stations in the United Kingdom with a view to communication with Australia, and the Marconi Company is, by reason thereof, unable to obtain the necessary licence to erect or operate the said trunk station in the United Kingdom for that purpose And n-hereas the Commonwealth is desirous that the company should (notwithstanding the fact that the Marconi Company is prevented at the present time from providing a main trunk station in the United Kingdom) proceed with the erection of the main trunk station in Australia, and has requested the company tb endeavour to arrange with the Marconi company to proceed with the erection of such station, and the company has agreed to do so provided the company is relieved from certain obligations under the principal agreement. Now, in consideration of the premises it is hereby agreed Mr E . RILEY - The whole point in the bill is that the company is to be relieved from its obligations.",24
38,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"That is the main purpose of the bill. Honourable members will notice that the basis of the company's application to be relieved from its obligations under the principal agreement, and to have a fresh agreement, giving it a new lease of life, to enable it to undertake fresh experiments and obtain, if possible, dividends, is that it understood that it would be granted a licence to erect trunk and other stations in Great Britain , and that those expectations were not realized. Did the Commonwealth Government covenant to invest £500,000 of Commonwealth money in this venture on the mere chance of the B ritish Government agreeing to the Marconi trust erecting high-power stations in Great Britain? If it did, that was a very reckless act, aud one for which trustees in private life might well be sentenced to ten or twelve years' incarceration. 'Of course it was an - easy 'matter to put that question to the proof. A cable to the - British - Government at the time would bave satisfactorily cleared that issue. The representative of Amalgamated Wireless Limited in Australiaa gentleman whose promises bave borne sueh a slight relation to his performances - assure d us that it was the easiest thing in the world to secure a licence to erect high-powered - stations in Great Britain. Perbaps I should explain that Amalgamated Wireless Limited entered into contracts with the Marconi Oompany for the - erection - of those .sbatuMis, and that the latter furnished the necessary guarantees j but, m the colloquial phrase of the day, Amalgamated Wireless Limited is - merely a "" pap "" - of the Marconi trust, an appendage in Australia having the appearance of an Australian company, but iai reality only an .inconsiderable . agent and represemtative of the Marconi trust in - this country. The question - to be answered is, is this .failure to obtain a lieen-ee to erect .stations in Great Britain merely an - accentuation of Other failures by the company, or is it something more.? .1 - suggest .that the statement regarding itamounts to an - allegation of breach of faith on the part of the British Government. I am led to that ieonclusion by - taking what is recited in the bill and-reading it in .conjunction with the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruoe), ?who has told us that, when the agreement .was cantered into, we 'bad reason - to believe that such lioenues wouM be .granted, bant that after we had ientered into the .agreement, the Britisb Government did not favour that [policy.",24
39,Mr SOULXIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"On what grounds - did the Tight - honourable gentleman believe'that those licences would the granted? Mr BRENDAN"" --He believed it , because the - cocksure representative of the Amalgamated Wireless Limited in Australia told bim that such was the ca-se, and he did not take the trouble to verify the statement of his informant. As a matter of - fact, there bas been no breach of 'faith 'on the part of tihe Britisb 'Government. If the ^position were as stated by the Prime Minister, there - would indeed have been-a breach of faith, in that the British Government had given us tounderstand that facilities - - would be given to us to eTect these stations, and subsequently bad refused the concession. As a matterof ""fact, the attitude of the Britisb Government for years past in Tegard to the control of wireless in Great Britain has been well known. The feud of which the right honourable gentleman spoke the otber day,, between the Marconi'trust and the British Government, centred round this intrusion of a largely foreign company into Great Britain, and .its competition with theBritish Government for the control of a national service. Tbere bas been no feud in the strict sense of the term; but, to their honour be it said, succeeding British. Governments-Conservative , Liberal, and Labour--bave-offere d stern and continued resistance to the Marconi - trust - in itsendeavour to control - wireless in Great Britain. I venture to say fSiat, if one wanted an outstanding illustration of the extraordinary .tactlessness .of the Commonwealith 'Government in its bandling of'.this matter, it .is afforded by the fact that it deliberately .allowed the Maneoni trust to obtain the controlling influence in Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and in our efforts to establish trunk stations in 'Great Britain, well knowing that that trust was wot persona grevba to the British Government or the British people. With its eyes open it bas allowed .this trust, under the nominal direction of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, to be the only .tenderer for the erection of .these bighpowfir - stations. Niobody cam iget into the business except the Marconi trust, and - the Government knew 'perfectly well that the Marconi trust was in constant .antagonism .to the British Government, and it .should rhave known tibat, on national and .imperial grounds, any .British Government with a high sense of iiihs duty as the .trustee of the 'nation,, would resist a ischejoie by which a company, wholly foreign, - could sit at the heart of the .Empire with its finger npon the prise of communication between Great Britain and every otber country in the world. 'Prom strategic, - defence, and oommercial points of view, it was of vital importance to Gseat Britain that, in the lash resort, her wireless - should be controlled by the British .people. The CommGaiwealtb Government .seems to have disregarded that necessity. What, is-the Marconitrust? The Marconi Wireless' Company, England ; the Radio Communication Company, United States of America; the Prench WirelessCompany, andl the"" Telefunken Company, Germany, are merely branches of the Marconi trust; and the Amalgamated Wirelessi Company is< what soame honourable msanbevs in thischamber onee referred, to - as "" the pup of the Marconi teust'.""

He' said khaib an innovation knownais' thebeam system Became a. practical possibility about the time that the Donald'., committee niaelaits report, and. thus changed-, the whole aspect ofi the wirelessagreement. 0ne* curious' feature about the Prime Minister^ references to the beam system is that, although be alleges that it is to. revolutionize ouai relations, with Amalgamated Wireless,, and' is to lead to a : new agreement, new obligations, and' new 1 commitments, be gave the system only that faint, praise which is traditionally saidto. damn.

If in d t h is report in the L o n d o n Times of the 2 4 t h J u l y , 1924EMPIRE WIRELESS SERVIC'E. TRIA L or THE BEAM SYSTEM Mr HARTSHORN, Postmaster-General (Ogmore), replying to a question by Sir L . Worthington-Evans (Colchester, U . ) , said:The Government have decided to adopt the main recommendations of the Donald Committee in regard to the Empire wireless service, which were as follows:-(1 ) That the State, through the Post Office, should own all wireless stations in Great Britain for communication with the Overseas Dominions, Colonics. Protectorates, and Territories; and (2) that the Post Office should operate directly, under an improved business organization"" all the Empire stations in Great Britain. It is a condition of the contract that the installations shall only be accepted and paid for by the Government if they fulfil certain minimum guarantees, which are as follows:Communication at 100 five-letter words per minute (exclusive of any repetitions necessary to ensure accuracy) for the following average number of liours daily throughout the year: between Great Britain and Canada, 18 hours; between Great Britain and South Africa, 11 hours: between Great Britain and India, 12 hours; between Great Britain and Australia, 7 hours. Communication is only possible when the average altitude of the sun between the terminal points is below a certain maximum; in other words, communication can only take place during the hours of darkness and during one or two liours 'before and after twilight. The hours of communication being outside the ordinary business day, stations of this type will as a rule only be available for deferred traffic. Por long distance communication at all hours and for simultaneous long distance transmission in all directions at all - hours (conditions which the Government regard as essential both for strategic and for other reasons), high-power stations of the type of that being erected at Rugby will still be necessary. Sir L . VVOBTHINGTON-EVANS - Does that mean that Australia and South Africa are abandoning the intention to erect a high-power station ?",25
40,Mr HARTSHORN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"That their general attitude at the moment, at any rate until they have given this thing a trial. Mr Brennan. Sir L . WOKTHI.NGTON-EVANS - And they will be content with communication after dark i",27
41,Mr HARTSHORN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"They have not yet and he reached a definite decision.  Is it not daylight in Australia and New Zealand when it is dark here? (Laughter, and cries of ""Answer."") It would appear that the united wisdom of the House of Commons was not quite equal to answering the question, ""How long is it dark at the same time in both Australia and Great Britain "" ? and I doubt if the united wisdom of the House could give a satisfactory answer to it . However, the discussion directs attention to the important fact that the beam system is applicable only to hours of darkness. Of course, hours of darkness are suitable to a government that acts in the dark; but I am advocating a system which works in the light. I believe that, as the light bas been switched on, we should follow the advice of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) in that regard, and keep it on. As a matter of fact, without deciding just for the moment the vexed question of how long it is dark at the same time in both Great Britain and Australia, I bave been led to believe that the beam system cannot - be relied upon to operate for niore than two to four hours each day. It follows, therefore, that it can only be useful for deferred messages at the best,- and must be quite useless and hopeless in competition with the ordinary cable system, which works during all hours of the day and night. The Prime Minister, in that light-hearted way in wbicb be has approached this subject, in marked .contrast totbe dolorous solemnity with wbicb be approaches the question of the taxation of leaseholds, has said that under this agreement we are to bave 21,600 words a day each way for 300 days a year, at the rate of 50 words a minute for 7 hours a day, instead of 20 words a minute for 12 hours a day - as provided for in the old agreement. One would think that we had been so long accustomed to 20 words a minute for 12 hours a day that we were pining for something new. The mere fact that we are not getting one word a day has not affected in the slightest the optimism of the rigbt honourable gentleman. But even his statement in this regard is open to appears to he criticism . on many points. ' For instance: are they to be repeat words and are they to be effective words 1 The truth is that the right honourable gentleman lacks authority to say that this can be done. Everything he spoke of in that speech quoted by me earlier about the impracticability of the whole thing remains unchanged today. He now says that the introduction of the beam system constitutes such a vital change that we are justified in changing our outlook on wirelessentirely. But the system is not novel. Eonorable members will probably be surprised to learn-tb e Prime Minister will not be surprised, because be knows it already, although be did not tell the House about it-that Marconi applied for a patent for the beam system in 1917, and the ground upon which his application was refused was that there was no novelty in the idea, and there was nothing about it for which a patent could be justly given. All that the beam system amounts to is that there is a certain amount of concentration of energy upon a short wave; but sucb is the effect of light upon this short wave that the system can only operate during a very few of the 24 hours, and it is also subject to our old friend atmospherics, about which the right honourable gentleman knows so much"". Nothing has been done to overcome these disadvantages, and no evidence bas been given by the Prime Minister to indicate that the beam system is a practical one. In a paper read by bim at the Royal Society of Arts on the -2nd July last, Marconi referred to radio telephonic transmission from the experimental station at Poldhu being received by Mr Fisk, managing director of Amalgamated ""Wireless, at a station near Sydney, and explained that reflectors were not used on that occasion. In other words, the transmission was normal, apart from the use of very short waves, sucb as so-called amateurs have employed for experimental transmission over considerable distances, using an input of only a few watts- a fraction of the power used at Poldhu. Here let me quote the comment of a correspondent- I am not at liberty to disclose his name, but the facts can be tested by communication with Marconi, and I take the responsibility for what be has said. His comment is as follows: The particulars given in that paper showed that such a system is likely to be of much value for working over comparatively short distances at night-time, but for long-distance commercial working we must rely upon high power stations transmitting on much longer wave lengths than those which can be used for beam working. To put the matter beyond all doubt, Marconi replied to a question on the subject of working to Australia by saying that, "" The indications were that in the middle of the day any practical amount of power would not get through very long distances."" and that "" It would appear to be very difficult indeed, if not impossible, to get messages to Australia by day-time as far as he had tried."" These were the words of Marconi himself. It is important to remember that the Britisb Government are proceeding with the erection of their high-power station at Bugby, although they are permitting, under very severe safeguards, an experiment with the beam system on the principle that if it works well it will be taken over by tbem, and if it does not - work well it will not be taken over.",27

43,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"And without pay- "" ment - In spite of advice and evidence, the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), in speaking of the determination of the Government to proceed with the, beam system, says lightlyOur reason is that such amazing developments have occurred in wireless during the past two or three years that by the time a highpowered station had been erected, at a cost of nearly £50(3,000, it would probably be obsolete and useless. F o r that statement we have one a u t h o r it y - the r i g h t honourable gentleman him s e l f . To the c o n t r a r y I quote M a r c o n i , the Do n a l d Committee, the B r it is b Government, and every local expert I bave been able to meet; and I . challenge the r i g h t honourable gentleman to quote a single ' expert in support of h is view. He saysAs recently as July, 1.921, a committee of British experts, which included several representatives of the Postmaster-General's Department, declared that wireless communication over a distance of more than 2,000 miles was quite impossible for commercial purposes, irrespective of the size or power of the stations which might he erected. To-day, I do not think that any one who is familiar with wireless developments will affirm that communication over 10,000 or 12,000 miles is either impracticable or difficult of accomplishment. That is a most extraordinary statement. The rigbt honourable gentleman knows perfectly well, as a member of the committee to which I have referred, and as one who bas given a little thought to the matter, that radio communication is possiderable sible over 10;000 or 12,009 miles. Thai; point is not in dispute; the question is whether :a practical commercial - service over-that distance-can be established. The Prime Minister, a day or two ago, spoke ,as if a revolution bad ^been effected i -.this regard, whereas, in truth and 'fact, since ""Che date on which the original una agreement was made, not a single step any considerable 'importance .has been reganrd taken to overcome the practical difficulties of establishing a commercial ^service. Not a single advance ""has been made, unMarcconi less the right .'honourable gentleman is .graft. speaking of the Dame Melba concerts, kind sealed sets, and otber 'broadcasting devous velopments, which ar,e not worth conchoose sidering in dealing with the matter of bribery or .aortEuption,, I asamob establishing bigh-power radio communiI cation.

Bnt w'hen - we put the acid - test on the claim wbicb Mr .

The voice is .superimposed on wave lengths .which create the telephony.. 'Telegraphy is the interpretation of the wave. itself. This is - the land of 'poisonous propaganda that is being spread through Australia today. Honourable members wall recollect that Mr ^Fisk ""was much in evidence when Mr Wise, i?ben - member for Gippsland and Postmaster-General in tfoe late Government of which the present Prime Minister was Treasurer, was 'hi charge of wireless 'afff-airs.' ' Mr Wise - felt it necessary to - speak very plainly in this chamber uncut the ^jbjectionable interference and lobbying of Mr Fisk in his efforts to cause the Commonwealth Gowrrranent to .enter into an agreement with him - on %dh-alf of his company. I i is wery much to the credit of Mr . Wise 'that be - stood up against Mr Fisk like a man, and expressed his candid opinion - of b'im. It is quite evident that the - wretched agreement, as originally - presented - by Mr Btugbes, and wbicb - we are now 'asked to 'amend, 'was conceived by the .company. When. Mr 'Fisk was - examined some time ago 'on this inatter Iby a disinterested .oommittee of honourable members of this Parliament, of whom the Prime .Minister was one; he .said that it was quite possible for his company to -.give Australia .a service of twenty words a minute .for twelve hours a day, but, under cross-examination, he admitted that his belief was subject to serious qualification, and that there was no eiddence whatever which would justify the committee in concluding with fair icertainty that it was possible. Mr Fisk also :said that it was quite within 'his capacity to obtain licences to erect high-power stations in 1 Great Britain, .Canada, and elsewhere. He ""bas - not done sq, nor ""can be do so. Now 'he asks the Government to amend the agreement ""to relieve him of tihe necessity for doing it .

44,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Was not the company supposed to put in £ 1 for £ 1 ? Mr BREOTAN"" - That provision had relation to . capital; but these figures relate to the working of the radio stations. How it happens that the Government is £88,000 out of pocket and the company has done nothing whatever for us, requires, in my opinion, a little more explanation than we have had so far. I will not trench further on the extended time which the House did me the honour to give me for the discussion of this matter, except to say that the question remaining for honourable members to decide is, whether the Government has proposed a practicable scheme. Although I do not claim to be an expert, I have given as mucb consideration to this subject as the next man, and in justification of my presumption in forming an opinion on the matter, I , at least, have called some witnesses, and given some evidence in support of my views, whereas the Prime Minister bas given us no evidence whatever in support of his proposals. would be of no use to appeal to honourable members opposite to vote against this measure on the ground that we should not allow this company to worm its way into the control of wireless in Australia, but should jealously guard our responsibilities in that regard for the nation's needs. The fetish of honourable members opposite is private enterprise, and their god is personal gain. Competition and profits are the ltmits of their outlook on life. But I trust that they are not immune to an appeal to consider whether the Govern-' ment has submitted to us a business proposition, for they pretend to have the business instinct. Is it a business proposition for the Government to covenant to pay £500,000 to this company in view of the company's utter failure to do the things that it undertook to do ? It has - not met its obligations in a single particular. In these circumstances, are we to give it a new lease of l if e on the same speculative grounds which governed the last agreement, to enable it to conduct its experiments at the public cost? Not long ago I read in the morning press an article in which the writer, like an ill tempered fishwife, hectored and lectured the Government of Victoria, because it proposed to relieve slightly the working conditions of the primary producers on the land by reducing railways freights and fares and by other practical means. What have such critics to say of the members of this Government, wbo do not hesitate to risk, in easy speculation, a large amount of public money in a company in which they would not think of venturing their own private resources ? How long is this kind of thing to go on? Is the Prime Minister willin g to pile up guarantee on guarantee, and after these guarantees have been dishonoured to propose something else to take their place? Where is the end of it? No justification has been shown for the proposal to vary this agreement. The whole thing is objectionable, not only from the point of view of sound business, but for the additional reason that there are no material grounds upon which we can be justly asked to conclude another agreement with the company. It is doubly objectionable, on the ground that it steals that which rightly belongs to the nation, and from the point of view that there is unanswerable It evidence to show that the Government, in proposing it , has been influenced and prompted by persons whose motives are their own private profits, and not the nation's good.",31
45,Mr MAKIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Hindmarsh) [5.25] Time has vindicated the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) in the attitude be adopted, some two years ago, in taking strong exception to the agreement then proposed with the Amalgamated Wireless Company, and the sound advice tendered by the honourable member on that occasion entitles his .remarks today to the most serious consideration. When, in defiance of warnings, the Government plunged headlong into this contract w itb a private company there was strong public feeling that the then Prime Minister (Mr W. M . Hughes) and his colleagues were courting disaster. The history of the wireless negotiations shows that the fears then expressed were well founded, since we now find that the good cash of this country has been invested in an enterprise of a doubtful character. The present Government, following the procedure adopted by its predecessors, with all the audacity it is possible to summon, desires to foist on the people a revised agreement w itb the company. The objections to the scheme arenumerous, and are based on logical grounds. The honourable member for Batinan-has rightly reminded us that in the new agreement no limit is placed upon the time to be allowed the company in which to "" deliver the goods."" In the original agreement there was a provision stipulating a definite period in which the work should be executed.",31
46,Mr BLAKELEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"It was as slip-shod as the pact between the Nationalists and the Country party. Mr MAKIN"" - I agree entirely with the honourable member for Darling. The Government, apparently has no desire to conserve the interests of the people generally. On the other hand, it seems to be studying the interests of the wealthy sections and of "" big business,"" both in Australia and overseas. More than two years bave elapsed since the original agreement was signed, but the clay ie still far distant wben Australia can expect a service in return for the capital invested. It seems to me that the public will look in vain for any adequate wireless service if the work is to be entrusted to the Amalgamated Wireless Company, wbicb is part of the Marconi Trust. It is useless to dispute the fact that the Marconi Company hasa very real interest in the Amalgamated Wireless Company, for it holds shares in it. All recent happenings in this matter prove conclusively that those wbo condemned the first agreement were rigbt, and that the Government was tragically wrong; but cold comfort is afforded the taxpayers, wbo have seen their money squandered. The agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Company was based on two main conditions. In the first place, the company was required to erect in Australia a high-power station capable of direct communication with the United Kingdom. Secondly, the company undertook to arrange for the erection of suitable corresponding stations in the United Kingdom. Everything else was contingent on those conditions, and the company made default. A lack of business acumen was shown by the Government in entering into such an arrangement with a company that did not give the necessary guarantee that it would carry out its part of the agreement. It now seems that there is still a deliberate desire to favour a commercial enterprise of a very doubtful character at the expense of the people of Australia.",32

Sub-clause viii of clause 3 of the agreement states-The company shall not enter into or be n party to any commercial trust or combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business. It is known that the Amalgamated Wireless Company has on its share list the Marconi Trust, and that paragraph, I think, shows that the company bas riot .acted according to the spirit and letter of the agreement. The position in Great Britain bas been clouded for. some considerable time by a controversy upon the proposed establishment of wireless communication between Australia and the Old. Country. But it is now reported that arrangements have been made for the Marconi Trust to erect an experimental station on the beam system. According to figures supplied by the Postmaster-General of Great Britain (Mr. Hartshorn), sucb a station would cost a maximumof £44,920, but the people of Great Britain are absolutely secured against financial responsibility, unless the tests made are according to required standards, and the Marconi Company erect a similar station in' Canada.",32

Honourable members, wben discussing the bill, This shows must rely on the opinions of wireless experts. When a bill relating to wireless on was introduced in this chamber three ago, Mr Hughes, the then Prime Minister, almost persuaded the House to According to. his statement, wireless communication with other parts of the world was to be established, and press messages were to be Notwithstanding that Mr Hughes had a large majority behind him-althoug h I do at not think that Dr Ear la Page, the to Leader of the Country party, was a very enthusiastic supporter of the bill-the such House appointed a committee of inquiry.

58,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"-The Prime Minister adto see that their mitted that. Mr E . RILEY - Yea . The Army authorities are also against the beam system, because of its insufficient service. The greatest objection to that system is that confidential wireless communications between the British and Commonwealth Governments would be subject to the scrutiny of a private company. is no justification for such a proceeding, and that is the greatest stumbling block to the new agreement. I understand that the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson), when in London, was quite in accord with the British Government's opposition to a private company having control of Britain's wireless communications. Under the original agreement, highpowered stations capable of a rapid communication were to be erected. ""Wireless stations that bad already been erected by the Commonwealth Government in the Pacific, in New Guinea, on the north ocast of Queensland, and elsewhere, and also all Government wireless equipment were taken over by Amalgamated Wireless of Australasia Limited. Every ship trading on our coast, provided with wireless, has to contribute to the revenue of that company. Although that portion of the agreement was carried out, yet the contract to erect high-powered stations here and in Great Britain has not been fulfilled, although the Commonwealth has already paid the company a large sum of money for that work. new agreement, if ratified, will n u l l i fy the previous agreement, and the company will commence de novo, not being held responsible for their failure to comply with the original contract. Under the new agreement there is no guarantee that the beam system will be installed within a certain time, and that it will be successful. I would be quite prepared to give the system a trial, and Mr ""Fisk, who is the agent for the company in Australia, should give a demonstration before wireless experts during the hours of the day when the beam system is effective. We have bad nothing more than Mr . Fisk's opinion, and I am not aware that the Prime Minister has received a communication from the Britisb Government. Marconi bas denied that the communication about wbicb reports were circulated was transmitted by the beam system. The Government sbould appoint a committee of members of this House to inquire into the matter and report upon it . It should not rely upon one expert, like Mr Fisk, who represents only one company. Naturally be does the best he can for his company, and it is our duty to do the best we can for the people of Australia. Such an inquiry as I suggest would take only a few days. The committee would report There whether the beam system was. satisfactory, and whether the r at if y in g of the agreement would be in the interests of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister, wbo was a member of the committee that inquired into the last agreement, must admit that it did excellent work. We know that the Amalgamated Wireless Company bas failed to carry out the agreement, wbicb. bas caused a loss of over £80,000 a year to this country. The Commonwealth is on the wrong side of the ledger in regard to it , and that is very serious. I do not like the agreement, I do not like the history of the company, and I do not like the way the company bas broken its contract. I bave no doubt that the House would readily adopt the report of a select committee.",34
59,Mr WEST,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"East Sydney) [ 6 . 1 4 ] - I urge the Prime Minister to "" go slow"" in this business. It is sixteen or seventeen years since wireless was first regarded as a possibility, and from that day to this everything that bas been done to improve it bas been experimental. The The proposal to ' erect masts 800 feet bigb amazes me. Masts of sucb a height would be subjected to great wind pressure and severe stresses of various kinds. As far as I have been able to learn, the beam system cannot be a success, but the transmission of messages at higher altitudes appears to be more practicable. All we ask of the Prime Minister is that be sbould have an inquiry made before in curring further expenditure. I would not worry so much about the cost if I did not feel that there was a danger of a failure resulting from it . It is certain that money will bave to be spent before the possibilities of wireless are exhausted. In 1 view of the confidential nature of wireless messages between governments, sbips of the navy, and commercial bouses, no one but the Government sbould be allowed to handle tbem. I advocate government control of wireless apart from my advocacy of the socialization of industries generally. It is necessary to have in charge persons in whom we have confidence. I remember wben the first wireless station in Australia was erected at Epping, New Soutb Wales. An agreement was entered into between the Britisb Government and the Marconi Company, and a sum of £375,000 a year was spent for three years in an effort to crush the Telefunken system. That system is not affected by .climatic changes, and can be used day and night, but the Marconi system cannot.. I support the suggestion that a committee of four or five members of this House sbould hold an inquiry before the bill is passed.",35
60,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Maribyrnong) [6.20] One has only to read the history of wireless telegraphy in Australia and in other parts of the world to conclude that a good deal of doubt and suspicion bas surrounded many of the transactions associated with it. The investigations made in Great Britain a few years ago revealed the fact that the characters of many prominent public men became more or less tainted in consequence of the financial influence of the Marconi combine. In hurriedly perusing some of the speeches delivered wben the original agreement between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was before the House, I find that 60,000 shares in the company, which was supposed to be an Australian concern, were held by the original Marconi Company, and that others holding shares were apparently under the influence of the .Marconi combine. In introducing the bill the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) should bave disclosed some of the discussions and decisions of the Amalgamated Wireless Board, upon which the Government bave a representative, and should also bave given that gentleman's opinion on the proposed agreement. It is within the recollection of honourable members that one gentleman was relieved of the chairmanship of the board owing to the manner in which be had been associated with otber concerns. Wben a similar measure was before the House in December, 1921, the then honourable member for Moreton (Mr Weinbolt) said that wireless transactions were comparable with the cloud that was no bigger than a man's hand, but which was assuming sucb proportions that it might overshadow everything. At that time honourable members on this side of the chamber strongly objected to banding over to private individuals work which should have .been conducted by the Government. With the exception, perbaps, of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), wbo is still, I believe, under the impression that even our railways should be privately owned, I do not think any honourable member would suggest that the great public utilities now under government control sbould be handed over to private enterprise. If it is right for letters and parcels to be carried, for telegrams to be transmitted, money orders to be issued, and our telephonic services to be conducted under governmental control, wby sbould .not wireless communications also be directly controlled by the government ?",36

The British Postmaster-General in the Lloyd George Government, the Postmaster General under Mr Bonar Law (Sir Worthington Evans), and the present Postmaster-General (Mr Vernon Hartshorn), would not entertain the idea of' their respective Governments being associated with a company controlled by the Marconi combine. Three different Postmasters-General under three different Britisb Prime Ministers bave, for very good reasons, resisted any association with the Marconi combine.",36

75,Mr BRUCE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Yes .,37
76,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"I am not levelling any accusation against individual members of the board, but I am endeavouring - to find out whether the Prime Minister bas fortified himself with the opinion of this new agreement held by the three representatives of the Commonwealth Government. If he has, he sbould give the House the benefit of their views. If be bas not, I think that be bas neglected his duty. Those members are supposed to be au fait with all that is going on, and they ought to have some knowledge, technical or otherwise, of the business. I understand that wireless operators wbo desire to serve in the Australian Navy have to pass an examination, and that Amalgamated Wireless Limited makes the appointments. I believe, also, that the Navy authorities are opposed to the beam system. I presume it is not regarded as what may be termed a general broadcast. ing system. If we bave sbips in various parts of the Pacific there is the probability that under the beam system any message sent out will be picked up by only - one of them. I am led to believe that the British Navy also is opposed to the beam system. I should like to hear the opinion of the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden). Is he satisfied that that system will meet the requirements of the Australian Navy? It is a fact that both India and New Zealand are not enamoured of the new system, and claim that it will not meet their requirements. The Prime Minister of New Zealand has stated emphatically that wireless should be under government control. Why is Australia rushing in where two overseas dominions fear to tread ? This matter was inquired into by a committee over which the Prime Minister presided. That committee submitted a report. Even then honourable members of the Country party at that time- Mr Fleming (Robertson), Mr. Hill (Echuca), Mr MCWilliams (Frank (Wimmera), and Dr Earle Page (Cowper) voted for an amendment, moved by an honourable member of the Opposition, against the agreement. If they had reason to vote against the agreement after that investigation, why do some of them now intend to vote for this agreement? Their attitude is most peculiar. I know from personal conversation, and from a perusal of his speech in this House, that an ex-Postmaster-General Wise) was most emphatically opposed to any arrangement being made with Amalgamated Wireless L t d . The postal officials, who were acquainted with the position, were also opposed to the agreement. They had made certain provisions, and they desired to carry out the work under Government control, with wireless as a department of the post office i h the same way that the telephone branch is. If I remember rightly, the honourable member for Henty (Mr F . Francis) made a "" stonewalling "" speech against the proposal. He quoted all kinds of authorities to prove different contentions. I have not scrutinized the division lists sufficiently closely to say how he voted. Mr Wise said, in effect, that it would be wrong to allow a private company to come into this business, that it was the bounden duty of the post office to carry' out this work - A f t e r he was put out of the Ministry, he stated on the floor of this House that the proposal practically meant giving away £500,000 of the people's money. was in the Ministry when the proposals were made, and he had carefully analysed them; and on the advice of those who were most qualified to give an opinion he opposed the agreement. This is a far worse agreement than the previous one. I want to point out what action was taken by the present British Government with regard to this matter. I quote from Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire, vol. v., No. 2, A p r i l , 1924, page 199IMPERIAL WIRELESS. There is another very important matter to which I have fallen heir-fallen heir in a rather inconvenient form, the Premier said. I refer to Imperial wireless. I believe for about the last twelve years this matter has been under consideration. On the day the late Government were defeated, a letter was written from the post office, the effect of which was to create an absolute and complete deadlock. Therefore, with my right honourable friend the Postmaster-General, we had to consider the whole matter de novo. If the Labour Government have any ambition at all except to do sober, effective work, they have the ambition to try to do their work in a business-like way, and as soon as we were faced with that difficulty we appointed a small committee to inquire into the whole situation. That committee was appointed a week ago, and I liope that at the end of this week I am going to have a report from it which will enable us to deal with the matter effectively at last. Papers and information will be made available for the House before the House is asked to implement what we will propose as the way out of the difficulty. (Mr There are notes to that speech. They read as follows: The committee, which was presided over by Mr Robert Donald, reported on the -22nd February, and recommendedThat the state, through the post office, should own all wireless stations in Great Britain for communication with the overseas dominions, colonies, protectorates, and territories. That the post office should operate directly, under an improved business organization, all the Empire stations in Great Britain. That an exception be made in the ease of Canada, and that competition between the post office and private enterprise in the AngloCanadian wireless service should be continued, provided that, in any licence granted for the Anglo-Canadian service, public interests are safeguarded as regards conditions of working and terms of expropriation by the state. That private enterprise should be given facilities to develop wireless communication with continental Europe, as with the rest of the world outside the British Empire. The MACDonald Government, as Mr . Bamsay MACDonald stated, inherited this problem from the preceding Government. He intimated that, on the very day that He the ex-Postmaster-General (the Bight Honourable Sir L . Worthington-Evans) left office, his officials had sent a letter which practically created a deadlock. That was the position of Empire wireless affairs when Mr Ramsay MACDonald took office. To place the matter on a business basis, he appointed an expert committee, and asked it to furnish a report within a fortnight, so that Parliament might be informed of the best course to pursue in the circumstances. Mr E . RILEY - That is the action which sbould be taken here.",37
77,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"I agree with the honourable member. W it h in a fortnight that committee, presided over by Mr Donald, sent in its report, which was adopted by the Government as the best way out of the difficulty. It recommended unhesitatingly and emphatically that the British Government should control all wireless stations within the United Kingdom that had communication - with oversea dominions. Yet we propose to adopt a different method! We propose to enter into a coalition with a private concern, of some of the aspects of which the least said the better for that concern. There I leave the matter. I emphatically state that this House should decide that a committee shall make further inquiries and furnish additional information for the guidance of honourable members. I hope that, whatever our political opinions may be, we shall take such steps as w i l us well informed and able to decide upon the best course of action to adopt in the existing exceptional circumstances.  I know very little about wireless, and I ask the Prime Minister to give me, when he replies, some assurance in regard to the correctness or otherwise of information which has reached me to the effect that Signor Marconi stated in England within the last three months, that the beam system is useless except during hours of darkness, and that the darkness must be coincidental in the countries of transmission and receipt. If that statement is correct it is obvious that the time during which the system can be operated between England and Australia is very short. On the 21st December, which is midwinter in England, darkness lasts from about 4 p.m. to 8 a.m. Australian time is about ten hours ahead of English time, so that 4 p.m. in England is 2 a.m. of the previous day here. As it is daylight in Australia about 4.30 a.m. 21st December, there would be only about two and a. half hours of darkness in both countries concurrently. In midsummer in England broad daylight extends from 3 a.m. t i ll 9 p.m., the hours of darkness being from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. The Australian time corresponding to 9 p.m. in England is 7 a.m. of the previous day, so that if at that time of year a message could not be dispatched from England before 9 p.m., it could not be received in Australia, because, by our corresponding hour of 7 a.m., it would be broad daylight.",38
78,Mr ANSTEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Bourke) [ 8 . 1 9 ] shall commence my remarks with a brief resume of the recent history of wireless in Australia. In the dying hours of session of 1921, the then Prime Minister saving life at sea. (Mr Hughes) endeavoured . to push through the House hurriedly an agreemental, ment with the Amalgamated Wireless Company. Strong hostility to the proposal was manifested by members of the Country party, especially the - present Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). Members of the Country party at that time were evincing great curiosity regarding the relations of the Government with the Anglo Persian Oil Company and Amalgamated Wireless Limited. In obedience to the wish of the House, the then Prime Minister consented to refer the wireless agreement to a committee representing both l make Houses, whose decision should be accepted. The then Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) was hostile to the proposal put forward by his own chief. The House adjourned on or about the 17th of December. A couple of weeks later Mr . Wise was pushed out of the Government, and the only influence in the Cabinet that was antagonistic to the proposed agreement was disposed of. In due course the committee reported, and, acting upon its recommendation, Mr . Hughes signed an amended agreement with the company. That agreement came before the House in the following June, when Mr Wise had an opportunity to say some of the things he did not say when he was Postmaster-GeneralI did not see whj' the company should get the benefit of those developments with the financial strength of the Australian nation behind them. Further than that, I preferred to link up with an all-British Imperial scheme, and reap the advantage of any knowledge which the Imperial authorities acquired as a result of their operations. on the- For many years the Imperial Government had refused to be associated with the Marconi Company in any way. The British public had been agitated over the Marconi scandal of 1912, and, in consequence, the Imperial Government, although anti-Labour, developed a scheme by which the nation should have entire control of the wireless system, based on two fundamental principles, namely, that the system should be operated by the nation, and that it should be regarded as of vital importance in defence. Even as far back as 1909, when Mr Deakin was Prime Minister of Australia, this ParliaI ment resolved that wireless should be controlled by the nation in order to permit of the conveyance of news of the apthe proach of an enemy, and to assist in Those desiderata were regarded at that time as fundabut the scheme which the Government bas now submitted to the House is notably devoid of tbem. The beam system will not enable ships at sea to communicate to the mainland news of the approach of hostile vessels, and it will be useless as a means of saving life at sea, because it will be direct, and, fore, incapable of broadcasting. ""Wben Mr Hughes was urging the adoption of the original agreement, be said that Amalgamated ""Wireless Limited was an allAustralian Company, and bad no outside shareholders. Upon that assurance this Parliament was urged to invest Commonwealth money in the agreement, and we were told that there would be government control concurrently with all the advantages of private enterprise. The then Prime Minister pointed out that the Commonwealth was then losing £50,000 per annum on its existing radio system. At that time we bad a number of wireless stations wbicb were doing very useful work, but, said Mr Hughes, these by the aid of private enterprise would be completely transformed, and the Commonwealth, instead of losing £50,000 per annum, would make a profit of at least that amount. He assured us that the ratification of the .agreement was an urgent necessity, because the interests of the nation demanded that the scheme should come into immediate operation. The company, be said, could accomplish at once all that it bad promised to do. Three years bave elapsed, and we have no Avireless system other than that which the company took over from the Commonwealth. That system, which was to be transformed by the skill and adroitness of private enterprise, and by purging it of government ""go-slow"" methods, bas been no more successful than it was under the old regime. The Prime Minister admitted that while it bad been losing £50,000 per annum under government control, it is now losing £86,000 under the control of Mr Fisk ancl his associates.",39
79,Mr MARE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,That loss is spread over two years.,40
80,Mr ANSTEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"If that is so, the annual loss bas been £43,000, so that we are getting little financial advantage from the company's control. Furthermore, the company has not done any of the things wbicb it promised to do. One of the members of the committee wbicb reported upon the agreement was Senator Jobn D. Millen, wbo said in another place after the committee's investigations that nobody could have participated in the inquiry without concluding that there was very mucb that was .suspicious in therethe transaction. And Senator Wilson, wbo is now - a member of the Cabinet, interjected, ""Yes; and you are not the only one who holds the opinion that the whole surroundings are smellful."" Mr Fisk could promise nothing ^ to the committee without communicating with his directors - It had been said that the company was purely Australian in its composition, but when Mr Fisk wanted the opinion of his directors be had to communicate with the Marconi Company in England. Having received a cabled reply from that company, he returned to the committee and said that Amalgamated Wireless Limited could guarantee to carry out all the obligations to which the agreement would commit it. At that time the Marconi Company knew very well the attitude of the Britisb Government, because that attitude was never changed. If its directors had acted honestly, and made inquiries in official quarters, it must bave learnt that the Britisb Government would not consent to the company carrying out what it was promising to do. Of course, the committee could only conclude, after bearing Mr Fisk's message from the Marconi Company, that the Britisb authorities had been consulted and had given their consent. We know now that the company had never been in communication with the Britisb Government, and that it knew that it had no more power then to establish high-power stations in Great Britain than it has at the present moment, because successive Imperial Governments, ever since the Marconi scandal of 1912, bave been determined that the wireless system shall not be controlled by private enterprise. However, upon the assurances and promises given by Mr Fisk, the then Commonwealth Government subscribed to the agreement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and, in accordance with the agreement, the Commonwealth has provided £140,000 of capital; a further contribution of £40,000 appears on the Estimates this year, and another £140,000 has been - paid for the upkeep of the plant which the Commonwealth banded over to the company. In ordinary business, a company is required to complete its contract or submit to the cancellation of it . The proper attitude for the Government to adopt is to say to Amalgamated Wireless Limited , ""Proceed wi t b the arrangement into wbicb you have entered; if you cannot complete it , our duty will be to cancel it . "" Mr Wise, when he said that he pr©> ferred to link up w it b a Britisb Imperial scheme and reap the advantage of any knowledge which the Imperial Government acquired as a result of its operations, said furtherIf we had not been so mighty hasty about rushing into this agreement with a private company, about the Oth December, we would have been able to take advantage of this big Imperial scheme for wireless telegraphy throughout the world. We have three more years of experience to guide us, and as the company cannot carry out its contract, and as the original scheme bas been a failure, the Government should cancel the agreement and have nothing more to do with the company. If the company cannot fulfil its obligations and do what the country requires, the Commonwealth should, having regard to modern facts, link up with the British Government's wireless scheme. When I was speaking on this subject in 1922, I saidA ministerial majority is endeavouring to force this thing upon the country. It is fraught with disaster, failure, and fraud. It has been fraught with disaster, it bas been fraught with failure, and as to the third part of my prophecy I shall make no suggestion at the present moment. Mr . Wise went on to say, in 1922If we had not entered into this agreement we could have joined in that scheme without asking to be linked up. One of the reasons why I objected to the wireless agreement was that I have no faith in the company. I say that unhesitatingly. I felt that it was going to be a big speculative scheme. That agreement was signed on the 28th March, 1922, and so far we have obtained nothing out of it, because the company cannot fulfil its contract. It has become possessed of certain Commonwealth perty and of about £250,000 of Commonwealth money, but as it cannot fulfil one item of the contract into which it entered, the Government have come down with a proposal to cancel every obligation into which it entered. The purpose of this bill is to relieve the Marconi corporation and the gentlemen associated with it in Australia of their obligation to arrange Mr Anstey. for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in Great Britain , the fixing of rates to be charged for messages between Australia and the United Kingdom, the provision of a main trunk station in the United Kingdom, the erection and operation of stations in the United Kingdom and Canada, and the provision of a practical commercial wireless service between Australia, and stations in the United Kingdom and Canada. As a matter of fact it is to be freed from every obligation into which it entered.",40
81,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,And without the payment of compensation.,41
82,Mr ANSTEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"That is so. . There is to be no cancellation of the contract, which would be a business-like method of dealing with a corporation which after three years has proved a miserable failure and demonstrated its inability to do anything it agreed to do. A f t e r three years of the non-realization of promises and the demonstration of the incapacity of private enterprise to meet the immediate necessities of Australia, at this hour this oompany is to be permitted to enter upon a new agreement signed, as pointed out by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), by Mr George Mason Allard, a representative of the Government, and Mr W . T. Appleton, a representative of the Marconi people. Some time ago the Minister for Trade and  altercation as to whether it was Mr George Mason Allar d or Mr Horace Allard who was concerned in the original agreement. Great stress is laid on the fact that the Commonwealth has three representatives and an independent chairman on the board of. directors of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited . Mr George Mason Allard is one of the Commonwealth's representatives on the board, but with just as much decency. his partner, Mr . Bartholomew, might have been the Commonwealth representative, because Mr . George Mason Allard is linked with Bartholomew, Allar d and Company. Mr. Bartholomew represents the Marconi in pro- terests in Amalgamated Wireless, and Mr . Allar d represents the Commonwealth. I do not propose to go into what is proposed in the bill . The Prime Minister himself admitted that the beam system would be absolutely useless for those fundamental purposes, defence and l if e saving at sea, and. that it could only be operated during hours of darkness at both ends. As it will never be dark at both ends so far as Great Britain and Australia are concerned, the system must he miserable failure, and, of course, when that is .proved, as it must be, the Marconi people will ask for another agreement. There ought to be further investigation before this agreement is ratified, and steps should be taken to see that there are .not the same demonstrations and efforts as were witnessed in this chamber when the original agreement was ratified. Mr Wise drew attention to the enormous amount of propaganda in progress, and spoke of the Marconi representatives ing in the lobbies of Parliament. As matter of fact they were living on buttonholes of honourable members, trying to get their original agreement through. It is our duty to see that this absurd folly is not repeated. We ought to guided by the past, and in order that there may be a proper investigation before we enter upon a further agreement with this company which will permit it to things which it cannot guarantee to I move the following amendment: That after the word ""That"" the following allegations. words be inserted :- "" in view of the fact that many experts are of opinion that a beam station would be inadequate for Australia's quirements, and the British Government ing recommended the erection of high-power stations, the bill bo referred to a select committee of this House for investigation report."" Wben the original agreement was before this Parliament the then Prime Minister said that time was the essence of contract, but as three years have passed and nothing bas been clone so far, there evidently no need for hurry, and we bave plenty of time to see whether the comit pany are now more capable of carrying out their promises than they bave proved to be in the past.",41
83,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Parkes) [8.37] - We have listened this afternoon to a very illumiotber nating speech from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) in regard to the agreement submitted by the Governquestion, ment for endorsement by the House. I is another instance, shall I say, out wishing to be insulting, of fools ping in where angels fear to tread. Mr E. EILEY - Is the honourable ber one of the angels? Mr MARE. No, I am one of the fools.",42
84,Mr GABB,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,The honourable member years said something like that three years ago.,42
85,Mr MAER,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"I said then that I was a one of the fools. The more one learnB about wireless the less be finds be knows about it. During the last three years it bas probably made more advancement than bas any other brancli of science. While I sbould like to see a high-power station erected so that the commercial use of wireless might be thoroughly tested, I am willing to support au amended agreement for the erection of a beam station so that we may ascertain whether we can use the system commercially. This bas livnot yet been proved, but I think it a better to spend about £100,000 upon a the beam station than to build a high power station at a cost of £500,000. We have beard a good deal of talk today about the report of the Donald Oommitbe tee appointed by the Eamsay MACDonald Government. Just as some peculiar religious sects are inclined to pick out those portions of the Scriptures wbicb suit do their own ends, honourable members of the do, Opposition have culled sections of the report of that committee to support their Before resuming his seat, the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. reAnstey) said that the Britisb Government havis in favour of retaining the control of wireless communication. As a matter of and fact, it bas already declared that it is only in favour of exercising that control in relation to the dominions of the Empire, but to the exclusion of Canada'. the Wby sbould Canada be excluded from this control? H it be necessary for the is Britisb Government to control wireless within the Empire, how much more so is necessary for that control to be exercised over foreign corporations that seek to erect stations within the Empire ? Wby should the Marconi or any otber company be permitted to erect stations in Great Britain to communicate directly with all countries and not with Australia? Members of the British Labour Government shut their eyes to this phase of the but I contend that if wireless t is to be controlled by the British Governwithment it sbould attend to external stepcommunication before attempting to control internal communication. Honourable memmembers opposite claim that the British Government has always acted on the one plan so far as wireless is concerned, but as a matter of fact, during the last eleven it bas stultified itself every second or thir d year. It has retarded the progress of wireless within the Empire. Le t us examine what the Donald Committee has recommended. It has recommended first., that the Marconi Company should be permitted to communicate with foreign countries and Canada, and secondly, that the British post office should have a complete monopoly over wireless communication with the rest of the Empire. But it has advanced no reasons in support of these recommendations. seutial considerations, it has failed to explain why the approval given by the British Government i u July, 1921, to Australia to make its own .arrangements should be withdrawn, and why the pledge given by Mr Bonar Law, as Prime M i nister, in March, 1923, that licences would be granted for private communication with the dominions, should be dishonoured. As a matter of fact, it was as a result of the promise given by Mr . Bonar Law that a contract was made by the Commonwealth Government with Amalgamated Wireless Limited for the erection of a high-power station in Australia"" According to the Acting Leader of the Opposition, the present agreement is to relieve Amalgamated Wireless of the obligation under the original agreement, and the honourable member says that the company has refused to proceed with the erection of a high-power station in Great Britain. The truth is British Government has refused to allow the company to proceed with the erection of that high-power station. Mr E . RILEY - When the contract was entered into the company said that it had the necessary authority to erectthat station.",42
86,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"No . According to the agreement the company promised to endeavour to erect such a station within two years. I hold no brief for Amalgamated Wireless or for the Marconi Company, but it is not their f a u l t tbata bigb-power station has not been put up in Great Britain. We ought to be fair to these people. Tbey are not able to come here to answer charges levelled against tbem, and whatever may be said against them, we must also recognize that they provided the only wireless communication the land forces of Great B r it a in had at the outbreak of war. They stuck to the British Government. The Marconi Company was the only company within the Empire which the Government could control. Mr E . RILEY - Australi a had its own wireless system wbicb this Government controlled.",43
87,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,The wireless system in operation in Australia could not compare with that of the rest of the world. It was years behind in development.,43
88,Mr ANSTEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Does the honourable member claim that the Marconi Company was not aware that it could not erect a highIgnoring espower station in Great Britain ?,43
89,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"It was relying - on t.he promise made by the Britisb Government in 1921 that licences would be granted. Let us see how consistent the British Governments have been. I do not blame the MACDonald Government for the muddle. Honourable members opposite statedthis afternoon that all the Britisb Governments, Conservative, Liberal, and Labour, had been consistent. In July, 1913, the British Government decided that all wireless stations within the Empire should be state owned, but that licences should be granted to private companies. In December, 1914, the imperial wireless chain scheme was abandoned, and the contract with. the Marconi Company for the erection of stations was rescinded. In June, 1920, direct wireless communication with Australia was rethat the garded as impossible, and the relay system was favoured. Tbat was six years after the outbreak of the war. D u r i ng the war wireless stations working in Berlin and New York were heard in Australia. If messages can be dispatched from New Y o r k to Australia, I can see no reason why they cannot be dispatched from Australia and heard in New York, although I do not say that it is possible to conduct the service on a commercial basis. It is recognized that there are few countries in the world more difficult, in the summer months, for wireless work than Australia on account of our atmospheric conditions. In January, 1921, only a fewmonths after it had been decided that direct wireless communication with Australia was impossible, it was resolved that a relay service to Australia was possible provided that the relay stations were controlled by the Britis h Post Office, but Australia must adopt the scheme, and bear her share of the responsibility. In 1922 it was decided that direct communication with Australia was possible, but that it must be controlled by the British Post Office, but in July of the same year approval was given by the then British - Government to an Australian Government contract with the Marconi Company. All these conflicting decisions were made by expert committees, and I think they reveal very clearly that even the experts do not kuow what the position is. In March, 1923, it was resolved to issue licences to the Marconi Company and to any other private company .for the purpose of erecting stations to communicate with the various Dominions. On the 16th October, 1923, the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) was present at a meeting of the Imperial Economic Conference, when this matter was under discussion. Sir L. Worthington Evans, who was then the British Postmaster-General, in reply to a statement by Mr Bruce, to the effect that it was necessary for Australia to make reciprocal arrangements in England, otherwise it was useless to complete the Australian station, said I quite agree, and you can rely on us as Far as we are concerned, not to stand in way in the very least in the world. On the contrar\', we will hel]) you in every way we can. In ""November, 1923, the Britisb Government decided that the Marconi Company should be given a licence to provide an inter-Empire service except in respect to Canada and South Africa, but in February of this year it determined that the British Post Office must have a monopoly of Avireless communications with all the Dominions except Canada. Summing up the whole position, therefore, we find that various Britisb Governments bave been most inconsistent. In 1913 a competitive service within the Empire was approved, and in 1914 it was rejected. In 1921, direct wireless communication with Australia was regarded as impossible, but in 1922 it was thought to be quite practicable. In 1923, a competitive Imperial service was again approved, and in the same year the Marconi Company was given permission to communicate with Australia, but not with Canada. In February, 1924, the Marconi Company was given permission to continue to communicate with Canada, but not to communicate with Australia. - In October, 1923, the Britisb Post Office was willing that Australia should make reciprocal arrangements for communication with Great Britain; but, in 1924, it decided that only Government-owned stations should be erected in Great Britain. I ask honourable members how that is for consistency.",43
90,Mr BEENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Are you trying to establish the imbecility of the Britisb Government ?,44
91,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"I am trying to show bow unfounded were the claims which honourable members opposite made this afternoon respecting the consistency of the various Britisb Governments. The Acting Leader of the Opposition said that we own our post office, our telephones, and our trains. It is a pity, in my opinion, we have not a competitive telephone system, like they bave in America. America bas the most efficient telephone system in the world. I do not blame our telephone department for the prevailing inefficiency. The responsibility must rest upon this Parliament, as it has year after year cut down the vote for the necessary additional telephone works, and so bas your prevented adequate extensions from being made. It stands to my personal credit that I supported the policy of spending £9,000,000 for the purpose of overtaking arrears in constructional works.",44
92,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"""We all supported that.",44
93,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Then we shall take joint credit for it. Honourable members opposite bave contended that the Government should have full control of all wireless arrangements. Tbey will be saying next that the Government owns the ether through which the messages are transmitted, or that it owns the air that we breathe, and that, therefore, the people have no right to breathe it. The Acting Leader of the Opposition also said that the beam system was not as satisfactory as what he termed the broadcasting system, for the reason that by it wo would not be able to communicate with vessels at 3ea, as we can with the broadcasting system. I have not made that claim for it, but I remind the honourable member that it is not so long ago since we were told by experts that it was impossible for us to communicate by wireless with F i j i and New Zealand. It appears to me that some honourable members desire the Government to do nothing. They want it to be like Micawber, and wait for something to turn up. They are not prepared to follow the example of the German Government, which even before the war had wireless stations erected in every .one of its territories. It had very fine stations at Nauru and Rabaul, and on some of the vessels that we captured there was equipment for the erection of first class wireless stations in otber territories. I am not averse to the Britisb Post Office and the Marconi Company doing everything that they want to do. The Marconi Company assisted the Empire in its time of great need. Mr E. RILEY - Who is competing with the Marconi Company now?",44
94,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"No one, so far as I know; but there is no reason why there sbould not be competition. It is not very difficult to ascertain wby some of the British expert committees reported unfavorably on wireless developments, for the chairman of directors of one of the big cable companies, and men with similar interests, were members of come of tbem. It would conflict with their financial interests to support wireless. The Britisb Government seems to have adopted an extraordinary attitude. It says in effect to the Marconi Company, and any other company that desires to erect stations for experimental purposes, "" Build your station, but if it is a success you will not be able to work it, for we will take it from you.""",45
95,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"And quite right, too.",45
96,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Why ?,45
97,Mr FENTON,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,The Government would pay for it .,45
98,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"It seems to me to be extraordinary that, although the Government is able to use the brains of the best wireless experts in England-for it bas at its call the technical officers in firms like Siemens Brothers and Thompson and Company, instrument makers, machine manufacturers-it will do nothing to assist in the development of wireless. I would like to see our own post office erect a station in Australia, as well as the Marconi Company. Let them both get to work and demonstrate to us which would render the more efficient service to the public. I do not say that the post office would be less efficient than the Marconi Company. The Donald committee, in several parts of its report, condemns the British Post Office wireless operations, both financially and technically, l t states that the Leafield high power station, which was intended to be the Britisb end of the proposed Empire chain, has been operated at a substantial loss, and is an antiquated station of the arc type. In paragraph 30 of the report the committee admits that the station was not constructed on the most modern lines, and recommends its enlargement at a considerable expenditure. It states that the Cairo station has been a failure, and recommends its abolition. . It also says that the Northolt station bas been conducted at a loss, and it recommends the closing of the Stonehaven and Caister stations, which have also proved to be failures. Mr E. RILEY - We want a committee to make an investigation to see what we ought to do, in view of such failures a? those.",45
99,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"If we begin appointing committees, we shall probably find ourselves in a worse position than Great Britain. An ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. I shall support the bill for the reason that I believe it will save us £300,000. If we were to accept the tender of £487,000 for the erection of a high-power station as contemplated under the original agreement, we should probably find that it would be obsolete by the time it was ready for use. It would be far better to experiment with the cheaper scheme.",45
100,Mr BLAKELEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Then the honourable member admits that it is an experiment.,45
101,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,I do. It certainly has to be proved yet whether wireless is a commercial proposition.,45
102,Mr BLAKELEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,The honourable member is certainly candid.,45
103,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"The Britisb Government admits that. Tbis Parliament sbould not refuse to take action simply because it is impossible to guarantee that the beam system can be worked for 24 hours a day. The Prime Minister did not guarantee that, but if it was possible to operate it continuously for two: hours every day I say that would be worthwhile. I should like to see a competition in transmitting messages by wireless and by ordinary telegraph between Melbourne and Sydney. I believe that, if private enterprise were given an opportunity, it would be able to dispatch messages in balf the time now occupied, or even less. Countries like America, which give every encouragement to private enterprise, lead the world in telegraph and telephone matters. In an article in the London. Observer, of the 2nd March, 1924, Mr . Donald statedMy committee's recommendations are intended to leave complete scope'for private enterprise to develop its activities in all the .British dominions, as well as all over the world, if it chooses to do so.",45
104,Mr BLAKELEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,All the better if p r i - to most foreign countries. vate enterprise can persuade governments to put their cash into the venture.,46
105,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"That is not what is desired. Similar remarks by Mr Donald were reported in an interview published in the London Daily Telegraph, of the 29th February last. It is difficultto understand how Mr Donald can reconcile these statements with recommendations of his committee that the post office should monopolize wireless communication with the whole Empire, except Canada. The Donald committee says that the British Government should grant a licence to the Marconi Company, or any other company, to enable it to engage in wireless communication with any foreign country, but' not with the British dominions. that it is preferable by far to give a licence to a company that will operate within the Empire. The Labour party particularly has always claimed that the dominions should work out their own destiny, and that Australia should enjoy the same privileges as Canada. Donald committee did not advance a claim on principle for the general ownership and control of wireless by the state. If it had done this, its attitude could be understood. The committee, indeed, expressly states, in paragraph 27, of its report, that it has not considered this "" ideal scheme."" Parenthetically it may be observed that it is strange, if this scheme is ideal, that the committee has given no consideration to it . In the next sentence, however, the committee statesThe pioneer work has .been done by private enterprise, and the Marconi Company participates in long-distance and in continental wireless services under conditions which safeguard public interests. The committee does not even advocate state control of wireless communication with foreign countries. cases, is expressly excluded, although, if the principle were sound, it is in connection with foreign countries that state control of communication would be most desirable. Nor does the committee adopt the general principle of state control of wireless communication with the dominions, since Canada is excluded from its recommendations. Australia, Canada, South A f r i c a , and Indi a bave all expressed their opinion of state control by making arrangements with private enterprise, and the same remark also applies Indeed, in many cases, state ownership bas been abandoned after t r i a l . It is thus obvious that no principle bas guided the committee in its recommendations with regard to state ownership, which appear to be haphazard in their conception, and to afford merely an expedient without any logical, practical* basis behind them. the In conclusion, let me say again that I support the amended agreement because it represents a saving of money on the cost of experimenting with a high power station. Personally I should like to see such a station established, because it would give us an opportunity of testing whether or not wireless is commercially successful over long distances. During the late war, I claim no service, not even the aerial service, did more valuable work, than the wireless stations. One must give great credit to the Marconi Company for its investigations, for undoubtedly the advance made in wireless communication is due entirely to the Telefunken and Marconi comThe panies.",46
106,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,'Now they are one.,46
107,Mr BLAKELEY,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"And the Amalgamated Wireless Company is their ' ' pup.""",46
108,Mr MARE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"No ; it is the "" p up "" of this Parliament. It must be recognized that 500,001 of the 1,000,000 shares in the Amalgamated Wireless Company are held by the Commonwealth. Three of the directors were appointed by the Marconi Company, and three by the Government, and I think it will be admitted that the independent chairman is a really independent man, wbo is likely to f ill the position with credit to himself and to the Commonwealth. No honourable member, irrespective of the party to wbicb be may belong, can but admit that the independent director is a man with a wide vision. What bas been done in this matter by This, in most the honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes) stands to his credit.",46
109,Mr BRENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"The present Prime Minister thought his vision was too wide. He curtailed his vision, and then took his job.",46
110,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"The Prime Minister is also a man of wide vision. He saw that the scheme was a good one, but be realized at the same time that great forward strides were being made in the science of wireless. I read recently that the beam system was known as long ago as 1907, but, of course, not the particular beam system now under consideration. I hope that the system will be given a trial, and that it will prove commercially successful. At the present time all we know about it is what we have read. If an opportunity is given to the Amalgamated Wireless Company to erect a station and demonstrate whether or not long distance communication is commercially possible, the Commonwealth will be saved many hundreds of thousands of pounds. I urge the House to adopt the amended agreement.",47
111,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Y a r r a ) [9.14] - Tb e honourable member for Parkes (Mr . M a r r ) , if be bas succeeded in doing nothing else, has shown that a further in vestigation of the inatter is necessary. It is true that be apologized for plunging into the discussion, saying "" fools rush in where angels fear to tread,"" and it seems to me that the honourable member made confusion worse confounded. He read long extracts wbicb reminded me of the publicity work of the Marconi Company.",47
112,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,I take exception to that.,47
113,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Some of it sounded very stale and familiar.,47
114,Mr BRUCE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Most of what the honourable member read was from the Donald committee's report.,47
115,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"There was a good deal of the Marconi publicity "" s t u n t "" in it.",47
116,Mr MANN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,T b at is not fair.,47
117,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"No one has gone in for more publicity stunts than has the Marconi Company. The honourable member for Parkes states stands for competition; yet, in supporting the Marconi Company, he is standing behind an organization that is reaching out for world monopoly. I know nothing of the technicalities of wireless but I know something of the operations of monopolies, and any oue who has studied the subject of wireless knows that the Marconi. Company is endeavouring to reach out in all directions, and is in danger of becoming one of the - worse k monopolies in the world. In Australia, it is attempting to achieve its object with the aid of public money. It bas been said that the Amalgamated Wireless Limited was a pup of the Marconi Company, and the honourable member for Parkes says that this Parliament is also a pup of the company.",47
118,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,I did not say that. I said that Amalgamated Wireless Limited was the pup of this Parliament.,47
119,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"T b is agreement, providing partly for Government control and partly for control by private enterprise, is what I would term a mongrel proposition. If the honourable mem-, ber for Parkes, and other honourable members opposite, are so keen on private enterprise they should let this private enterprise company prove what it can do, and should not rush to Parliament tor £500,000 to assist it . Honourable members will remember what happened three years ago. I was not then a member of this House, but was sitting in the Speaker's gallery when the then Prime Minister tried to rush an agreement that through this House in the dying hours of that session.. He had the support of the members of the Country party, and had it not been for the threat made by the Leader of the Opposition to fight the issue, that agreement would have gone through. Because of the opposition to the agreement it was referred to a committee. The present Prime Minister was a member of that committee, whose recommendation was an absolute condemnation of the agreement. We should profit by the lesson wo then learned, and cause an investigatioi. co be made, into this matter. The success of the proposed scheme is doubtful, yet there are no guarantees provided in the agreement. Nevertheless, the honourable member for Parkes desires us to go on without any investigation or inquiry If , during the past three years, we had had any exthat he periences of this company which were of a satisfactory nature-if we could say that in the past it had done its work well, and that we could rely upon it I could understand the attitude adopted by the Government. But what has beenour experience of this company.? First, it approached the then Prime Minister and asked him to sign an agreement oroviding that the Government should take a. majority cf the shares, but that the cornpan;/ should bave a majority of the directors. That was too much for the committee, which recommended that the directors should number seven, three' of whom should be appointed by the Government, and three by the companv. with an independent chairman to be appointed by them. The independent chairman first elected was the ex-chairman of the Amalgamated Wireless Company. That showed that the company was not prepared to give'us a fair deal, or to be f r a n k and honest with"" the Government of this country. At the very first sign of dealings of that nature, we should have broken our partnership with the company. It was dangerous associated with a company like that, particularly when the nominees of the Government, however vigilant, were not experts, but had to sit alongside the experts of the company, who were "" running the rule "" over tbem all the time.",47
120,Mr R GREEN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Does the honourable member consider himself to be an expert?,48
121,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"I do no't; nor is the honourable member an expert. None of us in this House is an expert in wireless. In view of our past experience with this company, we should be wise if we cut our first loss and had no more to do with this company. If we are to have wireless, let us obtain it by some other means. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who has made a close study of this matter for some years, made a scathing indictment of the Go%'ernment in connection with this agreement. No intelligent observer could fail to recognize the force of the remarks of the honourable member, but no answer has been forthcoming. The case he put forward demands an answer. I was struck with the remarks of the honourable mem wanted an answer, from the Prime Minister to a definite question. I sbould have thought that an answer would immediately have been forthcoming. Is it true that this system, which the Government asks us to adopt, can only operate, at the most, for about two and a half bours a day?",48
122,Mr R GREEN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Can the honourable member answer that question ?,48
123,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"No , I cannot. I do not know anything about the beam system of wireless, but it has been stated that it could operate between Australia and England for only about two and a half hours each day. That statement was made by the honourable member for Batman, on the authority of experts, I was myself in formed by an expert that this system could operate only while it is dark at each end.",48
124,Mr R GREEN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,What is the standing of the expert referred to?,48
125,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"H is standing is better than that of the honourable member. It would have been easy for the Prime Minister to have given the honourable member for Gippsland a civil answer. He could have said either "" Yes "" or "" No "" to the question wben asked if it were true that the system could only operate when it was dark. We to be all know that it is dark at the same time in Australia and in England for only about two and a half hours in each period of twenty-four hours. Is it a fact that the beam system of wireless can ouly operate during that period? If so, the system is a farce. At the Imperial conference the Prime Minister stressed the importance of wireless from a defence point of view. Imagine a system of wireless for defence purposes that could operate only for two and a half hours each day! There is no answer to that question from the Prime Minister. When the original motion was before this House some years ago, the usefulness of wireless for the defence of Australia, and for the saving of life at sea was emphasized. If there is one thing which would justify the expenditure of money in connection with a wireless system, it is the fact that it may save life at sea. But this scheme will not do that, because it is a direct system. Every one knows that when a vessel is in danger at sea, its "" SOS."" signals are broadcast. Because of the fact that the messages go in all directions, many lives have been saved in the past. But this system will not permit of signals being sent in various directions.",48
126,Mr MARR,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,We have stations all round Australia which could receive such messages.,48
127,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"We have not. I bave looked at this agreement, as I did at the last one. In the previous agreement no penalties for the non-fulfilment of the contract, such as are contained in the most trifling business"" arrangements were provided, nor are any penalties provided for in this agreement. Two years ago the Prime Minister assured us that he bad guarantees, or guarantors, but what have they been worth? The honourable member for Parkes asked if we were to sit down and do nothing. That is what the company has been doing while handling the money of this country. What has it done to carry out even one of its many fulsome promises ? During the debate in the New Zealand Parliament in July last year on the subject of wireless, the question was raised whether the Government was to get into the clutches of the Marconi Company. The Prime Minister, Mr Massey, replied, "" There is no danger of the Marconi Company doing business with us."" Mr. Massey spoke at the Imperial Conference, and on behalf of New. Zealand he said, "" Empire wireless should be under the control of the different countries of the Empire,"" I support that view. In its dealings with us this company has put the rule over the representatives of the Commonwealth Government. One has only to take the tenders which were called for the erection of a power station in tralia to see that. Even a child could see that it was intended that one company only should tender. The conditions imposed rendered it absolutely impossible for any one but the Marconi Company to submit a tender. Let me give honourable members one illustration. Tenders were called on the 20th February, 1923, and closed on the 30th April following-a jjeriod of ten weeks. During that short period it was absolutely impossible for many firms to get into touch with their head offices, or for prices to be prepared. When requests were made for an extension of time, they were refused on the ground that time was the essence of the contract. Notwithstanding that, however, nothing has since been done. Among the conditions of the tender was one requiring that the transmitters ing energy were to be free from injurious harmonics. It is claimed by many experts that no transmitter is free from injurious harmonics, but the Marconi Company claimed that its valve transmitter was free from this defect. As the only company which had a patent for such a transmitter was the Marconi Company, it was evident that only one company could tender. The other people said, ""Even if you admit that the Marconi Company's transmitter is the only one which is free from injurious harmonics, why not invite separate tenders for the aerial towers, the plant, and the transmitters, and so promote competition ?"" But Amalgamated Wireless Limited absolutely refused to call for three separate Mr Scullin. tenders. Instead, tenders covering all requirements were called for. It was specified that the transmitter had to be free from injurious harmonics; Under the circumstances the Marconi Company was the only tenderer, as it possessed the patent, and therefore had an absolute monopoly of that type of transmitter. Amalgamated Wireless Limited is really a pup of the Marconi Company.",48
128,Mr BLAKELET,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,The Marconi Company was told to bave its plans and specifications ready.,49
129,Mr SCULLIN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Of course. It was laid down that the successful tenderer must provide and operate a power station in England. The consent of the British Government bad to be obtained, yet only a period of ten weeks was allowed for tenders to be submitted. The AmalgaAusmated Wireless Limited had then been in operation for ten months, and had failed to carry out its part of the agreement. I agree with the statement made by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, that' wireless communication should be under the control of the different governments of the Empire. It would be exceedingly dangerous to allow private companies, and foreign companies at that, to control wireless communications throughout the Empire. For our own security, safetyand protection, whether in peace or war, whether trade war or military war, the Commonwealth Government sbould control the wireless system of this country. I cannot understand why the Government, if we are still in the experimental stages respecting long-distance wireless, did not radiatenter into an arrangement with the British Government for it to build a high-powered station in England, and for this Government to build one bere, in order to communicate with each other. Tbat would have established the system on a practical basis. But instead we entered into an agreement with a private company, virtually giving a monopoly to the Marconi Company for all the necessary material and apparatus. Highpowered stations were to be built in Australia and Britain. That was too big a proposition for this country to accept, and we opposed it. I suggest that an investigation should now be made as to the best course to pursue. Tbere is no hurry to ratify this agreement. The committee of inquiry, if appointed, could obtain expert opinion, and after weighing all the evidence placed before it, report back to this Parliament. This should be done before we attempt to renew an agreement with a company that has broken every promise it made under the original agreement. A case has been made out for further investigation, and in favour of the appointment of a select committee to obtain expert opinion and advice, and to report its conclusions to this House.",49
130,Mr BRUCE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [9.35] - The amendment moved by the Opposition is quite unnecessary, and cannot possibly be accepted by the Government. The whole debate, has almost exclusively circled round happenings of three years ago. Honourable members opposite bave not dealt with the point at issue-whethe r we should erect a high-powered station to cost almost £500,000, or should substitute for it a beam station, as contemplated under the amended agreement which the Government Uas brought down. The discussion was opened by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who, on the subject of wireless, never appears to be on as sound a ground as be generally is when discussing otber subjects. When the parliamentary committee that was appointed three years ago considered this subject, and brought in a report to this House, the honourable member for Batman, after I , as chairman, had signed the report on behalf of the committee, unexpectedly presented a minority report, which was the first indication to the other members of the committee that be dissented in the least from tbem. Tbat was the honourable gentleman's first effort respecting wireless, and be bas been singularly unfortunate ever since in connection with this subject. To-day, in making what was intended to be a really strong attack upon the Government, be failed lamentably, and I cannot associate myself with the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) in complimenting him upon the convincing case that he made out. He dealt with very few matters that are really germane to the new agreement. He discussed the original agreement, and stressed very mucb the bad faith of the Marconi Company. He gave chapter and verse for his conten[153] tions, and to these I take little exception. But I do take exception to what the honourable member for Yarra said, because, as usual with him, he did nothing but fling about insinuations and innuendoes respecting . the actions , of the Amalgamated Wireless Limited. The substance of his implications was directed at the three government directors on the board of the company, of which board the independent member is the honourable member for Worth Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes). The honourable member for Yarra said that the directors did not hesitate to be the tools of the Marconi Company, nor to - frame tenders, well knowing that they were not genuine, and were framed solely in the interests of the Marconi Company, wbo apparently bad some mystic power over the directors, and could make them do anything it liked. I am perfectly certain that insinuations of that character will carry no weight at all with the people of this country, particularly wben those insinuations come from the honourable member for Yarra. The honourable member for Batman stressed the point that when introducing the measure I appeared to have been in trouble respecting the periods I mentioned, and the attitude adopted by the British Government, because I bad said that during the Imperial Conference, in 1921, the Britisb Government bad stated that it would do nothing to interfere with any scheme of wireless that Australia chose to establish, and that in March, 1923, Mr Bonar Law reversed that policy, and said that licences would not be issued. He contended that the two statements were hopelessly irreconcilable. Any ordinary person, without a full knowledge of the facts, might generally think that that was the position, but the honourable member for Batman cannot for one moment believe that that was so. He was a member of the parliamentary committee, and he knows perfectly well that at the time the committee were sitting we communicated with the British Government, which said that Australia would be given wireless facilitiesHe remembers that we were in some difficulty on the subject, and called as a witness the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W. M . Hughes), who gave us his version of what had taken place at the 1921 conference, when an assurance had been given by the British Government that there would not be the slightest trouble in getting the facilities we wanted for the erection of a station in England.",50
131,Mr BKENNAN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,Exactly .,51
132,Mr BRUCE,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"That was well known to the honourable member for Batman, but when speaking today, he did not disclose those facts to the House, so that honourable members might be able to judge exactly what the position was at that time. I felt that I should clear up this point in justice' to myself. The substance of the case now being put forward by the Opposition, is that we should go right back to the beginning, and again consider whether it would not be very much better to conduct our wireless operations through government agency in the same way as the post office is controlled. I would point out to the honourable member opposite, who may hold that view that we have made definite arrangements as to the basis upon which we should conduct these operations, and we have subscribed to the capital of this company in which we own a majority of the shares, consisting of one share more than those held by outside shareholders. Honourable members opposite have based their case to a great extent upon the bright and shining example set by (be British Government. The honorablo member for Parkes (Mr Marr) dispelled any idea of that character, and his speech was a complete surprise to honourable members opposite, because many of them believed that the British Government had taken a consistent attitude on wireless, treating it as a government monopoly, and allowing no one else to participate in it . Having quite genuinely believed that, honourable members opposite bave led themselves into a trap which, in view of their protestations, has placed them in a difficult position. What the British Government did was to allow licences to be issued to any one for the erection of wireless stations anywhere, except to communicate with Australia and ono or two of the other Dominions. If honourable members opposite had appreciated that position, they would not have been so enthusiastic in their condemnation of this Government, and would have bad something to say about the British Government showing preferential treatment in the granting of licences, to the. detriment of Australia. I fought that position strenuously all the time that - I was in England. Honourable members opposite have objected to the beam system at any price. The reason they do so is that they are in opposition, and the Government has suggested the beam system. For no other reason than that they would be prepared, apparently, to proceed with the construction of a high-powered station. I have no hesitation in saying that to erect at the present time a high-powered station would be a most reckless thing to do, and no Government could undertake it in view of the developments that have taken place, and undoubtedly will take place, in wireless communication. The question at issue is whether we should construct a high-powered station or accept a contract for the erection of a beam station. The British Government has examined the facts, has come to the conclusion that a beam station is worthwhile, and has entered into a contract with the Marconi Company for such a station capable of communicating between Greab Britain and Canada for eighteen hours a day, between Great Britai n and South Africa for eleven hours a day, between Great Britai n and Indi a for twelve hours a day, and between Great Britai n and Australia for seven hours a day. That period of seven hours a day has also been stipulated in the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I am not expert enough to say whether the station to be erected in Australia will be able to communicate with Great Britain for seven hours a day, but I would direct the attention of honourable members to the terms of the agreements entered into by the Commonwealth and Britisb Governments. The company has said that it can communicate for seven hours a day, and both Governments have said, "" It is for you to show us that you can do what you claim. We are prepared to enter into a contract w it b you if you will accept the responsibility, and guarantee that you will give the service you undertake to give."" Beam wireless today has reached a stage of development similar to that reached by highpowered wireless in 1921. At that time no one could say that, with any kind of station, long distance wireless communication was possible. The Government entered into an agreement, which, after it had been revised by a committee of this Parliament, provided that guarantees should be supplied by the contractor to the satisfaction of the directors representing the Government on the board of directors. guarantees were to be given to the satisfaction, not of the board, but of the Government directors on the board. A majority of the members of the board could not override the Government directors. Although it was necessary to guarantee to the Commonwealth in every way possible that the service contracted for would be rendered, it was recognized within a year that the service could be given, and thab long-distance wireless was a commercial proposition. To-day such an agreement could be entered into without any guarantees, if we were dealing, with a reputable firm. The British Government, in 1921, on the advice of its experts, refused to listen to any proposal for the erection of stations to communicate over a distance of from 10,000 to 12,000 miles, because they said it was quite impracticable. But the British Government's view has gradually changed, and today, through the agency of the British Post Office, it is erecting stations to communicate over those distances, and no one raises any doubt about its being a practicable proposition. The Marconi Company says that it can give a certain service with a beam station, but whereas the British Government contended in 1921 that the Marconi Company could not just if y its claim, it readily admits today that it can do so, aud has signified its readiness to erect reciprocal stations in Great Britain to communicate with our stations. The Government is strongly of opinion that it should not proceed at the present time with the erection of a highpowered station at a cost of £500,000, but should enter into a contract for the construction of a beam station, with the necessary guarantees and safeguards. The contract provides for a far larger number of words to be communicated daily than could be communicated by a high-powered station operating at a rate of twenty words per minute for twelve hours daily. The Government was further in fluenced i u its decision by the fear that in two or three years' time, a highpowered station might become obsolete, in which event it would be useless; but on the other hand, if the beam system is not a success, and if the Government is not able to recover anything under the guarantees, we shall at least have the five masts, which will be erected so that they can be used for a highpowered station. « It appears to me that The a beam station is the only practicable business proposition. The debate should have turned upon the issue of a highpowered station or a beam station. Objection has been taken that there is no period of time fixed for the erection of the station, and it has been alleged that in that respect the agreement is even worse than the dreadful one entered - into previously. The statement that no time is fixed is quite wrong, for the agreement provides for the company(a) providing to the satisfaction of the Representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors of the Company for the erection in Australia of a main trunk station capable of providing (as soon as a suitable corresponding station has been erected in the United Kingdom and/or Canada) a commercial wireless service to communicate with such corresponding stations. ' The agreement proceeds to set out the number of words per day, and the number of days during which the service shall be provided. The station has to be erected as soon as a suitable corresponding station is erected in Great Britain . As a station in Australia is useless unless there is a similar station in Great Britain , the provision that a station must be erected here as soon as oue is erected in Great Britain definitely sets a term to the agreement, and it is the only term that is of any use, because we do not want a station here unless there is a reciprocal station in Great Britain . A further safeguard is that it is only after the agreement has been entered into for the erection of a station within a reasonable time that the Amalgamated Wireless Company will be released from any of the obligations under the original agreement, about which we have heard so much. No particular anxiety need bo felt regarding the period fixed. It bas been alleged that the. Commonwealth Government has been pouring out money to the Amalgamated Wireles3 Company in respect of the stations taken over, and that the agreement involved the Commonwealth in a tremendous loss, with corresponding benefit to the company. Under clause 7 of the original agreement the company undertook to take over the stations that the Government was then operating in Australia, and to operate tbem on behalf of the Government. Before the company took over the stations, the Government was losing £50,000 a year on them, but it was contemplated that when the main trunk station was erected it would be possible to so reorganize the service that our requirements could be met without a financial loss, and there were even suggestions that there would be a profit. It was quite obvious, however, that there would be no profit until the main station had been erected. It. was arranged that the stations should be taken' over immediately, but that until the main station was erected the Government would bear the cost of them and would receive the revenue from them. They were to be operated, however, by the company, as it was felt that this would be the best way to work up the organization and get the whole thing on a modern basis, so that the existing stations could connect with the main station as soon as it was ready. It was thought that when the main station was erected the Commonwealth would be relieved of the loss, even if it did not receive a profit. The honourable member for Batman asked me a question relating to the amounts paid by the. Government under clause 7. I gave him some figures which have been apparently misunderstood by honourable members. I stated that the payments out were £139,000, and the payments in £51,000. The payments out were for a period of two years and two months, since the stations were taken over, but payments in were for one year and ten months. The receipts do not come to hand for some after the expenses have been met. If the monthly amount paid out and the monthly amount received be calculated, it will be found that these stations are now costing the Commonwealth about £36,000 a year, although they have been extended somewhat, whereas prior to their being taken over by the company they were costing us over £50,000 a year. There is, therefore, a certain gain to the Commonwealth. It has also been argued that it is necessary to have a high-power station in Australia. The British Government advised lis to have both, but we said that that was an extravagance that we could not contemplate. The reason given for a high-power station is that it would be more suitable for communicating with a fleet scattered about the Pacific Ocean. Honourable members opposite bave suddenly developed an extraordinary tenderness for Australia's defence, which bas not been exhibited so acutely on other occasions. I can only say that the stations that we have will communicate a Mr Bruce. Certain distance. There seems to be an idea that we could not communicate at all. If Great Britain had a high-power broadcasting station, and desired to send instructions to her fleet in Australian waters, we could receive those instructions. The Commonwealth Government cannot agree that the advantages suggested are suflicient to warrant an expenditure which would certainly be £300,000 or £400,000 more than, will be necessary for the station that is contemplated. Another point that was made-and made with great poignancy-by two honourable members was in regard to the saving of life at sea. Apparently those honourable members bave an idea that wben a ship is in distress it receives a message. 1 suggest that what happens is that it sends a message stating that it is in distress. Our receiving stations will be quite adequate to receive any message that a ship would be capable of sending out. Honourable members need not be anxious about the safety of those at sea, whichever type of station is adopted. The suggestion has been made that there is something quite improper about this matter. I again remind honourable members that Amal- gamated Wireless Limited is not identical with the Marconi Company, and is not a "" pup "" of that company. It is an Australian company. The Marconi Comtime pany bolds sbares in it, as everybody knows. Upon payment of a fee the shar.e register can be inspected and information obtained as to wbo holds sbares in the company.. The Marconi Oompany is only one of the shareholders. It does not hold a controlling interest, or anything approaching it. The shares are scattered among people tbroughout the length and breadth of Australia. A large number are held by shipping companies in Melbourne and Sydney in particular. Therefore, the suggestion that this is the Marconi Company, or a pup of that company, and that its policy can be directed by the Marconi Company, is absolutely untrue and unfounded. The Commonwealth Government actually controls the majority of the shares in the company, and it is for that Government to determine its policy. Neither the Marconi Company nor anybody else can lay down what the policy shall be. The main point to remember is that three of the directors represent the old Amalgamated Wireless Limited shareholders-not , 'as has been suggested by honourable members, the Marconi Company. Three other directors represent the Commonwealth Government, and the seventh director is an independent one. I think it is lamentable that suggestions should continually be made that improper things are being done. ""Wby can we not discuss this measure, on the merits of whether it is better to go forward with a high-power station or substitute for it the beam system at a very much smaller expense, with the possibility of establishing it within a period of twelve months, and the certainty that even if it does not function to the extent anticipated, and we eventually have to erect a high-power station, we"" shall not be retarding the matter very greatly, but we shall certainly be safeguarding the Commonwealth against a loss of nearly £400,000 if the beam system proves successful. Nobody can state definitely whether this will succeed or fail. We are making an experiment. have never suggested that the system has proved itself. The British Government has communicated to Australia its readiness to give a limited service. It has entered into an agreement with the Marconi Company guaranteeing a seven hours' service to Australia. The company will have to give guarantees to the Commonwealth Government that it will provide the service laid down, and those guarantees must be acceptable to the representatives of the Government on the board. For the reasons I have stated, the Government cannot accept the suggestion that this matter should be referred to a committee. That would only involve further delay. The circumstances today are in no way parallel with those that existed on the previous occasion, when no agreement bad been entered into with Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and the business was being started from the beginning. We now propose merely to vary the terms of an arrangement that has already been subjected to a searching examination by this House and by a committee. The only decision to which we have to come is whether a long distance high-power wireless station shall be erected; or whether we shall substitute for that a beam station, in co-operation with the British Government, which is erecting a station of the same type and on the same plan to communicate with us.

146,Mr MANN,SOLDIERMENTAL CASES I N,"Perth) [10.24], - I directed a question to the Treasurer today about the treatment of mentally affected ex-soldiers in. Western Australia. For a long time past the position of tbese soldiers has not been satisfactory. Early this year an improvement in their position was made by the completion of special arrangements for their treatment in a ward of the Hospital for the Insane. In February last the Treasurer, on his visit to the state, entered into an agreement with the State Government by which proper provision was to be made for the treatment of these cases. But no progress has been made in carrying out that agreement. The matter is of grave concern, and bas occasioned considerable public feeling in Western Australia. On two occasions T have asked questions about it in this House, and the Treasurer has told me that no progress has yet been mado to carry out the agreement entered into with the State Government. I understand that be attributes the fault to the State Government, but it is no satisfaction to the men or to their relatives and friends, wbo are greatly distressed, to know which Government is to blame. Tbey are only concerned that steps should be taken to put everything on a proper footing at once. If the fault lies with the State Government I urge the Commonwealth Government to take active steps either to see that the state fulfils its obligation in the matter or to make adequate arrangements of its own. The inaction is becoming a scandal.",55

The site was chosen upon the advice of all the experts in Western Australia. The arrangement was that the' cost of the building was to be equally borne by the Commonwealth and the State, and that the building was to be sufficiently large to accommodate 70 pationts. For some of these the Commonwealth would be responsible; for the others, men who bave become mentally afflicted in civil life, the state would be responsible. It was underStood that all the arrangements were satisfactory and that the work would, be taken in hand almost immediately, but unfortunately a legal difficulty arose between the Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth and the Crown Solicitor of the state, and subsequently otber obstacles were raised by the State Government.
