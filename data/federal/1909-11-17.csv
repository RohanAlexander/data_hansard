1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Yesterday I promised the honourable member for Maranoa to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining the cause of delays in the transmission of telegramsfrom Queensland, and am now in possession of the following reports:13th instant - Pressur e of business andindifferent working. Fault on Brisbane side. 15th instant - Faul t intermittent throughout the day. Seven Queensland lines faulted. Cause of trouble not kno/wn. 16th instant - Fault . One line broken down. Ten insulators broken between Glen Innes and Tenterfield.' The interruptions and delays which have occurred have been due partly to overwork, and partly to faults which the Department have' not been, able to control, and about which I am not able yet to give full information. At the present time there are seven interstate telegraph lines in Queensland, and six in New South Wales, to carry the business between Brisbane and Sydney. Last year it was proposed to erect a seventh on the New South Wales side, but the work was deferred for want of' funds. Provision is made for it in this year's Estimates, the amount of Â£ 7 , 9 3 7 having been set down for the purpose. The length of the new line will be 495J miles. When it has been completed it is hoped that the seven lines between Brisbane and Sydney will be equal to all the requirements - of the business. Faults must occur. Sometimes they are due to accident, at other times to malicious injury to material, and occasionally to causes which we cannot explain.",14
2,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster General able to give me a reply to a letter sent to him a little while ago on behalf of the Erskineville Municipal Council, in reference to the removal of telegraph poles ? The council wishes for an answer.",14
3,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not remember to have received a letter or a communication by word of mouth on the subject; but I shall cause inquiry to be made, with a view to ascertaining whether there is a record in the office. SUPPLY OF LIQUORTO CADETS.",14
4,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that at a military tattoo, recently held under the auspices or with the consent of the Defence Department, at which a large number of cadets were present, tickets were given for refreshments, and lads seventeen years of age and under were supplied with beer and cigarettes ?",14
5,Dr LIDDELL,Unknown,How horrible !,14
6,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that boys of the ages to which I have referred went home intoxicated ? I have evidence with which to support the statement which I am now making. I understand that no provision whatever was made for the supply of other than intoxicating drinks, of which a number of lads partook to excess. In the event of similar demonstrations being held in the future under the auspices of the. Defence Department, will instructions be given that if refreshments are provided, none but unintoxicating liquors shall be supplied, at any rate to persons under the age of twenty-one years?",14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Neithe r the Minister of Defence nor myself is aware of the occurrence, but my honourable colleague informs me that he will at once take steps to inquire into the complaint, and if it is well founded will see that there is no repetition of the arrangements complained of. ADJOURNMENT {.Formal). CONTRACT' IMMIGRANTS.",14
8,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [ n . 7 ] I desire to move the adjournment of the FTouse to discuss a 'definite matter of urgent public importance, viz.) "" The administration of the Contract Immigrants Act in Western Australia."" Five honourable members /laving risen in their places, Question - proposed.",14
9,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"X t is some months since I first took occasion to draw the attention of the. Minister of External Affairs to the immigration of foreigners to Western Australia, and at intervals since I have spoken on the matter-chiefl y on grievance dayswith a view to keeping the Department fully alive to the position. It appears to me, and to those who advise me, that the number of the foreignerschiefly Italians and Austrians-wh o come to Western Australia in batches, and go straight to work at different places in the State, in many instances obtaining employment at the expense of Britishers, indicates that they do not enter the Commonwealth without having made an arrangement for obtaining employment on landing. I propose, in justification of this statement, to quote from a return with which I have been supplied and which I believe to be accurate, showing the number of foreigners employed at various places in mv constituency and just outside it. Most of the men are engaged in laborious manual labour, many of them being employed in the bush. The first company about whose employees I have information is the Kurrawang Wood-line Company.",15
10,Mr HEDCES,Unknown,Where does it operate?,15
11,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member must know, because he is, I understand, its managing director.",15
12,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I do not know of company of that name. Mr .FRAZER - Perhaps the company charge that they do. to which I refer may not be registered under that name. Possibly it is the Western information. Australian Gold-fields Firewood Supply Company. At any rate, the honourable a member knows where the firm is operating. contract. It is engaged in supplying wood to the Kalgoorlie mines. Independent of engine, men, horse drivers, andnavvies, it employs twenty Britishers and 360 foreigners in cutting firewood. The Kurramia Wood-line Company, of which Mr E. Graham Price is general manager^ employs twenty-nine Britishers and 162 foreigners as firewood cutters and loaders. The Lakeside Woodexisting. line Company, of which Mr A. Porter is general manager, employs Britishers and 170 foreigners, and the Lancefield Wood-line Company, same manager, fifteen .Britishers and thirty-five foreigners, as firewood cutters and loaders. The Lancefield! Gold Mining Company, of which Mr E. H . Taylor is manager, employs seventy foreigners in mining and kindred work, the number of British employees being unknown. The Orion Gold Mining Company at Niagara, of which Mr J. Sknne is manager, employs none but foreigners, of _ whom there are fourteen engaged in mining. Altogether eighty-three Britishers and 767 foreigners are employed by the six companies which I have mentioned. This is surely prima 1 facie evidence that preference is given to foreigners at the expense of Britishers.",15
13,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The companies mentioned appear to employ about 10 per cent. Britishers, and 90 per cent, foreigners.",15
14,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Of the mining companies employed at that particular work, the firm of Bewick, Moreing and Company are the worse offenders, and appear to wish to work their outback mining propositions almost entirely with foreigners, a great many being employed at the Sons of Gwalia and at the Great Fingal mines. The position has become so serious that Mr Foley, a delegate to the Miners' Conference held in Coolgardie on the 23rd March last, stated thatHe knew of cases where, on the Gwalia mine, nearly the whole of the men on a level were aliens. The day shift men were generally Australians, but on the other two shifts 82 out o l 100 were nliens-mostl y Italians, who knew so little of English that some of them had to be led to the shaft and backed into the skips.",15
15,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Do they work for any lower wages?,15
16,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I do not make a,15
17,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I only asked for,15
18,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I could not make such charge, because tli'ey chiefly work under In the great bulk of cases the day work is given to an Australian. Where the companies have to pay a certain wage for a' certain time, - chiefly an Australian is employed, but when it is a question of letting a contract they apparently rely upongetting more work at less cost from Italians or Austrians than they can get from Britishers under the conditions now",15
19,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That means that they nineteen do work for lower wages?,15
20,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I dare say that it under the - does work out that way.,15
21,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,It is the worse system that could be introduced.,16
22,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is certainly a most dangerous system in regard to working mines. It has a tendency not only to reduce wages, but also to increase the risk under which the miners work. that a number of the accidents which have taken place in Kalgoorlie and North Coolgardie gold-fields are directly traceable to the fact that the men were employed under contract conditions.",16
23,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I believe that that applies to contract work all round ?,16
24,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I believe that it does, and in this particular case it is a most pernicious system. Referring to the men who had to be backed into the skips, Mr. Foley continuesThey were a danger to every man in the mine, though not to Australians, because so few were employed. He means that they were a danger to one another when they could not be a danger to Australians, who might reasonably be expected to be employed there, but did not get employment. The Asiatics were a curse out back, and any one going to Leonora would think, from the smell of camels and sight of turbans, that he was in Afghanistan. This matter is, I think, sufficiently serious to demand the close attention of the Minister of External Affairs. He cannot claim that I have not given him fair warning in regard to my views. I have elicited certain information on the subject which I now place before him, and which, I believe, is accurate. I may say that the figures .1I have quoted applied to Kurrawang Wood-line on the ist of June, 1909, to the Lakeside and Kurramia Wood-lines on the 25th June, 1909, to Lancefield Woodline and mine on the ist July, 1909, and to the Orion Gold Mine on the ist June, 1909. The figures are, in my opinion, sufficiently serious to call for inquiry at the hands of the Minister, with a view to seeing whether or not the Contract Immigrants Act is being violated by the introduction of men who undoubtedly land at Fremantle in batches and walk straight to positions, in spite of the fact that in aU these centres there are a number of Britishers waiting for employment.",16
25,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I suppose that the men who run the companies call themselves good - Empire builders?,16
26,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We do hear expressions of opinion from them in favour of the gift of Dreadnoughts.,16
27,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Is the honourable member in favour of the unions paying men to naturalize the foreigners? I believe Mr Frazer - The question of naturalizing foreigners has been brought under my notice. If we are to have these foreigners in numbers, I think it is better that they should accept the responsibilities of citizenship and hold themselves liable as citizens to defend the country rather than that they should be freelances, and if we happen to get into trouble with the country from which they come they should be able to say, "" We are citizens of another power. We place ourselves under the control of our Consul and take up the position of neutrals.""",16
28,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They would be a disturbing element.,16
29,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Yes . There may be other reasons for the desired naturalization of these alien immigrants.,16
30,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,After they have been naturalized they cannot be termed foreigners ?,16
31,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"No , but the fact remains that they are not naturalized when they land. My honourable friend must be aware that the statements I am making are well iknown to any man who has been in Western Australia for any considerable time.",16
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,How many are there ?,16
33,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The half-dozen companies I have quoted employ 83 Britishers and 767 foreigners at the particular work mentioned. That fact is, I think, quite enough to warrant an inquiry. I have previously assured the Minister that in Western Austialia there are men available and willing to work in these industries if they get an opportunity. I make this statement deliberately, because I know the condition of the labour market there. It does appear to me to be a case which deserves the attention of the Minister, and I think that I am justified in taking this course to call public attention to it.",16
34,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [11.20] - It is true that on two occasions the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has brought this matter before the House, and acting upon the information which he submitted I immediately caused inquiries to be instituted. He has moved the adjournment of the House today to call attention to the administration of the Contract Immigrants Act, and I presume that owing to something - probabl y some alleged defect in the administration of the Act-h e is of opinion that immigrants are coming into Australia under contract who ought not to be allowed so to come here. If any European of good character and ability and not subject to the disqualification contained in the Immigration Restriction Act, or Contract Immigrants Act, desires to come here and cast in his lot with us there is nothing in the law which prevents him from carrying out his desire.",16
35,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And casting a number of Australians out of work.,17
36,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am speaking of the law of Australia at the present time. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said he believes that at present Italian and Austrian immigrants are coming in under contract, but he adduces no evidence to show that that is the case. He admits that.",17
37,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,No .,17
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"All the honourable memberdid was to call attention to certain facts, namely, that immigrants are coming into Australia, and that they are able to get work with remarkable facility.",17
39,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That they land in batches and EO straight to employment.,17
40,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member says that these immigrants immediately get employment. So far as one can ascertain, the facts appear to be as he stated. But to argue that because men arrive in Australia and are able to get work shortly afterwards, therefore they come under contract, is an argument which I am afraid is not warranted by the investigations which have been made.",17
41,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It warrants a little inquiry on the Minister's part.,17
42,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It warranted not only an inquiry but also a very strict administration of the Act and the closest scrutiny. This is not the first time that this question has been raised here. These people have been coming into Australia and going out of it in a regular stream, as I shall show presently. So far back as 1904, when the honourable member for West Sydney was Minister of External Affairs, the complaint which has been made today was made to him. He sent an officer to Western Australia specially to make inquiries, and after remaining there for some time that officer said that he was unable to find any substantiation of the statement as to persons having arrived under contract. Later, a Special Commission was appointed by the"" Government of the State to inquire into the matter, and :n the course of its report it statedWe are of opinion that it is very unlikely that any aliens are imported under any actual contract or agreement, but we think it very probable that some of them have been induced to come by letters from friends already here who are in a position to get them work on their arrival. Many, however, seem to have come out quite on the chance of getting employment, and have had to go from place to place a good deal before finding any. It is quite possible, neveitheless, that some secret understanding may have existed at times .between persons here and in Europe whereby men were sent out to work for contractors in the State, but we do not think that this has gone on to any considerable extent, if at all. Later, when ex-Senator Playford was in Western Australia, he made inquiries, but was not able to find any specific evidence. The question then was : Are aliens coming into such an extent as to seriously affect the labour market? It was a very proper inquiry to make, but it was found that in 1906 there was an excess of twenty-five departures of Italians over arrivals, the figures being 507 and 482 respectively, and in 1907 an excess of tixty-three departures over the arrivals, the figures being 552 and 489 respectively.",17
43,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Accordin g to those figures, there ought to be no Italians in Australia shortly.",17
44,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There may be a constant decrease in the number, and if that consummation is effected the desire of my honourable friend will be realized. I am stating recorded facts.",17
45,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I doubt the accuracy of the figures very much.,17
46,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am giving the returns supplied to the Department. Of course, if the honourable member has better information than that, I liope he will lay it before the House.",17
47,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I have not.,17
48,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"For the first ten months of 1908 there was an excess of thirty-six departures of Italians over arrivals, so that the figures for the three years show a considerable decrease of these aliens.",17
49,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,But the complaint re'ates to the arrivals during the current year.,17
50,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have given the latest figures available, and which were compiled, in the beginning of the year, to ' show the tendency during the last three years. The complaint to which the attention of the House has been called today was put before my predecessor in a letter written in December last by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and instructions were issued to the officers to make special inquiries. The following reply was received :1 beg to inform you that every possible care is taken to carry out the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act, and from my own knowledge and personal observation I am satisfied that there are very few, if any, evasions in this respect. The report of the boarding officer was enclosed.",17
51,Mr MAHON,Unknown,To whom was that letter addressed ?,18
52,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"To the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, by the Collector of Customs, in consequence of an inquiry which was instituted by my prepredecessor. Shortly after the House met, and I was appointed to administer the Department, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie again drew attention to the fact that immigrants were coming into Australia and getting work, and asked that special inquiries should be made. I caused instructions again to be issued, and the information which I received was exactly to the same effect as that which was supplied to my predecessor. I was satisfied with what was stated in the reply; but, with the desire of securing special vigilance, I made this minuteI n view of the repetition of the allegations with respect to importation of contract labour (foreign) in Western Australia, issue reminder of instructions for special vigilance in this respect.",18
53,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,At all ports.,18
54,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"This is a general instruction to the officer in charge of all ports in Western Australia. It was a second instruction, issued by me on 23rd October last, on which date the honourable - member for Kalgoorlie had again brought the matter before the House. The question is not new. Every immigrant arriving in Western Australia is specially examined, and questions are put to him in accordance with the powers conferred by the Act upon the officers. Every effort has been made to ascertain whether these men are coming in under contract. A perusal of the papers leads one to the conclusion that for some time these men have been coming to.Australia, and that on their arrival here they appear to obtain employment and to receive very good wages. It is not alleged that they are receiving less than the standard rates Of wages. Mr J. H. CATTS - But they are being emplo3ed to defeat an Australian union. !",18
55,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We are simply dealing with the question of the powers of the Commonwealth to regulate the admission of people into Australia, and I say that it is not suggested that these men are receiving wages lower than those usually paid in the districts in which they are employed.",18
56,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,They are usually employed under contract.,18
57,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is quite possible. It is not suggested that they are not receiving fair wages, and whether they are employed by day labour or under contract after their arrival is purely a matter of internal concern. The Commonwealth has power to regulate the admission of immigrants coming here under contract, but once a man is admitted, and mixes with the general body of citizens, he is entitled to engage in industry in accordance with State laws and the conditions prevailing in the different States. My reply to the question raised by the honourable member is that, so far as I can ascertain, the officers are carefully and vigilantly administering the Act in Western Australia. The records show that my predecessor also made inquiries, and appeared to be satisfied with the measures that were being taken by the officers in the Department. Apparently information is sent to these Europeans across the seas that remunerative employment can be obtained in Australia, and they consequently come here as free citizens and engage in work.",18
58,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,And obtain work in preference to Australians.,18
59,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is a matter of local conditions, with which the Commonwealth is not concerned. The Department has no general power to control the selection of individuals by persons engaged in carrying on industry in the States.",18
60,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,How far would the honourable member carry that principle-that the Commonwealth has no responsibility as to interference with employment?,18
61,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If Europeans enter Australia as free men, the Department has not .power to follow them further.",18
62,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Any one may be refused admission under the law.,18
63,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Quite so.; but it is neither the policy nor the wish of Australia that free Europeans shall be refused admission to the 'Commonwealth.,18
64,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Where the Department sees a certain class of men taking possession of an industry, it is, I think, entitled to take action.",19
65,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It certainly has not been the policy of this Parliament to exclude Europeans from Australia. I think it is the desire of the Parliament that, while welcoming Europeans, we should secure the arrival in Australia of as many Britishers as possible.",19
66,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Thes e are nice Britishers !,19
67,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It has been the desire of this Parliament that the Commonwealth should co-operate with the States to attract a steady stream of British immigrants to Australia.,19
68,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think it desirable even for Britishers to come here and to obtain a preference over Australians in the matter of employment ?,19
69,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I am not suggesting that it is.,19
70,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That is what is happening.,19
71,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The only question really at issue in tins instance is whether our cers are so diligently administering the Act as to ascertain whether immigrants under contract are entering Australia. We have made inquiries, and have given instructions that the Act shall not be evaded. assure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that his desires in this respect are being loyally observed by those administering the law. The report of the debate on this motion will be forwarded to them, and they will be urged to continue special vigilance with a view to preventing any evasion of the law in this respect.",19
72,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [11.36] As my name has been mentioned in connection with this matter, I desire to refer briefly to the question, and shall be able, I think, to show that there are many reasons, other than those which have been given, to account for these foreigners coming to Australia. There has been some trouble lately in connection with the wood supply of mines in Kalgoorlie, and having been in touch with the trouble, I have received telegrams in regard to it. In reply to inquiries, I have obtained some information which I think will be of value to the Minister in his endeavour to ascertain why these foreigners are coming to Australia. No preference is given to men of any foreign nationality on any of the mines, or in any other industry in Western Australia.",19
73,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No preference, even to Britishers?",19
74,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"No preference is given to foreigners. I recently received the f o l lowing telegram from the Chamber of Mines, KalgoorliePresume you have copies of arbitration awards. You may safely and positively say that in no sense whatever is any differentiation made between the British and foreign labourer in connection with mining in this State, the hours of work, rates of wages, and other conditions of employment being identically the same in every respect. Mailing you copy of journal for October containing leading article on question which full y sets out the whole position. Chamber Mines. That is a telegram from the highest mining authority in Western Australia. The Chamber comprises men of undoubted integrity. I have also received a copy of a small pamphlet on this very question, - published by the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines. It is entitled "" Foreigners in Mines,"" and was issued as the result of a case arising out of. a row which took place among foreigners on some of the mines in Kalgoorlie. The question was raised and thoroughly threshed offiout in the State Parliament, and in referring to the debate there we have in the pamphlet the statementHere the Minister touched upon the real point raised by the remarks of Mr Justice BurnI can side, and he followed it up next day. Mr Justice Burnside, during the hearing of the case, had remarked that evidentlv these men did not understand the English language In reply to the member for Mt. Margaret, he said he had already instructed an inspector to report if any of the miners employed underground at the Lancefield could not readily speak English, and also to give special attention to section 42 of the Mines Regulation Act. This appears to touch the point raised by the honourable member for KalgoorlieWithin the last few days that report has been furnished to the State mining engineer by the Inspector of Mines at Malcolm. It is a contradiction of the statement made by Mr Justice Burnside, and therefore a disproof of the implied charge against the management of the Lancefield. The following portions of the report are sufficient to quote : - "" I beg to report having visited the Lancefield and having examined the following Italians in English, in the presence of the manager and underground manager of the mine-A . Sartori, D . Michellelti, A. Bonetti, and R. Zanzoni. The two Carraras had not returned to the mine. "" I found that all these men could speak English readily and intelligibly, and understood any question addressed to them. Saitori, who speaks English without any noticeable foreign accent, states there must have been some mistake; he did not want any interpreter. The newspaper account was wrong, he said. ' Why. Did you read it?' 'Yes,' he replied. I handed him a paper and told him to read the news from Kookynie. He read the account of a euchre party fluently, and without hesitation. He he had been fourteen years in Australia; twelve years in this State. "" All the men were questioned in a similar manner, the questions differing according to whether they were machine men or shovellers. They were asked as to the number of trucks they got out per shift, where they were working, how long they had been mining, whether they knew any other kind of work, and to make the range of questions wider the shift bosses were brought in and the men were chaffed and chatted regarding their personal affairs. Each man quite understood and gave suitable replies, and the replies to all questions were given without tation. Each man was asked in turn why he wanted an interpreter, and each gave a similar reply, viz., that although Ihey could understand and reply to ordinary conversation they did not consider they were good enough for a court of law."" I shall be pleased to lend this pamphlet to any honourable member who mav care lo read it. It clearly proves that no preference is given, and contradicts certain statements that have been freely circulated. I propose to quote some figures which furnish a very good reason for the presence of Britishers and foreigners in the timber industry round the gold-fields of Western Australia, and which emphasize my statement that no preference is given. Taking the returns for the Western Australian Goldfields Firewood Supply, I find that the average earnings of 207 foreigners for three months are over ns. 6d. per day. SOUM* of them have earned up to 17s. per day. I have also a comparison of the earnings of thirty-four men of three different nationalities, which shows that the Austrians earn more than the Italians, and the Italians more than the British. The figures which I am about to give are taken from the paysheets. The average earnings of the Austrians are 14s. 5-9od. per day, those of the Italians are 13s. n . s i d . , and those of the Britishers ios. n.64d. Twenty-four foreigners who are employed in truckloading average 16s. 3d. per day, whilst six Britishers average 15s. 2d. per",19
75,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,What .hours are they employed ?,20
76,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"They work eight hours per day. Horse-drivers receive 13s. 46. per day, and they are not even required' to feed their horses. Other employees perform that service for them.",20
77,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"All the horse-drivers are Britishers, are they not?",20
78,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The company in which I am interested employs 155 men on day stated wages. Of that number only three are foreigners. The average earnings of these men is 12s. 9d. per day. The total number of hands employed by the company is 610, and their wages average ns. io-35d. per day. Is it any wonder that foreigners come to Australia, seeing that they can earn as much here in a day as they can earn in their own country in a week ? I say that if these figures were known to the world we should not require to advertise the resources of this country in order to hesiattract immigrants. The fact is that these men come to Australia to work, and not to argue. Even while they are working, they are being exploited by the Britisher. They have a man running after them to see that they become naturalized, so that they may exercise the franchise, and thus be able to put him into Parliament. He has openly stated that he intends to oust the member who at present represents that division in the Western Australian Parliament.",20
79,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The honourable member has stated that a difference is made between the emplovment of Britishers and foreigners upon day work. Would he mind explaining the nature of that difference?,20
80,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I ' did not say anything of the kind. I said that out of 155 men who are employed upon day wages only three are foreigners, and that their average earnings are 12s. 9d. per day. I believe it is quite possible to attract as many Britishers to Australia as we desire to obtain, so long as we are willinp; to turn them loose, and allow them to do what work they choose. But so soon as we require them to do so much work per day they will raise all sorts of objections. At any rate, that has been the experience upon the gold-fields of Western Australia. There is no other country in the world where men can earn 12s. per day by cutting wood. I have spoken to a great manv individuals who have travelled considerably day - me n who have come from America, for example-and they all declare that it is an unheard of wage. Nobody objects to the men earning that wage, and nobodv has attempted to reduce it. These employees are receiving the same wages today as were paid when the gold-fields were first opened up, whenwater cost them fro m is. to is. 6dper day, when provisions were at least from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, dearer than they are now, and when they were obliged to tramp from one end of the fields to the other, instead of being able as they are now to travel by rail. It is idle for anybody to suggest-that they are not better off today than they were fifteen or sixteen years ago, when the goldfields were first opened up.",20
81,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But the employers get more out of the men now than they did then.,21
82,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I doubt the accuracy of that statement. Here is an industry in regard to which the complaint has been made that foreigners are employed, and yet the average earnings in that industry are u s . io.35d. per day. It is a wonder that Western Australia is not overrun, with men of all nationalities, seeing that such high wages can be earned in it foreigners employed in it would never have gone on strike had it not been for a Bri tisher. The locomotive drivers are earning 15s. 8d. per day, and the firemen 13s. 4d.",21
83,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,- Of what nationality are they ?,21
84,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"They are all British. I was up the line one day, when I experienced rather a surprise on being.told that an Italian had twenty or thirty horses working there. Whilst I was waiting for the train, a man rode up with whom I entered into conversation. After a little time. I inquired who he was. He told me his name, which was a very Italian one, and thereupon I remarked, "" But you are not an Italian ? "" His reply .was, "" Oh , yes, but I was born in Bendigo.""",21
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memindustry, ber has now exhausted the time at his disposal.",21
86,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Coolgardie) [ r r . 5 3 ] is to be regretted that the honourable member for Fremantle did not tell the House how many of the' men employed by his companv are foreigners.,21
87,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I did.,21
88,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I heard the honourable member say that altogether the company employed 610 men, but he did not give the proportion of foreigners and Britishers.",21
89,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I'sai d that there were Britishers and only three foreigners emtralians ployed upon day work.,21
90,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What about those who are working upon contract?,21
91,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I cannot say how many are thus employed.,21
92,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Then we may take it that the figures quoted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie are absolutely correct. I know that they have been caref u l l y compiled, and by one who gave close attention to this question for some time. M.r. HEDGES - They were compiled tot a purpose.",21
93,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Certainly; they were compiled for the purpose of showing that some of these timber companies which have very large propertied interests in Australia - interest s which would be confiscated by an enemy-ar e not prepared to give a job to the men who would have to defend those interests. This is the sort of treatment meted out by certain capitalists to the potential defenders of Australia. They are expected to fight for the capitalists' protection ; but when a job is going, it is given The to aliens, who recognise no such obligation to this country.",21
94,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,No preference is given to the members of any nationality.,21
95,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It is all very well to say that no preference is given, but the figures prove the contrary. Knowing the source from which they come, I have absolute faith in their accuracy. They show an enormous preponderance of the foreign element.",21
96,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Does the honourable member object to the employment of foreigners ?,21
97,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not. I do not object to the introduction into Australia of foreigners whn are prepared to settle upon the land, but I do protest against the introduction into this country of a body of men who absorb all employment offered by an and thus shut Australians entirely out of it.",21
98,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Anvbod v would object to - It that.,21
99,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Why , then, does the honourable member complain ?",21
100,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I say that no preference is given to the members of any nationality.,21
101,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Is not the preference proved by the fact that 90 per cent, of the 1 men employed by the timber companies are foreigners? Is it right that the timber industry should be captured by the foreign 155 element, and that only 10 per cent, of Ausand Britishers should be afforded employment in it ?",21
102,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I have yet to learn that' the employment of 200 Britishers out of a total of 600 employees represents 10 per cent.,21
103,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"- I am not referring merely to the company in which the honourable member is interested, but to the whole of the timber companies. I understand that they do not employ more than 10 per cent, of Australians and Britishers. There is no objection to the introduction of Italians and Austrians. in reasonable numbers, provided that they engage in industries for which they are suited, and that they do not displace any large body of Australian labour. But I am certainly not in favour of the system under which these men are now being introduced. Their practice is to come here and amass ^zoo or Â£300, arid then to leave Australia, their places being filled by fresh arrivals.",22
104,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"They must receive good wages if they are able to amass ,Â£200 or",22
105,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That is not the. complaint. The complaint is that the wages which are being paid by the companies should be paid in larger measure to Australians. I admit that there has been a great reduction in the cost of provisions during the past few years, but the honourable member for Fremantle must admit that the employers get more work out of the men now than they did in the early days. They are now in a position to' pick and choose.",22
106,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,But the timber getters cut the timber at so much per ton.,22
107,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That was not so from the beginning. The Minister of External Affairs has stated that no evidence has been adduced to show that these foreign immigrants are being introduced under contract. But the fact that, immediately after arrival, they proceed direct to the goldfields and obtain employment, is strong presumptive evidence that some understanding exists between the agents who engage them in Europe and the employers in Australia.",22
108,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,It is only a month or two ago that the company in which I am interested had to insert advertisements in the Kalgoorlie newspapers for the purpose of preventing them from coming to Western Australia.,22
109,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I was not aware of that. Does the honourable member think that the 'Kalgoorlie Miner is read by the peasants of Ttalv and Austria?,22
110,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I am not speaking of any particular nationality. We inserted an advertisement in the Kalgoorlie newspapers stating that cutters were no longer required.,22
111,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But what the honourable member said was that advertisements were inserted to prevent those men coming.,22
112,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,To prevent cutters coming in.,22
113,Mr MAHON,Unknown,From Italy and Austria ?,22
114,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,No .,22
115,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Then I fail to see the application of the honourable member's interjection. I am referring to the inrush of aliens, and not to Australians. How can his Kalgoorlie advertisement stop them? Despite the assurance of the Minister that the administration is very vigorous at Fremantle, it is evident that there must be some leakage. The facts of which we are aware are enough to arouse suspicion that there is some secret machinery by means of which these men are brought here and given work straight away.",22
116,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,T t is very difficult to get proof.,22
117,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That is so. When the late Government were in office the honourable member for Boothby, at my request, went into the matter, but was assured that no satisfactory proof could be obtained.",22
118,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What is the nature of the machinery the honourable member suggests?,22
119,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I think a little judicious inquiry at the port of embarkation might reveal something. . It might be found that these immigrants are then not tutored so well as they are when they arrive at Fremantle. The Minister has all the machinery of government at his command, and a remarkable circumstance such as I have mentioned ought to arouse his activity. I do not deny that the law allows all reputable Europeans to come into Australia; but there is a qualification, as the honourable gentleman knows. Any European can be prevented from entering the country by putting to him a lest in a language which it is"" known he does not understand.",22
120,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It was never the intention of Parliament that that should be done.,22
121,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman has no more right than I have to say what was the intention of Parliament. T was in Parliament, as well as himself, when the Act was passed; and might just as fairly give my interpretation of the views of Parliament. I repeat that where foreigners are capturing an industry, special efforts ought to be made to get at the facts and apply the remedy at hand. No one desires to depreciate the character of these aliens; but we cannot shut our eyes to their tendency towards crimes of violence. Only a. few weeks ago there was a murder of exceptional atrocity. From my knowledge of the gold-fields I can say that there have been a great many homicides committed, I admit mostly amongst themselves. They seldom attack people of another race; but, amongst themselves, rows occur, and a good deal of expense has been incurred in tracing the crimes and punishing the criminals. Italians, Austrians, and-others from Southern Europe make valuable settlers when they take up rural pursuits, become permanent citizens, and accept Australian conditions. There should be no objection to their presence in reasonable numbers under these circumstances. But very few of them start out with the intention of becoming citizens and accepting the obligations of citizenship. At present they form a disturbing element by displacing from one industry Australian workers. Their docility and their unfamiliarity with the English language render them very acceptable to capitalists who manage the industry, and who on that account give them preference over their own kith and kin.",22
122,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,There is no proof of that.,23
123,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No more proof is re-, quired than that 90 per cent, of the men employed are foreigners. The capitalists are ready enough to accept the Australian as a defender of the country, but when he wants a job, they prefer an Austrian or an Italian. This discussion should be of service in stiffening up the administration and diminishing the number of these foreigners.",23
124,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,The honourable member said he did not object to them.,23
125,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Certainl y not, if they accept our citizenship under the conditions already mentioned. But I do object to their presence here if they are to be made use of by wealthy corporations to exclude the workers of this country from employment. The honourable member revealed the reason for this preference when he said the foreigners "" did not argue."" The whole trouble is that they are more amenable to discipline and less likely to resist injustice than the Australian or Briton. But that does not constitute a good reason why Parliament should encourage them to come in in large numbers by a lax administration of the powers intrusted to the Minister of External Affairs.",23
126,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [12.8] - I listened very attentively to the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and the honourable member for Coolgardie, who are supposed to know the local conditions; and I observed that, while the honourable member for Fremantle canvassed their statements, he did not dispute the general facts. The Minister himself says that there is nothing new in this complaint-that he has often had it before him Departmentallybut if there is nothing new, there is a surprising growth, of the evil. The question comes within the operation of our immigration and other laws affecting contract labour, and, further, affects the general policy of Australia. A mere motion for the adjournment of the House will not suffice; whether or not this Parliament be compelled to take action, it is absolutely certain that the next Parliament will have to do something, in view of the present proportion between the foreign and the British influx. The honourable member for . Kalgoorlie complains that foreign workers, or workers of foreign extraction, are keeping Australians and Britishers out of work, and the honourable member for Coolgardie emphasizes that point. The honourable member for Fremantle, however, says, "" Oh, these men are getting excellent wages,"" though he does not deny that they are more amenable to discipline than are the other workers.",23
127,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I do deny that.,23
128,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Onl y a few months ago, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Fremantle joined hands, in the interests of mining and of the mining corporations in Western Australia, and urged that the duty on mining machinery should be made as low as possible. Apparently they did not care whether or not the machinery was foreign made, though the British artisans in my electorate",23
129,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Then the honourable member is a Protectionist?,23
130,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said they were Protectionists, but, when it came to mining machinery, they were satisfied with a duty of 7.2 per cent. They had no concern for Bri1 tish mechanics employed here, though it is a peculiar feature of the trade that those who build machines are either Australian born or distinctly of British descent. The honourable member for 'Kalgoorlie has, apparently, awakened to the fact that foreigners are displacing Australian and British labour, and I agree with him that that should not be so. ""But the honourable member for Fremantle is not only willing to have foreign-made machines; he is anxious to have foreigners working the machines. I am with those who, for very good reasons, object to an undue influx of foreigners into Australia. When the honourable member for Fremantle says, "" Look at the Italian and look at the Austrian, who is even better than the Italian",23
131,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Who said that?,24
132,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member fer Fremantle says that the Italians and the Austrians, under a contract system, are getting larger wages than are Britishers, that they are doing splendid work, and that they express their satisfaction in their letters to their friends at home. ' Mr HEDGES - I never said that.",24
133,Mr WILKS,Unknown,That was the argument the honourable member presented.,24
134,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I object to the honourable member putting words into my mouth that I never said.,24
135,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member endeavoured to place on record in Hansard the high wages these foreigners were earning-the Austrian even better wages than the Italian - and he asks, "" Is it any wonder they come to Australia""? Truly, it is no wonder, because these men, in their own country, were employed as charcoal burners; and led a lif e only a few degrees above that of the brute creation. The same argument that the honourable member uses was used in regard to the Chinese on the Rand, who came from serfdom, and had their one glimmer of liberty and life under rational conditions. Is it any wonder that charcoal burners from Bohemia, or Northern Italy and Austria, should Be satisfied to earn 13s. or 14s. a day ? out to the Minister that this is only evidence that Australia is neglecting her work of inviting the proper class of immigrants. The Department of External Affairs should have pressed forward the appointment of a. High Commissioner, and, with him, proper officers to place the advantages and attractions of Australia before the British community. Surely the honourable member for Fremantle does not desire to see a torrent of Italians and Austrians poured into Australia ? We desire immigrants, but we desire them mainly of British birth. The mine-owners are' not concerned with the nationality of their men, and the honourable member for Fremantle does not care whether mining machinery is made in Germany or in Lapland . If the machinery that is used by the caoitalist is to be admitted free, the same capitalists cannot be blamed for employing foreign workmen. Italians and Austrians will work under more slavish conditions than will British mechanics. The British workman is accustomed to a free/, atmosphere. The question with which we are now faced is one that is causing trouble in the very heart of the Empire. In London itself there are thousands of destitute foreigners from the centre of Europe who pour into (jreat Britain to compete with British workmen. There is no nation in the world that affords the same freedom as Great - Britain does to destitute foreigners. On sentimental grounds no one can take any exception to the privileges afforded to these immigrants. Even a Laplander has a right to live here and prosper if he can. But I maintain that it is the duty of the Australian Parliament to see that a disproportionate number of foreign immigrants are not employed upon a distinctly Australian industry. It appears that at present in the timber industry of Western Australia out of every 1,000 employees 900 are foreigners and only 100 of British 'descent or Australian born. That is a strong reason for giving serious attention to this matter. The Minister of External Affairs says-and we cannot contradict him-that he has no evidence to show that the Commonwealth immigration law with regard to contract immigration has been evaded. But there is certainly something seriously wrong in regard to our immigration policy if we neglect to afford facilities for British people to come here in preference to foreigners. Why should we not endeavour to brineout Scotch, Welsh, I point Irish, and English workmen? But I cannot help remembering that when the question of mining machinery was under consideration the honourable member for Kal goorlie forgot all about protecting the Australian workmen, and said in effect, "" Let us get our machinery oven from Bohemia if it is advantageous to do so.""",24
136,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member was a Free Trader except wher any question affected the electorate of Dalley.,24
137,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I have exploded that idea long ago. I have wakened upSurely it is a rank absurdity to complain of foreign labour being emplo) ed in this country r when the honourable member who makes the complaint is not prepared to afford facilities for making here the very machines that are manipulated by the foreign labour. I know that in saying this I may be accused of making a rattling good Protectionist speech, but when I wake up I can be as good a Protectionist as any man in this House. The discussion should be an intjmation to the Government that they should as soon as possible set the High Commissioner to work to induce people from Great Britain to come out here and avail themselves of the splendid opportunities for earning a livelihood which are to be found in Australia.",24
138,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Cook) [12.20] When the honourable member for Dalley makes a charge against the honourable member for Kalgoorlie he should himself recollect the class of men with whom he is now associated in the so-called Liberal party. When he goes upon the platform and uses such arguments as he has used this morning I trust he will not forget to remind his auditors that he belongs to a party which has in its ranks a number of gentlemen who are very favourable to the conditions to which he so earnestly objects.,25
139,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I shall be foolish enough to tell the truth, and that is what some honourable members opposite do not always do.",25
140,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that there are quite a number of members of the party to which he belongs who are fully as indifferent as is the honourable member for Fremantle as to whether they employ Britishers or foreigners. As to the charge that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie voted for low duties on. mining machinery, I would remind the honourable member for Dalley that the point then was that there was certain mining machinery that could not be made in Australia; and it was consequently argued that until the period was reached when there was a probability of it being made here, there should not be a heavy duty upon machinery of that char-' acter.",25
141,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Such machinery can be made in Australia now.,25
142,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That , at all events, was the whole point. The honourable member for Fremantle has gone a little bit further today than he did' when we were discussing the Defence Bill. then made some irrelevant interruptions while I was speaking, and when I charged him with employing foreigners, he stoutly denied my assertion. As .reported at page 4853 of Hansard, I said I do not know whether he is referring to the pay of men on seine of the railways which he built in Western Australia. Perhaps that is what he paid the Italians whom he employed.",25
143,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I am building no railways in Western Australia. How can I be employing Italians to do what I am not doing?,25
144,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,-No r am I .,25
145,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That is somewhat like the quibble to which the honourable member resorted when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie mentioned that he was managing director of the Kurrawang wood company.,25
146,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,There is no such company as he mentioned.,25
147,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Exactly-ther e is the quibble. The honourable member is managing director of the Western Australian Gold-fields Firewood Supply Company, which has its head-quarters at Kurrawang. The Kurrawang railway line is owned by the company, so that the honourable member is managing director of the whole organization of which the line is a portion. The history of the trouble is simply this : In July, 1908, there was a. strike amongst the woodworkers of Western Australia. These were the men who, as the honourable member for Fremantle complains, were too fond of arguing. The Italians and Austrians did not argue, and that is one of - the reasons why he thinks they should be employed in preference to Australians.",25
148,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I said nothing of the kind.,25
149,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The result of the dispute of the unions with the woodcutting companies-includin g the honourable member's company-wa s that the Premier of Western Australia became arbitrator, and gave an award which was signed on behalf of the men and of the companies. I have a copy of the award in my hand, and I. notice that it is signed by W. N . Hedges, R. Henderson, and Alexander Porter on ""behalf of the companies. It appears that to get even with the unions the honourable member has taken to the employment of aliens in preference to Australians. On the Norseman line, which was built by the company of which the honourable member is managing director, there were, on the ist June, 316 aliens emHe ployed, as against twenty Britishers; and I am informed by correspondence which I received yesterday that at the present time an even larger number of aliens are employed. I remember that a few weeks' ago the honourable member was a member of a conference at which it was urged that a preference should be given to British) goods. Is not this monstrous hypocrisyto urge that there should be a preference on British goods, whilst refusing to give! a preference to Australian workmen as against Austrians and Italians?",25
150,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I voted for preference in this Parliament.,26
151,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"But when the honourable member is desired to give a preference in the conduct of his own industry he declines. Although he is prepared to vote in Australia. for preference to British goods, he admits that in conducting the affairs of his company he thinks there should be no differentiation whatever between Austrians, Italians, and Australians. Surely if the honourable member were consistent he would give a preference to Australian workmen.",26
152,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I rise to order. 1 made no such statement as the honourable member is attributing to me.,26
153,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That , again, is a quibble.",26
154,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must not say such things of another honourable member.,26
155,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If the honourable member refers to the Hansard report of his speech, he will find that he stated that company made no differentiation in regard lo the employment of Britishers as against Italians and Austrians.",26
156,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He said that there was no preference for workmen of any nationality. T took his words down.,26
157,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Does the honorabi; member for Fremantle deny that? He is silent now. Consequently we may take it that he agrees that his company exercises preference in regard to men of any nationality. I am surprised to learn that we have a member of the National Parliament of Australia who is not prepared to give preference in the matter of employment to workmen of his own flesh and blood.,26
158,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Who is that member?,26
159,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The eminent Empire builder, the honourable member for Fremantle. I sincerely hope that there will be more vigilant administration of the Contract Immigrants Act. It is evident that these Italians and Austrians have come to Australia to work under contract on the definite understanding that they will be employed.",26
160,Dr WILSON,Unknown,Can the honourable member prove that they are brought out under contract ?,26
161,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The managing directors are too cunning to allow us a chance to prove it. We have had this kind of thing over and over again. We know that in different industries men have been induced to come out on an understanding, but it was not possible to get anything in black and white on which to take those responsible to Court, and prove that they had broken the law.",26
162,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"In any case, the understanding would be void when they arrived",26
163,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That is not the point. The point is that these companies want to get the men here. So long as they get them through the port into their industries it does not matter to them whether or not the contract holds good any longer, because they are then able to employ them on the spot in preference to Australians. The only object for which they want an understanding with them is to get them here, and not as regards their employment afterwards.",26
164,Dr WILSON,Unknown,The Governments in all the States have been working to bring these men out to Australia.,26
165,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If all the State Governments have been doing what is his charged by the mover of the motion now before the House-encouragin g the employment of Italians and Austrians as against Australians and Britishers-the n all the State Governments ought to be promptly put out of office, and thorough-going Australian Governments put in their places. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [12.32]. - During one of my trips to the West to acquire information about the Commonno wealth, one of the representatives of which I have the honour of being, I paid a visit to Kalgoorlie and to the particular industry that my honourable friend, the honourable member for Fremantle, represents. T saw splendid discipline there. I saw 120 18-ton trucks go day after day to the mines. I know something about mining and the conditions attached to it, and I venture to say that the story which some of the gentlemen opposite have told today will be conveyed to the Kalgoorlie miners, who, without this particular industry, would be deprived of their living. I was surprised at the statements of the honourable member for 'Coolgardie, who did not afford us that intelligent expression of opinion that he usually commands, while the honourable member for Dalley spoke from a very one-sided book. I may tell you, Mr Speaker, and the gentlemen on the opposite side, that there are so many difficulties in connection with mining that I am not surprised at the necessity of employing, if anything, cheaper labour than, perhaps, the British people would be able to afford. During my political experience, which is longer and likely to be longer than that of some of the gentlemen opposite, it has been my privilege to assist men of the type of the honourable member for Fremantle to lift the human race. I venture to say that all the legislation that Australians have endeavoured to bring about has been in that direction. I might remind honourable members opposite also that there must be hewers of wood and drawers of water, and is it not better that they should be of a race inferior to that from which those gentlemen spring? I am surprised at what has taken place this morning. I could understand an invidious attack being made in connection with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, but it appears to me that this assault is absolutely levelled at the individual character of the honourable member for Fremantle. T say, without fear of contradiction, that I never saw a more magnificent enterprise, or a more splendid help to the miners of Kalgoorlie than this industry. I never saw a more disciplined set of men, greater precision or business perspicuity-withou t any strikes. Such an enterprise should command the admiration of the people, instead of inciting the dirty personal attack that has been made today on the honourable memher for Fremantle.",26
166,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [12.35] - I must enter my emphatic protest against the statement of the honourable member for Indi that the mining industry requires cheap labour. I deny it, and the honourable member for Fremantle bears out my contention. I am surprised at the honourable member for Indi rising in the House and advocating cheap labour for that industry. There is no industry in Australia that requires that the men should be paid a fair and legitimate wage more than the mining industry does. No industry calls upon men to take such extraordinary risks as miners have to t?.ke, and under those circumstances it is well that the miners should be paid a fair wage. The position taken up by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is that there is a danger that, through the introduction of what the honourable member for Indi calls "" an inferior class of labour,"" the wage paid to them will ultimately become the wage paid for more highly skilled labour. I am also surprised that a member with the experience in State and Federal politics possessed by the honourable member for Indi, should advocate the employment of an inferior class of workers in and for the mining industry. The honourable member made in that regard a statement which in his calmer moments he will very much regret. Fancy him advocating in his own constituency the employment of an inferior and cheaper class of labour ! I make bold to say that the honourable member dare not go to Rutherglen and other mining centres in his electorate and state publicly that the mines want an inferior class of labour, or men who will accept a lower rate of wages. The honourable member must not make reckless statements like that in this chamber. The matter which has been brought before the House requires serious attention. I know that an attempt was made in North Queensland to bring out a class of labour to work more cheaply than others were working, and it is a strange thing that the labour brought out drifted into the very industry of wood-cutting to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie now refers. I have nothing personal against the Italians or Austrians, nor, judging from the tone of his remarks, has the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but we do object to their being brought out here and worked under the contract system, which is the most vicious system possible, with the result that the standard of living to other workers in the same industry is largely lowered. That is the point of the objection that we. take. So long as. those men get the same conditions and the same wages as Australians do, no strong exception nan be taken to their employment. I know personally a number of Italians who came out to work in the sugar industry of Queensland, but who very soon drifted from it. They were located principally in and around Charters Towers, where they took to wood-cutting. Some of them have turned cut excellent citizens, and I might add that they are also very good labour men.",27
167,Dr WILSON,Unknown,Hav e net the Italians been very valuable in many places in Queensland ?,27
168,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I say they have been excellent citizens in many places, and so were the Italians who came to Victoria in the early days. What we object to is the bringing of these people out under contract, not to develop the mining industry on sound lines, but for the express purpose of being employed under conditions that are calculated to reduce the wages paid to, and the standard of living secured by, the miners already here. I am surprised at the astounding statements of the honourable member for Indi, that the mining industry requires much cheaper labour, and that an inferior class of worker is necessary for its development.",27
169,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,It is breaking down all over the State of Victoria.,28
170,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I do not think so. The Victorian mining industry is not breaking down through the want of cheaper labour. The great factor in the situation - is that many of the mines are being worked out.,28
171,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,I know more than the honourable member does about it.,28
172,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"That may be so, tion but the fact remains that the Victorian can be no strikes. mines are not so rich as they were. They are getting to a greater depth, and the expense of working them is correspondingly increased. But, even so, does the honoryou,"" able member for Indi mean to tell us that they want large numbers of immigrants this particular class to work them?",28
173,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,The honourable member is wilfully misunderstanding my observations.,28
174,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"If the honourable member desires to explain exactly what he did mean, I shall gladly resume my seat.",28
175,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,There will not be time.,28
176,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I shall give the honourable member the opportunity if he so desires.,28
177,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"B y way of personal planation, I wish to state that I said that preference was given to Britishers by the company in which I have an interest. honourable member for Cook alleged that said no preference was given. No preInspector ference is given to any man in regard tp the cutting, but in regard to the other ployment, preference is given to Britishers.",28
178,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [13.42] - I took down the words which the honourable memthe ber for Fremantle used. I do not knowj whether it was in reference to wood-cutting or mining, but the honourable member said there was no preference given to any tionality.

180,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They were given by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and the honourable member for Fremantle did not dispute them. Will the honourable member say now that there are not 90 per cent, of foreigners employed in wood-cutting by the company of which he is the managing director ?",28
181,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Absolutely .,28
182,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member admits that I am absolutely correct.,28
183,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,No .,28
184,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Indi said he never saw a finer disciplined body of men, and that, there were no strikes. What a glorious thing for the company to have no strikes ! The honourable member must know that in Western Australia there is a Conciliation and ArbitraAct in force, and that therefore there The honourable member for Fremantle put another aspect of the question when he said that, "" These foreigners will not argue the point with meaning that they will allow themselves to be sat upon by their employers, of and will work for a lower wage than the Britisher would take.",28
185,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I did not say thai.,28
186,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member did not say it, but he knows it to be a fact.",28
187,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,It is absolutely false.,28
188,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member read out a lot of figures which I presume were compiled in the office of the company of which he is a representative, to show how the foreigners obtain more wages than the Britishers. I would remind the honourable member that in the Victorian exFactory Inspector's report he can find figures to prove that the Chinese obtain more wages than white men in certain inThe dustries. But does any one believe it? I On the contrary, Mr Harrison Ord, Chief of Factories foi Victoria, states that as usual the Chinese apparently earns emmore than the white man, but the figures are supplied to the Department by the employers. Similarly the figures given by honourable member for Fremantle fiis morning were supplied by the employers. They no doubt wish to make out that the foreigner earns more than the Britisher, but nathe honourable member for Fremantle has admitted that the preference is given to Britishers for work done by day labour. The reason for that is that it is known that the Britisher is better able to earn the wages paid him than is the foreigner.",28
189,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,We have no power in one case. The honourable member does not understand the question.,29
190,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The employers have no power over the Britishers, who are prepared to fight for their rights if they are not them by the company. When the foreigners have been long enough in Australia they learn to fight for their rights also. I have worked alongside foreigners, who have put up as good a fight as any Britishers for their rights. We have been asked whether we could prove that these foreigners have entered into contracts. We cannot, because the men will not admit it, and it is impossible to sheet home the fact that they have been introduced under contract. The employers arc too wide awake to admit that the men have been introduced under false pretences, and in order that work might be taken out ot the hands of Britishers. Yet these employers get on to the platform and proclaim that they are the only Empire builders. At the close of their meetings, they ask their audiences to give three cheers for the King, but they take advantage of every possible opportunity to displace Britishers by foreigners.",29
191,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [12.49] - I tesent altogether the suggestion of the honourable member for Indi that I introduced this matter as a personal question.,29
192,Dr WILSON,Unknown,It was made a personal matter.,29
193,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The personal tone was given to the debate after I had concluded my speech in opening it, and it was introduced as the result of interjections from honourable members on the other side. have quoted figures which show that at this particular work 87 Britishers were employed as against about 700 foreigners. When 10 per cent, only of Britishers are employed in an industry, it is time some attention was given to it. I ask the Minister of Externjil Affairs to look into the provisions of the Contract Immigrants Act, and see whether what I have complained of could not be put a stop to. When foreigners are introduced, and as a result Britishers and Australians are thrown out of employment, it is easy to understand that a position may be reached when the difficulty must be dealt with apart from the provisions of the Contract Immigrants Act.",29
194,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Do not some of the Italians and Austrians become naturalized ?,29
195,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I believe that some of them do.,29
196,Dr WILSON,Unknown,In Queensland hundreds of them are naturalized.,29
197,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not doubt it. I admit that a number of them become very good citizens of Australia. I will not given say that many of them do not also become good unionists, and take a deep interest in keeping up wages.",29
198,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Are they not a race of people specially qualified for this class of work ?,29
199,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"They may be, but the honourable member should not forget the figures given by the honourable member for Fremantle. Where it is a question of getting the best results from day work, the honourable member has explained that out of a total of 155 men employed at this work by the company with which he is associated, only three are foreigners.",29
200,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,I understood that they were not engaged in the same class of work.,29
201,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,They may not be engaged in the cutting. The figures I quoted related to the percentage of Britishers and foreigners employed in the cutting and loading in this particular industry by the company in which the honourable member for Fremantle is interested.,29
202,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,The figures quoted by the honourable member are incorrect.,29
203,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member will find that, as indicating the position on the 30th June of this year, the figures I quoted are absolutely correct. The remarks made by the honourable member for Dalley were not in any way rele1 vant to the question I raised. It is true that I adopted a certain attitude in connection with certain Tariff items.",29
204,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,And wisely.,29
205,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I believe that I acted wisely. The position 1 took up was that in respect of all machinery, that could be produced in this country I was prepared to vote for prohibition in the interests of the Australian manufacturer. I was prepared to give him the whole of the Australian market. But in respect of machinery, which it was admitted could not be manufactured in Australia, I was not prepared to support a revenue duty, which could only have the effect of penalizing a great primary industry, which employs many thousands of men at a fair wage. I believe that the position I took up in the matter will be endorsed by my constituents, and that I shall be given an opportunity to take a similar course should any amendment of the Tariff be submitted in this Chamber. In view of the statement of the Minister of External Affairs, that he will cause inquiries to' be made as to whether any of these men are being introduced under contract, and will secure information with regard to their employment after they have arrived in Australia, I ask leave to withdraw my motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. TANNING INDUSTRY. , Mr .WATKINS (for Dr asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the letter in Herald of 12th November, page 6, wherein the President of the Master Tanners and Leather Manufacturers' Association states :"" I would like the people of Australia to know, through your medium, that the Victorian Master Tanners' Association is wide awake to the undeniable fact that the tanning industry, and the welfare of those of our people who are dependent upon it, is being quickly and surely undermined by the foreigner, who has found that, with cheaper labour and longer hours, our hides can be profitably purchased at a price that leaves no margin for the Autralian tanner. Unfortunately this is not a case that, alone, would cure itself, but one that demands immediate action on the part of Parliament if the industry is to be kept alive. My association has, with others in the neighbouring States, petitioned the Minister to take into consideration the facts, and send us speedy relief. I also understand the Trades Hall have made a similar request, entirely independent of our action.""1. Will the Government, if necessary, introduce a short measure to give effect to the wish of the Master Tanners and Leather Manufacturers' Association and of the Trades Hall? 2. If not, will he undertake on behalf of the Government, during the next session of Parliament, to take the necessary steps to bring about an export duty on hides, and so enable Australian leather to hold its own against the outer world ?",29

215,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In reply to a question put by the honourable member for Herbert, I have, through the courtesy of the Attorney-General, received the following memorandum :The Acts Interpretation Act, No. 1, of 1904, section 10, provides that all regulations, unless the contrary intention appears, shall be notified in the Gazette, take effect from the date of notification, or from a later date specified in the regulation, and be laid before both Houses of Parliament within thirty days of the making thereof, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within thirty days after the next meeting of the Parliament. If either House pass a resolution, of which notice has been given, at any time within fifteen sitting days after the regulation has been laid before it, disallowing the regulation, such regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. As a matter of practice, and also as prescribed by the Rules Publication Act 1903, regulations are in print at the time that they are laid upon the table (see section 5 of that Act)'. In the Senate they are laid on the table by a Minister, in the House of Representatives by the Clerk of the House. After having been made and passed by the Executive Council they are also notified in the Gazette. As a rule,' therefore, members have fair notice of the making of the regulation. It might, STRIKE. however, be provided that, contemporaneously with laying them upon the table of the House', copies of the regulation (which are, as I said, already in print), should be at once circulated amongst members. Members will then have at least a fortnight to decide whether a motion of disallowance shall be tabled. in I may inform honourable members that the owing Attorney-General has made arrangements an whereby the last paragraph of the memothan New randum will be given effect to.

Sitting suspended, from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",31
217,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall not detain the House long in moving this motion. I have slept over the opinions which I uttered in the chamber last night, and since then, as previously, have given the greatest consideration to the seriousness of the position with which we are faced. The merits and demerits of the proposed agreement have been under discussion for some time, and I regret to have to say that, in my view, the results shown by the division lists do not reflect the opinion of this House or of the electors. It will be eadily conceded r that, although technically we are not in this Bill proposing an alteration of the Constitution, undoubtedly we shall, by taking over the Northern Territory on the terms proposed, or on any others, alter the whole character of the Commonwealth's powers and administration, and add enormously to our responsibilities. Indeed, we shall, by taking control of the Northern Territory, alter the character of the Federation. Now, before the Constitution itself can be altered, the proposed alteration must be submitted to and accepted by the people; and no such submission can be made until, not only a majority of those within the precincts of each chamber at the time of the passing of the covering Bill, but an absolute majority of its members, are present and vote for it ; and when the proposed change is before the people, it must be accepted, not only by an absolute majority of the electors voting, but also by affirmative majorities in a majority of the States. These safeguards were adopted to prevent the engineering of any alteration through Parliament, and to make it certain that Parliament and the people recommend the change. But what guarantee against log-rolling have we now that Parliament is recommending the people of Australia to add drastically to the Commonwealth powers and to materially alter its character? A few months ago the Bill before us was thought to have "" Buckley's chance "" of passing. . Since then a strange thing has happened. It has been felt that the few votes which .South Australia could give to any party were of sufficient importance to make this great National question the plaything of party politics. The Labour party was divided in regard to it. Those who represent South Australian constituencies thought as they did now. But others, notably representatives of Queensland electorates, thought then as they think now, but as they are not prepared to vote. In order to keep the Labour party solid, every Labour'representative is voting in this ter, not for what Re conceives to be best in the public; interests, but for what he considers best in the interests of the",31

219,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,And I am another.,32
220,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"There are, of course, a few exceptions. I regret that the honortralian able member for Kennedy has been prethe vented, as Chairman of Committees, from taking part in the Committee's deliberathe tions. I should like to hear another speech from him similar to that which he delivered on the motion for the second reading. If he advances the same arguments again, with the same ability, we shall be sure of getting the proposal viewed from the National instead of the party stand-point by some of his colleagues. The proceedings in Committee were of a distinctly unusual character, and inspired by somewhat unusual motives. This in itself should cause honourable members to pause before consenting to impose on the taxpayers of Australia an immediate obligation amounting to at least ^10,500,000. Honourable members should give the people an opportunity to say' whether they wish to take this burden on tlieir shoulders.",32
221,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Dee s the honourable member refer to the building of a Federal Capital ?,32
222,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The people in voting for the acceptance of the Constitution affirmed that a Federal Capital should be selected by Parliament and established. In this matter some honourable members no doubt take refuge in the thought that their particular electors will not be called upon to find, any of the money required. They say, "" Our electors are not rich men; they will not have to carry this burden."" Do they not know that the expenditure of the country is shared directly or indirectly by the whole community; that in taxing this or that form of wealth you tax all indirectly? Every man' who votes for the Bill votes to impose an obligation of Â£ 2 14s. on every man, woman and child in the community. So serious an imposition should not the placed on the taxpayers without giving the electors a chance to say what they think of the proposal. Honourable members were elected on the freest franchise in the world, mat- and surely they will not deny the people who sent them here, the opportunity to express their views on the subject.

223,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Why does not the honourable member stick to the interests of AusDemocracy ? Does he not know that basis of representative institutions is complete confidence between the electors and elected ? How are we to have that unless, before imposing an obligation of this' magnitude upon the taxpayers, we ask them what they think of it ? Can it be pretended that this House is representative, if honourable members, especially those of the Labour party, refuse to allow this question to be put to the electors?",32
224,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We shall be taking every question to the electors very shortly.,33
225,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman consent to the postponement of this proposal until the electors have been consulted ?,33
226,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No . - Mr KELLY - The honourable gentlemen who have expressed their willingness to trust the people on all sorts of questions, are not willing to trust them in regard to a proposal to impose a burden of Â£ 2 14s. on every soul in the community, in the interests of the pastoralists of the Oodnadatta district.",33
227,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,It is only a trifle.,33
228,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It may seem a trifle to some honourable members, but I know that in my electorate, as in others, there are many, who will suffer if this burden is laid on the community, and who would not vote for any one who considers it lightly.",33
229,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Has the honourable member ascertained how the Labour party reconciles its determination to vote for expenditure of millions with its refusal agree to a loan policy? Are we to underunder stand that the proposed expenditure is to made out of revenue?,33
230,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not propose to condum is so much in the interests of the sider that matter now, but I would put fore the House another difficulty arising of the position in which we find ourselves. A day or two ago Labour members were scribing a certain arrangement with regard to thefinancesas a surrender of Commonthe wealth powers and rights. It was said the Commonwealth was being put in pawn to the States. Do they now propose spendproposed. ing ^10,500,000 of public money in much the spirit of the bankrupt who, having sequestrated his estate, is prepared to upon any obligation?",33
231,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The sum referred to will_cover only the initial expenditure.,33
232,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Quite so. And if we seized do not go immediately as far as is proposed, we shall place on the taxmany payers of Australia the burden of a. non-paying railway, which will have to kept going purely for the benefit of the people of _ South Australia ! I think I have said enough to voice the protest every Democrat in the chamber against manner in which the measure has beerr dealt with from start to finish. I hope that the Government will give the question the gravest consideration. It must appear to the Minister that the support which the Bill has received was as unexpected as inexplicable, and I hope therefore that he will recognise it as his duty to the Australian people, of which, in hisMinisterial position, he is a trustee, to see that the proposal is safeguarded as I suggest.",33
233,Dr WILSON,Unknown,Will the Government accept the motion?,33
234,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the Government wil* promise to take the matter into consideration, with a view to action in another place,. I shall be glad to withdraw further opposition to the measure here. All I desire is that the people shall have an opportunity to express their opinion with regard to it. No honourable member worthy of his place in the House can refuse to give the publican opportunity to say whether or not they should be burdened with this enormous obligation without any reference having beenmade to them, either at the last general election or since.",33
235,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [2.31] - I did not think that honourable membersthis would be prepared to go to a vote on this to question without further discussion. I was the impression that the Minister inbe charge of the Bill would at least inform, the House that the proposal for a referen1 bepeople that the Government are prepared toout accept it. The principle which the honourable member desires to affirm is accepted! deby most honourable members. No harm will be done either to the Commonwealth or to Territory itself by submitting to the that people the question of whether or not the Territory should be taken over on the termsHonorable members of the Opposition havg spoken from time to time in terms of commendation of the principle enter of the referendum, and I fail to see why they should not embrace the present opportunity to secure an appeal to the people on> this question. The House is not as fully with the importance of this questionas it ought to be. I do not think that honourable members will dispute the desirableness of the Commonwealth taking be over the Territory; the sole question at issue relates to the terms on which it should) that be taken over. I was much impressed by of the remarks made last night by the honour the able member for Coolgardie in regard to - the relationship that would exist between the Commonwealth and the Government of - South Australia, under this agreement, in respect to the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. Under the agreement as - it stands, the Commonwealth will have to - meet an annual loss of ,Â£78,000 before it 'reaps any benefit whatever from the transfer. It is also proposed to saddle the monwealth with the cost of constructing a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. The construction of that line will involve the .people of Australia in an expenditure of - millions of pounds sterling. In taking over - the Territory on the terms for which this agreement provides, we shall practically enter upon a loan policy. We shall pledge ourselves to take over the liability in respect of certain borrowed - moneys, to pay interest upon that borrowed money, and, further, to float a loan to carry out certain works in connection with the development of the Territory. The - matter is of such importance to the people - of Australia that every honourable member except those who are blinded by parochial .prejudice should support the proposed referendum. We object, not to the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, but to the terms on which it is proposed that it should be taken over. I hope that 'honourable members will carefully consider the motion for the recommittal of the Bill before proceeding to a vote upon its final stage. Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) T2.37I - I agree with the honora^'e member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Corangamite that the Government should r-onsider the desirableness of submitting this question to a referendum of the people. If the agreement would involve the Commonwealth in a liahilitv of only .Â£3,328,000, I am sure that honourable members would not object to it, but it will mean an expenditure at some time or other of Â£10,000,000 in connection with the construction of a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek and other works. Where is that money to be found ? Having regard to the defence proposals and other large schemes which the - Government are supporting, I am sure that we shall have to resort to direct taxation if we accept this agreement. We cannot find ,Â£10,000,000 at present, and the probabilities are that, before the present railway to Oodnadatta is extended to Pine Creek, we shall have to construct the Western Australian transcontinental railway, which should come first. The provision of rolling stock and of an adequate water supply in connection with that line will involve a further expenditure of .Â£6,000,000 or ,Â£7,006,000. I do not advocate a policy of borrowing; indeed, I do not think that we ought to borrow. We should devote our energies to an endeavour to settle the people on the land, and not to Com- wild-cat schemes to build railways in the Northern Territory that will end nowhere. The country is not ripe for such enterprises. I appeal to the Government to consent to submit this agreement to the people. It will involve an expenditure of Â£ 2 14s. per head of the population,and, taken altogether, it is unreasonable. Representatives of South Australia have said, "" Let us stick to the agreement."". As a business man, however, I consider that it is faulty, and, from the point of view of the people of the Commonwealth, bad. If I were a representative of South Australia, and viewed the proposal from the stand-point of that State alone. I should be prepared to support it, but, as members of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, we must consider all the States. We ought not to be pressed to vote for the third reading of the Bill. The Government should accept the motion for its recommittal. I repeat that if the agreement would involve the Commonwealth in a liability of only .Â£3,000,000, I am sure that the House would agree to it, and, if necessary, would sanction an additional expenditure of .Â£1,000,000. Let us take over the Northern Territory without any conditions. The conditions of this agreement N should not be insisted upon. If the Bill passes this House, I hope that it will be rejected by the Senate, for it will commit us to an expenditure which our present position does not warrant.",33
236,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Does not the honourable member hope that the Senate will throw out the Bill that we have just passed in regard to another agreement?,34
237,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"I do not. I am sure that the honourable member for Wakefield would be prepared to support a proposal that we should take over only the territory lying north of the MACDonnell Ranges, and I hope that the Minister will make a statement as to the attitude of the Government. I am totally opposed to the Bill as it stands, and' think that many other honourable members also object to it. I do not know why honourable members have changed their views with regard. to it, and why so many should have voted for the Bill as did so last night. Someone has said that they were well whipped. They must have been, because many spoke in one direction and voted in the other. I have always voted as I have spoken, and fail to understand the attitude of honourable members who speak today in favour of a certain course, and tomorrow vote against it.",34
238,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs - Minister of External Affairs) [2.43] - It is not my intention to accept the motion for the recommittal of the Bill. I would remind honourable members that the question is neither new to the House nor to the country. In the first Federal Parliament, a motion affirming the desirableness of the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory was unanimously agreed to. Since then there have been two general elections, and the question has been frequently discussed. The agreement embodied in the Bill was signed inFebruary, 1907, and its provisions have been freely discussed in the press as well as by honourable members, many of whom have also visited the Northern Territory to make themselves acquainted with the true position. The terms of the agreement have been fully explained, and no useful purpose Vou Id be served by going into them once more. In the circumstances, I cannot see my way to accept the proposal for a referendum on this question.",35
239,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Surely the Government will trust the people on this Bill. desire to do so in regard to an agreement embodied in a Bill which we passed last week.,35

Only a day or two ago every member of the Ministry was crying out at the top of his voice, "" Trust the people."" Now, however, when amotion is submitted, which clearly ""invites us to the people, they take a stand which if it does nothing else enables us to judge of their sincerity. I am beginning to think there is a good deal of hypocrisy on the part of the Government.",35
242,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Is the honourable member only beginning to think so?,35
243,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I have thought so for a considerable time. It appears to me that the - Government are prepared to take any side which suits their own political ends.,35

The motion of the honourable member for Wentworth does not propose a referendum which, involves the approval of a majority of the States, but merely means a straight out majority. The honourable member for Corangamite surprised me when he spoke of honourable members speaking one way and voting another. Not long ago, in connection with another measure, we had .honourable members speaking in the strongest possible way against a measure proposed by the Government, but, when the whip was cracked, they were quite prepared to say, "" Yes, Mr Whip.""",35
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It seems to me that the honourable member is .trying to make They mischief!,35
249,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I a m trying to do no such thing. If. ever there was a question which should be sent to the people, it is this, seeing that it has not been before them previously.",35
250,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes , it has; it was before the people at-the last election.",35
251,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member knows that the question was never seriously before the people. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It was before my constituents.,35
252,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"No doubt the hontrust orable member's constituents study every question in the most minute detail, so that it is not possible for anything to escape them; hence they send such, an intellectual representative, who can inform the House on every phase of every subject. The Bill before us, if passed, will saddle the country with a great liability. 'There is not merely the Â£10,000,000 spoken of by the honourable member for Wentworth, because that is a mere flea-bite compared with what we shall have to spend on the ultimate development of the Territory. I admit that tht expenditure will extend over a long period, but, still, it means an enormous sum. From the moment we take over the Territory, we shall have to be prepared to speno large sums until it is thoroughly developed. If we are not prepared to do that, we have no right to pass this measure.",35
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Does the honourable member wish to leave the Territory as'it is?,36
254,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Whil e I am prepared to take over the Territory, .1 think the conditions are not wise. If we do not intend to spend the ,Â£3,000,000 or .Â£4,000,000, we are only deceiving the people of South Australia. I regret to say that certain honourable members have suggested that there is no time specified for the construction of the line, and that it may be postponed for fifty or a hundred years; but, if so, that is a deliberate attempt to deceive, and I hope that the Government have no such idea.",36
255,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"Eve n if the construction of the line is postponed, we have to bear the cost of the Oodnadatta line.",36
256,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not object to that, because the South Australian Government built that line with the idea of ultimately carrying it through; and, if we depart from that idea, we should be prepared to meet the outlay. The ,Â£3,000,000 or .Â£4,000,000 which the new line would cost could be far better spent in another way in the development of the Territory. The honourable member for Brisbane is now present, and I should like to know how he is going to vote. He was one of the strongest advocates of a certain course, but, up to the present, he has dodged his responsibility by not recording a vote. We now know that the Government refuse to trust the people, and it would be interesting, in view of the able pamphlets he has written, to know what position the Honorary Minister takes up.",36
257,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [2.55] - I am astounded that this proposal should have gone so far, because I never dreamt it would get beyond the placard stage. Under the circumstances honourable members must wake up to the serious responsibility of the Commonwealth. If this Bill is to be carvied only to appease the South Australian Government, we are deceiving the people of that State; and, if it be carried with the intention of doing what they desire, the Commonwealth will be saddled with an expenditure of millions.",36
258,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Whic h we have not got!,36
259,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If that be so, and there is no immediate prospect of getting the money, the proposal ought to stand in abeyance. The representatives of South Australia have done very well to get the Bill carried so far. It is said that we must not mention it in Gath or murmur it in Ascalon, but we now find loyal members of the Fusion party, like the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable member for Corangamite, letting in a very invigorating breeze of personal independence. Up to the present we have not heard the words, "" No party question""; but when, a few days ago, we did hear them all round the chamber, I never witnessed a stronger instance of party discipline. Why do not the Government appeal to their supporters to "" save the f ace "" of the Prime Minister - to guard his good faith and honour-in the agreement he made with the ex-Premier of South Australia? Surely liberty is not to be allowed to some and denied to others ? I cannot but think that the honourable member for Kennedy is treating us to a Jittle burlesque when he says'that the Honorary Minister is not loyal to the Government. Am I really asked to believe that the honourable member for Brisbane has not yet cast a vote on this question? It cannot be true! The Ministry, who are loyal to the agreement, will surely not allow one of their number to abstain from voting, seeing that last week not one of the rank and file was allowed to escape! This is an opportunity which I am pleased to take to defend the party to which I belong, against the attacks of a Labourite. Fancy a Labour man letting it go forth to the public that a member of the Ministry is not loyal to the agreement! If the honourable member has not voted, I am sure it must have been because of some untoward accident.",36
260,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,He has not even paired.,36
261,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Then there must have been an oversight. I shall vote for a referendum, not because I believe in it, but because I can see in it a means of delay. That is frank speaking; and my desire is that the public shall not be committed, without further inquiry, to the expenditure of millions. I am not one who thinks that every question ought to be submitted in this way to the public, without time being affordedfor consideration. What do the public of New South Wales know about the Northern Territory ? I should be the last to suggest that the Deakin Government wish to fool the people; but, if that should be their idea, what harm can there be in delay ? The South Australian people evidently think that we as the Commonwealth Parliament ought to take over the Northern Territory; but I refuse to do so on the conditions imposed. If a similar business proposition were put before us in our private capacity, none of us would entertain it. We would never buy a pig in a poke. The mere fact of trotting in at that door does not destroy the business acumen or aptitude of members, and I ask them to apply to this proposition only a portion of their business caution. I respectfully ask them to give it the same amount of honest consideration that they give to their ordinary private affairs. There is not a member in the House who would not carry out his promise if he took over an undertaking on condition that he completed certain work, and will this Parliament sully its record by refusing in this case to fulfil immediately the conditions attached to the agreement? It is well known that I am violently opposed to the inauguration of a loan policy for Australia, especially on a matter of this kind, which does not call for such speedy treatment. The Ministry refuse, of course, to accept the motion, but I cannot understand why they are so anxious to force the agreement through. It was made by the honourable member for Ballarat when he was Prime Minister of another Government, and leading quite another party. What has taken place is a splendid tribute to the power of one man. It is a tribute to him that on two occasions his powerful personality can be said to have practically dominated a party. I have never known a stronger instance of one member, although he is a Prime Minister, taking one course of action in a different Ministry, and subsequently having sufficient power to dominate another party in regard to it. It certainly seems to be a matter of personal domination.",36
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Severa l honourable members of this Government were in the previous Government with him.,37
263,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If the right honourable member believes in the project he has, of course, as much right to defend as I have to oppose it. But are those who vote for it really voting for the immediate carrying out of all the terms of the contract ?",37
264,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Of course !,37
265,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Then they are voting for an expenditure involving millions of pounds. But how many honourable membersare prepared to impose a heavy interest charge for an affair of this character upon the masses of the people? There are other projects the treatment of which by the Commonwealth Parliament is anxiously awaited, and which more urgently demand? settlement. This case is only another evidence to me of the fact that in all movements of life it is the master mind, the strong character, that rules. The only thing that astonishes me is the attitude of members like the .honourable members for Corangamite and Grampians, who last week looked askance at myself-and others who dared, in connection with another matter, to go on our own. The honourable member for Grampians regarded me almost: as though I belonged to some foreign breed, yet he is doing today exactly what I did) then. According to his view, this agreement is dangerous to the community. Last week I thought the other agreement was dangerous to the community, but the honourable member and others acted on that occasion like dervishes who were unable to dance. They were afraid to dance from the fear that they might lose the Bill which they were supporting, but the acted in the spirit of the dervish in regarding everybody who was not with them as an enemy. Those of us who took an independent stand last week could not have a stronger justification of our attitude than what is occurring in connection with this measure. Let those party organs which then tried to raise the cry of party discipline and party loyalty with regard to the financial agreement attempt now to exercise their authority and whip such scallywags as the honourable members for Grampians and Corangamite into their places behind the Government. Why do not they cry, "" How dare those honourable members insult the Government and the Prime Minister by refusing to swallow a sacred agreement arrived at by the Prime Minister and a former Premier of South Australia?"" If they were consistent they would not have a vocabulary extensive enough to describe those honourable members and their contumelious attitude. When the - honourable member for Kennedy hints at the likelihood of the Honorary Minister also taking up an independent stand and opposing the agreement, I expect the honourable member for Bris-bane to rise in his wrath and tell the honable member for Kennedy what he thinks - of him. The honourable member for Brisbane is loyal to the Ministry. What does - he care about pamphlets written, in the past? Votes recorded and expressions of opinions uttered in the past are nothing, and he must come behind the strong personality of the Prime Minister.",37
266,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"He came right home and voted for the other agreement. Mr Wilks. - The honourable member for Adelaide is trying to cause a split in the party on this side, but I want to defend the honourable member for Brisbane. Does he think I will sit here as a loyal supporter of the Government and allow an honorary member of it to be castigated in the way attempted by the honourable member for Kennedy? I am anxious for delay in this matter. If you, Mr Speaker, were on the floor of the House and a big proposition like this had to be dealt with, would you not think that the ordinary methods of delay should be resorted to? The honourable member for Wentworth is moving for a referendum on this question, and the honourable member for Batman has moved for a referendum on the question of the Federal Capital site. I shall not vote for a referendum in this case only to he asked to vote for a referendum on the other. If I voted for this motion, the ingenious Labourite would say to me, "" You voted for the referendum on the Northern Territory agreement, and you cannot refuse to vote for it on the Capital site question."" I am not to be caught in that way. I shall oppose both propositions. I guarantee that even the honourable member for Grey, a few weeks ago, never thought in his wildest dreams that the House would be mad enough to accept this proposition, with the conditions attached to it, in the way it has done. I do not want to ask another place to save us from the consequences of our own actions, but if this Chamber is foolish enough to pass the Bill, I cannot believe that another place will do so. If the Government do not intend to go on with the measure, or to carry it into effect when it is passed, the sooner they adjourn this debate the better. They have pushed the Bill to a good stage now, and its general principle has been accepted. Matters of detail can well he allowed to stand over for a further Conference and a further agreement, without any question of the destruction of party loyalty being raised.",38
267,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [3.10] - In rising to support the motion of the honourable member for Wentworth, I wish to say, by way of personal explanation, that I was paired with the honourable member for Richmond in yesterday's division, in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney, but in seme way that pair was not recorded. I hope the House will take into consideration all the facts in relation to this great question, and accept the motion, in order that the people may have some say regarding the expenditure of all this money. I have never seen a business proposition put before anybody for acceptance in the way that this has been put before us. We are told that the cost of the whole line of railway may be approximately estimated at ^4>5 > -00 000 We do not know how it is going to be built, or on what gauge. There has never been any survey, and we do not know what engineering difficulties will have to be overcome. What is roughly estimated at ^4>S ) 0 0 0 0 0 may run into Â£8,000,000 o r ,Â£9.'Â°Â°o,ooo before the work is done. Moreover, we do not know whether the line is going to pay. The only information the Government have put before us on that question is contained in the memorandum laid on the table of the House. This contains the statement that "" Five years after the completion of the railway it ought to pay both working expenses and interest, if the country is as good and valuable as it is believed to be by many in South Australia."" For a business proposition that appears to be absolutely the baldest and most irresponsible statement that could emanate from anybody. One would not think that ar.) Minister could put such a statement before a deliberative Assembly. If this House and the Commonwealth is going to find the money to build that northern railway to connect Port Darwin with the eastern and southern States, then upon this Parliament rests the responsibility of finding the best route-no t in the interests of one particular State, but in the interests of the whole Commonwealth-and running the line along it. We have only vague information as to the different routes, but we are asked to pledge ourselves to the exoenditure of an enormous sum of money without any data to work upon, and with but the vaguest statements as to the probable .cost. It is useless, and even dishonourable, to contend that, because there is no specific date laid down within which the railway to be built, we can, therefore, postpone indefinitely. As soon as this agreeShould ment is passed into law-if it ever is-an we take over the Territory, the South tralian Government will have a right to this Parliament: ""We have fuland, filled our part of the agreement; you ought to fulfil yours."" I heard similar argument used in connection with the Federal Capital site. urged that it was not specified when that site was to be established, and I remember with what indignation that argument was repudiated. The reply was that, having promised to do it, we ought to see that it was done. We have before us rival schemes for transcontinental railways.",38
268,Mr WISE,Unknown,They are not rivals.,39
269,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"At any rate, there two schemes, to one of which the Commonworth. wealth, if it adopts the agreement, will be pledged, while to the other it is not pledged. In common fairness, will not railway in regard to which a pledge given have to be constructed before that regard to which there is no pledge?",39
270,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Does the honourable ber mean to say that no pledge has given in regard to the construction of the Western Australian railway?,39

I shall be glad if the honourable member can show me that the Commonwealth bound by any pledge in connection with But, if we adopt the agreement with South Australia, we shall be bound to construct a transcontinental railway through that State and the Northern Territory as soon as Parliament can find the money for the work. If we have funds foi the construcworth, tion of one railway only, we must make the line now under discussion. These siderations cause me to pause. I should like the Commonwealth to take over the Northern Territory, but I consider the contheir ditions regarding railway resumption and construction unfair, and such as cannot accepted by us under present circumperhaps stances.",39

We are elected to deal with questions of this sort for the people, being supposed to be better acquainted with all details.

No objection was raised to the taking over of New Guinea. We are also to be asked to take over Norat folk Island, which will mean more expense. The taking over of the Northern TerriThe tory will cast a still heavier obligation us. The States never offer to the Comparty, monwealth a profitable Department. I would be well for the Government to give consideration to the ways of for controlling these non-paying concerns. If Ministers do not do this, we ourselves in a position of great difficulty. The Treasurer, no doubt, knows how he intends to manage the finances, but he not made any statement on the subject us, and, with the information, which now have, I do not see my way clear to for the third reading.

The press, in some cases, has condemned the proposal as absolutely ridiculous, viewed from the Commonwealth stand-point. If the Minister contends that mere press discussion is sufficient, apart from the conclusions arrived at, I do not think that he advances his position at all. We know, too, as I showed the other night, that the opinions expressed by the press change from day to day. Press opinion cannot be counted upon as continuous and consistent. An editorial in favour of - one view is written today, but if another man sits down in the editor's parlour to write on the same subject a month hence, the chances are unless the discipline of the office is very perfect, he may express another and different view.

290,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The other is for an amendment of the Constitution.,41
291,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It has been admitted that it is desirable to trust the people. We hear so much about the desirableness of submitting questions to the people that one wonders whether it would not be better to abolish Parliament and to allow the people to come together in the fields as they did in the old Anglo-Saxon "" moot "" days to discuss every public tion. I think that the tendency of modern times, however, is to more and more affirm the principle of representative government. The people return us to this Parliament, not to remit questions to them, but to on our own shoulders the responsibility of studying and determining them. How is it possible for the people, by a referendum, to enter into all the ramifications of the merits and demerits of such a question? The proposal to submit this question to the people, and the response with which it has been met, suggest that the cry with regard to trusting the people is little more than platitude in the mouths of honourable members. We know that the people do not wish to be trusted in the sense of having imposed upon them the consideration of complex questions which we are elected and paid That being so, this constant talk of trusting the people sounds like a mere placard intended to win a little popularity for certain honourable members. I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth, however^ that, apart from the constitutional aspect there is as much merit in the proposal to submit a question of this sort to the people as there is in one to submit the other question which it was decided last week should be submitted for their consideration. The other question is more complex; and it will require a deep study of the Constitution, and a close and intimate knowledge of the finances of the whole of Australia to satisfactorily determine it. I avail myself of this opportunity to say that there is no difference of opinion in this House with regard to the wisdom of taking over the that, Northern Territory. I have never heard two opinions as to the justice of South Australia being recouped the expenditure she has incurred in her pioneering and enterprising efforts, so far as they proare of value, to do something with this enormous tract of country. But the question of the terms on which we should take it over is quite another matter. As one of the conditions of the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, we are asked lo take over a State railway. Honourable members who support the agreement tell us that the Territory contains such extraordinary mineral and other wealth that it will be a most valuable asset in the hands of the Commonwealth. If that is so, is it not highly desirable that South Australia shculd have a State-owned railway running to the border of such a Territory ? She has quesa railway running now to Oodnadatta, and if the Territory is capable of such great development when the Commonwealth has taken charge of it, why is South Australia' so anxious that we should make take the important departure of consenting to take over and pay for a State railroad ? It seems to me that South Australia rather stultifies herself when, through her representatives, she says in one breath, "" The Northern Territory is so marvellously rich that in the hands of the Commonwealth, and with a little capital expended upon its development, it will bea come a magnificent asset,"" while in thenext, she declares virtually that she does not desire to be connected with that Territory by a railway of her own. She calls upon the Commonwealth, not only to take over the Territory and to expend money upon its development, but to take over one of her own railway lines and to pay her for it. If that line is going to pay its way, and it ought to, if the glowing statements we have heard with regard to the richness of the Territory are true, why does South Australia desire to part with it ? Honourable members who intend to vote for the third reading of the Bill should consider whether the desire on the part of South Australia to have this railway taken out of her hands is not proof that there have been gross exaggerations with regard to the wealth and prospects of the Territory?",41
292,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That was a condition imposed by the Commonwealth.,42
293,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Then South Australia will not be keen about its observance.,42
294,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I have heard the ultimate cost of this project variously estimated at from ,Â£4,000,000 to Â£10,000,000.",42
295,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Ove r Â£[10,000,000.",42
296,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I am not going to try to get at the exact amount, because I do not think, that any honourable member knows what it is.",42
297,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The Treasurer does.,42
298,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I do not think that he knows any more about it than he does of the probable cost of the proposed railway connection with Western Australia, and of that we still know very little. Whether this transfer is going to cost the Commonwealth Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or jÂ£6,000,000,.the money will have to be found, not by South Australia, but by the whole Commonwealth. It must be accepted almost as an axiom that if the whole of the Commonwealth is to contribute towards this enormous expenditure, it should be given an opportunity of participating in the benefits of reaching this Eldorado. What effort is being made by the Government to secure to Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland an opportunity of reaching it? They are actually asking us to accept an agreement which provides for the construction of a railway through impossible country; and they are proposing to close that bargain in such a way as to oblige this House to agree to the construction of a railway through the centre of the Territory, and so to necessitate Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland extending their railways many additional hundreds of miles, whereas by a detour, which would involve only a modification of the agreement, each of those three great States, representing almost four-fifths of the population of Australia, would be able to reach the railway ultimately terminating at Port Darwin. Have honourable members considered that fact? It has occurred to me that there has crept into this question a little of that element which the Americans call "" back-scratching."" We have Western Australia, so ably represented by the right honourable member for Swan, anxious to have her transcontinental railway",42
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Will not the adoption of this agreement k ill that project?,42
300,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"There is, surely, no possible connection between the two.",42
301,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Excep t the financial consideration.,42
302,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The adoption of this agreement may render it more difficult, financially, to carry out the Western Australian project, but there is no real connection between the two proposals. The two great reasons advanced in favour of the Western Australian transcontinental railway are, in the first place, that it would be useful for military purposes-and that is a farcical reasonand secondly, that it would fulfil an implied Constitutional undertaking on the part of the eastern States to bring the west into connection with the east. That I do not recognise; for it is not in the Constitution. The Northern raihvay, for which this agreement provides, has nothing in common with the railway which it is proposed to construct between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie; and to say that the one project kills the other is to make a purposeless parallel. There is no connection between the two.",42
303,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Sav e the financial connection.,42
304,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Then there will be more log-rolling to determine which shall be constructed first. If one is to cost Â£6,000,00 0 and the other Â£ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 there will be a considerable agitation in this House by-and-by as to which should first be constructed. I repeat that there is evidence of what the Americans call ""backscratching "" in this House. The advocates of the Western Australian transcontinental raihvay are practically saying to the advocates of the northern line, "" If you want us to go for your 1 ail way you must support that for which we ask,"" and the others are replying, "" If you want us to go for your line you must support ours."" And so a number of votes are being used for State 'advantages. In this matter, and the other to which I have referred, there has been distinct evidence of honourable members giving up their Commonwealth obligations and sentiments to benefit the particular State to which they belong. The representatives of South Australia are apparently forgetting their Commonwealth obligations in voting so unanimously, and speaking so suggestively, in one way, as they have done with regard to this question. I have listened to their speeches in this House, and have not heard one of them offer an answer to the argument as to the claims of the eastern States to have an opportunity to connect with the Northern Territory line. Their whole argument has been, "" South Australia has done a wonderful thing in embarking upon this pioneering enterprise, and the Commonwealth ought to take over the Territory."" TKey have completely disregarded the claims of the eastern States which will have to become liable for the bulk of the money necessary to enable this agreement to be carried out. I do not think that is desirable. presentatives of each State are going on every occasion to allow themselves as in this question to be influenced by State interests, and to put aside broader Commonwealth considerations, then we shall simply be resolving ourselves into a duplication of the State Legislatures. We might just as well have an annual meeting of all the State Houses sitting as a Parliament to decide Federal questions. The very object we had in establishing in Australia this seventh body pol'tic was that representatives might be induced to view questions apart from purely State interests, and to consider the effect that legislation is likely to have from the broader and more general aspect of Commonwealth interests. Ever since iqoi, in connection with one of our largest Departments, we have been depleting our revenue, rather than float loans for permanent and revenue-producing works. Notwithstanding that this Government recognises that a loan policy is the proper one to adopt in connection with such works, it has always been said, "" The Labour party are opnosed on principle to the policv of borrowing."" I should like to know-bear ing this in mind-ho w the Labour party are going to justify the expenditure of about Â£10,000,000 on the Northern Territory and the transcontinental railway.",42
305,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,They will provide for it by direct taxation. Mr Bruce Smith.,43
306,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,It is only a means to an end.,43
307,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If honourable members think that the imposition of direct taxation is to be promoted by the passing of this measure are they going to assist to pass it ? Would it not be far better for the Government to show that they are going to establish a loan policy-that this work is to be carried out with loan moneys ? At present, there is no indication of our being able to overcome the determination of the Labour party to oppose all loan proposals. If there were any such Ministerial indication, the Government have had an admirable opportunity, in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department, which we know has been starved for years owing to revenue moneys having to be used for permanent and revenue-producing works. Even in this year, as in the last, something like ,Â£700,000 will be taken out of revenue for such works. If the Government are not going to raise loans for that class of works, and are yet going to use loan moneys in the case of the Northern If re- Territory, how can Labour members justify themselves in voting for a project which will involve the complete sacrifice of one of the first principles of their policy? I confess that I cannot understand how .this transformation has come about. It would be a very interesting psychological study if we could look into the minds of those honourable members who have opposed a loan policy from year to year, and ascertain why there has been this sudden and complete change of attitude.",43
308,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,The Treasurer can twist them round hisfinger!,43
309,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I have not as much confidence in the ability of the Treasurer, in that regard, as has the honourable member for Balaclava. I am sure that neither the public nor the press understands the change; and, even supposing that the ""back-scratching"" habit which is so prevalent in America is an element here, while it may account for a great many changes, it by no means can account for all. It will remain a mystery for some time to come how this great transformation has been brought about. I can only say that I regard this as a reckless measure, which will throw upon the Commonwealth an enormous and unjustifiable expenditure, and which will compel the eastern States, representing the great bulk of the population, to contribute the greater proportion of the cost, while they are denied a fair participation in any benefits that might, under certain circumstances, result.",43
310,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [3.48] - The honourable member for Parkes always gets attention, because he speaks honestly and courageously. On this occasion, however, while he may have spoken courageously, he has not spoken of some members of trie House with that fairness that I think he usually aims at. He has said straight out that there has been a considerable amount of log-rolling in connection with this measure, and has singled out Western Australian representatives as actively participating in that particular Parliamentary operation. As a Western Australian representative, I deny that I have been approached in any way, either directly or indirectly; and I feel sure that all the Western Australian representatives are in pretty well the same position. As a proof of this, I point out that the Western Australian members are divided, some being in favour of the Bill, and others against it. Only last night, I moved an amendment, and was accused of adopting a hostile attitude towards the northern railway scheme. This does not look as if the Western Australian members were actively in sympathy with this Bill on account of some supposed benefit they will derive. It is to be regretted that such statements should be made against them on the mere suspicion of any honourable member. I have supported this Bill because I believe it is the duty of the Commonwealth to take over this great Territory; and, although the proposed railway construction is incidental, the measure does not commit Parliament to it at any definite time. Undoubtedly, this railway will be built sooner or later, but I believe it will be many years before it will be undertaken. I am not committed, nor have I committed my State, to the construction within any definite period; and, in that respect, this scheme is very much in the position of the scheme for a transcontinental line to Western Australia. While the latter scheme has, in my opinion, a prior claim, they are both absolutely necessary to the development of Australia, and to that true national unity which was aimed at when we entered into Federation. I hope I shall hear no more of these insinuations, which, for my part, I indignantlv repudiate, and which, so far as the members from Western Australia are concerned who have been definitely named in this connection, are absolutely without justification.",44
311,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.52] - I hope that the question of the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States will not be introduced into this discussion. The honourable member for Parkes expressed the opinion that the question before us had an equal claim with that of the financial agreement to be submitted to a referendum of the people. But I point out that the financial agreement involves a change in the Constitution, which must, of necessity, be submitted to the people in that way, while the agreement as to the Northern Territory stands on a different ground.",44
312,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That distinction does not affect the partu, I suppose?",44
313,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It ' does, because we might go a little further in regard to the financial agreement. It was stated by the Prime Minister that if that agreement were rejected by the Parliament, it would be carried to the people at the next election as part of the Government policy; and, believing that the agreement was a fair one for submisison to the people, as a single issue detached from any party policy or candidate, I supported that Bill. Such a method certainly gives the people a better opportunity to pronounce a straight out opinion, clearly and definitely, than if the question were submitted as part of the Government policy. I intend to vote against the motion of the honourable member for Wentworth, because I believe Parliament should take the responsibility of deciding questions expressly delegated to it by the Constitution. If 'we are to have a referendum on this question, there is no reason why every question involving large expenditure should not be similarly submitted, such as that of the Federal Capital site, the transcontinental railway to Western Australia, and so forth. My objection to the referendum, generally,' as a principle, is that this Parliament is elected by the people to perform certain duties which legitimately come within the Constitution, and that we should take the responsibility, leaving the people to pronounce their opinion regarding our action at the general election. Tf every important ouestion is to be submitted to a referendum, an opportunity will be presented to members to dodge tlieir pledges, and thereby become largely demoralized. As I said yesterdav, I am aorjalled to think that this House should deliberately commit itself to a possible expenditure of Â£10.000,000, largely upon a railway which, in my opinion, is altogether unnecessary for developmental purposes. This Territory must, I think, be developed by railways running inland from the northern coast; and the proposed railway through the unexplored and undeveloped centre of Australia, while it might be a good project twenty or twenty-five years hence, has no justification at the present stage.",44
314,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"There is a line of 150 miles running from the northern coast, but it does not pay.",45
315,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"For the simple reason that other elements enter into the development of the country. Grazing has not been a success in the northern districts, because the people have not been placed on the land in the proper way. When the time comes for agricultural settlement, there will have to be experimental stations, with water conservation from some of the important' rivers; and the present grass, which is too coarse for fattening purposes, will have to be replaced by artificial grasses, as has been necessary in the most important grazing and dairying district I know of in Australia. That country can only be developed by the intelligent industry of the people and the expenditure of large sums of money; and to spend, say, ,Â£7,000,000 on this proposed railway, while the northern areas are crying out for a large expenditure, would be a step we could not contemplate. I have always expressed myself enthusiastically in favour of taking over the Territory; but I am against the construction of a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek at this stage; and that is my justification for voting as I did yesterday. This railway project, in my view, is a, huge mistake; and, as it is a vital part of^he Bill, I shall be compelled to vote against the third reading.",45
316,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [3-5 ]-- 8 14 is a matter for sincere regret, in the interests of the whole Commonwealth, that so many honourable members were absent yesterday, and happened to be unpaired. This, I take it, was largely due to the fact that they were not aware that the question would come up for discussion.",45
317,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It was announced last week.,45
318,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Then it must have escaped the minds of honourable members; and I am sure that, when they saw the newspapers this morning, they must have been considerably surprised at the result of vesterday's divisions, especially when they reflect upon the speeches previously delivered by some honourable members, which* certainly gave the impression that their votes would be cast in an entirely different way. However, every honourable member isresponsible for his opinions and votes to his own constituents. They are the people who have to be consulted, and so long as they aresatisfied, the House has no reason to complain. It is certain that a little while agothere were very few members on either side, even including those who most warmly advocate this proposal, who dreamt that thesecond reading would be carried, still lessthat the Bill in its original form would', go through Committee, and the agreement endorsed with its monstrous provisions regarding the obligations of railway construction and the taking over of existing works. The honourable member for Parkes chose, as one of the absentees of yesterday, to put in an appearance to-dav and lecture some honourable members on> their attitude. Indeed, it has become a favourite attitude of the honourable member lately to assume the role of lecturergeneral to the House on almost every question. I resent that kind of thing, especially from one who is so frequentlyabsent and unpaired. I never attempt to lecture other honourable members. I recognise that every honourable member is the keeper of his own conscience, and has the right to please himself, being responsible only to his own constituents if he happens to change his mind or his vote. We may, perhaps, make some comment on the fact that such a thing has been done; but it is not the province of any honourable member to set himself up as the censor or custodianof the consciences of other members. Trt the course of his lecturette, as he styled it, the honourable member for Parkes attempted 1 to draw an analogy between the financial agreement recently entered into between the State Premiers and the Prime Minister, and' this agreement. There is absolutely noanalogy. In the case of the financial agreement there was a certain provision embodied' in the Constitution for a fixed period, during which no alteration could take place. The time was approaching when the fixed' period would end, and it would become necessary to make some alteration. In view of that fact the Premiers met in Conference to anticipate the expiration of the constitutional provision, and the agreement arrived at was, therefore, on a footing totally different from this. There is nothing in the Constitution involving any compulsion! on the Commonwealth to take over the thern Territory or its debts, or the responvoluntarily sibilities associated with its administration. ning This is a purely voluntary matter so the Commonwealth is concerned, and agreement was entered into on the express understanding that it must receive the fication of both Houses of Parliament. But in regard to the financial agreement, the Prime Minister gave the House clearly to understand that whether it was ratified by likelv that there will be any Parliament or not, it would go to the counfor try as part of the Government policy the endorsement of the people, and he therehalf century at least. fore asked the House to sanction a Bill authorize a referendum on the subject.",45
319,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is precisely the same in this case, for if this agreement is not latest. approved by Parliament, the Government will go to the country upon it.",46
320,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Not necessarily, nor is it at all likely where the majority Government supporters are strongly opto it. posed to its railway provisions. It is not likely to form a part of the Governfeatures ment programme, because a large number of Government supporters would absolutely refuse to endorse it. 1 cannot conceive the Government attempting to do such a suicidal thing as to unnecessarily drive wedge into the midst of their party at elections.",46
321,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,At least they have never indicated their intention of doing so.,46
322,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"They have not, and would certainly exhibit a want of acumen and political tact if they attempted this agreement were submitted to the people tomorrow for their endorsement, it is tain that it would be condemned throughmoment's examination. out the Commonwealth, with, perhaps, the one exception of the State most directly concerned financially, and that the reprement sentatives of the people would be instructed to oppose it, especially when the people tained some idea of the expenditure likely to be involved and the amount of extra taxation which would probably have to imposed upon every family in Australia.",46
323,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It is quite certain that the people learn the truth about the finantory cial agreement they will reject it.,46
324,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not think but, of course, one can never accurately foretell public sentiment. The two matdestroying his own argument. ters, however, stand on an entirely footing. One necessarily means taxation - either by the States or the Commonwealth - for ordinary purposes of administration, continual loss and no profit. Norbut the other means the Commonwealth undertaking expenditure runinto upwards of Â£10,000,000 far as for which no necessity has yet been the shown to exist. No immediate danger threatens us; there is no immediate ratinecessity for expenditure on any of the railway lines indicated, nor from present indications, and the present rate of growth of the population, does it seem need action by the Commonwealth on for some of the grounds urged for the next It is, therefore, a to matter that can well afford to wait indefinitely. The other is a pressing matter that must be met by the end of next year at It would be wise to obtain an expression of the opinion of the people upon this.question, which touches their pockets so closely and heavily, before Parliament is of committed to any definite course in regard When we examine the financial aspect of the matter it presents appalling from a business point of view. If the South Australian Government and the representatives of that State in this Parliaof ment believe the Northern Territory to be so magnificent as they declare, and so capa able of producing all that they claim for it the - if it is such a veritable gold mine only awaiting development-wh y are they so anxious to get rid of it ? That is the one pertinent outstanding question that has not yet been satisfactorily answered.",46
325,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,On the same principle that many working miners have had to give it. If up a good thing to a syndicate.,46
326,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is a piece of cersophistry which can be exploded after a The individual miner is not in a position to raise loans to obtain the necessary capital for the developof his claim, but a State with alleged enormously valuable assets to offer as obsecurity would have no trouble in obtaining the necessary money. As a matter of fact, loan after loan has been raised to develop be the Territory and construct public works, and the result has been to render the finani f cial position of the country more unsatisfacyear by year by increasing the annual deficit on the administration and attempted so, development of the Territory.",46
327,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member is We have different reached the end of our tether.,46
328,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Of course, borrowing cannot go on for ever where there is If the Territory had all the potentialities claimed for it, South Australia could have obtained all the capital necessary to achieve success; but the result of all that has been done is nil. Whilst the expenditure has been growing every year, the income from the Territory has been getting less. There is a greater disparity between the income and the expenditure every year, and if this . went on at the same rate, and South Australia continued to bear the incubus of the administration of the Territory, it would be only a question of a little time before she would certainly become bankrupt.",46
329,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"They tried to give it away to a syndicate, and could not.",47
330,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"We have been told about the millions of capital waiting to be invested by people who are anxious to construct railways on the land grant system. I dare say that those honourable members who have advanced that statement believe it themselves, but I do not, nor can - anybody who has read anything of the Territory imagine that people with moriey to invest would pass by all the fields of profitable investment offering in other parts of the world to go to this desert for the purpose of acquiring useless land and constructing railways which would have no possibility of paying unless some extraordinary mining or other development occurred. If there were any syndicate at Home which, owing to the glowing and highly-coloured misrepresentations made to them as to the possibilities of the Territory, expressed a desire to construct a railway on the land grant system, I am sure that even if they had the option, they would abandon the"" scheme as soon as their agents' reports regarding the possibilities of the country as a paying proposition reached them. No offer of any area of land on the free grant system would induce wealthy capitalistic syndicates to undertake the construction of lines which would involve them, perhaps for all time, in a certain annual loss. Let us now examine the financial position under the proposed agreement, as stated by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth in a minute to the Prime Minister, in which we may take it for granted the subject is viewed in as good a light as possible. The Treasurer says The financial obligations connected with this agreement have been considered by the Treasury, and the results are hereunder submitted for your information. The financial loss is certain to be considerable for some years, but, as far as reasonable, a favourable view of the future has been taken. The whole matter has been dealt with under four heads, viz. :I . Northern Territory indebtedness to South Australia. II . Port Augusta to Oodnadatta Railway indebtedness to South Australia. III . The railway from Pine Creek to join the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. I V. Recapitulation (after completion of the railway from Pine Creek to join the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta Railway). No doubt a favourable view of the future was taken. Then follows this account of the indebtedness of the Northern Territory to South AustraliaLoans outstanding on 30th June, 1908 ... ...

Â£158,439This loss of Â£158,439 does not include anything for special Commonwealth expenditure ondevelopment of the Territory. The figures given above cover merelv the; loss for which the Commonwealth will be liable, and does not take into account future developmental expenditure by us, which would run into millions of pounds. These figures are appalling, and should cause us to seriously consider the proposal for the transfer .of the Territory, even if it were not associated with the taking over of existing non-paying railways and an obligation to spend an enormous sum on railway construction. The statement given in regard to the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway is as follows :Loans outstanding on 30th June, 1908 ... ... Maturing as shown hereunder :1922 to 1936 ...

How are we to raise the money for this purpose? In addition to being asked to bind ourselves to take over and work the unprofitable railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, we are asked to construct a line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, whose length we are informed would be 1,063 miles, or about 1,350 miles if taken east of Lake Eyre, and its cost approximately Â£[4,500.000. At the same time we should be bearing the cost of the non-paying line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, and of that from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.

What urgency is there for a proposition that will involve I am surprised"" In that the Government should try to push matter to a conclusion at this stage to of the session, relying on the LabourOpposition to help them through when they hear that the majority on their own side of the House is antagonistic to the raihvay and financial stipulations of the agreement, and when the election offers an early opportunity of eliciting the opinion of the people in regard to its terms; it is a question which vitally concerns the community generally, and one on which they have not as yet been consulted. I am sorry to have taken up more time than I intended, but the importance of the subject must be my justification. If the matter be referred to the people, I shall strongly advise my constituents to resist any attempt to take over the Territory on the terms of the agreement. It might be advisable, from many points of view, for the Commonwealth to relieve South Australia of a burden which is proving too heavy for her shoulders; but, if the people be willing to thus help South Australia, by taking upon their own shoulders her existing burden, the Territory should be taken over on fair and reasonable terms-term s just to the whole of the people, and not in the interests' of only one particular State.",50
354,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [4.55]. - I intend to support the proposal for the recommittal of the Bill. When the financial agreement with the States was before the House, a majority were very anxious to allow it to go before the people for consideration ; and we must recognise that in connection with the Northern Territory the Government are introducing quite a new principle. It is proposed to take over unpayable railways from one State, and to saddle the Commonwealth with the cost of their running. In Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, there are a number of unpayable lines which the Governments of those States would no doubt be very pleased to hand over. should the Commonwealth be saddled with the bad bargains of the various States? It seems incredible that the Government should initiate such a policy. They are quite reversing the Micawber attitude, be' cause their exclamation will apparently be: "" Thank God, we have taken over another liability !"" I wish to point out that it will be impossible to make use of this railway in connection with an overland line. I haye consulted an engineer of very high standing, with much experience in many parts of the world, and he tells me that a 3 f t . 6 in. gauge is absolutely useless for a long distance railway. It will be seen, therefore, that, if we take over this line, it have to be run as a separate and non-payable venture. It will be useless for military purposes, because the standard gauge of 4 f t . 8Â£ in. is the lightest that could possibly be used for overland traffic.",51

362,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,And a nice mess was made of the transport!,51
363,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,They made an excellent job of it.,51
364,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I ' should like to see a better job here. We have virtually parted with the whole of our Customs revenues to the States, and have granted heavy bonuses for the stimulation of production and industries; and 'now it is proposed to take over a liability of Â£[10,000,000, and pay interest on it for a great many years. The honourable member for North ' Sydney showed last evening that the loss on this line for ten years would be Â£[750,000 at least; and I think that if the figures were carefully analyzed, it would prove to be a But why million, in addition to the interest on the debt we are taking over. We have to provide for old-age pensions, and our naval and military defence; and before we know where we are, we shall, without any borrowing, have to find Â£[8,000,000 or Â£[9,000,000 for services that return nothing to the Commonwealth. We are taking over from the States every service that is valueless to them and to us, relieving individualStates at the expense of the Commonwealth, as a whole, and yet no consideration is shown to the National Parliament as.regards the future. It would be unreasonable and unfair, if the people did not have an opportunity, by means will of the referendum, of stating whether ox not they approve of the Government taking over further unpayable services. This question is quite as serious a one as the financial scheme for the people as a whole to consider by means of a referendum. There have been great cries of. "" Trust the people,"" yet the trusters are afraid to trust them in a matter of this importance. They say, "" Oh, no; we are capable of dealing with' this. We are capable of dealing with everything that suits the majority. We do not trust the people where they are incurring liabilities. We are going to thrust those on them."" It is more reasonable that they should have an opportunity of dealing with a matter like this than that* we should take the responsibility of imposing such a burden on them without giving them an opportunity of being consulted. There would not be the slightest trouble in putting, at the next election, the question, "" Are you in favour of taking over the Northern Territory with the liability of this railway ?"" The people could answer ""Yes"" or "" No "" to that in a very simple manner, but, as the honourable member for Parkes pointed out, the financial question is a very complicated scheme to submit to them, and very difficult to explain to tr-'em. If we are not going to protect the finances, it is time the people took a hand in it themselves. The question is brought up at this late stage of the session, and we know that a number of honourable members have expressed opinions absolutely adverse to the taking over of the Territory with this railway incubus, although they seem to have been log-rolled, or buttonholed, or duced in some other way to support it. The Government, instead of listening to the opinions of their own supporters, have carried the Bill by the votes of the Opposition, who have voted as solidly on it as they voted against the Government on the financial question. We, on this side, were twitted last week with having joined the Labour party, but nothing is said about the Government joining the Labour party now, nor do the Government say anything about dishing their own supporters by the votes of the Labour party. If we construct the transcontinental line, we shall have to become responsible for the line the whole of the way from the Northern Territory to Adelaide. What is the use of having a terminus at Port Augusta, over 200 miles from Adelaide? Surelv the line should go from a live town in the Territory to the capital of South Australia, rather than to a place which is nearly as dead as Julius Caesar. I believe that Port Augusta has been retrogressing year by year, yet the Government pretend that they are willing to construct a railway line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, whereas, if they build an overland line at all, it ought to go a great deal further east. The proper way to take it is round through the better lands, terminating it at Adelaide. It seems to me that the people of the other States are not being fairly treated. Why should they be asked to take over such large liabilities from a State which is getting from the Commonwealth a grant more' than sufficient to pay the interest? In years to come the payment of 25 s. per head by the Commonwealth will amount to a very large sum. What are we to be left with? We shall have to find the money to pay the interest. We are taking over liabilities to meet which will require us in a few years to borrow ,Â£50,000,000, and the interest on that will amount to nearly Â£2,000,000 a year. We shall have to meet these liabilities without possessing any revenue-producing properties. The Postmaster General's Department at present does not pay its way, yet it is the only concern we have which has any chance of meeting its engagements. Every other Department is absolutely a dead loss to the Commonwealth, yet we are going to burden ourselves with a debt of Â£[50,000,000, and get nothing in return. We have parted with our Customs revenue. We may have the Excise revenue, but the inevitable rei n - sult will be that we shall have to duplicate the land and income taxes. What will happen then? The .people will either suggest the abolition of the Commonwealth Parliament or they will go for unification. It will be one 01 the other, and I should not be at all surprised if they said, "" Let us have a council of the State Premiers to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth, and wipe out the Commonwealth Parliament, which has put us into this hoTe, and which evidently cannot manage the affairs committed to it . """,51
365,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [5.6] I regret that I was absent yesterday when the vote was taken, but I must say that, with other honourable members, I was perfectly astounded at the total reversion-of form shown on this question. When the Bill was introduced early in the session, I do not believe that one-quarter of the members of the House would have voted for the agreement as it stands. One point which I have not heard put today is the serious responsibility and enormous obligation that we shall place by this agreement upon future residents of the Northern Territory. If the agreement is to be anything in the way of a success, it will mean that a sufficient number of people will be settled in the Northern Territory to enable them to make it a State, and to seek admission into the Union. Yet we are now telling future settlers in the Territory that they will to begin their new political life with an indebtedness of from Â£10,000,000 to ,Â£15,000,000 round their necks, and that a railway must be constructed and maintained at their cost, no matter whether it pays or not, or whether or not it is suitable for the development of the country. There is a consensus of opinion in the House that the development of the Territory will not be best served by a line running due north and south. Many honourable members who know something of the country assert that the better way to develop the Territory would be from New South Wales and Queensland. Be that as it may, I claim that the future residents of the Territory are the people who ought to decide the matter. We have no right to say to them, "" We shall construct this railway for you and hand it over to you with all its indebtedness, and with an obligation upon you to run it for all time, whether it pays or not, and whether it is necessary or not."" I take that the terms upon which the contract will be given effect to will be on somewhat the same lines as those on which South Australia has carried out its most unfortunate dealings with the Territory; that is, that a debtor and creditor account will be kept in connection with the railway, and that all the losses sustained by the Commonwealth-and every one admits that there will be heavy losses-will handed over to the Territory when it assumes responsible government. is a condition which might well make the House pause. Is it fair to the new State - to saddle it with the tremendous consequences of the muddle and serious blunders made by the South Australian Government ? The whole history of British settlement will not show so ghastly a failure, and such - small resiilts from the expenditure of money, as are shown in connection with South Australia's dealing with the Northern Territory. There is an existing indebtedness Mr MCWilliams. of between Â£[3,000,000 and Â£4,000,000, and a white population of under 1,000 people. Now South Australia is asking us, not only to relieve her of that failure, which I think the House would be quite prepared to do, but also to incur an obligation to construct a raihvay which she has never constructed herself, because her losses from the sections already built were so enormous that she never completed the connection. She insists, however, as have part of the agreement, that we should carry that railway through what is generally admitted to be' an absolute desert for the greater portion of its length, and with an obligation to continue to run it, whether it paysÂ«or not. That is not a fair deal between - South Australia and the Commonwealth, or between South Australia and the other States. There is no doubt that the proposition involves a borrowing policy. Numbers of honourable members like myself have viewed, almost with horror, the prospect of the Commonwealth becoming a seventh borrower in the markets of the world, yet honourable members are deliberately plunging the Commonwealth into a policy which will necessitate immediate borrowing if the works indicated in the agreement are to be carried out. T do not think the argument put forward by the honourable memlier for Perth was fair. It would not be giving South Australia a. fair deal to say to her, "" Yes, we shall construct that railway. We shall put it into the contract that we must construct it ; but we do not it say when we shall do so. It may be now or a hundred years hence."" That would not be carrying out the spirit of the agreement, at any rate. I take it that every member who votes for it pledges himself to carry out the whole of its conditions in the immediate future. If I voted for it as it stands, I should regard it as only fair and honest treatment of South Australia to carry out the contract in its entirety. be I view the matter just as I did the proposal for a survey of the Kalgoorlie to That Port Augusta railway. I. have no sympathy with men. who voted for the survey without the slightest intention of voting for the raihvay. I believe that of those two railways, the one to Western Australia has the prior claim; but by passing this agreement, we shall practically prevent it from being made. I did not support that line; but if I had to take my choice of the two, I should distinctly vote for the one from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie in preference to that from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek; because, in the first place, we should have at least two termini of large and flourishing populations, and a mail service. The other raihvay would go through the heart of a desert into a country about which, we know nothing. In building it, we should be spending money from which we should expect to get nothing in return. The combined railways would cost from Â£10,000,000 to Â£12,000,000. If the Commonwealth borrows Â£[4,000,000 or Â£5,000,000 for railway construction, Parliament will not be inclined to sanction fresh work until it has seen the results of that expenditure. Not many honourable members can be of opinion that these two railways should be constructed almost simultaneously, and in the near future. But every one who votes for the ratification of the agreement will be in honour bound to support the construction of the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. It is because I believe that the people have not given the matter the consideration which it deserves that I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, and, should it not toe carried, shall vote against the third reading. The people should be given an opportunity to express their opinion, either directly on a referendum or indirectly at the elections, before the Commonwealth is plunged into extensive borrowing to pay for work for which we have made no provision. At the present time our revenue is hardly sufficient to meet existing obligations, and recently the Treasurer had to ask the assistance of the Premiers to vide for the payment of old-age pensions. On his last Budget there was not a shilling available for extra expenditure. are asked to undertake an obligation amounting to over Â£10,000,000. Before this is done we should be told how the necessary money will be found. It is very improper to propose enormous expenditure without giving information of that kind. Many of the proposals which have been brought before us show an almost reckless disregard of financial considerations, and their adoption would plunge the Commonwealth into a policy of borrowing which I , for one, think should be deferred as long as possible, and only undertaken at last for works which will prove reproductive. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [5.19] I shall not detain honourable members long, as I gave brief expression , to my views night. The splendid speech of the honourable member for Lang, and the figures which he gave, show that we are being asked to accept an obligation whose magnitude we can hardly estimate. I feel my loyalty to the Government strained by this proposal. I agreed to the second reading on the understanding that amendments would be permitted in Committee, but the Minister in charge of the measure has not encouraged those supporting the Government to give it every fair and honest criticism.",52
366,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely there has been sufficient opportunity for free criticism.,54
367,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"The Government have declined to accept amendmentsWhile I do not wish to shirk my responsibilities as a member, the Government have such narrow majorities on many of the large matters now agitating the public mind that I am inclined to support proposals'for referring them to the people for decision. The expenditure of the Commonwealth Departments is increasing unduly. The honourable member for Lang showed that the annual obligation under the proposed agreement would be about Â£400,000, but the lack of business control in Commonwealth administration justifies us in adding another ,Â£200,000 or ,Â£300,000, and even then we shall probably not reach the limit. For old-age pensions we are paying today about Â£1,500,000, but before the Estimates of revenue and expenditure for next year are put before 'us, the sum will be much larger. Our expenditure will also be increased by the cost of the improved naval and military defence scheme, while the ordinary Departpro- ments of Government are steadily becoming more costly. During the past nine years, and especially during the past five years, Yet we the Commonwealth expenditure has steadily increased. The other night 1 asked the honourable member for Mernda whether, if a vote were taken again in the near future, the people of Victoria would vote for Federation. I have no hesitation in saying that they would not. I have travelled through the north-eastern and northern parts of the State as much as any man, and know that the universal feeling there is that the Commonwealth is overstepping the bounds which it ought to respect. When we took over the State Departments at the beginning of Federation, our expenditure, according to Sir George Turner, was Â£[2,900,000. I had many consultations with him, and felt with Mr Coghlan that last finance would be the rock on which we should break. I do not wish the Commonwealth to break, but our disregard for financial considerations is endangering Commonwealth interests. Honourable members generally have to accept the people's verdict in regard to their own election, and are bound by the expression of their opinions. I think, therefore, it will be better to refer this matter to the constituencies. If the public of the other five States wish to assist South Australia, let them say so. If they think that the taking over of the Northern Territory is necessary in the interests of Australia,' they will vote for it . In view of the slight difference in number between those who support this proposal and those who oppose it, I think that the agreement should be submitted to the people.

The South Australian members have gone to considerable trouble to convince the House that we are being asked to pay only Â£[10.500,000 or so for what is virtually a paradise. An explorer, Mr. David Lindsay, has lectured to us, giving what we thought at the time were merely his own views as to the possibilities of this region.

This consideration is entitled tp the utmost weight. I am convinced that neither the Government nor the House desires it to be said or thought that it has been made the tool of company or syndicate promoters. It is a statement that I cannot make of my own express knowledge, but I make it on information that 1 do not believe to be incorrect, and in the full belief that everything I say is true.

412,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I think that additional evidence in support of my statement is to be found in the very attitude of representatives of South Australia. Did they not hasten to disclaim any responsibility for Mr Lindsay as soon as I referred to him?,57
413,Mr RICHARD FOSTIER,Unknown,I shall tell the honourable member something presently.,57
414,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Tak e no notice of the honourable member for Wentworth. He is only out for mischief.,57
415,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member for Adelaide would prevent the honourable member for Wakefield from giving the House the benefit of his experience. What is this league?  charges against honourable men.,57
416,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The chairman of the company is one of the most honourable men in Australia. ,57
417,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Then it is a company, although five minutes ago representatives of South Australia denied that it was ! Is this company a philanthropic institution, or is it like other companies, out to make profits? Whether it is a philanthropic institution or an ordinary company, the fact remains that it has sent to Melbourne a gentleman with a distinguished career to influence honourable members to pass this agreement and to pass, it for its benefit. I think that I have proved, out of the mouths of these honourable members themselves, the information given to me.. It is a company. Like every other company, it is out for profits, and has sought to influence our judgment on (a certain Bill, the passing'of which will give it profits. Has this House reached' such a stage of degradation that we are to allow to be engineered through it, without opposition or exposure-and I use the word "" exposure "" in its mildest sense- a measure which, while it will impose the greatest financial burdens upon the taxpayers of Australia, will have a bright side to it, the bright side of putting profits into the pockets of a private syndicate?",57
418,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Everythin g we do has that effect. That might be said of every Act that we pass.,57
419,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am'glad to know that an honourable member of the Labour party considers that a sufficient ground for supporting this Bill I Tn the honourable member's own electorate, there are many families who find it difficult to make both ends meet. If this Bill be passed as it stands, every one of the honourable member's constituents, every member of his constituents' families, will have to bear the burden of the accumulated debt upon nonpaying railways and unprofitable enterprises.",57
420,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I tried to show what would happen to my constituents as the result of a vote that the honourable member proposed to give last week, but I could not induce him to alter his mind.",57
421,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member is anxious now .to excuse himself for the wrong he is doing to the poor of his electorate in supporting this Bill by suggesting that I did a wrong to the poor of my own electorate by a vote that I cast last week. I refuse to be drawn from the present controversy. I insist upon the honourable member keeping his conscience to the present issue, and observing his duty to the people, remembering that, while they suffer, this - company of honourable men-and I do not use the phrase in a satiric sense-whic h has been so befriended by South Australian representatives, is going to reap the benefit .and profit of the burden that they will have - to take upon themselves.",57
422,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The body to which the honourable member has referred is called a league, but it is represented to me by Mr Lindsay that the members of it Jiave land.",58
423,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parkes corroborates the statements I have made. It is first hand information with the honourable member for Parkes; and, - as the honourable member says, this is a - company of men who are not pure philanthropists, but are out for profit. Why - do they not call themselves a company? Why do they masquerade under a philanthropic label? If it pays them to send Mr Lindsay across to deliver lectures in Melbourne, under vice-regal patronage-to buttonhole honourable members in the' precincts of the House, and to lecture to them in their rooms-surel y they hope to get some personal profit? I ask the Minister again to postpone the consideration of this Bill for three or four days. If the honourable gentleman can ascertain that this is a bond fide political organization, without any hope or idea of profit, I shall offer no further opposition to the Bill . The Minister of External Affair's has, I know, already opposed this proposed line of railway, in the interests of Australia as a whole, and particularly in the interests of the State from which he comes. I make no appeal to him on that point; all I ask him to do is to see that there is no tarnish on our good name, or on the reputation of this House for good sense and business instincts.",58
424,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member is quite wrong in saying that I opposed this line. I should like to know where he got his information.,58
425,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have just got the information from the honourable member in front of me, the honourable member for Lang.",58
426,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The Minister of ternal Affairs opposed this line when it was before us previously.,58
427,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member is quite wrong.,58
428,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I immediately withdraw a statement. I made in good faith. But I am not altogether glad to hear that the Minister has been consistent, although he comes from Queensland, in supporting this route, which is for the benefit of no one but a land syndicate masquerading under the title of a league. I suggest that the statement, which was corroborated by the honourable member for Parkes from first hand information, is too important and too serious to permit us to pass this measure in any light-hearted, easy way. I refuse to turn this - Parliament into' the tool of a financial syndicate masquerading as a league. I hope sincerely that the Minister will show such regard for the dignity of his position, and proper appreciation of the honour and dignity of the House, as to refuse to proceed any further with the Bill until this business has been satisfactorily cleared up.",58
429,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"If the honourable member can give proofs, I think the Minister ought to grant his request.",58
430,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am glad to hear those words from the - honourable member for Melbourne Ports.. I started with one or two assertions in which I stated I firmly believed; but I was contradicted roundly by honourable members from South Australia. The honourable member for Wakefield, in his inexperience and perhaps heat",58
431,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I shall contradict the honourable member again, and pretty flatly, when he sits down !",58
432,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member has admitted that this Northern Territory League is a land syndicate.,58
433,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I did not say that it is a land syndicate.,58
434,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member says it is a company- I hope the honourable member will stick to what he says.,58
435,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,And they are among the most honourable men in Australia ! The honourable member ought to be ashamed of himself 1,58
436,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am willing to take responsibility for what I say. I am indebted to the honourable member for Coolgardie for the following list of the committee of this land league, showing the subscriptions of each. These are the patriots who are Ex- financing this philanthropic institution, which is to help the Federal Parliament to an appreciation of the values of the properties they hold.

The honourable member knows that a company is usually formed for benefit of its shareholders.",58
437,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,And cannot they be honourable men?,59
438,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not say that they are not honourable men.,59
439,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Yes , you do. You have said they are masquerading, and you have ridiculed them.",59
440,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I say they are masquewhether, rading when they call themselves the Northern Territory League, and send explorer to tell us what we are to do to develop what we now find are their lands.",59
441,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Thos e firms are not the league. Why does the honourable member misrepresent?,59

443,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,-.Coul d the honourable member not give a subscription if he had a mind to?,59
444,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Of course; not forget that this is a company. The honourable member for Parkes told he had it straight from Mr Lindsay him- - Mr KELLY self that these gentlemen wfere paying his company hold? expenses.,59

446,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We are told that is a public matter, and yet my statements have been contradicted in the House! think, however, that I have exposed suffiAustralia. cient of this extraordinary business to cause every serious-minded man to refuse to proceed further until we know where we really stand.",59

450,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No , I find it hard, of sometimes, to be so when addressing honmyself to the honourable member; but is a I am most serious on this occasion. We are on the verge of commit-. the ting the gravest political blunder that could be contemplated- a blunder that is a reflection on our good sense and acumen as business men and legislators. When I first heard of the Northern Territory League, I thought it was an ordinary league, in the same sense as a progress association, for the advancement of the public good. ' I ask honourable members when they read the league's pamphlets, they did not think the same? an We now know from the honourable member for Wakefield that this is a company; and we may take it that, as a company, it is out for profit.",59

458,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If so, we can find it .",59
459,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Why did not the honourable member get it before?,59
460,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Because I was deceived by the title of the association. How much money is this company going to make out opened our of its operations?,59
461,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We might just as ask how much the honourable member to will make if the Bil l does not pass.,59
462,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member on does not do much justice to the into telligence of the House. Many years to the ago, a member of my family was interested in a big syndicate, since dissolved, which held land in the MACDonnell Ranges, and, consequently, by second hand information, I knew something of what the members of that syndicate thought of the possibilities of the region. The land held by the members of that syndicate cost, I believe, some Â£ 7 , 0 0 0 a year on leasehold from the South Australian Government ; but, had a raihvay been constructed right through their territory, they would have been able to turn that loss of Â£ 7 , 0 0 0 a year into a profit of, I suppose, hundreds of thousands-jus t as this syndicate of philanthropists no doubt hope to do. The whole of the argument of honourable members opposite, and also on this side largely, is against the iniquity of the unearned increment. Here we have a public company promoted for profit, and we do not know what unearned increment they are going to make out of their operations in the neighbourhood of this House, through the instrumentality of Mr Lindsay. that the Minister's method of advancing a measure is, very largely, to sit back, look wise, and do nothing j but I suggest to him that, in view of the statements 1I have made this afternoon, the time has gone by for him to continue that attitude towards this measure.",59
463,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The honourable member laughed at us while the Government treated us in that way last week.,60

465,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The honourable member voted for the "" gag.""",60
466,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I did not. I regarded the matter as of the greatest importance, and walked out rather than vote for the "" gag."" An interesting paragraph published in' the Adelaide Advertiser of 10th March, 1909, regarding the Northern Territory League, reads as follows: The league has already secured the co-operation of powerful allies in the eastern States, and steps are being taken to obtain the support of Western Australia. The prospects of a successful campaign are most encouraging. What do honourable members think of that in regard to a public company? Mr RI CH ARO FOSTER - What paign ?",60

468,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member for Wakefield will have to reply to this.,60
469,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,He will reply.,60
470,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I hope he will ; and I hope that he will vote according to his statements ! It is idle to disguise the fact that Mr Lindsay's advocacy of the project in Melbourne has done an immense amount to sway the judgment of honourable members. 1I have shown, out of the mouths of South Australians in this House, and by the corroboration of the honourable member for Parkes, who learnt the same in conversation with Mr Lindsay, that this so called league is nothing but a company, and, no doubt, like other companies, is formed for private profit. I ask the Minister to save the honour of the Government and the-dignity of the House, by finding out what land the company holds. I know Mr MATHEWS --O r what land its members hold individually.",60
471,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"B y finding out who, in connection with the company, own land individually or collectively, in the Territory, or who own land on the raihvay route between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta, in order that the House may know for what purpose its judgment has been swayed by Mr Lindsay's lobbying. If the Minister insists on exposing this Parliament to the risk of humiliation and shame, it is not my fault. I find that the area already occupied under forty-two-year leases, the value of which will, of course, be enormously appreciated by this railway, is 83,209,120 acres. How much does the league own individually or collectively of that area? I have a right to know that before this business is further proceeded with. I implore the Government, for the honour of the House; and the credit of its own trusteeship, to give us a chance to inquire into this question. Will the Minister consider what I have stated? If he does not feel in a position at this juncture to postpone the further consideration of the measure without consulting his leader, will he consult him as soon as possible ? I am sure he will realise that the matter I have brought before the House is too serious to cambe passed over. He could, without the slightest trouble, furnish the House by next Tuesdav with a return showing a list of the lease-holders in the Territory. ""Will the Minister undertake to do that?  done.",60
472,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Ove r and over again. Why does the honourable member not look at these things?,61
473,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"What we shall have to do is to find who compose this philanthropic institution, and what lands they own collectively or individually in the Territory. I am inclined to think, however, that even there we can be circumvented; because a company which has the hypocrisy to describe itself as a league, and pretend to be acting in thi public interest, will have sufficient acumen not to hold the land in its own name or the names of its own subscribers. We may, therefore, find some difficulty in tracing the real owners. But the Government could elucidate the matter and expose the fallacy of what I am saying, if it is a fallacy  Fusion policy ?",61
474,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is certainly not; but if any such item were being pressed forward by the manoeuvring of land syndicates, I should oppose it even if it were included in the Fusion policy. The Minister sits tight and says nothing; but I cannot believe that he cares nothing how many hundreds of thousands of pounds are made by a syndicate out of the taxpayers of Australia. I believe knows no other method of proceeding with public business than to look wise, say nothing, and go straight ahead. If the Prime Minister were here to hear what 1I have just said, I think he would be the first to say that the Bill must be postponed until some day next week.  faith in him at last.",61
475,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Whateve r may be urged against the Prime Minister by his most aggressive critic, no one can say that he has ever acted in the interests of land syndicates. I sincerely hope that the members of the Labour party, whether they come from South Australia or other States, will insist on seeing that no opportunity is given to this syndicate to make a profit out of misrepresentation in this Chamber.",61
476,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [ 6 . n ] - I have listened to the honourable member for Wentworth, although I do not know whether more from curiosity than from special interest. He is very often humorous, and sometimes up to political pranks, but very seldom serious. Occasionally, when he gets into a serious mood he is, I think, least responsible. The statements he has made this afternoon have been such as to astound anybody with any sense of decency. To deal with a personal matter first, the honourable member says that I have advocated one thing and voted another way. During my recent election I said I should stand by the agreement that had been made by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia, and ratified by the Parliament of South Australia without any open protest by the people of that State. I said, at the same time, that I considered it was one of the worse bargains that South Australia ever made, and I think so today.",61
477,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,And yet the honourable member is going to vote for what he believes to be the worse bargain that South Australia ever made!,61
478,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I am going to vote for what I promised my constituents to support. But so far as my own personal opinion is concerned, I consider that this is the biggest gift that the Commonwealth has ever had a chance of getting hold of, and I am satisfied that the members of this Parliament will agree with me in years to come. So far as the statements of the honourable member for Wentworth respecting Mr Lindsay and those who sent he him here are concerned, the honourable member has shown a great lack of information about the whole business until within the last few hours, and I doubt very much whether he has carefully read through the agreement. If he has read it only within the last few hours, he might as well not have read it at all, because of the lamentable want of information about the whole thing that be has betrayed from beginning, to end, and the honourable member for Balaclava stands in a still worse light. I wish to deal with the reflections which the honourable member for Wentworth has made on the members representing South Australia in this House, and on the gentlemen who were responsible for sending Mr. Lindsay to Melbourne on more than one occasion. The honourable member says I called them a company. If I did it was by interjection, and was a mistake. The party of gentlemen who were responsible for sending Mr Lindsay here are known as members of the Northern Territory League, and I believe that league does not own a single acre in the Northern Territory.",61
479,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Do its members individually?,61
480,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I will tell the honourable member what I do know. The league is presided over by Mr Simpson Newland, of South Australia, one of the oldest and most respected colonists in that State, or for that matter, in Australia. I have seen those gentlemen in meeting only once, and I suppose there were about thirty men representing the commercial life of Adelaide present. Among them were the best men in every sense among Adelaide commercial men. The Northern Territory League was formed to stimulate the development of the Territory. Is there anything wrong in men banding together with that object? What the members of the league really, believe in is the construction of a land grant railway.",61
481,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that they are the cutest business men in Adelaide?,62
482,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"They are among the most successful and respected commercial men there. I understand that many' of the subscribers whose names have been read are sympathizers with, but not. members of, the league. Possibly, after their day's work in the city, they have not the energy for, or feel indisposed to give the time to, its affairs, but are prepared to assist those who will do so.",62
483,Mr KELLY,Unknown,How much land do these philanthropists hold in the Northern Territory ?,62
484,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Some of the members of the league are lease-holders there, but the league itself owns nothing. I understand that the names of those who have leaseholds in the Northern Territory, and the areas held by them, have been published several times. Is it strange that 83,000,000 acres of land should be held under lease there? ' The honourable member for Wentworth, if he considers this such a momentous matter, should have informed himself better regarding it.",62
485,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I knew that fact. It is significant that the league, or its members, hold land.",62
486,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The league does not hold land, though some of its members do.",62
487,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Mr Lindsay told me, in the vestibule, that the league held land. That was his expression.",62
488,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The league is not an incorporated body, and cannot hold land.",62
489,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"How much land do Messrs. Elder, Smith, and Company hold there ? [214]- 2",62
490,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"They are considerable holders, though I believe that they have a larger holding in Queensland than in South Australia.",62
491,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Are they members of the league?,62
492,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I do not think so. They are not likely to interest themselves in anything but their own business.,62
493,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,They donated Â£ 5 0 to the work of the league.,62
494,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I never knew the members of the firm to give their time to political work.,62
495,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"They will make 2,000 per cent, on their donation ff the proposed railway is constructed.",62
496,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Will it be a bad thing for the Commonwealth if the construction of the railway enhances the value of the land in the Northern Territory ?,62
497,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Besides , the land is only held under lease. It is hot alienated.",62
498,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"That is so, and the leases carry conditions which must be complied with. It will be a good thing for the whole country to be taken up.' The honourable member for Wentworth has charged the Northern Territory League with sharp practice, but its meetings are reported in the press, and every time that Mr Lindsay came to Melbourne to advance the interests of the agreement, the fact was made public. Yet the honourable member suggests that something underhand has been going on.",62
499,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why is the honourable member afraid of an inquiry?,62
500,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"There is nothing to inquire into. Some of the mem- bers of the league, when they read the honourable member's remarks, will give him all that he wants.",62
501,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Hav e they any money?,62
502,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,As much as the honourable member has. Mt. KELLY - I am sure they have that..,62
503,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member suggested that Mr Lindsay has made a success of what was a hopeless business, but it is the honourable member for Grey who has used his long experience in the far north to win votes for the agreement. I challenge the honourable member for Wentworth to disprove a single statement descriptive of the country in the pamphlet circulated by Mr Lindsav on behalf of the league. Silting suspended from 6.25 to 7.4.5 p.m.",62
504,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [7.45] The attitude of the House towards this measure seems to have undergone a radical change. When, the second reading was carried, we ajl expected that the agreement which the Dill embodies would be altered in Committee, necessitating its withdrawal for the time being. Owing to I his expectation, many honourable members refrained from discussing the measure. This explains why I waited until this stage to offer some remarks in justification of the vote which I propose to give. But, before touching on the Bill itself, I should like to recall the history of an incident which is closely connected with the proposed transfer of the Territory from South Australia, and which, to some extent, affects my view of the bargain made with that State. Because it seems to me that in the relations existing between the Stales, we should expect an even more rigid adherence to an honourable understanding than is enforced in private life. Now, several months before the people ot Western Australia agreed to enter the Federation, the Premier of South Australia, acting for and on behalf of the Parliament and people of that State, gave the following promise to the Premier of Western Australia:Adelaide, ist February, 1900. Sir,-Following our conversation as to the possible blocking of the construction of a railway line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta by the Federal authority, by South Australia refusing the consent rendered necessary by section 34 of clause 51 of the Commonwealth B i ll to the construction of the line through her territory, I regard the withholding of consent as a most improbable thing; in fact, quite out of the question. Yet today, nine and a half years since that letter was written, the undertaking still remains unfulfilled. The thing which was improbable, and out of the question, has become a reality. The letter continued_ To assure you of our attitude in the matter, I will undertake as soon as the Federation is --.stablished, Western and South Australia both being States of the Commonwealth, to introduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this province to the construction of the line by the Federal authority, and to pass it stage by stage simultaneously with the passage of a similar Bill in your Parliament. The PaiiHament of Western Australia did uass such a Bill, but the Parliament of South Australia did not, and has not done so up to this moment. It is true that the agreement in this Bill has been ratified by the South Australian Parliament, and that it permits the construction, by the Commonwealth, of a railway through South Australian territory. But this does not relieve South Australia from the charge of being guilty of a gross breach of faith.",63
505,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Stil l this agreement would enable the construction of the Western Australian transcontinental line to be proceeded with.,63
506,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The consent of South Australia depends on the passing of this BiM, and the exaction of terms by that State. In default of the passage of this Bill, South Australia may refuse permission to construct the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. Hence it is no answer to my case to say that this agreement enables that line to. be proceeded with. Reference has repeatedly been made in the House to this question, and South Australia has been requested on many occasions both by the Government of Western Australia and by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to fulfil the promise made by the late Sir Frederick Holderas Premier of that State. That promise was renewed by his successor, Mr. Jenkins, in a telegram to the Premier of Western Australia, as follows-Adelaide, n t h June, 1901. Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railway - A Bill will be introduced into our Parliament as agreed Premier's Office, by Mr Holder first February, igoo, but we strongly insist upon line joining your State forty to sixty miles north of Eucla. Here .was an entirely new condition, and although apparently no objection .was offered to it by the Government of Western Australia, the promise remained a dead letter up to 25th June, 1903, when Mr. Jenkins, as. Premier of South Australia, completely changed his ground. I invite the attention of honourable members who have heard read the unqualified undertaking, made in the most solemn way, by two Premiers of South Australia, to the manner in which it was disregarded later on. I wou.ld also ask the House to remember that it was on the strength of the first promise made by the late Sir Frederick Holder that Western Australia was induced to enter the Federation.",63
507,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Was the first promise made before the referendum?,63
508,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It was made in February, 1900, and the referendum on the Constitution Bill was not taken in Western Australia, until July or August of that yeai. On 25th June, 1903, Mr Jenkins sent the following despatch to the Premier of Western Australia: Railway to Western Australia - After the most careful consideration, we feel that it would aot only be unjustifiable, but utterly useless to submit to Parliament a Bill authorizing the construction of this r a i l w a y In other words, without any apology the Premier of South Australia repudiated his promise and that of his predecessor. He declared that the introduction of the Bill would be unjustifiable, despite the fact that in the interval Western Australia had entered the Federation on the strength of the undertaking given, and despite the further fact that the Western Australian Parliament had passed the Bill as stipulated by Sir Frederick Holder(of which this State's share of the cost would amount to a very large sum) He began to take account of the cost two years after the promise had been madewithout being in a position to give Parliament information as to the cost of the line. Now, this was clearly a bogus pretence, as subsequent events show. when this agreement for the transfer of the Northern Territory was made with the Prime Minister in 1907, South Australia, had no information as to the cost of the Western Australian transcontinental railway and did not as'k for any. It was prepared to disoense with such information, because it was to secure concessions in connection with the transferThe Commonwealth Government is at present inquiring into the matter, and the information obtained by it will , no doubt, be made available to this Government. Until this information is obtained it would be useless to submit the scheme to Parliament. I think this Parliament should not condone a shameless violation of an honourable compact between two States. Even those who favour the agreement should insist on the restoration of the status quo, and not allow consent to construct the line to Western Australia to be dependent on some concession to South Australia. The promise made by the Premier of that State should be rigidly fulfilled before we take over the Northern Territory and agree to the construction of another transcontinental railway. I regret that the Treasurer is not here just now, as I intend to read an extract from one of his speeches. On the 17th July, 1907, the Treasurer deplored the action of South Australia, when the present Attorney-General made an interjection. He said that the South Australian Government never made a suggestion that they would block the project of constructing the line.",63
509,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It was said that the pretext for not submitting the Constitution Bill to the people was that South Australia would block the line. I remember all the communications that passed between the Premiers of the two States.,64
510,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I do' not think that the honourable member should cloud the issue.,64
511,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,There is no attempt on my part to cloud the issue.,64
512,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"There was a difficulty about submitting the Constitution Bill to the people of Western Australia, but the honourable member need not attempt to divert attention from the main issue.",64
513,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The State of South Australia never gave an undertaking.,64
514,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Surely the honourable member will not evade the point by a quibble.,64
515,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,There is no quibbling involved. I say that the State never gave Because the undertaking referred to.,64
516,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Who said that it did? But will the honourable member deny that a State is bound by the acts of its Government ?,64
517,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I am not going to reply by wav of interjection.,64
518,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"When the present Treasurer was speaking on the occasion to which I have referred, the honourable member interjectedThe South Australian Government said they would not block the line. The Treasurer repliedThe honourable and learned member should not trv to bolster up a bad case. This sort of thing makes my blood boil. I really have scarcely patience to discuss it temperately, because I was trapped. In assenting to this agreement without having South Australia's promise fulfilled to the letter, the Treasurer will find that he has again been trapped.",64
519,Mr GROOM,Unknown,No ; the promise is embodied in this agreement.,64
520,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I admit that we have now something more binding than we had then. But that does not affect my contention that a gross breach of faith has been committed.,64
521,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Unde r this agreement the Commonwealth will have the necessary authority under the Constitution to construct the Western Australian transcontinental railway.,64
522,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not suggest that South Australia has not definitely given her consent under this agreement to the construction of the Western Australian transcontinental line. But I do say that unless the Commonwealth grants the concessions asked for, she cannot be held to that consent.",65
523,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If the line is not constructed the fault will rest, not with South Australia, but with this Parliament.",65
524,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"When I said that the Treasurer was likely to be trapped again I had in mind the possibility that if this agreement is ratified, it is extremely probable that the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie line will become of secondary importance with a large section of this Parliament. It will be urged that, in order to make good the loss on the existing line to Oodnadatta, and also for the rapid development of the Territory, Parliament should first bridge the gap between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek. This is the demand, and these are the arguments behind it, which will be heard in this Parliament before many years elapse. I say that last night's vote justifies this forecast If there was any real intention on the part of the representatives of South Australia to support the construction, first of all, of the Western Australian transcontinental railway, why did they vote down the amendment to give priority to that line? When a division was taken on the amendment of the honourable member for Perth we had every South Australian member voting against it. That is presumptive evidence that there is a design to trap the Treasurer again ; but he has a happy facility for reconciling his constituents to all these little misfortunes and humiliations that overtake him.",65
525,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member contend that the vote last night gave prioritv to the northern line?,65
526,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not sav that, but it is an indication that an effort will be made to give it priority of construction later on. I have mentioned facts which will be impressed on a subsequent Parliament of the necessity of bridging that gap between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek. To prove that the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek line is first in the minds of the people of South Australia, 1 need only quote a few sentences from a circular sent out by the "" Great Central State League "" in Adelaide - whic h is merely a land syndicate, according to the honourable member for Wentworth.. ",65
527,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have never known ai> instance before of a body ""of private citizens giving princely donations to carry oro a crusade, unless, they had something more than a mere patriotic interest in the question. But if this should prove an exception, the honourable member for Grey ought to start a movement, when this Bill has been passed, to erect a monument to those unique patriots.",65
528,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Perhaps they have an interest in Adelaide trade.,65
529,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Perhaps . But they are making no such sacrifice for the Westernrailway. They give it second place in their thoughts and in their circulars. For instance, they recently sought my co-operation in a document dated 9th March of this year, their object beingTo secure that the surrender of the Northern. Territory to the Commonwealth Government shall be conditional on the construction of a Transcontinental Railway direct from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta and by no other route. My Committee considers that the co-operation of the States of Western and South Australia is highly desirable in this matter in order that a united party may be formed to carry on a campaign during the coming Federal session to secure the construction of not only the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek but also of the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. It will be seen that it is not the Kalgoorlie railway they are anxious about, but the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. We heard yesterday of the splendid bargain the Commonwealth is making in assuring the Northern Territory. We are told that South. Australia is being sacrificed-absolutely immolated-by giving this magnificent asset away. Yet this "" Great Central State League "" evidently does not share that opinion, because, in another circular of March of the present year, they say. . . . the Northern Territory in its inaccessible and undeveloped - condition, has been for many years a considerable burden to this State. And in a later passageIt is generally conceded that the proposed taking over of the Territory by the Commonwealth would undoubtedly relieve the strain on the finances of South Australia. These admissions do not quite fit in with the theory that South Australia is making a tremendous sacrifice in surrendering the Territory. However, the Leaguers are candidThey quite freely admit that their primary object is to develop the northern portion of South Australia at the expense of the rest of the Commonwealth. In the circular, the interests of South Australia are kept prominently to the front, but have .various references to ""Australia a whole."" By using that phrase about half-a-dozen times, these single-minded patriots wish to make us believe that their real object is to benefit the whole of Australia. I think 1I have said sufficient to show that South Australia intends the construction of the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek line first; and that, when that work is completed, the Western Australian line Parliament? may wait the pleasure of the Federal Parliament. I apprehend, however, that when we have spent ,Â£3,000,000 on a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek",65
530,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The cost is estimated at ,Â£4,500,000.",66
531,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Le t us put it at the it is possible to get. minimum; and say that, when the Federal Parliament has spent Â£3,000,000 or ,Â£4,000,000 on a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, and has committed another Â£[3,000,000 for the development of the Territory, it will not be in a humor to construct any more transcontinental lines. We shall be beset by an incessant agitation, such as has demoralized Parliaself ment in connection with the Federal Capito it. tal. Parliament will be told, "" Oh, took over the Northern Territory, of the bargain was the construction of a transcontinental railway; we want that done at once."" As it has been with New South Wales over the Federal Capital, so really approve of this measure. will future representatives of South AusPrime tralia make it a grievance in the House that there is something in the bond that has not been redeemed. Let me ask honsee orable members, as practical men, what the taking over of a line about 500 miles long-whic h is not in the Northern Territo tory at all-mean s to the Federal Governshall ment. At the present moment that line is being carried on at a considerable loss South Australia; a loss which this Bill transfers to the taxpayers of other States, who have had no voice in the railway policy of South Australia. This is the frank mission of the Minister in charge of Bill. But does the honourable mean to say that that is the only loss we aie likely to have to meet in connection with the line? Is it not the most probable thing in the world that, as soon as this comes into the possession of the Commoncontinental wealth, we shall have an agitation for frequent trains. As indicating the magnificent country at the terminus of this railway, I may say that there is actually one train a fortnight. We shall probably we be asked for two or three trains a week as on the ground that a new public house and blacksmith's shop have been erected at Oodnadatta; that the population is increasing by leaps and bounds, and so on. I should like to know how Parliament is to resist pressure of the kind applied by the united delegation from South Australia.",66
532,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I suppose the same pressure would be brought to bear on the State,66
533,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But the. State Parliament is an economical business institution, and members from other districts see to it that Oodnadatta gets only its share. There will be nobody here to do that; for as the Commonwealth foots the bill, the South Australian members will press for all that",66
534,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable members own Government were going to submit this itself to agreement to the House.,66
535,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Is that so?,66
536,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I understand that it is so.,66
537,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I think the honourable gentleman will find that I should hold myfree to take mv own course in regard you Mr GROOM - I speak, of course, suband part ject to correction.",66
538,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The interjection, even if correct, loses point, seeing that several members of the present Ministry do not If the Minister declines to make it a Ministerial measure, several Ministers would probably vote against the third reading. I no enthusiasm amongst them about it. But, to revert to the point that I have been urging as to the pressure that is likely be placed on this Parliament. Not only we have an agitation for an increased train service, but probably an agitation for to a reduction' of the rates for passengers, goods, and stcck. That is a most natural result; and I do not see how this Parliament can resist an agitation of the kind.  the not apply also to the transcontinental gentleman railway to Kalgoorlie?",66
539,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"When we have that project before us, it will be time enough to answer the honourable member's question. line At any rate, the Western Australian transline will have a terminus amongst more 260,000 progressive white people, all earning good wages and spending their money freely, whereas the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek will terminate at a place where there are, I think, about 1,000 white people and 2,000 coloured.",66
540,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,The Western Australian line is a much fairer proposal.,67
541,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,And we are told by experts that the Western Australian line will probably pay in a few years.,67
542,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Exactly . May I also remind honourable members that Western Australia came into the Federation on the distinct understanding that the State was to have this extension from Port Augusta. The honourable member for Indi, who has been to Western Australia, knows that the proposed railway, if it did not pay immediately, would, at least, cement Australian Federation.  member for Indi was before his constituents he referred to it as a "" desert railway.""",67
543,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,That is an absolute untruth 1,67
544,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Indi must withdraw that statement.,67
545,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"You Speaker, that I am willing to withdraw, and to bow to your decision; but no honourable member should dare to make an imputation of that kind.",67
546,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I regret very much that something like a threat has been used in connection with this measure. It has been hinted that if Western Australian members resist the taking over of the Territory on the terms of the agreement, and the Bill is rejected, South Australia will not give its consent to the construction of the Western Australian transcontinental line.",67
547,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Who says that?,67
548,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I am not referring to private conversations that have taken place in the House.,67
549,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,If the honourable member cannot give the name it is unfair to mention the matter.,67
550,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The honourable member may take that view if he likes. In my opinion it is not unfair.,67
551,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Certainl y it is,67
552,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Perhaps the honourable member would like me to accept his standard of fairness. My own view is that it is perfectly fair to refer to this matter without mentioning names. We have had the hint from several that the western line would be best serverJ by Western Australian members voting for this agreement.,67
553,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,If the honourable member cannot give the name of ihe person he is not justified in making the matter public.,67
554,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Does the honourable member really desire to have the names?,67
555,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I think the honourable member ought to do so. as he has mentioned the matter.,67
556,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"We l l , I shall consider the suggestion. I am not in the habit of doing tilings hurriedly; certainly not at the instance of my honourable friend. When he is a disinterested party, his advice may be safely followed; but at present I am afraid he is very much interested. Passing from this, may I add that those gentlemen who imagine that the power of a State honourable to forbid the making of a raihvay is absolute, have not read their Constitution caref u l l y. Or if they have read it , they have not applied to its phraseology the acumen of the legal profession. Now, it is quite true that there is in the Constitution a section which prohibits the Commonwealth from making a railway through a State without the consent of the Government of know, Mr that State, but there is another section which empowers this Parliament to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. The greater includes the less, and I take it that when the Constitution empowered us to take measures for the defence of the Commonwealth against an invader, it empowered us to construct any railway required for that purpose, without waiting for the approval of a provincial Parliament. I ask our friends to reflect for a while on that point. High legal authorities agree that if ever it became necessary for the defence of Australia to build a transcontinental line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, we could do it without consulting any ether power. In such case, the lesser right of the State must give way to the greater right of the nation. It goes without saying that if the necessity for such a railway arose, we have an inherent right to build it. No mere local objection could prevail if the existence of the nation were imperilled. I am sorry that these things are said, and sorry to have to reply to them. It would be better to conduct the debate on different lines, and I refer to this matter only incidentally to make the situation clear. If honourable members have made up their minds to pass the Bill , I cannot complain. I have done quarters what I consider to be my duty to my constituents, and recognise that other honourable members have equal responsibility with me. I would remind my honourable friends that we cannot take over the Northern Territory and become responsible for the existing railway lines, and another line to be constructed, without borrowing money. At present, we are dependent to some extent on the bounty of the States in order to pay old-age pensions, and being about to mortgage our Customs revenue also to the States, I do not see where the money will come from to build those lines, or even to carry on minor works for the Postal and other Departments, except by means of borrowing. The situation should be faced fairly and at once. This policy involves recourse to the foreign money market, a procedure which is not exactly in harmony with the platform of our party. I have no wish, however, to lay stress on this aspect of the question, and am content to merely place it on record. While South Australia in this matter always makes appeals to national sentiment, and affects to have regard to the interests of Australia as a whole, we find her always making the hardest possible bargain. Every line in the agreement and every stage in the negotiations shows that South Australia took a provincial and purely local view of this and other matters. I ask the Attorney-General why, if South Australia took a national view of questions, she refused to carry out her undertaking to Western Australia in regard to the Western Australian railway ?",67
557,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think the State ever did refuse. I said that if I were in the position of the Premier of South Australia, who gave that implied obligation without authority, I should have carried it out.",68
558,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Her e we have some beautiful hair-splitting. Only a legal mind would try to draw such a distinction. How can the honourable member absolve the State from the promise of its Premier ?,68
559,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I told the honourable member that if I were in Mr Jenkins' position, although I should not be legally bound, I should consider myself in honour bound to carry out the promise..",68
560,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is what I am contending.,68
561,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Then why did the honourable member talk about hair-splitting?,68
562,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Because the honourable gentleman wanted to dissociate the responsibility of the State from the responsibility of its Premier. He now says it was a breach of honour, I said it was a breach of honour on the part of one State towards another.",68
563,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"A breach of honour, not between two States, but between two Premiers.",68
564,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Why did those men occupy the position of Premier ? Was it not because Parliament put them in that position, and did not the people elect the Parliament ?",68
565,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Does the honourable member contend that a Premier can make any statement and thereby bind his Government and Parliament to support him?,68
566,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"When a Premier writes a letter such as I have quoted, he and his Parliament behind him are in honour bound by it. If the South Australian Parliament did not intend to be bound by their Premier's promise, why did not some honourable member rise in that Parliament and repudiate it ?",68
567,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"On the same process of reasoning, the honourable member is bound to this agreement because he was a member of a Government that promised to introduce a Bill giving it effect.",68
568,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Nothin g of the sort. I have never favoured this agreement, and was never bound to it. The honourable member is very clever in these interjections, but he cannot refine away the wrong which is clone when one State repudiates its compact with another. In conclusion, I desire to say that, while fully recognising the importance of this Territory to Australia, I am unprepared to accept its surrender, hampered by conditions that prevent our developing it in the best"" interests of Australia. And this is the meaning of some of the conditions contained in this agreement. Under the garb of nationalism, one State is seeking to gain advantage at the expense of her five sisters. Had a truly national spirit prevailed in South Australia, this Territory would have been handed over to the Commonwealth free of conditions or restrictions, except such as relate to the debt incurred by the State in holding and developing that region. If Australia was prepared, as she is, to accept liability for that entire debt, and relieve South Australia from the burden, Australia had a right to expect from that State reciprocal generosity. The least that could have been expected was that South Australia should show confidence in the National Parliament, and trust it to manage this new possession in its own interests, and with the maximum benefit to the future Australian nation.",68
569,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [8.25] - It was not my intention to speak upon* the third reading, but I feel it is necessary to reply to some of the remarks of the honourable member for Coolgardie. The honourable member says he objects to the passage of the Bill because there is a desire on the part of somebody, especially the members from South Australia, to trap the Treasurer as a representative of Western Australia. If the honourable member has been able to see that design from anything that has transpired in this House, he has a keenness of perception which I do not think any other honourable member possesses. When asked for evidence, he produced two letters issued by a League which is working for its own purposes in South Australia. That League was working not necessarily for this agreement, but for a definite line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek.",69
570,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,In the interests of a land syndicate.,69
571,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There is no evidence of that at all, but I shall deal with that question later. That is the evidence upon which the honourable member for Coolgardie bases his statement. The circular which he has quoted is one in which the League invites the co-operation of the members from Western Australia to secure the passage, not of one line, but of two.",69
572,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"They put their line first, though.",69
573,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member thinks that because one line is mentioned first, it shows an intention to construct that line first. Let me take the speech which the Government of which the honourable' member for Coolgardie was a member put into the mouth of the Governor General at the beginning of this session about five months ago. The sixteenth paragraph saysIn this connection the development of the Northern Territory is considered to be of first impprt.mce, and the agreement will mitted to Parliament with a view to an early settlement. That' is the agreement now before the House. The honourable member twitted me at one time with expressing different views on one subject, but I never expressed different view. Yet the honourable member, as a member of the Fisher Government, was prepared only a few months ago to submit this agreement to the House irÂ» order that the House might deal with it.",69
574,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What did the last Deakin Government do in regard to the Federal Capital site question ?,69
575,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That question is not before us now.,69
576,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Then why did the honourable member refer to the other matter?,69
577,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Because the honourable member tried to point to the inconsistency of others, and it is a fair retort for me to point to his inconsistency. He saysthat because one line is mentioned before another in that circular a preference is indicated. On that point, I have read the sixteenth paragraph of the Governor General's speech at the opening of this session, and let me now turn to the twentieth paragraphThe survey of a route for the proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is rapidly approaching completion. The field work, both, in South Australia and Western Australia, having been finished, the final report, with plansand estimates, will shortly be ready for submission to Parliament. Would it be fair for me to suggest that, simply because one line is mentioned before the other in that speech, honourable members, opposite intended to give it the preference?*",69
578,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is ridiculous..,69
579,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Ye t that is the argument which the honourable member used.,69
580,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That is one instance, but what about the vote last night?",69
581,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall deal with that presently. It would not be fair to accuse the Fisher Government, or the honourable member, who belonged to it, of designing to put one line before the other, simply because one was mentioned before the otherI do not think that was their intention.",69
582,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Do not take up the weakest link in the chain. Mr .GROOM - I shall take each link in turn, but if the honourable member puts-a weak link in, he must not blame me for calling attention to it. The honourable memthe ber last night invited a division upon an> be subamendment moved by the honourable member for Perth. I pointed out to the honourable member for Perth and the Committeethat it was unwise to ask for a vote on the question which he raised, and to put theselines into competition with each other, bea cause I did not think the Committee desired to do it. After my statement, the honourable member for Perth was quitewilling to withdraw the amendment, and' rest satisfied with my assurance, but the .honourable member for Coolgardie forced division that apparently cast discredit upon Government. the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line.",69

586,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Exactly . When the submit honourable member tried to substantiate his case to-night, he quoted from a speech of even the Treasurer, who has all along been a constant supporter of the line.",70
587,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The honourable member for Coolgardie opposed the Treasurer in this would matter in 1901.,70
588,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes . It is for him to ment say why he sought, by urging the construchave tion of a line from Esperance Bay, that from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie.",70

597,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Then why did they not ,70
598,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The position was thus by the honourable member for Angas I believe, from what I know of the people [of South Australia], that if a deliberate policy the part of the Federation to construct this line were evidenced, the Price Government or any olher Administration would be prepared to to the State Parliament a Bill giving the requisite consent. . . . I believe that, if the provisions to which I have referred were not in the agreement, the Price Government as soon 'as the time had arrived for the fulfilment of the promise made by Mr Speaker [Holder] when Premier of South Australia introduce a Bill to give the necessary consent. With the exception of the Jenkins Administration I do not know of any Governthat has exhibited any hesitancy, and, as I said, I think that many regret that the to block promise was not fulfilled. Be that as it may, the good faith of the Price Government is evidenced by the fact the Premier signed this agreement I early in 1907, and passed through the South Australian Parliament an Act which authorizes the construction of this line.",70
599,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Mr Kingston offered to the bring the line to the border if Western be needed. Australia would join in.,70
600,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The people of South Australia evidently wish to carry out the arrangement, not to repudiate it.",70
601,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Why does the consent appear in the measure with which we are,70
602,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Tw o or three national works were under consideration, and were There is nothing in the agreement giving priority to the construction of a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. Should it be accepted, Parthis Parliament must determine which line of shall be completed first. Personally I itthink that it must be the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. The settlement In with the transfer of the Northern to Territory, provision must be made for ocGreat proas blems will be met which it will take time The survey of the Kalgoorlie to to Port Augusta line, however, has been completed, and there is no reason why the work should be unduly delayed. My personal view is that that line must be the first constructed. It is unfair and unwise in the national interest to attempt to put the two lines into competition. The construction of both forms part of a great national policy. We should set aside provincial views in dealing with this matter. The construction of these lines is necessary to complete the Federation. That is my attitude, and, I believe, the attitude of a majority of honourable members. The bogey has been raised that the Northern Territory League is a land syndicate. That has been done to delay the passing of the Bill.",70
603,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The matter was referred to in all sincerity.,71
604,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wentworth said that he desired to delay the passing of the Bill in order that the point he raise<"" might be considered. Even were the league a syndicate holding land, that would not be a reason for refusing to take over the Territory. Its motives are one thing, the necessity for the national action another. The fact that 83,000,000 acres were held on lease by a syndicate in the Northern Territory would not be a reason for not taking over the Territory. The fact that the Territory is unoccupied and unpeopled hinders the progress of Australia, and menaces its future.",71
605,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,We should not spend millions of money to construct railways to benefit private land-holders.,71
606,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It will be only after a full investigation that Parliament will determine what it will spend on railway construction. The route marked on the map before honourable members does not show that between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek large areas are held by syndicates. Except at the MACDonnell Ranges-and even there the area under lease is comparatively small - ther e is not much occupation. After all, land in the Territory is held only under lease.",71
607,Mr MAHON,Unknown,For a period of forty-two years.,71
608,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"When the Commonwealth takes over the Territory, it will have power to resume any land it may reed for closer settlement.",71
609,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,And it will have the right to tax.,71
610,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It will have sovereign powers of legislation. If it be found that land held under lease by syndicates is needed for closer settlement, the Commonwealth will resume it on terms that are just.",71
611,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The existence of leaseholds is not a serious disadvantage.,71
612,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I think not. The motives of the Northern Territory League do not concern us. f hey may be patriotic or merely materialistic. To what extent Mr Lindsay has influenced honourable members 1 do not know; but if he has done so at all, it has been by appeals to their judgment and reason, and every member is responsible to his constituents for his vote in this matter. I resent the suggestions of log-rolling and back-scratching. Some honourable members, if their ideas"" are not carried out, find it easy to suggest that the majority has been influenced improperly. These suggestions bein<- vague and indefinite, do not hit any one; but they leave a bad flavour.",71
613,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Unfortunately , the secretary to the league has made such a suggestion in a letter to a South Australian newspaper.",71
614,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I am sorry to hear it. Such a thing is reprehensible. We must exercise our own judgment.,71
615,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Is it usual to carry a measure of this sort with the support of the Opposition against Ministerial supporters ?,71
616,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"This is not a partyquestion; and the House must decide it. I do not think any honourable member has more at heart the interests of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway than has the Treasurer. No one has fought more strenuously for the line. He has made its construction one of the objects of his Parliamentary life. He advocated it before Federation was accomplished, and felt that the people cf Western Australia were thereby induced to vote for the draft Constitution. Therefore, he has repeatedly appealed to the Parliament to honour the compact.",71
617,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Minister seems concerned on the Treasurer's account. M.r. GROOM - Because the honourable member made insinuations against the Treasurer's sincerity in this matter. I do not think that he will persuade the people of Western Australia that he alone has advocated the construction of the line. They know who have been its consistent advocates, and will give credit where it is due.",71
618,Mr TRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [8.45] - In view of the speeches made this afternoon. I cannot allow the third reading lo pass without stating my position. Hitherto, I have not said anything about the agreement. I am unable to follow the reasoning of the honourable member for Coolgardie,, and the view that he takes with regard to this Bill. Mr Jenkins' repudiation of the promise made by two of his predecessors in office as Premier of South Australia, undoubtedly caused a feeling of resentment and distrust in Western Australia; for the people of that State were justified in believing that they would receive the assistance of the Parliament of South Australia in securing authority for the construction of the Western Australian transcontinent.il railway. But whilst Mr Jenkins repudiated the position taken up by his predecessors, what is the situation today? Have we had in this House more consistent advocates of proposals to obtain information that would justify the construction of that line than the representatives of South Australia? I am sure that we have not. I have no sympathy with the attitude taken up by a former Premier of South Australia, Mr Jenkins; but it is most unfair that the representatives of that State in this House should be asked to carry the burden of his repudiation. The difficulty under which the honourable member for Coolgardie labours will not be removed unless the agreement embodied in this Bill is accepted. I do not say that the fact that the agreement tains the sanction of South Australia to the construction of the Western Australian transcontinental railway is a strong reason for its acceptance; but 1 do urge that, unless we adopt the agreement, it will still lie necessary to obtain the consent of the Parliament of South Australia to the construction of the Western Australian transcontinental railway.",71
619,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I have very high legal authority differing from the honourable member on that point. One of my authorities is sitting in front of the honourable member.,72
620,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I gave the honourable member for Coolgardie a column and a half to assist him at an election.,72
621,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,In connection with the Esperance Bay line?,72
622,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Yes .,72
623,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"My predecessor in the representation of Kalgoorlie, in connection with that project, took up a position of placing the Esperance Bay line in antagonism to the transcontinental railway, and it helped him out of Parliament and assisted my return. I am prepared to say that this question must of necessity be decided on the rival merits-if they are. rivals-of the two projects for ihe construction of the Western. Australian transcontinental railway and the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek.",72
624,Mr GROOM,Unknown,They are not rival projects.,72
625,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not think that they are. The agreement would have been more satisfactory if it had not definitely provided for the construction of the northern line; but the fact that it does pro-. vide for its construction would not justify the rejection of a great national proposal, such as this, for the taking over of the Northern Territory.",72
626,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Le t us take it over without conditions.,72
627,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I frankly admit that I should have preferred the Commonwealth to be empowered to take it over without such conditions as are imposed by the agreement.,72
628,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Then move in that direction.,72
629,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member must recognise that there are many occasions when an honourable member has to accept something with which he is not in absolute agreement, because he can get nothing better, and believes that it would be con- disadvantageous to allow things to remain as they are. It would be a mistake, in my opinion, to allow the Northern Territory to lemain for years as it is today, unpeopled, and without' a white garrison to defend it against attack.",72
630,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The Commonwealth is bound to defend it, whether it takes it over or not.",72
631,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is so; but the best way to defend it is to people it. Judging by its history, if it is to be peopled, the Commonwealth must assume the responsibility of its administration. From the opinions that have been expressed in this House, I think that the construction of the transcontinental railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is likely to be the first to be undertaken by the Commonwealth. After all, the defence of 270,000 people on the western seaboard is more important than is the defence of a handful of people in the Northern Territory. That, in itself, is a strong argument in favour of the proposal to supply railwav communication between Western Australia and the eastern States, so that, should the occasion arise, the people on one side of Australia may come to the assistance of those on the other.",72
632,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It will be a more important railway than the proposed northern line would be.  orable member; and that is why I say that the two projects should not be in conflict. There is no stipulation in the agreement as to which shall be constructed first, and I am satisfied to rely upon the judgment of honourable members, believing that they are sure to determine that priority shall be given to the Western Australian transcontinental line. I come now to the position of the honourable member for Wentworth, who sought to support his opposition to the Bill by the statement that 83,000,000 acres in the Northern Territoiy have been leased. ",73
633,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That was the statement of f a c t ; and I shall come in due course to the point which the honourable member sought to make. Surely the fact that 83^000,000 acres have been leased proves that the Territory is not ihe barren waste that some people would have us believe. It shows that settlers and others appreciate its possibilities.",73
634,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,How does the honourable member account for the yearly loss?,73
635,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"There is always a possibilty of loss in the early stages of any great undertaking, more especially when those controlling it have not at their couimand the means necessary to give full effect to *t. The development of the Northern Territory is too great an undertaking for the people of South Australia, and they have not been treated fairly by the Commonwealth. This question ought to have been decided two and a half years ago. As soon as the agreement was made it should haye been submitted to the Parliament and accepted or rejected. Instead of that, it has been hung up since 1907. The Government of South Australia, I am told, have taken care to insert in every lease issued a clause providing that, for the purposes of closer settlement the land to which it relates may be resumed after the lease has been in operation for ten years. For several years the South Australian Government has been issuing only annual leases, in respect of lands in the Northern Territory, its desire being to hand over the Territory to the Commonwealth as untrammelled as possible.",73
636,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Annua l peimils, not leases.",73
637,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I come now to the extraordinary attitude taken up by the honourable member for Wakefield. If I felt on this question as he does, I do not think that I should care to make to the House the statement which he has done. He says that as a citizen of South Australia, he thinks that the Government of that State is making a bad bargain. If that is his opinion, he ought not to vote for this Bill. If I held such a view, I certainly should oppose it . It would appear that the honourable member went before his constituents and said: ' T have my own opinions in regard to this agreement; I think it is a bad bargain for South Australia, but if you will only return - me, I shall be pleased to let the Commonwealth have the Territory."" Apparently he had no convictions, save that he ought to be a member of this Parliament.",73
638,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Quot e all that I said, and the honourable member will be fair.",73
639,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"All that the honourable member said, beyond the reference I have made, does not affect this question.",73
640,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,It does.,73
641,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member -Â«nnot side-track me. I have been a member of this Parliament long enough to know that such assertions deceive no one in the Parliament, although they may deceive people outside.",73
642,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member has been here long enough, apparently, to learn to tell half the truth.",73
643,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I have quoted the honourable member's statement.,73
644,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Onl y half of it .,73
645,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have quoted all that has any bearing on this question. If he desires to repeat the whole of his speech he can do so later. The honourable member has taken up a most remarkable position. He is associated with those who speak of members of the Labour party as being mere political machines; but I can honestly say that I have never heard a member of our party declare that he did not believe in a certain proposal, but intended to vote for it . I come now to the honourable member for Wentworth, whose - difficulty seems to be that if the northern line is constructed holders of land along the route may be advantaged. Did any one ever hear a more absurd argument against a national project ? Was a railway ever built that did no:, confer on some one an advantage ? honourable member made the further stateto ment that his people were once interested in a syndicate that held land along the promost posed route, and which lost Â£[7,000 a year ou the property. He added that if this railway had been constructed they would have been able to make Â£100,000 a year out of it.",73
646,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And he does not want the present holders of the land to make that piofit.,74
647,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am not suggesting that there is on the part of the honourable member any bitterness associated with the idea that if the northern line is constructed the ""other fellow"" will be able to make money out of the land. I refer statement merely because it indicates that there is good land along the route of the proposed railway, and that it to profitable account as soon as it is connected by railway with centres of population. Surely that is a strong favour of this Bill. I do not think that Mr Lindsay's recent visit to Melbourne had any influence upon honourable members. was so interested in stating his case that he did not come to me.",74
648,Mr WILKS,Unknown,He knew the honourable member was all right!,74
649,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Probably , from my appearance, he thought that I would take an intelligent view of the case. I may say that, until yesterday, no one had asked me how I was going to vote. When we talk about persons coming here and endeatake vouring to secure certain results, we not injure honourable members personally, but we do injure Parliament as an institubeyond tion ; and I should be in favour of ing these information-distributors the building altogether, because, as perience in connection with the Tariff showed, their information is. always of partisan' character, and very often gerated or untruthful. It is absurd to suppose for a moment that any honourable member has been influenced as the result of the views expressed by Mr Lindsay. If this league, as has been stated, is simply a, party of interested perand sons, who have been masquerading as patriots, they have played the part most contemptible cads. At the same time, I do not think their efforts will in way influence the decision of the House. Another matter, and one to which I have referred on several occasions The the attitude of the Government in regard the financing of the proposals which come before us. To my mind, there is a deplorable state of affairs in this Parliament. We embark on greater or lesser national undertakings without making any financial provision; and we now have before us a proposal which, in a few years, will place a heavy annual responsibility on the Commonwealth, if this Territory .is to be properly developed and made an outpost of white civilization. The Government ought to accept the responsibility for this project. I was opposed to the Deakin Government allowing the Capital site measure to be made a non-party question; and I believe that, if it had not been so treated, Dalgety would have been the selected site to his today. It was because the Government shuffled, and were not prepared to accept their proper responsibility, that we had to can be. turned accept another site.",74
650,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is not the argument in question before us. Mr .FRAZER - I admit that, Mr. He Speaker, and I only mention it with a view to prevent the disaster which must follow when the Government are divided on a great problem of the kind. The Government ought to be able to make up their minds before they ask the House to make up its mind, and when they have made up their minds, they ought to be able to place an intelligent financial scheme before us. We have drifted into a practice during a number of years of allowing the future to care of itself, until now we find ourdo selves with a deficit of ,Â£1,200,000; and the Government place no scheme before us that embodied in the proposed keepsettlement with the States. We have this outside year to face a deficit of Â£600,000, our exeven if their Finance Bill passes; and now there is a Bill before us involving a millions, with not one word as to how it is exagto be financed. Under ordinary circumstances, the absence of financial provision would be a fatal objection to a proposal of this kind. We have taken over the lighthouses, and legislated for bonuses and old age pensions; and, although for weeks weeks we have been asking for a financial statement, there has been no satisfacof tory result. Even at this late stage, the Government ought to afford us some inforanymation; but I am afraid that, if it is necessary to crack the party whip, the Government supporters will be found voting previously, is for this Bill as it is.",74
651,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,Unknown,I think honourable member will be found voting with the Government!,75
652,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I shallvote with the Government on this> Bill , because it is of such national importance that even my whole-hearted objection to the present Administration will not permit me to defeat the aspirations of the Australian people. - Mr TUDOR - If the Government make it a vital question, the honourable member will have to reconsider his position !",75
653,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I ' have not seen the Government show any disposition to make any question vital as to the result of which there was a doubt. I have made a reasonable request 'to the Government, and I can assure them that any financial statement by them will be received with enthusiasm, tending as it might to relieve the Commonwealth from increasing difficulty in years to come.",75
654,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [9.10] - I had not intended to speak on the third reading, and I shall not detain honourable members at greater length than is necessary to give the reasons why I think this motion should be deferred. I feel strongly disposed to move that the Bill be read a third time this day six months, in view of the momentous issues involved, and the enormous extra taxation which this transaction will make necessary. It is proposed to saddle the Commonwealth with an annual loss representing Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 per day from the very outset, and that is without considering the additional commitments in connection with railway construction and the development of the Territory. This afternoon, certain statements have been made which certainly call for further nv vestigation, and form reasonable ground for asking the Government to defer the third reading for, at least, a few days, so that the truth or otherwise of the allegations may be ascertained. We have been told that the so-called Northern Territory League is neither more nor less than a land-boom syndicate, whose alleged patriotism is simply a cloak to obscure the real object and character of an association formed with the hope of receiving material personal benefit. for its members, owing to increased land values created by the construction of the proposed railway.  material benefit when a railway, is constructed ? the Mr JOHNSON - The honourable member is trying to confuse the issue. Is this a league for patriotic purposes, or merely a syndicate of interested land-holders, who are banded together for their own financial advancement ? Several honourable members interjecting;",75
655,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I cannot understand how it is that I never get on my feet without being subjected to a storm of interjections from the Labourites.,75
656,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have several times called "" order,"" but honourable members were apparently talking so loudly that they did not hear me. I ask them not to converse witfi each other in such a tone as to disturb the honourable member who is addressing the Chamber, and not to interrupt him in his speech by interjections.",75
657,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am merely calling attention to the fact that a statement, which warrants further investigation, has been made. T fake no responsibility for its truth or otherwise. It was that an organization known as the Northern Territory League, supposed to be banded together to advocate the taking over of the Territory on purely patriotic and national grounds, was mainly if not wholly composed of interested land-holders, who desired that the taxpayers' money should be expended for the benefit not so much of the Commonwealth as of their own private purses. If that is the character of the League we ought to know it.",75
658,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"It is not. Mr - JOHNSON - I do not say it is, but it has been said in this debate, and a serious statement of that kind ought to be investigated. If it is simply a company of land-jobbers masquerading in the form of a patriotic league for the purpose of concealing its real object, and if it is receiving the support of Labour member? who profess to Be opposed to landlordism and capitalism, we ought to know more about it and why so many Labour members are supporting it. We also have the right to know whether Mr Lindsay, who was here lobbying members of this Parliament, and who it is alleged has been instrumental in converting several honourable members from their previously expressed opinions, was simply the representative of a patriotic league or the paid servant of a syndicate pecuniarily interested in getting the taxpayers to foot the Bill to the tune of some Â£5' 0 0 0 ' 0 0 0 for running a railway through their land. "" The statements which have been made this afternoon will create in the public mind a certain amount of suspicion. I do not believe or suggest that any honourable member would be influenced in an improper way, but from the nature of the statementswhich have been made here this afternoon, there is a danger from the sudden change in the attitude of certain Labour members to this agreement that such a suspicion may be engendered in the public mind. If the Bill is pushed forward with undue haste, without the real character of the League being investigated, we shall make a very grave blunder. Some peculiar statements appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser of 10th March last. In the course of a letter published by that paper the secretary of what was then called the Great Central State League, quoted the Sydney Bulletin to the following effectI t points out the danger that is likely to arise from influences that are being exerted Queensland and New South Wales to divert the lions ! railway through those States, and calls upon Australia as a whole to treat this subject in an to Kalgoorlie and Perth. Australian national spirit. I want to draw particular attention to the term ""national spirit."" What sort of Australia a national spirit is it which prevents any benefit from the construction of this railway going to any part of the Commonwealth except one portion of South Australia? Not another inch of Australia can receive a farthing's worth of benefit from the expense to which the whole of the people will have to contribute, and apparently only a few land-owners in the Territory, if we are to believe the statements which have been made, will reap any benefit. That is the broad national spirit that the League talks about! That sort of national spirit is always confined to a certain small area within the Commonwealth. We never hear of it in New South Wales, although that State an3 Queensland and Tasmania are the only States that really show the Federal spirit in its true form.",75
659,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,What about Western Australia?,76
660,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am afraid that the Federal spirit of the West is mostly wrapped up in its transcontinental railway. The names of certain patriotic citizens were read out this afternoon, with the amounts of their subscriptions, the object being to show that those gentlemen, who are members of large commercial and other firms and companies, have liberally assisted the funds of the organization. I do not know whether any of them are interested in land in the Territory. I am informed by the honourable member for Wakefield that they are not. That may be the honourable member's opinion, but is he in a position to assert the fact with absolute certainty ? We are entitled to more authentic information on the point. With regard to the peculiar unanimity exhibited by some honourable members, I notice the following statement in another letter published in the Adelaide AdvertiserI t would include all the political strength and influence of South Australia and Western Australia. It would demand the transfer . of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth on the terms already agreed upon between the State Government and the Federal Cabinet, the building of the straight and comparatively short and cheap line from Port Darwin to Port Augustain A cheap line costing four and a half miland the building of a line from South Australia And its members would refuse to separate these demands, and would make it a question of "" all or nothing."" . . . Therefore, it is proposed that South and Western Australia cease to argue as to which line is the more essential.",76
661,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I point out to the honourable member that what he is reading has already been read this afternoon.,76
662,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I was not aware th?t the honourable member for Coolgardie rjad this extract. I thought he quoted from a document addressed to himself personally. The suggestion in that letter is that the representatives of Western Australia and South Australia should band their forces together ir. a united effort, and not call each other's territory hard namessuch as "" desert,"" for example. 1 take no exception to that so long as it is done from.' the stand-point of the interests of the whole Commonwealth, or even if it is done from the purely parochial point of view of the interests of those two States, but if it is done fjpr another reason which has a private financial backing to it while it is pretended that the action is prompted purely from disinterested and patriotic motives it assumes a different aspect.

I shall consider the advisability of moving later stage, if I am in orderThat further consideration of this Bill poned until next week, with a view to informaif tion being supplied to the House on the ing points :1. Is the organization known ns the Northern quire it. Territory League purely a league of patriotic citizens banded together from personally terested motives, or is it a fact, as by an honourable member of this House, that league is mainly an Executive Committee that organization of large land-holders whose properties will be enhanced in value by penditure of the taxpayers' money? 2. How many members of the league are landhundred miles inland from there. holders, and what is the area and situation each holding in their possession? 3. Was the Mr Lindsay who industriously interviewed members of this Parliament league's interest the paid representative servant of a landlord syndicate? Was the Gosuccess. vernment aware of the real nature of this leged patriotic league? Is it proposed to levy a betterment land value tax on all privatelydisappointing owned lands within the area which will ficially affected by the railways to be conpounds going to ruin. structed under the agreement? I should further like to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill whether the Governpowerful ment have taken into consideration the question of where the money to construct successfully is a question for experts. a railway, if the agreement is ratified, to come from. I ask further whether the Government proposes to levy a betterment tax on the lands which are beneficially fected by the construction of the proposed railway. The House should have some inon timation as to what is intended in this spect. We should know whether the vernment intends to make the land-holders contribute towards the cost of the railway in proportion to the increase of value will be given to the land by railwav conPine struction.

667,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"At any rate, it has nothing to do with the matter now fore us. It has been argued by the Bulletin-at first sight plausibly-that Territory cannot be developed by a line which runs out of it, and that the posed transcontinental line is required for developmental purposes. I am of opinion that a transcontinental raihvay which, for the greater part of its length, ran outside the Territory would not develop the Terriborder tory. To develop the Territory, lines, each a couple of hundred miles long, would have to be run inland from points on the Victoria, Daly, and Katherine Rivers to various points on the northern coast and to the Gulf of Carpentaria. A transcontinental line will be neces80 sary for Defence purposes. But such tinental a 'line should not be taken through what has been described as the dead heart of Australia; it should link up the centres of population as conveniently as possible. Were the proposed line to be made, troops could not be taken to Port Darwin from the large centres of population without being conveyed about three times as far as would be absolutely necessary, and this would give the enemy an opportunity to thoroughly entrench himself. A defence line should so link up the structed. great centres of population that troops could be taken to Port Darwin by the quickest routes. However, these are ques6 in. line. tions to be decided largely by experts. So is the question of the development Territory. We cannot decide now what should be done, and will probably do the line. wrong thing if we tie our hands by agreeing to the proposals contained in the Bill. It is said that the proposed transcontinental railway would develop the country north of the MACDonnell Ranges, but beyond a certain distance haulage becomes so expensive as to make the conveyance of live stock frozen meat unprofitable. My opinion is Queensland. that we should not commit ourselves until all the subjects to which I have referred have been investigated by experts. parently the Prime Minister, being oured of the idea of extending the funcballast, tions of the Commonwealth by transferring the control of the Northern Territory to ignored the conditions prescribed by nental the late Premier of South Australia.  astute in detecting in the enthusiasm of Prime Minister an opportunity that would be very advantageous to South Australia. South Australia ought to be recouped the whole of her losses on be the Territory. I do not object to the Commonwealth taking over, at their actual cost, the the State properties there, although their present value may be very much less than prowas the original outlay upon them. We can well afford to recoup her the whole of her accumulated losses on the Territory, but to urge that we should commit ourselves to a line from Port Augusta to the northern of South Australia, and to the routes of other railways for developmental purposes, is to ask us to do that which I do not think we should be justified in doing on behalf of those who sent us here. Only 40 lb. rails have been used on the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, whereas lb. rails are the standard for transconlines. Eighty pound rails are used on the line from Sydney to Melbourne, so . that in comparison the raihvay from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta is a mere tramline.",78

Reference has been made to the way in which the development of the Northern Territory is to be financed by the Commonwealth. I have not heard it suggested that any vast expenditure can be provided for out of revenue. A borrowing policy seems to be foreshadowed.",79
677,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,There is no question about that.,79
678,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I have not heard it disputed. If the cost of developing the Northern Territory is to be provided, not out of revenue, but out of loan moneys, the failure of South Australia to develop the country could not have been due to her inability to float loans. Surely no one will say that South Australia is in such a parlous state that it could not raise loans' for the development of the Territory if it felt that such loans were justifiable.",79
679,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,But she would not obtain any return for her money.,79
680,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Is the Commonwealth to raise loans to develop the Territory, and to get no return from its outlay ? I should like to hear some reason why the Territory has not been developed. If it is that South Australia could not afford to develop it out of revenue, I have not heard it suggested that the Commonwealth could afford to develop it in that way. If it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to resort to a borrowing policy in this con-' nexion, surely it will not be said that South Australia was not in a position to borrow money for the same purpose.",79
681,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,South Australia is plucky little State. Give her a show. She gave us the overland telegraph when New South Wales would not help us.,79
682,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I have had nothing to say as to South Australia's pluck. I have already stated that I should be prepared to support the Commonwealth taking over the Territory, and making good the loss that South Australia has suffered in connection with its administration. I object, however, to South Australia insisting on certain conditions that ought not to be associated with the transfer. It is quite likely that if the agreement be adopted, experts sent out to advise the Government as to the development which should take place will report that we have done wrong in committing ourselves to these conditions. It has been suggested that if we reject this agreement we shall not have another opportunity to take over the Territory. I differ from that view. I think that South Australia, will be very glad to hand over the Territory to the Commonwealth irrespective of the terms and conditions incorporated in this agreement. She cannot develop the Territory herself.",79
683,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Then the honourable member says, in effect, that we should take advantage of South Australia. That is very generous !",79
684,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I do not suggest that we should take any advantage of South Australia, but I do hold that South Australia ought not to say to the Commonwealth Parliament "" Since you are filled with enthusiasmfor extending the powers of the Commonwealth and acquiring Federal territory, we insist upon your conforming to certain terms and conditions that will tend to our advantage, although they may very likely retard the development of the Territory, and will certainly place upon the taxpayers of the Commonwealth a heavy and, perhaps, unnecessary, burden."" It is, therefore, my intention to vote against. the third reading of the Bill. I feel that I should not faithfully . represent my constituents if 1 gave a vote that would commit them to a considerable, expenditure in developing the Territory in a way that might be repudiated later on by experts appointed on behalf of the Commonwealth. A proposal is put forward that this Bill should be read a third time six months hence. I hold that a Commission should be appointed on behalf of the Commonwealth to investigate the terms and a conditions that have been laid down, and to make a report upon which this Parliament could act. At present, we are in the dark. There is no body so incompetent to deal with matters of this kind as Parliament itself. Parliament is affected to a very large extent by prejudices and sentiment, and I should have been glad had the Government proposed to appoint a Royal Commission to secure authoritative information with respect to this project. There have been many advocates and experts working on behalf of South Australia, but we have had no. one to speak with any authority on behalf of the Commonwealth. The appointment of a Royal Commission should have been a stage precedent to the taking over of the Territory under the conditions imposed by this agreement. If , however, the House, having given the matter careful consideration, still thinks that this agreement, despite its disadvantages should be adopted, I shaill be prepared to do all in my power hereafter to assist in developing the Territory. I feel considerable misgiving in regard to taking it over on the terms and conditions imposed by this agreement, but can only hope that should the Commonwealth embark upon its development, its effortswill be attended with unqualified success.",79
685,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.57]--Some six hours ago I addressed you, Mr Speaker, on the proposal to recommit this BiM, and I intend again to speak in opposition to the measure, although I - shall' not repeat the arguments that 1 then used. Since the inception of the Federal Parliament we have had nothing to equal the word painting that has been indulged in in connection with this project. On the motion for the second reading, the honourable member for Grey, with a pointer in his hand, indicated various districts shown on the map exhibited in the Chamber, and told us that the Territory was a land of untold wealth. In the very centre of Australia we are told - lies the Eldorado of the Commonwealth. I suppose that its wealth is described as "" untold,"" because no white man has been there to tell of it. Some* time ago a band of hardy, earnest members of this House undertook a perilous journey to the Northern Territory, travelling from Sydney round the coast in a splendidly appointed mail boat to Port Darwin. On reaching that point, some of them undertook another perilous journey of 200 miles by rail. Upon the information so obtained, we are asked to gauge the possibilities and potentialities of the Territory. I recognise that the Territory is enormous, but it is an unknown land. So far only the gummed edges of the envelope have been touched by white men. What the interior is like is a mere matter of speculation to the rest of Australia. But we are asked to take over the Northern Territory with an immediate charge of Â£[10,500,000; and this I regard as too heavy a burden on the Commonwealth with its fringe of population. I can see the strategic advantages of taking over the Territory, and I am prepared to listen to those who say that it ought to be garrisoned for the defence of the Commonwealth. But it is a most extreme proposal to ask the people to shoulder the financial responsibility involved in this agreement. The honourable member for Grey, if anything, over-painted his picture when, he made his pathetic appeal to us, and dwelt upon the great riches of this portion of Australia; but there were other honourable members who have visited the Northern Territory, and who described it as a land of white ants. This is part of the electorate of the honourable member for Grey, and, while I do not desire to draw any inference from that fact, it is certain that he would not present it to us in its worse colours. There are other projects of more concern to the people, which we have not the money to finance; and, as a matter of fact, only a few weeks ago the Treasurer said there might possibly be a shortage of Â£[1,200,000 this year.",80
686,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It will be over Â£[1,800,000 on the year's figures.",80
687,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I ""am taking the lowest estimate. If we are not humbugging the people of South Australia we shall have to provide Â£[10,500,000; and this can only be obtained by loan. I respect South Australia for the way in which she has borne the burden of the Northern Territory for so many years; but it is absurd for the honourable member for Grey to say that if we dp not take the Territory now we shall never have it offered to us again. We are not children to be told that a State would desire to hand over a country possessed of such riches as have been represented. The description of the land of Barataria is weak in comparison with the language used by the honourable member for Grey. It is idle to talk of the Northern Territory as a land of ' agricultural and mineral riches, when we know that three-fourths of the area is unknown land. I could understand a proposition that the Northern Territory is a fair charge on the Commonwealth, on the ground that, unless it be properly defended, it will present a standing danger, the responsibility being too great for the small population of South Australia. I am prepared to support the Territory being taken over and the Commonwealth being allowed to develop it when it feels so disposed.",80
688,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,On certain condicommendation tions.,81
689,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No , without conditions, mended and certainly without the conditions which not for that are sought to be imposed. I can underas I am to concede stand a project to connect Port with Perth as one which the Commonwealth It is no small thing that, has should speedily carry out; and it would tried, keep our hands full for years. As a matter of fact, the people of Western Australia to are further from the port of departure in askingwe South Australia than is New Zealand from this Commonwealth Sydney; and, while the people in the West to repay to South Australia know they are in the Federation, they really have no Federal contact. We certainly canhas not carry out both undertakings; and to which talk of shouldering all the liabilities of the they have Northern Territory, and constructing the regard to their proposed railway, is ,so much humbug. When the honourable member for Grey, with would tears in his voice, begged us to take this ditions beautiful bargain-this land teeming with demnify her wealth- I wondered what was the matter also that wefor with South Australia that it should to part with so much. Surely the Governsent ment of the State are not lunatics to desire to Oodnadatta to get rid of so rich a.territory; if they are, South Australialine it is the first time. I have heard of such a will not pay. It does case in history. The fact of the matter that South Australia has no power to part ward for its extension even to theput with the Territory except to the Commonwealth. I cast no reflection on the South of Australian people for desiring to have trade in communication between Adelaide and Port tinued Darwin, or for desiring to strike a sharp ment as_ bargain; but I should certainly blame the so, and i fcorrect, Commonwealth Parliament if we proved blind to the true position. For these reaupon sons I shall vote against the third reading. Territory,",81
690,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [10.10] - I rise to add my protest against this ParliaTerritory ment entering into what I believe to be utterly unreasonable contract with the people of South Australia. If I could pertinue ceive any argument which would justify us in taking over the Northern Territory upon the agreement that has been put forward, should be ready to assent to it ; because, upon general principles, I believe that Commonwealth should control the Territhe Territory. tory. I take that view because South tralia has practically admitted that she unable profitably to herself develop that Huge area. I join with those who have expressed their admiration for the work that South Australia has done in this regard. I am sure that the people of that State are sufficiently independent to desire no cheap from any one. But, nevertheless, I consider that they are to be.commade to for the attempt which they have develop the Territory. Were it belief, I should not be as ready so many of the points Augusta for which South Australia stipulated. when she has and absolutely failed in her attemptdevelop the Territory, and comes to us the Commonwealth to take it over, should, under such conditions, say that is willing, not only all that she spent, but will also accept the works actual the State has constructed at their cost, irrespective of the time that been in existence, and without depreciation. ,To do that be to take over the Territory on conBut she very favourable to South Australia. not only asks that we shall inall that she has spent, but desire State line of railwaytake shall over from her a which cannot at prebe made to pay. The Port Augusta is evidently one which is not want, because it altogether within South is Australia, and no project has been forborder the Northern Territory. The argument used is that the line has been constructed order that it may eventually be conto Pine Creek. We take that stateSouth and say that if that be Australia has spent money a real attempt to develop the Northern although the attempt has failed, this Parliament will go that far with her, and indemnify her for what she has spent upon the railway. The annual loss on the. amounts to from ,Â£200,000 to an Â£[250,000 a year, and that loss would fall upon the Commonwealth. It would conto be a loss for many years, until we could develop the Territory to such an extent that the ledger would be balanced. I South Australia unquestionably feels the burden of the quarter of a million pounds the which she has to spend every year upon She has been feeling Ausit more and more every year. It is is useless, therefore, for her representatives to say that she does not want to part with the Territory; that she wants to keep it ; but that, as probably the ComEwing, Page, Jmonwealth can do more with it than she Hughes, W. M . can, she will let us have it. The facts Harper, R. show conclusively that, in spite of all that South Australia has done to develop the Wise, Territory, it has been an absolute failure. O'Malley, But, not content with asking the CommonMauger, S. wealth to indemnify her for her losses, Spence, W. G. South Australia attaches a railway condition Chapman, Austin to the transfer. I cannot go so far as Tudor, to agree to that. I consider that, Bamford, F. W. any one regarding the proposal from an unbiased point of view, must agree that South Australia is asking too much. If the railway route which she suggests is the right route, what urgency is there for providing for it in the agreement? route which the railway should follow, I have no doubt that the Federal Parliament, in its wisdom, after due examination inquiry, would so determine. But what I object to is that, on a mere statement as to cost, route, and probable revenue, we are to be bound down to construct a given line. The proposition is unreasonable and unfair. It is, in short, such a proposition as ought not for one moment to be entertained this House. Question-That the Bill be now-read third time-put . The House divided. Ayes Noes 16 Majority Carr, E. &'.
