NEW PROTECTION.",14
1,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, when it is proposed to introduce the Bill relating to the new protection, and whether be is aware that the early passing of such a measure would materially facilitate the passing of the Tariff?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The preparation of the Bill , which must be read in relation to the Tariff, is well in hand. The discussions now taking place on the schedule touch so many points of the new protection that we are anxious to take advantage of them before introducing a measure, the scope of which will be extensive and its administration complex.",14
3,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Will the. Prime Minister submit to the Parliament at an early date a memorandum dealing with the leading features of the proposed new protection legislation ?,14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I shall endeavour to prepare a memorandum setting out in a general way the difficulties to be coped with. The particular means which the Government propose to' adopt to meet those difficulties will of course be disclosed in the Bill. COMMONWEALTH OFFICES' IN LONDON. HIGH COMMISSIONER - TRANSFER OF WORK OF AGENTS-GENERAL-STATE S DEBTS - DESIGN FOR OFFICES.,14
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, a question relating to the Commonwealth offices in London, l t is mentioned in this morning's newspapers that an offer made by the Government for a lease of the site of the proposed Commonwealth offices is likely to be rejected, and that it is possible that the Government may offer an increased rental. Are the Ministry satisfied that a considerable amount of the work now done by the Agents-General of the States is likely to be transferred to the Commonwealth, having regard to the statement made in the report of the Agents General, presented in December, 1905, to the effect that'of a total outlay of ;£8z,ooo in connection with their offices, ,£51,000 or .£52,000 represented expenditure incurred in connection with the registration or inscription of stock, which of course is not likely to be transferred to the High Commissioner ? Seeing that if a High Commissioner were appointed, as a merely ornamental entertainer he would be Ludicrously out of place, is there any certainty. that the greater part of the expenditure now defrayed by the States will be taken over by the Commonwealth as their agent in order to justify to some extent the large expenditure proposed to be incurred upon Commonwealth offices? .",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is rather difficult to deal off-hand with all the suggestions contained in the honourable member's inquiry. He,, perhaps, will remember that, since the presentation of the report to which he refers, there has been in connection with the London offices of several of the States a very large development of business quite apart from the inscription of stock. That business must continue to grow and involve an increased expenditure upon the part of the States.",14
7,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,What chance is there the States asking us to carry out some that work on their behalf ?,15
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think they will be glad to transfer to us much of the busiamend ness which they now undertake without receiving any direct return. We are satissomething fied that it can be undertaken more cheaply by the Commonwealth/ acting on behalf of all the States, than by six different coma petitors in London.",15
9,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Arisin g out of the answer just given by the Prime Minister to the question put by the honourable member for Angas, I should like to ask whether it is the intention of the Government to arrange, at an .early date, for the transfer of the States debts?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When the Tariff disposed of, the Government will submit proposals in that regard.",15
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Are negotiations pending between the States and the Commonwealth, failure? which are likely to be successful, in regard to the transfer to the Commonwealth conbreaking-down trol of any portion of the London business of the States, including the management of the States debts, as to the transfer of which the Agents-General in the report I have mentioned expressed considerable WARATAH-ZEEHAN doubt? I think the House should receive some information on the point in view of the very large expenditure which is likely to be incurred in connection with the selecroute tion of a site for offices.",15
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The information sought will be immediately pertinent when there - before the House a proposal quisition of the site. It can then be dealt with in detail. The assurances I received from the States are those made by several States Premiers at recent Conferences. They were willing to transfer to the Commonwealth certain portions of the work now being carried out by the Agents-General. I do not call that in any case there was a proposal to transfer to the Commonwealth the management of any States debts they remain States debts. .When the States debts become Commonwealth debts then naturally the Commonwealth alone will speed. deal with them ,15
13,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether the sign for Commonwealth offices recently exhibited in this Chamber has thus been approved by the Government?,15
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The design exhibited here has been approved by the London of County Council, but in the event of our of obtaining the site for which we are negotiating, we propose to ask for the power, which no dbubt will be granted to us, to that design in order to provide - I shall not say for the substitution of more Australian,"" but for an opportunity for the architects of Australia to send in competitive drawings for more characteristic and distinctive type of building. INTER-STATE TELEGRAPH"" COMMUNICATION.",15

21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I wish to make a personal explanation in reference to a statement in this morning's Age which has just "".been brought under my notice.

23,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Perth) [10.46] - I feet that it is due to the Tariff Commission/, that at least one member of it should make observations upon this item, in respect which some honourable members appearto be labouring under a misapprehension.. as I listened with a good deal of interest to the speech which was delivered last evenby the honourable member for Yarra, who put the case for the manufacturersvery well indeed. It seems to me, however, that his speech afforded another excellent illustration of the vicious circle inHe pointed out that it was absolutely necessary to levyhigh protective duties upon confectionery,, each because similar duties had been imposed His statement clearly illustrates what is continually going on in the fiscal circle. One industry has to bear a portion of the burwhich rightly belongs to another.",16
24,Mr WEBSTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Bea r ye one another's,16
25,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That is a very good' on adage ethically, but it does not apply industrially. In the final distribution of theburdens we arrive at a point at which no transfer can be made, and it is at . point that most harm is effected. honourable member for Yarra stated last evening that a reduction had taken place the price of sweetmeats in Victoria, and quoted evidence in support of his allegain ""tion. His statement was entirely correct, but I object to his having left the ""tail"" of the thing out of sight. According the evidence of a witness, who appeared before the Tariff Commission, the reduction in the price of confectionery was made a certain firm for the purpose of crushing a workman who had started a business his own in opposition to them, and was endeavouring to work up a connection himself. That was the reason why the duction was made, and I am sure that one which will not 'commend itself to the honourable member. Consequently, his i lustration of the willingness of the facturers to reduce their prices was about the worse that he could have selected support the contention that protective duties have the effect of reducing prices. increased.",16
26,Mr MCDOUGALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member deny that they reduce prices?,17
27,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,In this particular incountry. stance the price was reduced in order to crush a small man who had just started to manufacture an article in the production of which a particular firm had previously enjoyed a monopoly.,17
28,Mr MCDOUGALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,What opportunity does free-trade give to the small man?,17
29,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It does not subject him to the disadvantage of having to comquantity. pete against a big monopoly which is shelbefore tered behind a high Tariff wall. It affords him a freedom of action which a promonopoly tective policy denies to him. In framing a recommendation regarding the duties be levied upon confectionery, the Tariff Commission undoubtedly laboured under a very grave disability, because although manufacturers busied themselves in presentagainst ing a ""very strong .case-and incidentally I may say that one manufacturer presented ' his case in such a frank way as to win commendation of every member of that body",17
30,Mr SAMPSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Is that the reason, an increased duty was recommended?",17
31,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It may have had someing thing to do with it. Undoubtedly the paidrefutation members of the Commission were influenced by the testimony of employers who treated their workmen well, and who did not pear to charge the public undue prices. that - Mr TUDOR - Who was the witness to The whom the honourable member refers?",17
32,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr MACPherson in Robertson, who has a substantial interest in one of the largest confectionery firms Victoria, and whose business is conducted upon excellent principles. I regret that other manufacturers do not conto' form to the high standard upon which he carries on his important industry. The importing firms tendered no evidence whatby ever to the Tariff Commission. Had they been in such close combination as has been of suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, they would undoubtedly ""Have apfor peared before that body. But I believe rethat they did not tender evidence because it is of the keen - competition which exists amongst themselves. The fact that no im- l - porter appeared before the Commission to manumy mind demonstrates that no such combination as has been alleged exists. There to is no doubt that during recent years the imports of confectionery have considerably But I would point out that those imports chiefly consist of chocolate combinations, which seem to be so popular with the users of confectionery in this",17
33,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"There has been an increased importation of 1,000,000 lbs. in chocolates, and of 500,000 lbs. in general confectionery. ",17
34,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The increase- of 500,000 lbs. in, general confectionery is not a very serious one. In relation to the local manufacture it is really a negligable The witnesses who. appeared' the Tariff Commission testifiedthat the local manufacturers enjoy a practical of the lower class of the confectionery trade. As a matter of fact, there to are very few importations of confectionery other than chocolate preparations. In this - particular instance it can scarcely be alleged the that our manufacturers have to compete that pauperized labour which forms such' a useful ad captandum argument amongst ' the protectionists ' of Australia. the The imports of confectionery are nearly all comprised in three very large British, firms, all of whom'treat their employees in why a way that is. almost unexampled. They are. firm's .of the highest repute, and their attitude towards their employees is a standof the allegation that highly labour must always be protected against poorly paid labour. These firms are paying double the wages which are appaid in other parts of the world, and are treating their employees in the most handsome fashion, notwithstanding that they control the entire importation of confectionery injfco the Commonwealth. What has become of the cheaply paid labour in this industry in Great Britain? Why do not the confectionery manufacturers who employ cheap labour sweep out of existence the workmen employed by Cadbury's, Fry's, and Rowntree's? The truth is-as has been pointed 'out again and again by political economists-that highly paid workmen do not require protection against poorly paid labour, because, of the two, the latter is the most ineffective. The honourable member for Yarra, recognising that the reputation of. such firms as Cadbury's was beyond assault, took refuge in the insinuation that certain Scottish firms sweated their employees, and that large quantities of their confectionery were imported into the Commonwealth. Fortunately, these firms have representatives here, and One of those representatives who heard the insinuation in regard to the bad conditions imposed upon the operatives, immediately took action to refute it. It is to be regretted that an honourable member will utter words which are put into his mouth by interested people, without first taking the trouble to satisfy himself as to their accuracy.",17
35,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,It is not correct to that anybody put the words into my mouth.,18
36,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"When the honourable member made the statement which he did, he ought to have supplied the Committee with facts.",18
37,Mr THOMAS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Do Cadbury's compete with the Scottish firm .in question ?,18
38,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"They compete very successfully indeed. I hold in - my hand a copy of two telegrams sent by a representative of one of these Scottish importing firms to his firm in Glasgow asking them to telegraph immediately what is the average wage paid to their workmen. The following is the reply received, adding necessary words to make it intelligible:Above the age of eighteen, the average is 32s. weekly. The honourable member for Yarra is sufficiently well acquainted with the labour conditions in the old country to know that such is by no means a sweating wage, but that, as a matter of fact, taking the difference in the cost of living as between the two countries, it compares favourably with the average paid in Australia. At any rate, here is proof positive that one of the Scotch firms, regarding whom insinuations were made, pay what is, so far as the old country is concerned, a high wage. The principal witness before the Commission on this subject was Mr. Robertson. His evidence was undoubtedly given frankly, and with the object of supplying all reasonable information; and he did not for a moment insinuate that he had to compete with sweated labour in connection with importations. He stated what I believe is the fact, that, so far as the higher classes of confectionery are concerned-and these form the bulk of the importations-hig h wages are paid, not only in Great Britain, but even on the continent of Europe. Some of the men employed on the continent earn as much as .£3 o r £ A a week; but these are special cases, and that rate does not apply to the majority. Here, at any rate, we have an Australian industry which has to face a certain amount of competition, not from poorly paid labour, but from well paid labour. The honourable member for Yarra, while pointing out the increased importation of confectionery, had to admit that there has been a certain increase in local production, though he argued that the local increase is not proportionate to the importation. However, I say think that if the honourable' member for Yarra goes into the figures again, he will find that the increase in the local production is in greater ratio than the increase of importation.",18
39,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"In the last seven years the increase in the local production is represented by 13 per cent., while the increase in the importation is represented by 42 per cent.",18
40,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I question the correctness of the honourable member's deduction*, If we take Victoria as a fair illustration, we find, according to the report of the Inspector of Factories, that in 1905 the number of hands employed in the confectionery industry was 797, which number wage had, in 1906, increased to 1,043.",18
41,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If the honourable member refers to appendix B of the same report, he will see that the increase in the number is only fifty-five. The honourable member is quoting appendix A?",18
42,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Yes.,18
43,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If the honourable member refers to appendix B, he will find that the figures he has quoted are entirely wrong. - Mr FOWLER - What - is the difference?",18
44,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Appendi x B gives the wages of the employees, according to age, and is more complete.",19
45,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I prefer, to take appendix A as a correct indication of the number of hands employed.",19
46,Mr HUME COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,But the details do not work out correctly.,19
47,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is strange ""that there vernment. should be such a discrepancy between two tables in a publication of the kind.",19
48,Mr THOMAS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Why quotefiguresif they do not suit?,19
49,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I take the table that is most obvious, and it shows that, in period named, the increase in the number of hands was nearly 300. At any rate, of the inspectors makes the following general statement in regard to the confecthan tionery trade: A very good year was experienced; the state trade increased considerably, and informed the prospects are good for its tinuance. That does not look very sad or discouragfectioner ing in regard to the future of the confecevidence tionery industry of Australia. The manuthat facturers complained to the Commission certain classes of .chocolate were admitted at a lower rate than was justifiable. That complaint was regarded as reasonable, and, accordingly, the Tariff Commission recom-mended that edible chocolates, which are really confectionery, should be placed the higher lists. That recommendation been adopted by the Government, and will,, in itself, be a considerable advantage^ local manufacturers', who have obtained higher duty for a large and important of chocolate goods. It will be observed those who have taken the trouble to the Commission's report, that the members were practically unanimous in this nexion. When it is remembered that the recommendations were based very largely on the evidence of the manufacturers themselves, it will be realized very best case was submitted for higher duties. There was little or no rebutting evidence; and, consequently, it be fairly said that the case was judged on the evidence of the manufacturers selves. It is unfortunate, I think, that that should be so; but the Commission had turers. to take such evidence as was offered them. I think I can fairly claim on behalf both sections of the Commission that duties they recommended were regarded ample even from a protectionist stand-point. The free-trade section, in practically endorsing the recommendation of the protectionist section, were largely influenced by the fact' that those particular confections might reasonably be subjected to a very high revenue duty. But I have not heard yet, in the whoie course, of the debate, any substantial reason given for the higher .rate of duty as proposed by the Go",19
50,Mr THOMAS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"-Ha\i e the Government, given any reason?",19
51,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"No ; it seems to be simply a case of running up the duties, reason or no reason. While I undoubtedly the hesitate to take any steps which would injure or destroy an industry that I regard one as one particularly Australian-as one which ought to be carried on here, rather that we should have any considerable introduction of confectionery from abroad Inter- - I think it is the duty of this Committee I am not to impose such a high Tariff as may conlead to a monopoly in the trade. I have here a telegram from a manufacturing conin Western Australia, who gave before the Tariff Commission in State; and he is of opinion, now that that he has been able to compare the Government proposal with the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, that the latter is the farrer all round. With such additional evidence as that before me, I have no hesitation whatever in adhering to the recommenin dation of the Commission. I feel satisfied has that if that recommendation be adopted, the industry will continue to progress until to the those engaged in it have practically a control of the whole of the trade, even in- < class eluding those chocolate goods of which by there has been a considerable introduction read during the last few years. That importation, however, has been more than equalled conby the increase in local production, and that increase is a fair indication of the prosperity which has come to Australia during the last few years, and which I that the hope will be long continued.",19
52,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Robertson) [11.13] - This is an item in which I take may some interest; and, so far as I can gather from the evidence obtainable, the market them for the commoner classes of confectionery is practically controlled by local manufacI f the local men have complete control of the market, there seems no necesof sity for a duty on this class of goods. We the have been told by a member of the freeas trade section of the Tariff Commission that practically the trade is in the hands, of tralians; and if a duty be placed on importations, the result, undoubtedly, will be to increase the cost of imported goods. We must remember that whatever duties we impose there must be some importation of all classes of goods; and the increase in price caused by the Tariff enables the local manufacturer, who has command of the trade, to increase his price to the consumer. That is a natural result of a highly protective Tariff; it ceases to be protective, and becomes taxation. Theduty in itself will result in only a small amount of revenue, but, as a matter of fact, it is imposed on the whole consumption, though in regard to the latter we, of course, have no statistics. It seems to me that such a duty confers no benefit on the general consumer, though, of course, it is of great advantage to those engaged in the trade by enabling them to obtain higher prices. Statistics go to show that their output has increased enormously, and that there has also been an increase in the number of persons employed in the making of the various brands of confectionery. According to a return furnished to the Tariff Commission, the number of employees in the confectionery business in New South Wales in 1899 was 613,. and in 1904 839, while in Alctoria the numbers were 727 and 995 respectively. Therefore, in this State, in five years the number of the employees in the' business has increased by more than 250. . These facts show that the industry is by no means declining, and that it will not suffer if we do not increase the duty on confectionery. Last night the > honourable member for Yarra stated that although the higher rates of duties are now being collected, prices have not been increased to the consumer, that the child who enters a lolly shop gets as much for his pence as he received formerly. the retail sellers have to pay more for their supplies. The honourable member for Yarra spoke of this condition of things .as something in favour of the Trust; but I interjected that the small storekeepers were really being sweated, and I' contend again now that, in supporting the - present arrangement, the honourable member is giving countenance to the sweat-' itig of the labour engaged in the work of distribution, because, when 'goods are sold by the ounce, those who sell them may well, be spoken of as labourers. The confectionery industry is well established in' Mr Henry Willis. Aus- Australia, and is a. credit to the Common- ' wealth. Free-traders like to see up-to-date factories' which are able to stand alone, and it is an eye-opener to go through some of the factories here.. The industry being so well established, it is absurd to speak of fostering or protecting it. Higher rates of duty are not. necessary for its protection, and, if agreed to,, can only have the effect of taxing the community for the benefit of the manufacturers in the industry, who. have practically the command of the trade of the Commonwealth. Therefore, it is no longer a question of free-trade or protection. One of the witnesses examined before the Tariff Commission, said that, the importations of confectionery did not affect the local manufacturers, that the over-sea competition was not worth considering, the local trade being strong enough to stand on' its own. According to him, it is the Australian competition that is affecting the local makers. They are cutting into one another's trade, and thus reducing their profits. It is not the duty of Parliament to interfere under these circumstances. Competition is the soul of business, and firms that are not up-to-date and able to compete with, 'their rivals must go under. Prior to the passing, of the Kingston Tariff, there were in New South Wales manufactures which had not been fostered by hot-house treatment, but established under free-trade, and when, on the consummation of Federation, were able to compete on equal terms in the Victorian market, the Victorian manufacturers had speedily to get rid of the obsolete machinery with which they had been making a good living under the old Victorian Tariff. Of course, the man in the street is always ready to give information on this or any other subject; but a witness who is under examination on oath, and liable to But punishment for giving false testimony, is much more ctareful. Therefore the statements contained in the evidence attached to the reports of the Tariff Commission must be taken in preference to irresponsible statements. Some of the witnesses who asked for higher rates of duty had commenced business only since the imposition of the Kingston Tariff, and', notwithstanding, were doing very well. They thought, however, that if the importation of confectionery were reduced, they would get a larger output. But, as I have shown, it is the local competition that does most to reduce prices, and men who have been in business for only a short time can mot expect to be so successful as firms of long standing, who have agencies everywhere., and ;are doing things ona large' scale. If the small makers - are earning a good living, ""we ""may be sure that the large - manufacturers .are Amassing wealth. It is highly creditable to the industry that wages have increased; .that the employers who ;are doing well themselves are paying .good wages to their workmen. Of course, they expect high-class work from them. In some of the factories .in Melbourne, artists .are employed in the manufacture of confectionery, and, - of course, must be paid high wages. Employment is - given to large numbers of active, well-dressed, respectable girls, who are well paid. This 'being the state >of the industry under ,the old duties, why .should - we increase the - rate, seeing that ithe effect of such action 'can be - only to increase prices or to sweat the retailers.? .",19
53,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Fift y thousand pounds worth of confectionery is imported annually.. Sir - WILLIAM LYNE --Tb e total importation is valued at ^120,000. ' Mr HENRY WILLIS - Most of the confectionery imported - consists .of high class chocolate manufactures and preserved fruits, which are most delicious, and are ;got up most .attractively, largely by French firms. This is confectionery which you can put on your table without the fear of causing dyspepsia to your guests, ancl we should take steps to make it reasonably cheap, and within the reach of all classes. Notwithstanding the importation of high-class confectionery from abroad, the trade of the local manufacturers is increasing largely, and I - understand that nowhere in Australia is better confectionery made than in Victoria. Under these .circumstances, the 'Committee - w'll :be well advised if it adopts the suggestions of the Tariff Commission. I find that in respect to some of these items both - sections agreed that certain duties be imposed, and I fail to understand why the Minister should have taken the extreme course of imposing duties, 50 per cent., - and, in some cases, roo per cent., in excess of the increases - recommended even by the protectionist section of the Commission. The confectioners of this State, who appeared before the Commission, showed that they were able to thrive under the Victorian Tariff, and the Commission, recognising that a considerable' sum had been invested in"" the industry arid that it was worth preserving, after a careful consideration of evidence put before it by trade experts, made certain recommendations, the adoption of which by the Parliament would it believed do justice to the industry. Surely those recommendations ought to have some weight with the Committee. The free-trade and protectionist sections of the Commission agreed that on the ordinary class of cheap confectionery in respect of which there is no competition worth mentioning a duty of 2d. per lb. should be imposed. The Government, however, have proposed a - duty of 3f d. per lb. 'On orna mental confectionery the 'Government pro pose a duty of 25 per cent., whilst the protectionist section of the Commission recommend a duty of 2d. per lb. ©ID - cocoa and chocolate the - Government propose a duty of 2^d. per lb.; the free-trade section of the Commission recommended that a duty '©f i d . per lb. should be imposed, whilst the protectionist - section recommended a duty of 2d. per ""lb. Both sections of the Commission' recommended that cocoa 'beans should be free, - and that recommendation has been adopted. But on cocoa shells and nibs a duty) of f d . per IK - has been imposed, although the Commission - agreed that they should be free. '.Cocoa butter, caramel, caramel'paste, and <carame!l butter have been made dutiable at * f d . , - whereas the Commission recommended a duty of i d per lb. The outlook for the industry seems to be good, and the Minister - shows a want of respect for the Committee - in submitting these increased .duties without offering any explanation in regard to them. As to tihe existence of a combine, to which reference has - been made, I consider that that is a question which should be dealt - with when the amending Anti-Trust Bill is before us, and that to deal with it now would be only to confuse the issue. Will -.the Minister now give some reason for imposing duties much higher than those recommended even by the protectionist section of the '.Commission. Mr FOWLER .(Perth) [11.40] - Whils t J was speaking a few minutes ago the honourable member for Yarra challenged a quotation which I made from appendix A in the - report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for Victoria for the year ending 1906. The honourable member contended that I should have quoted from appenelx : B. Having since had an opportunity to examine the two appendices T find that I was quite coraect in quoting from appendix A, - and that to have quoted from appendix B would have been to put before the Committee imperfect and therefore misleading Information.

Two phases of this question have to be considered in this connection; one is conditions under which men engaged, say, in the chocolate manufactories of Great Britain and elsewhere work, and the other the conditions under which the indusenters try is carried on here.

It been asserted that there is in this State combine comprising practically the whole of those engaged in the manufacture of confectionery. That, however, does not less to the stomach. affect in the slightest degree my judgment in this case. A number of honourable bers are inclined to allow their decision influenced by the statement that there trust in existence, .but I am disposed with the honourable member for Robertson that that is'a matter which cannot be considered in connection with this item. Nor do I think that it is a matter with which those who believe in individualism should concern themselves, because they favour conditions which render the creation of trusts and combines inevitable. Yet, when these combinations arise, they propose to exercise remedies which are not only drastic, but which, in some cases, are grossly What I propose in regard to for trusts is what I should propose in regard Both are entitled to abThe mere fact that a combine regulates the conditions attached to an industry ought not to prevent justice being meted out to it. A combine qua comought not to be .treated differently, from an ordinary individual carrying on his business. But the mere fact that a number of persons are driven together by the inexorable consequences of a competition in its results, and in its methods, is sufficient to induce a number of honor^ - able members to promulgate all sorts of schemes for dealing with them.

These rates of duty would constitute a fair compromise, and would allow the manufacturers of the United Kingdom a reasonable preference. The increase which has taken place in the importations of confectionery during the past few years is due to the increased spending power of the people, which, during that period, has been very marked. Not only did the largest manufacturer of confectionery in New South Wales not ask for the present high duty, but he actually wrote to the Minister of Trade and Customs before the Tariff was 'introduced, suggesting that no higher rate than 2d. per lb. should be imposed. Consequently, I suggest that a .fluty of 2 j d . per lb. under the general Tariff would represent an appropriate adjustment of the rate.",22
63,Mr KNOX,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Kooyong) [11.55] - My own feeling is that a case has not been made out for the extreme duty proposed by the Government. It is quite clear from the evidence tendered to the'Tarif f Commission that the large manufacturers engaged in the confectionery industry are doing very well. An analysis of the cost of production-particularl y in connection with sugar-justifie s the belief that the honourable member for West Sydney has suggested a fair compromise.,23

65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,That is not correct.,23
66,Mr KNOX,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If we cannot accept the statements made by the Treasurer we have arrived at a very pretty pass indeed. I had a suspicion that there was an element of bargaining in the treatment accorded to one or two items of the Tariff, and that a high duty had been proposed in respect of them under the belief that the Committee would reduce it. If the Treasurer has made any declaration of the character attributed to - him by the honourable member for Paramatta, ""the sooner the public learn how he is leading the Committee in this matter the better. Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-The statement is absolutely incorrect.",23
67,Mr DTJGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Seeing that the industry has been doing very well under the old rate of duty, and that the price of sugar has not changed, why should we place it in a better position?",23

69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Will the honourable member read this statement?,23
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,What is the name of the newspaper in which it is published? The statement which the honourable member for Parramatta has attributed to me is absolutely untrue. I shall show how true it is before we have completed the consideration of this item.,23
71,Mr KNOX,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,It is important that we should not be asked to sanction the imposition of duties which the Government conscientiously believe will not be agreed to.,23
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Parramatta) [12.0] - I do not intend to speak-on the main question at present, but simply to respond to the challenge of the Treasurer in regard to my statement that in Sydney he declared, in a newspaper interview, that hehad proposed certain duties in the Tariff in order that they might be reduced, and that he would be very well satisfied if they were reduced.",23
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,To which newspaper is the honourable member referring?,23
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,To the Sydney Daily Telegraph.,23
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Goo d gracious ! Treasurer Does the honourable member quote that newspaper as an authority? The honourable member must think I am a fool if he believes that I said anything of the kind.,23

77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Always . I have had to write statements that I desired to make, and to refuse to express opinions in any other way.",23
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Then it is a pity that the Treasurer did not correct this very important statement at the time it was made.,23
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I never bother my head about what the Sydney Daily Telegraph says; I never read that newspaper when I am down here.,23
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Treasurer is thus reported in the newspaper interviewI am very well satisfied with the way in which things have gone so far. The result has been very much as I anticinated, except in one respect. . . . Sir William denied that there had been any "" back-down"" in respect of the duty on candles.

87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.3] - The statement of the honourable member for Parramatta is not correct ; he is quoting from a newspaper that never tells the truth. One part of the report of the interview is fairly, correct, but the latter part is absolutely untrue. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The report puts the remarks of the Treasurer in inverted commas.",24
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The newspaper is inverting itself all the time. As a matter of fact, I was asked a question by a representative of the Daily Telegraph the reduction in the duty on candles, and I said to him that if there were no other Chairman. items reduced in larger proportion, as the consideration of the Tariff went on, should not have very much to complain",24
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Is that not same thing?,24
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"No , it is not the same thing.",24
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,It means that Treasurer proposed duties in order that they might be reduced.,24
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That is not so. I have said, from the first submission of the Tariff, that alterations must take place - that suggestions were sure to be made that could not be made before the public knew what the Tariff proposals were. I anticipated that some very good information might be given, and suggestions made, to the Government, whereby anomalies would be removed; and that is what I referred to in the newspaper interview. If , from persons outside, or from honourable members, there should come any reliable information pointing to the necessity for making alterations, I shall take, notice of it and will adopt.the consequent suggestions if-they appeal to me. Not one word! that I ever gave to any newspaper interviewer can be interpreted as meaning that I proposed the duties set forth .in the Tariff with a view to their being reduced.",24

95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Hear , hear; that bears out what I say.",24
96,Mr SALMON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I rise to a point of order. Is it not the custom, which has existed for many years in Parliament, that when are honourable member denies the truth of any expression or observation attributed to him, his denial must at once be accepted?",24
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is a rule that when a statement is denied that denial! shall be accepted. But what has happened here this morning is that the Treasurer has made a statement repudiating; what I read from the report of a newspaper interview, and has, in the next breath, repeated the statements contained! in that interview. That is the position.",24
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I have done noabout thing of the kind.,24
99,Mr SALMON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I ask your ruling, Mr .",24
100,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Of course, honourable, members of. must accept a statement made by another the honourable member in correction. But, at the same time, what appears to have transpired up to the present is merely a matter of opinion. the Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No , it is a matter of fact.",24
101,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," The Minister has expressed his opinion, and J. fail to see that I could 'take the matter any further.",24
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I only take notice of the reference to the newspaper interview, because thereby the deputy leader of the Opposition desires to impregnate the minds of honourable members, and of the public, with the idea that I submitted the duties in the Tariff schedule with no anticipation of their being adopted. I shall allow neither the honourable member for Parramatta nor any one else to create a false impression in that way. I have just stated that I shall generally stand by the duties as proposed, but, at ' the same time, I cannot expect to carry the whole of them. I think I can say that, up to the present, I have not done badly in submitting a fairly acceptable Tariff. As I am now on my feet, though I do not make long speeches as each item is submitted",24
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The Treasurer does not make any speeches.,25
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do wish the honourable member would be quiet. were to talk in the most convincing way for an hour or two, I should only give rise to a flood of debate on the part of those who are never satisfied with anything. Under; the circumstances, I control myself, and say no more than I can possibly avoid; a Minister who desires expedition must not speak too often or too long. While I am on my feet, however, I wish to urge upon honourable members that the existence of a combine has nothing whatever to do with the Government proposal. I may say that I have information which leads me to suppose that there is a combine; and I think I am at liberty to go 61 so far as to say that the matter has been inquired into by the Crown Law Officers, who have some very important information, on which action is likely to be taken. I am not prepared to say more at present because the case may be regarded as sub judice. At present, I contend that the proposed duty ought not to be imperilled because there happens to be a combine.",25
105,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,It ' strength of the protection which enables a combine to be formed.,25
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That has been said so often that, really, one ceases to take notice of the statement. If protection tends to create a combine, the reply is that we can better deal with a combine here than we can deal with a combine elsewhere. Honourable members opposite are always supporting the foreigner-the poor unfortunate foreigner !-to the detriment of our own people.",25
107,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Now we shall have a debate.,25
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That may be; but, in any case, my silence would not restrain honourable members opposite. Such statements as those to which I refer have been so frequently repeated that the Government may be forced to adopt some means of getting business through more quickly.",25
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The Treasurer will not expedite business by making personal remarks.,25
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I cannot sit still while misstatements are made and re? peated.,25
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I quoted a newspaper, and the Treasurer confirmed the report this morning.",25
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That is a repe- "" tition of an untruth. It has been contended that the .Government proposal means a large If I increase of the duty. I take it that before Federation the States may be taken to have known something of their own business in regard to fiscal matters. I have here figures which show that before Federation the duty on confectionery in New South Wales-owin g to the same influence which is felt on the benches opposite-wa s onlyid. per lb.",25
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,And the industry was flourishing.,25
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Flourishing ? In Victoria, prior to Federation, the duty was 2d. per lb., or 25 per cent.; in Queensland, 46. per l b ; in South Australia, 3d. per lb.; in Tasmania, 2d per lb.; and in Western Australia, 4d per lb. In Canada, at the same period, the duty was £d. per lb., and 35 per cent., which worked out at an average of 3 d. per lb. This inx formation has just been handed to me by the Comptroller-General. The duty that was first proposed on this particular item in 1002 for the Commonwealth,, was 2d. per lb., and 15 per cent.; but that was reis the duced to i d . The duty, which was fixed in 1902, on cocoa and chocolate, was i d . per lb., and on other confectionery 2d., with 20 per cent, on ornamental confectionery and so forth-the duties varied. The Government proposal now practically strikes an average of the duties imposed by the States prior to Federation; and one reason which causes me to submit the proposed duty is that, for some three or four years, importations, instead of decreasing, have been increasing.",25
115,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,But local production has been increasing still more.,25
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member has repeated that statement two or three times, but it is not correct.",25
117,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Le t the honourable member prove the statement.,25
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"There is no attempt at proof; only the bald statement is made. Last year, the importations of confectionery amounted to 3,184,000 lbs., of a value of .£116,000. In 1903 the value of the imports was £89,000 odd, so that there has been an increase of about £30,000. That cannot be good for the industry in Australia. posed as any one to undue .combination, but the fact that' there is a combine should not dissuade honourable members from imposing a fair and proper duty. should, perhaps, have liked to see a little more preference given to Great Britain, whence come about two-thirds of the importations, the remainder being from the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Hong Kong, and other foreign countries. For thereasons that I have stated, I do not wish to dwell on this subject, but I have given shortly the grounds on which the Government have proposed to increase the rates, which, undoubtedly, were too greatly reduced'by the Tariff of 1902. I wish to see the making of confectionery in Australia increase; we should not import any. If there is a nettle in the shape of a combine, we should grasp it . firmly. I feel strongly about combines, and have been urging certain action in connection with this and with others. Something should be done, and when the Bill which is in the other House is passed, I think that pretty drastic action will be taken, which will show that we mean business.",25
119,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Lang) [12.18] - Perhaps it is well that the Minister does not often address the Committee in explanation of the items of the Tariff, because he seems unable to get on his feet without making personal and offensive references tothose who sit in Opposition.",26
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Not at all.,26
121,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If the Minister cannot give us the information we ask for, he should at least set an example of courtesy. Ministers are the worse offenders, they are the most discourteous men in the Chamber. But they are mistaken if they think that they can bullock the Tariff through, and silence honourable members. I , for one, refuse to forego my right of speech under the influence of Ministerial threatenings or the boorish behaviour of Ministerial supporters, and intend to say what I have to say completely and without curtailment. The Tariff mission unanimously recommended the duty on confectionery should ndt exceed 2d., and yet the ment, without rhyme or reason, propose to make the rate 3fa\ The Treasurer has not said a word in justification of the proposal.",26
122,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Because it does not I am just as op- need it.,26
123,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If there is one item in the scjhjedule which needs explanation more than any other, it. is I this. If the Minister will not give an explanation, the item""' will not be passed as quickly as he may think. We shall insist on getting an explanation from some quarter. The facts which have been laid before the Committee show that there is a combine among the manufacturers of confectionery in Australia whose operations are injuriously affecting both retailers and consumers, their object being to restrict trade and to increase prices. In spite of the denials made last night, a price list was read, which shows that increases have been made in a large number of lines- I think over fifty. In view of this fact, will the Minister say that the effect of the duties is not to raise prices?",26
124,Mr MCDOUGALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,That is not their intention.,26
125,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It may not be the intention of those w-ho are foolish enough * to vote for them, but it is the intention of those who ask for them, and it is the effect of voting for them,",26
126,Mr MCDOUGALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The . same things occur under free-trade.,26
127,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That is a silly reply. If they occurred under free-trade, it would be none the less absurd to support propositions which will have the same effect.",26
128,Mr MCDOUGALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,We can restrict the operations of combines.,26
129,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"But why assist to create them?. Not only is the confectionery combine dealing unfairly with retailers, and raising prices, but it has even resorted to methods of cheating. That is shown by a series of complaints set out in a letter in my possession, in which the writer, a well-known retail confectioner, says, after referring to several grounds of complaintThis shows that the public of Australia are already very heavily handicapped and the shopkeepers here are in a worse position than those in England, for we have not got the population to work on, our rents are higher, cost of gas over Com- roo per cent, more, and many other things are in keeping with those mentioned. that The following are also some of the troubles' that I have had to contend with :Govern- r. Short weipht in the boxes. That is cheating",26
130,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Rubbis h !,26
131,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Fro m the protectionist standard of commercial morality, perhaps it is regarded as honest to give short weight. I do not expect that any argument would take effect upon the mind of a confirmed and unreasoning protectionist. Such minds have become unreceptive, and impervious to reason. or argument. are less hardened members on the Government side of the Chamber, whose minds have not yet become fossilized, and whose brains are still receptive. It' is for their benefit that I am speaking, The writer whose letter I am reading, complains, first, of short weight in boxes. He saysThis was so glaringly rampant that though I complained to the traveller about it, and he to the firm, it still went on, and I then brought the shop my large scales, and weighed the boxes in front of the carters, and required them to put the gross weigh: on the boxes, and initial them, and when empty I again weighed the boxes to ascertain the nett weight received. The traveller told me there was trouble about my delaying the carters, and that I was to weigh them myself, and what was short he would always (and did) allow me for. (I pity the shop-keeper who was not sharp enough to find out the above.) Those who have been shrewd enough to weigh their boxes, and thus to discover that they were getting short weight, have been able to demand that it shall be made up, but those who have not suspected trickery have been, and probably still are, the victims of it.",26
132,Mr MALONEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Le t us make the law strong enough to punish those who do these things.,27
133,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do not know that that is necessary. We have passed legislation to punish those who act in restraint of trade, but when we ask the Minister to put it into operation, he says that the Act is ineffective.",27
134,Mr MALONEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Opposition did not want it, and criticised it, and tried to destroy it.",27
135,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"^-We tried to make it better; but every suggestion we made was pooh-poohed as unnecessary, and our amendments were not accepted. We were assured that the measures were perfect, and could therefore not be improved. The letter continuesAnother grievance- A friend of mine was paying 7d. per lb. for a line. I was being charged 8d. per lb. for the same line, same quality, and by the same traveller. In another case I was paying is. i d . per lb. for a line, but another friend of mine was being charged is. 5d. per"" lb. for the same line, from the same firm, but not the same traveller. Another unfair practice-Certain lines of toffy at 8d. per lb. are put up in tins, which tins weigh about a lb. The gross weight is chaTged, but only 6d. is allowed for the empty t in ; thus the shopkeepers lose 2d. or more on every tin, if they have not discovered this trick. These poor unfortunate shopkeepersmostly widows and old people, who depend upon the trade for a scanty liveliBut there hood-los e 2d. on every tin. ' Then again, the discount has been (and I have every reason to believe is still) a source, of great complaint. I have been getting 5 per cent., but I find some have been getting to per cent., and 15 per cent., whilst one lady who signed our petition to Parliament showed me invoices (two of which I now hold as evidence) on which she received no discount at all ; yet we, as retail confectioners, are asked to trust these firms who are craving for more protection, which will, if carried, injure into us still further, and penalize the public. As to the Combine amongst manufacturers of confectionery, in my opinion it not only exists, but is very detrimental to the shopkeepers, and in a lesser degree to the public. One manufacturer who refused to join has been debarred from handling the goods of those in the Combine, and the middleman had to, and did, close their account with the manufacturer because he refused to join the Combine; and he told me in confidence that he had good reason to believe the Combine has tried to sjtop his sunnlies of sugar. I respectfully submit that there is need for a Government inquiry, and I honestly believe, if instituted, we can procure, evidence that would be the means of showing that a great attempt has been made to introduce the muchdreaded American combine or trust system. I agree with that contention. The writer makes allegations, which I understand he is prepared to substantiate, showing that there is ample reason for - making an inquiry as to the composition and operations of this Combine, and others which are said to be carrying on business in the Commonwealth-and more particularly in Victoria-and whose monopolies we are asked to bolster up by increased duties. This item ought to be postponed until an inquiry has been held, and Parliament has been placed in possession of full information as to the effect upon trade of the operations of these trusts.",27

138,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do not wish to disclose the name of the writer, because if I did the Combine might supply some one else with goods to undersell him. I am prepared to give his name if I am required by the forms of the House to_ do round so. but surely the honourable member for Corio, who professes to have the in-sire terests of the small man at heart, will recognise that this man would be likely to suffer by the disclosure of his name.",27

142,The CHAIRMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is laid down May that if a Minister reads from a State document, or from any document that likely to be published, he may be asked to lay it on the table of the House. But, so far as a quotation from a purely private letter is concerned, it is for the honorbuilt able member who makes it to determine whether or not he should disclose the name of the writer. There is nothing in the Standing Orders requiring an honourable member to give the name of the writer private letter which he quotes, nor is it definitely laid down by May that he be compelled to do so.",28

144,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Quite so. letter bears the signature of a well-known and reputable shopkeeper in this city. Several letters were read yesterday, but no honourable member on this side of the Comseen mittee asked that the names of the writers should be disclosed. I have refrained from disclosing the name of the writer of this letter simply because I do not wish to do him an injury by exposing him to the relentless persecution of this powerful Combine which honourable members of the Labour Party are bolstering up. Three of the largest manufacturers South Wales-amon g them one of the most highly-respected and best-known manufacturers of confectionery in tralia-hav e admitted that they do not want any increased duty, and that an allduty of 2d. per lb. is amply sufficient. If honourable members reaily deto grant a genuine preference to the Mother Country, they have a splendid opportunity to do so in this case, seeing that, according to the Treasurer, two-thirds of a our importations of confectionery and otherchocolate come from Great Britain. We to should be prepared all the more readily to grant a preference in this case since the labour conditions obtaining in the manufacture of British confectionerv are all that could be desired. I have here some illustrated pamphlets illustrating the conditions of labour and rates of pay. prevailing in connection with Cadbury's establishment. Cadbury's not only provide the finest possible accommodation for their employees and grant them the best working conditions and high wages, but attend to social and physical welfare outside no their, factory. They provide for them on gardens, tennis courts, cricket and football kits, and various other means of taking by health-giving exercises. They have also a pension fund arid a scheme for the genis eral improvement of the conditions of their workers. In order that the employees may not have to live under the unhealthy conditions of crowded cities, they have upon a trust estate some splendid up-to-date dwellings, replete with the most approved hygienic and sanitary conveniences. In short, they have done all they can to advance the physical, mental, of a and moral welfare of their employees.",28
145,Mr HUME COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does ithe honourable can member know of any firm outside Cadbury's and Frv's who do that?,28
146,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I.a m told that there are reputable firms which, although perBut the haps not coming up to the standard of Cadbury's, observe more than reasonable conditions of labour and pay wages that are in the highest degree satisfactory. It will be that in this case the workers in the industry in Australia are not called upon to compete against cheap Continental labour. The proposed duties are almost prohibitive of the importation of the highest class of confectionery, produced by British labour under the conditions I have described. I do not wish it to be inferred that I desire in any way to detract from the conditions in New which obtain in the industry in Australia. As a matter of fact, in company with a number of honourable members, I visited Ausa local factory some time ago, and I was extremely pleased with the conditions under which the employees labour. But - would point out that under the operation firms. of the old Tariff, which represented a reduction in the duty previously operative in selves. Victoria, employment in this industry has been nearly doubled, and wages have increased by more than 50 per cent. is no justification, therefore, for the creased duty proposed. Upon the sion of my visit to the local factory, the proprietor commented upon the satisfactory conditions which obtained leading. in the industry, and pointed with pride to its growth. But there is one item of formation which he suppressed. not inform us of the extent to which his profits had increased since the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff.",28
147,Mr EWING,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does Cadbury tell us that?,29
148,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Cadbur y is not askBritain ing for a monopoly or the privilege of dipping his hands into the public Treasury to increase the profits of his business. Victorian manufacturers are demanding an increase of 275 per cent, on and we have a right to know what are the reasons underlying their demand. The fact is that during the past ten years their fits, must have considerably increased.",29
149,Mr BAMFORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,What is the highest duty for which the honourable member will vote?,29
150,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I sav that even if admitted British confectionery free, sales of Australian confectionery would be affected. In spite of the natural advantages under which British confectionweek, ery labours in Australia, by cost and length of time in transit, there is a steady demand for it on account of its superior Our manufacturers have not the experience necessary to enable them to produce such good article, nor have they, the same market to cater for. British and tinental manufacturers have the benefit the markets of the world. They have compete against the world. But our local manufacturers are restricted to the Austraharm lian market. They cannot hope to compete with firms like that of Cadbury in the kets of the world, and therefore they canwill not afford to purchase the up-to-date machinery necessary for the production the highest class of goods. I acknow- ledge that they produce goods cellent quality, . t u t I do not think that any body will contend that their production - of chocolates is equal in quality to that I Cadbury's and other well-known British",29
151,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,They admit it them,29
152,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Exactly . It has been . - urged that the wages paid in the industry There here are very much higher than those which inare paid in Great Britain. But as a matoccater of fact the average British wage is higher than the average Australian wage.,29
153,Mr BAMFORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Averages , are very mis",29
154,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Then they are misinleading upon both sides. Probably what He did the honourable member says is correct. Still, we must accept them as fairly correct averages after making proper allowance for differences, to which I need not refer. The average wage paid in Australia to male operatives in the confectionery industry, is 30s. 5d., as against the average in Great of 31s. In the case of females, the average wage in. Great Britain is 18s. 6d.,. The as against 13s. in Australia.",29
155,Mr BAMFORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Thos e figures apply to the old rate-, Victoria, I think.",29
156,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It will thus be seen, that our .manufacturers are not called uponproto compete against lower-paid labour in> Great Britain. I would point out tosome of my labour friends that not only is the firm of Cadbury's working upon philanthropic lines, but it is intensely sympathetic with the aims of labour. As eviwe dencing this fact,*I. may mention that Mr. the George Cadbury, during the recent strike not of engineers, contributed £ 5 0 weekly todisthe union funds, and during Christmashe increased his donation to £ 1 0 0 .",29
157,Mr BAMFORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Is it not true that theConfectionery Combine here contributed toquality. the bakers' strike?,29
158,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is very probable. a But it does not detract from the action wide of Mr Cadbury, against whom this: Conduty is mainly directed. I have noof desire to handicap any local industry. to It is the greatest fallacy in the world to suppose that free-traders wish toanybody. All that we desire is to> prevent manufacturers from injuring others, marand if we grant them a monopoly, they be in a position to injure the retailers who purchase from them, and the consumers-of who have to pay the piper.",29
159,Mr CARR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Is not Cadbury going toof very exstart operations here?,29
160,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I should not be surprised if he did. I submit that it would' of be very much better for our manufacturers-to »be called upon to face the competition of such a rival when he was 16,000 miles away, than to be called upon to face it at our own doors.",29
161,Mr WATSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Oh , no; we want to employ our own people.",30
162,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Unde r the old Tariff, which-as I have previously remarkedwas lower than the Victorian Tariff, the number of confectionery factories in the Commonwealth has increased from seventyone to seventy-nine, and the number of hands from 1,845 to 2,418. Of the total number of hands engaged in the industry in Victoria, 800 are employed by one firmthat of MACRobertson. So that we are asked to grant this increased measure of protection in the interests chiefly of one firm.",30
163,Mr WATSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,What about the Sydney manufacturers ?,30
164,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I understand they do not desire any increased protection. They have declared themselves satisfied with a duty of 2ti. per lb. all round-on e of the largest manufacturers in Australia has so.,30
165,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,When did he say,30
166,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I cannot give the honourable member the date, but I make it on the authority of a statement published by the Chamber of Commerce. Sitting suspended fronj 1 to 2.15 p.m.",30
167,Mr JQHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I regret.that the necessity arises to combat as vigorously as I have the attempt to impose this duty. At the same time, it must be admitted that no more time has been occupied in this debate than is necessary to place the case clearly before the Committee. It has been stated by at least one retail confectioner in Melbourne, in a letter to the press recently, that, so great is the demand 'for imported confectionery, as compared with the demand for the local article, that forty-nine boxes of imported milk chocolate can be sold for one of local - manufacture. This is evidence that the public taste inclines for the imported article, so far as this particular class of - confectionery is concerned. No doubt there are other branches of the trade in which the local product can command a - ready sale, and hold its own against competition from any source. Chocolate and cocoa should not be regarded as - confectionery, seeing that they are the - staple food of the sick room and the nursery, containing as they do very valuable nutritive properties. A duty such as that proposed by the Government really places an embargo on the best classes of chocolate and cocoa; and we ought to discriminate between such articles and confectionery which is used simply for pleasure. Under free-trade conditions in New South Wales, Messrs. Griffiths Brothers were able, not only to manufacture cocoa, but to successfully compete with the Victorian manufacturers, who were protected by a duty of 3d. per lb.; and one of the first actions of the Victorian Combine was to endeavour to prevent New South Wales manufacturers from doing business in that State. Mr Robertson himself, in his evidence given before the Tariff Commission, admits that there is no justification for the proposed duty. He says that the continental competition does not seriously affect his business; and he added that he did not think that, so far as some of ""the continental manufacturers were concerned, he was placed at a disadvantage, because he had been told that the men who said made the higher classes of goods were tolerably well paid, receiving £ 2 , £ 3 , so? £ 4 , and in some cases as high as £ 5 per week. That furnishes the best proof, if proof be needed, that the proposed 'duty is unnecessary. The average wage in Great Britain "" pans out"" really higher than the average wage paid in Australia; and, in addition, we have Mr Robertson's admission that there is nothing to fear from continental competition.",30
168,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,It is only fair to Mr. Robertson to point out that he was instancing exceptional cases.,30
169,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I am speaking of high class goods.,30
170,Mr FOWLER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Eve n in that connection, these were special rates of wages for specially skilled men.",30
171,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"And I have no doubt that, in the case of the higher classes of goods, Mr Robertson himself pays special rates of wages. Mr F. Geddes, the representative of the Operatives' Association, when before the Tariff Commission, said that the. wages question did not seriously affect the cost of production; so that both employers and employed agree that they are not called upon to compete against low wages.",30
172,Mr HUME COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Mr Geddes pleaded ordinary hard for the extra duty.,30
173,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do not blame either employers or operatives for asking for a higher duty, if by that means they can secure a monopoly. If they find a Government pliant enough to give them anything they like to ask for, they would be foolish not to ask; but I certainly would blame any Parliament which consented to a Government conceding such terms, in face of the overwhelming evidence that we have, and in the full knowledge that thereby there may be created a dangerous, monopoly, injurious to a large section of the public. The Treasurer seems a little restive because this debate has proceeded for a time. I do not think, however, that the debate has been unreasonably protracted by honourable members on either side; and if the Treasurer is so anxious to get the Tariff disposed of, as I am sure honourable members are",30
174,Mr SAMPSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Le t him apply closure.,31
175,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Government may do as they please in that respect, and, perhaps, the honourable member would like the closure applied to himself. No doubt the Government have the power to apply the closure as suggested, not only by the honourable member for Wimmera, but by others.",31
176,Mr WILKS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,It must not be forgotten that the Government must have the support of twenty-four members before the closure can be applied.,31
177,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"What are honourable members talking about? They seem to be dreaming, or, perhaps, they think they deserve the closure.",31
178,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Treasurer himself is mainly responsible for any debate that may have taken place. If he did not introduce, such unreasonable there would not be the same necessity for hostile criticism. The Treasurer is not satisfied .to accept even the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. How, then, can he expect honourable members, whether protectionists or free-traders, who profess to represent the people, to let his extravagant proposals pass without discussion? If the Treasurer desires a short debate his best plan would be to so revise the Tariff that it will appeal to the common-sense of the Committee.",31
179,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Fawkner) [2.27] - I rise merely to say that - if the amendment now before the Committee is defeated, I intend to move that the duty be 3d. per lb. as against foreign nations, and 2^d. per Tariff [25 OCTOBER, 1907.] (Item 45). 5225 lb. in the case of confectionery from Great Britain.",31
180,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Batman) [2.28] - Yesterday afternoon the honourable member for Grey stated that a certain Melbourne firm was sending out goods under weight. The firm referred to is that of MACRobertson, and, in reply, I desire to say that every box of goods which leaves their works contains a slip of paper bearing the following words: - "" Should you find the weight or count incorrect please return this slip.""  MACRobertson's sweets this morning, and there was no such slip in them.",31
181,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I visited the MACRobertson factory this morning in connection with this matter, and I was requested to go into the shop and take down a box. The box was the not given to me, but T took it down myself in the presence of the honourable member for Grey, and inside I found this slip. Further, a Victorian. Act which was passed last year provides that every article shall carry a tag giving information as to weight and so forth, so that MACRobertsons, if this slip were not included in their boxes of confectionery, would be breaking the law. This, I think, is sufficient to show that the firm referred to is not doing the class of business suggested by the honourable member for Grey; indeed, the firm has no need to do so. The only argument that the honourable member for Grey can find in opposition to the proposed increase of duty is the fact' that there is a combine in the confectionery trade. We are not dealing with combines now, but with the Tariff. When the time comes for us to deal with combines, we shall, of course, deal with them.  proposals about increased prices?",31
182,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes ; but out of 300 varieties of goods turned out by the confectioners of Victoria, in only thirty instances have prices been raised.  ton.",31
183,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The most startling statement made to the Committee was that of the honourable member for North Sydney, who said that he would vote against the Government proposals because one of the leading manufacturers of Australia had gone before a Tariff Commission and said that the increases were not necessary.",31
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I did not say that that was my reason for voting against these proposals; but I mentioned the facl as evidence that an increase in the rates is not required.,31
185,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The point I wish to make is that Mr Stedman-the manufacturer referred to-di d not go before the Tariff Commission, although he instructed Mr. Robertson to represent him there, and to ask for increased duties. Mr Stedman is one of the largest importers in Australia, rather than a manufacturer; his price list containing 419 foreign lines. Then the honourable member for Dalley told us that he was going to stick to the evidence of the Tariff Commission, and would not take the statements which have been circulated on flimsies throughout the chamber.",32
186,Mr WILKS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,What I said was that one of the biggest manufacturers of confectionery in Australia did not go before the Tariff Commission.,32
187,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Mr Stedman employs only about 120 men.,32
188,Mr WILKS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"MACRobertso n is also a big importer. . Mr COON - That is not correct. I have been charged with misrepresentation; but I am now showing how the Committee has been misled by the members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Lang, in a very long speech, told us what Cadbury does in the old country. As a protectionist, I think we should increase our duties so as to compel that firm to come here to carry on its operations. The Australian manufacturers do not fear such competition.",32
189,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,They think that they would soon get any new competitors into the Combine.,32
190,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I am not now dealing with combines. The. evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that higher rates arenecessary; some of the strongest statements being made by Mr Alfred Woodhill, of Sydney, who saidOwing to the higher prices paid in the trade here, and the much higher prices charged for raw material, the present rate of 2d. per lb. is rendered worthless as an aid to local manufacture, and is only a revenue tax. He also stated thatThe present' Tariff is a blood-sucking one. It takes everything,, and gives usnothing in return. Mr Robertson,, who represented MacRobertson and Co., and every manufacturer in Australia, with the exception of some in Western Australia, went before the Tariff Commission and asked for higher duties.",32
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Are manufacturers to be given higher duties simply because they ask for them?,32
192,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"When what is asked for is fair and just, and will bring about better conditions, it should be given.. Representatives of the workers also went before the Commission and testified that there are scores of men out of employment, but that, if the duties were increased, work would be given to 500 more men.",32
193,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member believe that?,32
194,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"A short time ago, the members of the Opposition insisted that, we should accept the sworn evidence presented by the Tariff Commission. I ask them to accept this sworn evidence.",32
195,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,That was only a statement of opinion.,32
196,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It was given on oath. I ask those who recently visited MACRobertson's factory here whether it is not equal to any in the Commonwealth, if not in the world. The firm treats its men well. The honourable member for Lang praised Cadbury as a liberal employer, who gives freely to one organization and another.",32
197,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I mentioned that only incidentally.,32
198,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That an employer 16,000 miles away is.liberal is no reason for not putting up our Tariff. The honourable member did not say anything about combines in England. Under the Victorian Factories Act, the boys employed in the confectionery industry must be paid ios. a week; but one of the boys employed by MACRobertson earns on piece work £ 1 ns. 6d. a week, another £ 1 4s. iod., another £ 1 12s. 3d., and another £ 1 8s.",32
199,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Perhaps they get more than they are worth.,32
200,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Thos e figures show what a splendid employer MACRobertson is.,32
201,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,They may show that he is charging toomuch for his wares.,32
202,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On e of the girls employed on piece work earns £ 1 6s. 6d. a week, another £ 1 8s., another £ 1 ios. 9d., and and another £ 1 7 s. 6d. Thosefiguresshow what good wages are paid in this industry.",32
203,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If it can pay such good wages, why are higher duties needed?",32
204,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Honourable members opposite, a few days ago, spoke of an. industry as not being worth encouraging, because the conditions of employment were not too good. The honourable member for Grey urged that. The confectionery industry, at any rate, should be encouraged, because of the good wages which it pays. I have shown that the statements of the honourable members for Dalley and North Sydney were incorrect, and that the honourable member for Grey objected to the proposals of the Government merely on the ground that there is a combine. But the manufacturers and workers of Australia haying asked for - extra protection, I appeal to the Committee to grant it to them, and to keep out importations which, last year, were valued at jQi20,000. We can make our own confectionery. Even the honourable member for Parkes has admitted that Australian confectionery is nearly as good as the imported. He could hardly be expected to say quite as good; but, twelve months hence, he will find it equally good. I shall have much pleasure in supporting the proposals of the Government. I hope that Ministers will stick to their guns, and carry the rates set down in the schedule.",32
205,Mr SAMPSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Wimmera) [2.45] - I regret that the debate is not proceeding more rapidly. If second-reading speeches are to be made on every item, it seems to me that we shall not dispose of the Tariff for another two years; but if the Government are prepared to adopt reasonable measures to expedite the discussion of the duties I shall be very glad to assist them. My desire is that we shall push on with the business of the House in order that the affairs of the Commonwealth may be attended to in the way that the people expect. I have listened to this debate with a good deal of interest, and although I do not profess to have an expert knowledge of the manufacture of confectionery, I think that a case has been made out for an increased duty. Under the States Tariffs the duties on confectionery were as follows.:-Victoria, 2d. per l b . ; New South Wales and Queensland, 4d per l b . ; South, Australia, 3d. per l b . ; Tasmania and, I understand, Western Australia, 4d. per lb. Under the Victorian Tariff certain drawbacks were allowed in respect to sugar and glucose used in the manufacture of confectionery, the effect of which was to place the manufacturers in a much better position than the mere imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. would suggest. Under the first Federal Tariff the duties were reduced to i d . and 2d. per.lb., with the result that the value of our importations of confectionery increased from ^71,575 in 1902 to £110,281 in 1906. There was a steady increase of imports under the old Tariff. I am prepared to admit that the conditions of labour in the old country are in certain respects very reasonable. There is no occasion in this connection to talk about the existence of sweating in Great Britain. We know that most of the manufactures imported from the old land are made under very favourable circumstances. But it is our duty to look first of all to the industries of Australia. Older nations have to compete with exportations from Great Britain, and although they should be able to carry on their industries under a much lower Tariff than Australia can do, we find that they are not doing so. I have in mind Canada, the United States of America, and Germany, which are not exposed to the same dangers that confront us, and do not need population as we do. The industries of Germany and the United States, and their sources of production, are well developed.",33
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,But they are alongside their most formidable competitors.,33
207,Mr SAMPSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That opens up another phase of the question. I am not greatly impressed with the argument that is con-, stantly advanced that our importers labour under special disadvantages owing to the long distance freights which they have to bear. Ocean freights at present are extremely low, and I feel satisfied that if we were to calculate the amount of freightage required to distribute goods from Melbourne or Sydney to every other part of the Commonwealth we should find that the manufacturers in those cities have no advantage over the manufacturers of Great Britain, who are distributing their goods throughout Australia. I shall probably be met with the reply that the Melbourne manufacturer should confine the distribution of his goods to Victoria; but .1 would remind the Committee that our intention in establishing Inter-State free-trade was that manufactories indigenous to the different States should be able to distribute their goods and wares, all over the Commonwealth. Taking that fact into consideration, I fail to understand in what respect the manufacturer in Melbourne or in Sydney is in a better position in regard to the distribution of his goods over the Commonwealth than is the manufacturer in Great Britain who exports to Australia. The argument as to the natural protection enjoyed by our producers is one which if properly sifted will be found to have very little force. According to the Customs returns, the percentage of duty on confectionery under the old Tariff was about 25 per cent. The Canadian duty is equal to about 40 per cent.; the duties under the United States Tariff range from 50 to 100 per cent.; and those under the German Tariff from about 40 to 50 per cent. I think that the duty proposed by the Government is rather high, and my present intention is to support the amendment fore- shadowed by the honourable member for Fawkner, that the general duty be reduced to 3d. per lb. and that against imports from Great Britain to 2|d. per lb. The duty of 3d. per lb. would be equal to about 37 per cent., or less than those imposed on confectionery by the well-established nations to which I have referred. I hope that the Government will take into consideration the possibility of being able to meet the honourable member for Fawkner, whose proposal I shall have much pleasure in supporting.",33
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Parramatta) [2.52] - I congratulate my honourable friends in the Opposition corner on their extreme generosity and moderation. They are prepared to stretch their fiscal conscience to the extent of giving the manufacturers in Melbourne all that they have ever asked for. The Tariff Commission, having sifted their statements, recommended a duty of 2d. instead of the 3d. per lb. for which they asked. When Mr Robertson appeared before the Commission, the Chairman put to him the following questionI t has been suggested by one firm that a duty of 3d. or 4d. per lb. should be placed upon confectionery in order to remove your grievances. What do you say to that proposal? The witness repliedMy own suggestion, which has been endorsed by the Victorian Manufacturing Confectioners' Association, is that the duty should be increased to 3d. per lb. My honourable friends in the Opposition corner"" will therefore see that in the generosity of their hearts, and after analyzing the whole situation, they are falling into the position prepared for them by the Protectionist Association of Victoria.. It is evident as we proceed with the consideration of these duties that the schedule has been specially prepared for the purpose of enabling the Government to make concessions to the Committee. The statement made by the Minister and published in the Daily Telegraph on Monday last is quite correct; he expected that reductions would be made, and, in framing the schedule, provided for them. This is one of the duties which have been specially set up in order that they may again be removed by the Minister with a show of apparent generosity and fairness. All that the manufacturing confectioners of Victoria have ever asked for is a duty of 3d. per lb., and the Minister simply imposed a duty of 3fd., in order that he should be able to take off the extra f d . when pressed to do so and still reach the point for which he set out-givin g the manufacturing confectioners of Victoria the duties they want or expect. It seems that the industry has been suffering from the 1 imposition of duties on its raw materials. That is made clear by the evidence given by Mr Robertson when before the Commission.",34
209,Mr SAMPSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I understand that the duty on some of the raw materials used by confectioners has been increased by i d . per lb.,34
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"And I suppose that the honourable member will vote for that increased duty. He is about as strong a protectionist as I have met in this Chamber. So far as the policy of protection is concerned he is much stronger than the man he displaced. In our efforts to reduce the duties, we could get a little help from his predecessor, but I look in vain to the honourable member for any fiscal moderation. When before the Commission, Mr. Robertson said that his industry had developed and prospered, that his Inter-State trade had expanded, and that everything that could assist to make him a rich and prosperous manufacturing confectioner was really taking place under the old duties. All that he urged before the Commission was that he should be relieved of some of the duties on his raw materials. If that were done, he said, he would be perfectly content. He was examined by Senator Clemons as followsYour chief trouble is the cost of your raw material?-That is a very .serious infliction. Your principal difficulty arises not from the operation of a low Tariff but from that of a high Tariff ?-It cuts both ways - There is a high duty upon our raw material which did not previously exist, and a lower duty upon confectionery. Which of the two hurts you most?- I am inclined to think that it is the increased Tariff upon the raw materials. You are more concerned in obtaining a reduction of the duties at present operative than an increase of them?-The confectioners seek both a decrease upon their ,raw materials and an increase in the duty upon imported confectionery. But you chiefly seek a decrease of duty?-Of course, it is a matter of calculation; but from a superficial view I would prefer to have the duty removed from the raw material.",34
211,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,What did he say later on ?,35
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"He proceeded to give particulars about the cost of glucose. Glucose has not been increased in price. It is quite clear that Mr Robertson was prospering under the operation of the old Tariff, and all that he asked was that he should be relieved of some of the duties which were imposed upon his raw materials. If those duties were retained, he desired that the dury should be increased to 3d. per lb. 'The Government, in their generosity, propose to make it 3!3. per lb. It seems to me that Victorian manufacturers have merely to prefer a request in order to have it granted. Why should this Parliament, which represents, not only the manufacturers, but also the consumers, accept the statement of any manufacturer who chooses to come along ? We do not act in that way in connection with ordinary business bargains. So far as I am able to ascertain, we have every reason to be proud of the position which our manufacturers occupy. I only hope that they will continue to grow and prosper. Should the time ever arise when they are able to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth in the matter of confectionery, none will rejoice more than I will, so long as they supply them upon reasonable conditions. I believe that Mr Robertson conducts an establishment which is a credit to him in every way. I have tasted his confectionery, and I pronounce it to be excellent. I only hope that great prosperity will attend the efforts of those who have embarked their capital in this enterprise. But it seems to me that they have already attained a fair measure of success, and that there is no justification for piling the proposed duties upon the consumers. Statistics show that last year, in Victoria alone, there was ah increase in the number of hands employed in this industry of 248. The honourable member for Yarra stated last evening that the importations of confectionery have materially increased during the past few years. But even he had to admit that there has been a large increase facture of confectionery. The fact is that the increased importation is the best possible index to the increased prosperity of Australia.. In good seasons our importation of confectionery must necessarily increase to a greater extent than the local product, because that importation consists largely of particular brands of confectionery which have not yet attained to their proper development in the Commonwealth. Seeing that the industry is doing well-that it is prospering in every way-w e ought to let well alone, instead of imposing upon these articles higher duties, which will most assuredly be passed on to the consumer. The honourable member for Batman has ; made a statement in reference to Mr Stedman, of Sydney. It is almost a pity that the names of individuals have been mentioned during this debate. It would have been far better if the names of Mr. Robertson and Mr Stedman had been kept out of the discussion, and if we had debated this question in an impersonal way. I do not know any of these gentlemen personally, but I believe that they are men of high repute and of strict integrity. Reference-has been made to the fact that Mr. Stedman did not appear beforethe Tariff Commission to ask for an increased duty. But his absence has been explained by the honourable member for Batman, who has declared that he deputed Mr Robertson to make the request for him. Why should Mr Stedman, who is almost solely an importer of confectionery, depute Mr. Robertson, who is interested in its manufacture, to represent him before the Tariff Commission? The fact that he did so is conclusive evidence, to.my mind, that Mr Stedman is a member of the Confectionery Combine, which has now reached Inter-State proportions, and whose operations, I venture to say, will have to be investigated very shortly. Everybody knows that this Combine is spreading all over Australia, and that it not only controls the manufacture of confectionery here, but that it virtually controls the importation of chocolate as well. I think that the Treasurer ought to promise to have a strict inquiry made into the conditions surrounding - this industry. If what is alleged be true, the Confectionery Combine is already beginning to act in restraint of trade. We are told that a higher duty is required upon confectionery. Why?",35
213,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Because there is too in the local manu- much imported.,35
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member has not answered my question, but has merely put it a stage further back. Why is an increased duty required?",35
215,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Because the .industry is not sufficiently protected.,35
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"In the old days all roads were supposed to lead to Rome, and, with the honourable member, all roads 'lead to protection. Why should an - increased impost be needed? What are the ingredients which enter into the composition of confectionery? One of its constituents is milk. But I have been informed that all the milk consumed upon MACRobertson's premises is Nestles imported milk. It is really wonderful how these manufacturers prefer an imported raw product to a locally-manufactured article. Another ingredient is sugar, upon which there is a high duty, and which, therefore, according to the dictum of the Government Whip, ought to be cheap.",35
217,Mr HUME COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,But there is a combine in sugar - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Would the,36
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I find that milk, sugar, dried fruit, and paraffine all of which enter into the composition of confectionery, are dutiable today. Consequently, according to the doctrine of protectionists, these articles ought to be very much cheaper than they would be otherwise. There should be an abundance of these cheap raw products for the manufacture of confectionery in Australia. Yet Mr Robertson had to cut right across that theory when he was giving evidence before the Tariff Commission. He had to complain that, because of the duties imposed upon his raw products, they were dearer than they otherwise would have been.",36

221,Mr HUME COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Will the honourable member tell us the duty which is levied Great Britain?,36
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I have never that made any reference to the duty operating in that country. All that I have read about Cadbury's leads me to believe that its estaballeged lishments are conducted upon excellent # lines. They - do well by their employees and I should like to see more of the same spirit prevailing in Australia, as well in other parts of the world. But' drag in these names ? I . am now dealat ing with the evidence which was given before the Tariff Commission; anu the figures show that the industry flourishing and prosperous in every. way. In 1905 there were 797 hands employed in Victoria, whereas last year the number was 1,043.",36
223,Mr HUME COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Thre e times over those figures have been corrected. 1905 the number of employees was 987.,36
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is marvellous how some honourable members are able correct the figures of official statisticians who devote their lives to the work. It would appear that the figures have' to be turned' round until they express entirely what some honnrnble members desire theut to express. . The wages paid seem to be fair and reasonable; and I point out that the Australian manufacturers are competing not against cheap or pauper labour abroad, but against the best paid labour in the world.",36

226,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"X n proportion to the wages paid here, yes.",36
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If "" the same protection, which has made those people the most well-to-do in the world, were accepted for Australia, this argument would end at once. I am not sure, however, that there is such a difference between the wages paid in Australia and the wages paid elsewhere, particularly in Great Britain. I find that in Australia the average wage for apprentices, improvers and full-grown men is 30s. sd. per week; and I regard that as very fair.",36
228,Mr MALONEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,There are a lot of girls that I employed in the industry.,36
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"That average wage applies only to men and boys; the average wage for females is 13s. a week. in I have been told that the average wage paid by Cadbury is a little higher than paid in Australia, but I confess that I do not make that statement with any degree of confidence. Whether the wages to be paid by such firms as Cadbury's applies to men only, or includes ; apprentices and improvers, I am unable to say, and therefore I cannot make a comas parison with that confidence I otherwise why should feel. The average wage for men Cadbury's works is said to be 31s. per week and for females 18s. 6d. per all week; and I give the figures for what was they are worth. Only this morning we were told that in the case of another cocoa manufacturer at Home the average wage is even higher than that paid at Cadbury's factory, being for men over 18 years of age 32s. a. week. I submit that no case In has been made out for the high duties proposed. This industry was flourishing and holding its own against the confecto tionery of the world before the duties were imposed; and it should have - been allowed to continue in. its prosperous career without imposts which most assuredly are passed on to the consumer. In spite of , what the honourable member for Batman .says, prices are being increased and - oii* to the consumer, all being strictly lated by means of the Combine. I should like the Government to. investigate this, matter, and see that the operations of the the public. - Combine are legitimate and above board.

Unquestionably there exists an association, entrance ping the taking of a division. to which is governed by a severe entrance fee, and a substantial subscription in proimportant subject. portion to the amount of business done, and the interests to be protected. Combine regulates prices, and, by forcing ness. the middlemen to deal exclusively with it, causes the latter also to combine. Furnow ? ther the Combine regulates the prices charged by the retailer to the consumer, may Mr..take and, in some instances, takes away, or fixes at a lower rate, the discounts which aforebeen courting it the whole time. time were proper to the trade. All this indicates that this Combine, like all others, while entrenching itself, and getting withplanation in its grasp the whole ramifications of the retail trade, is ever seeking a little more for itself than was - considered, fair viously. That, is the point at which the Government ought to step in. Abundant thing proof was furnished last night by the honourable member for Grey that the Combine is extending its 6perations all over tralia; and that very shortly, if it now, it will have the control of the whole correct. of the industry. Now and again a manufacturer may stand out; but he is made lo suffer. I make no allegation regarding the operations of the Combine except such as have been made to me, and_ simply urge that there is a case for inquiry. If it be found that the Combine ducting its operations in any but a legitimate way, the Government ought to apply existing legislation, and if that be found not sufficient, let us. have otherlegislation, in order that restraint of - trade may not be permitted..

240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Wheneve r the Minister's statements are repeated, he denies that he made them. He made some outrageous statements in London, and then contradicted the reports when he came back. I ask him, in the interests of Australia, to investigate the charges against the Confectionery Combine. If they are untrue, the Combine should not lie under them any longer than is necessary to disprove them, while, if they are correct, stern action should be taken to repress the practices which have been spoken of. Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - I have said that proceedings of a very decisive character are on the point of being taken.",38
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I am glad to have that statement from the Minister. Would it not be better for him to make explanations now and again, when they are ' asked for, than to sit there insulting every one? It would certainly facilitate business.' In my judgment, no case has been made out for increasing these duties, and therefore I shall vote against the Government . proposals.",38
242,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Hunter) [3.34] - As we are now only at item 45, and must deal with 444 items before we can finish the Tariff, I shall make my remarks as short as possible, although I have a good deal that I should like to say, and much, no doubt, that honourable members would be glad to hear. To a certain extent, the discussion of this item has been laboured. It has been said that it is necessary for the protection of the confectionery industry to increase the duties on confectionery; but, from the statements made from all quarters, I judge that, of all industries in Australia, it least needs assistance. Mr. Robertson told the Tariff Commission that, thirteen years ago, when he employed comparatively few hands, he was not satisfied with the Tariff.",38
243,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Non e of satisfied.,38
244,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"No protectionist ever satisfied, however high the duties. Like a' child crying for the moon, he does not know what he wants, time. In those days, Mr Robertson had a protective duty of 2d., and was very ral failing. anxious to exclude the better class of confectionery, such as sells at 2s. and 3s. lb. To exclude such confectionery, he they possess any failing. wished for a duty of 4d - It has been stated in evidence, however, that much this confectionery cannot be made in tralia, and to make the duties on it very high, would be to increase the taxation of our people, and destroy the revenue by lessening importations. It would furthermore deprive poor children of what may be regarded - by .some as luxuries, though they have really become necessaries; because what we regard in the first instance as a luxury, gets to be a necessary when we have become accustomed to it. .The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will find that that remark applies to the possession of a seat in Parliament. Regarding the comparison of wages that has been made, I think that there can be little doubt but that English wages are higher than Australian wages. Furthermore, only eight hours a day are worked in England. The' chairman of Messrs. Cadbury Brothers, whose statements, I presume, can be accepted with the utmost confidence, stated some time ago that the firm's employees get through more work in eight hours than do continental workers in ten or even twelve, and that although they are paid higher wages, actually less is spent on labour. But the employees of that firm, and of other English firms, enjoy many advantages which are not granted to the operatives of Australian manufacturers. Notwithstanding that there is no protection in Great Britain, wages in this industry are higher there than they have been in Victoria, while on the Continent they are also very high.",38
245,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Why does the honourable member say that there is no protection in Great Britain?,38
246,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The protection there is not so high as is asked for by the Government here. Mr Robertson, giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, said I do not thirik that, so far as some of the Continental manufacturers are concerned, we are placed at any disadvantage, because the men who make the higher class of goods are tolerably well paidI have been Home twice, and have us is ever ascertained the wages paid. They pay £ 2 , £ 3 , £ A . and, in some cases, £ $ a week. is Although Mr Robertson, like other protectionist manufacturers, asked for protection for his industry,, he wishes to get half the his machinery in free.",38
247,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I admit that is a gene-.,38
248,Mr LIDDELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I thought that the a protectionists would not acknowledge that Mr Robertson has been forced to admit that the of prices of his wares are today higher than Austhey were, but he told the Tariff Commission that if the duties were raised he would reduce his prices. That promise was made by a number of other manufacturers, but it is very seldom fulfilled. Although the honourable member for Parramatta spoke for only twenty minutes, he said more in that time, and with more effect, than I other country. could say in three hours. I wish merely to add, in conclusion, my protest against the manner in which members have been taken round in four-horse drags various Melbourne factories.",38

263,Mr MALONEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I propose to put before the Committee a few figures which, I think, will prove of interest.

265,Mr MALONEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I am a prohibitionist, ancl am prepared to vote for prohibitioh when I have an opportunity to do so. But is the free-trader who will vote for with absolute free-trade?",39
266,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Is a manufacturer a in true protectionist when he desires his machinery to come in free of duty?,39
267,Mr MALONEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Not if that maa chinery could be manufactured here. The Government propose a duty of 3 f d . per lb. on confectionery, which is equal to a duty of £ 3 5 per ton. In Italy there is a duty of £ 4 0 per ton. On cocoa and chocolate a duty of 2 j d . , or, roughly'speaking, £ 2 1 per ton, is proposed by the Government. In Italy there is a duty of £ 5 2 per ton uoon that commodity. Cocoa beans, which are admitted free into Australia as one of the raw materials of the manufacturing confectioner, are subjected to a duty .of t £ 4 0 per ton under the Italian T a r if f ; whilst ground paste, upon which we have a duty of f d . per lb., is dutiable in Italy £ 4 0 per ton. I recognise that there is a good deal of truth in the statements made. I his believe that there is a combine in existence in relation to this industry, but I do not the blame the manufacturers for combining. a I can understand business men, who are of called upon to grant a discount of 15 per cent, in some cases, and of 5 per cent, in others, agreeing upon a fixed rate of discount, so that all their customers shall be placed on an equal footing. When we have submitted to us a Bill to deal with combines, I shall vote for it, so that we may control them, and prevent those who purchase their products from being ruined, as they might possibly be if these organizations were allowed to go untrammelled. I am not going to say that the Combine in relation to this industry is doing anything that is very unjust. I believe that some men have been bought out and paid less than they ought to have received, but I am not going to blame all the manufacturers for that sort of thing. Factory legislation now applies to the industry, and at present the employees are working under fair conditions. I do not suggest that they are as good as those prevailing in Cadbury's establishment, but I hope that they will be. Cadbury's are to be commended for the treatment of their employees. Fry's also treat their employees well, and the same may be said of Rowntree Brothers. The members of these three firms belong to the Society of Friends, but Rowntree Brothers were more loyal than were Cadbury's to the principles of their society when they received the offer of a contract to supply £30,000 worth of chocolate for the troops in South Africa. As members of a society that is opposed to war, they refused to take that offer, as they did not believe in the wicked South African war, whereas Cadbury's did not hesitate to accept it. I shall vote for the higher duty proposed by the Government, but if the honourable member for Fawkner is prepared to agree to an amendment of his amendment, so as to provide for the imposition of a duty of 3§d. per lb. on imports from foreign countries, and of 2fd. per lb. on British imports-thu s granting a preference of id. per lb. to British imports- I shall be happy to support him.",39
268,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"North Sydney) [3.54] - I wish to reply very briefly - to a statement that has been made by the honourable member for Batman. I think honourable members will agree that I am usually very careful regarding the substantial accuracy of any information that I put before the Committee, and that if at any time. I make a mistake I am perfectly willing to correct it as soon as it is pointed out to me. It is true that I said yesterday that Mr Stedman had made representations to the Tariff Commission in favourof a lower duty. The honourable member for Batman said that it was on that ground that I opposed the Government proposition.",40
269,Mr COON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I said that that was one of the grounds of the honourable member's opposition to it.,40
270,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I am opposed to the duty on the ground that, even from the protectionist point of view, it is unnecessary, and, in proof of my assertion, I pointed out that Mr Stedman had made the representations in question. The reply of the honourable member for Batman to that is that Mr Stedman favours the higher duty, - that he did not appear before the Commission, and was satisfied to ""allow Mr MACRobertson to represent the trade. That is what I understood the honourable member to say. I admit that I was wrong in thinking that Mr Stedman had made his representations to the Tariff Commission. He did not make them to that body, but to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I hold in my hand a document from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, which statesThat Australian manufacturing confectioners are by no means unanimous in desiring increased duties, three well-known msnnfacturers in New South Wales (James Stedman Ltd., leading), and one in Queensland, have petitioned the Minister of Customs against anv increase beyond an all-round duty of 2d. per lb. That is my authority for the statement which I made, and whilst I was in error in thinking, that Mr Stedman had made his representations to the Tariff Commission, I was absolutely right, so far as the effect of those representations is concerned.",40
271,Mr STORRER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Bass) [3.58] - I am prepared to support the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission in respect of this item. If the amendment be defeated, I shall move that a duty of 2^d. per lb. be imposed under the general Tariff, and that a preference of Jd. per lb. be granted to the manufacturers of the United Kingdom.  the Treasurer whether he intends to report progress ?",40
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"No .  I shall be compelled to lose my train, but nevertheless I have a duty to perform. To-day I received the following telegram from the firm of Bass and Company, SydneyManufacturing confectioners of Sydney and Newcastle commanding New South Wales trade have been holding two and more weekly meetings for past ten weeks, and under the style of New South Wales Manufacturing Confectioners' Protective Society, have combined to raise prices enormously under penalty. The increase of some leading lines was notified to the shopkeeper Monday, the twenty-first inst., by circular, and printed information is given that lists of further lines are in preparation, and will be issued in a few days. Present printed quotations of the Combine as compared wfth those in existence prior to the twenty-first instant show the following increase :-Com mon mixed lollies, from twopence three-farthings to threepence farthing. Conversations, Scotch mixtures, and peppermints from threepence and threepence halfpenny to fourpence halfpenny per pound. London mixtures from threepence farthing and threepence halfpenny to fourpence halfpenny. Jeliy jubes, threepence thTee-farthings to fivepence halfpenny. Caramels, frosted and cream, from sixpence to ninepence. Jelly beans from sixpence halfpenny to ninepence. late creams ancl mixtures from sixpence to eightpence. The writer, after thirteen years in the retail confectionery of this city, and holding two of the leading retail shops, exclusively confectionery, aggregating rentals approximating four figures per annum, was told only yesterday by the principal of a firm of over fifty years' standing in this city and a member of Combine,that while in the past the manufacturer waited on the retailer, in future the manufacturer would be master. If leading vendors are plainly told this, what about aged spinsters and widows, by whom this trade is largely conducted outside business centres? Could say a good deal more on information received first hand, but in the absence of documentary evidence desist. The accuracy of the statements which I made last night - has been challenged in some quarters. I affirmed that prices had been increased in Victoria, and in support of my allegation I quoted not twenty-five lines-as stated by the honourable member for Batman-bu t fifty-nine lines upon which an increase had taken place. These increases upon the old rates range from . £ 4 13s. per ton to ,£37 6s. 8d. per ton. It has been argued that the increases are due to the duties which have been imposed upon the raw materials of the industry, but I venture to say that protectionists will experience a great difficulty in proving that. Last evening I quoted from a letter in which the statement was made, not only that prices had been increased, but that short weights were being delivered. The accuracy of that assertion has been challenged. I have since been informed, not only that short weights have been delivered once, but that they have been delivered repeatedly even after complaints have been made by thejaarties aggrieved. The honourable member"" for Batman has declared that every box of confectionery sent out by a certain firm contains an enclosure intimating that if there is any short weight upon a box it will be made up by the manufacturer upon being informed of it. There[ ' 8 5 - 2] upon, I asked him whether it was the practice of the firm to send out a similar enclosure with every box, and he replied that it was. I then sent down to a very reputable firm in this city, and obtained two boxes of confectionery, which were opened in the presence of witnesses, who can testify that neither of them contained the enclosure to which reference has been made. If further proof of my statement is necessary I am in a position to supply it. It is generally admitted that a confectionery combine does exist. Indeed, there has been no effort to refute Choco- the statements I made last night. Not only is there a combine, but it is so effective that it almost succeeded in confining the trade to a particular State, and it has succeeded in arranging that no goods shall be sold under the price fixed by itself. The idea of the honourable member for Wimmera that under protection competition protects the consumer and the retailer is not borne out by facts. The majority of honourable members seem to concern themselves entirely with the men who are employed in the industry; but we must not forget that there are hundreds of retailers, most of them people of small means, who are equally deserving of consideration. By means' of this Combine retailers may be practically fleeced, whilst at the same time it has been arranged to pav 15 per cent, to the middlemen. The Government propose the magnificent preference to Great Britain of Jd.' out of an increased duty amounting to i j d . Of £ 1 1 6 , 0 0 0 worth of imports last year £ 9 3 , 6 7 4 worth came from the United Kingdom, as compared with only £ 1 , 0 0 0 worth from France, and £ 1 , 2 0 0 worth from Germany. The industry is in such a sound position that last year the exports were valued at £ 1 3 , 7 8 1 , and in spite of the duty of 2d. per lb. in New Ztealand,- Australian manufacturers can export to that Dominion and undersell English manufacturers. In my opinion, the proposed duty is most iniquitous, and yet not one word in justification of it have we heard from the' Treasurer. When we ask for fair play and honest trading we are'accused of supporting the foreigner; but surely no one can say that the retailers of Australia are foreigners, or that they are not just as much entitled to consideration as are the manufacturers. In the face of what has been proved in connection with this Combine, we are told that we must leave it to be dealt with under the new protection scheme. In my opinion. however, this is the time to teach the manufacturers that if they are given the advantage of high duties they must 'deal honestly with others who have as much right to live as they have. While we are waiting for the Government to introduce the new protection legislation, and, probably, to amend legislation already in existence, the retailers are left in the hands of the Combine. It is proposed that when there is clear evidence that prices are unwarrantably' increased, or that there is a combine created to take unfair advantage of the public, duties shall be reduced, and I am only asking honourable members to take that step now. If we are in earnest we have an opportunity to show the manufacturers that they will not be allowed to enter into a cold-blooded combination for the purpose of .fleecing those with whom they have to do business.  not think it better to employ 3,000 hands .in Australia than to employ' none at all? Have those employees no claim on our consideration ? Mr .POYNTON - The greater part of my life has been devoted to the protection of the working man, but I recognise that there are many others concerned besides the employees. If only the working men have to be considered here, then the sooner I know the fact the better. I take it that we are sent to Parliament to deal fairly with all concerned-no t only with employees but with consumers-and all I am asking is that we should give the retailer a fair opportunity. This Combine should have the slap in the face it deserves, and be taught a lesson. If manufacturers come to Parliament for high duties, they must' not be permitted to form themselves into combines for the purpose of robbing the public.

If we do not get more business done during the ordinary sittings next week, we shall have to meet earlier or sit later, or, perhaps, do both. I am sure that honourable members will not take umbrage at that proposal, seeing that the Government are anxious to pass the Tariff before Christmas, and that cannot be done unless we'apply ourselves be steadily to the work. Next week honourable members will the asked to sit each night until a certain amount of progress has been 3 made. 3i Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [4.24] - In regard to the facilitation' of 18 public business, I wish to suggest, in the AYES. most courteous way I can, that there might be more progress if the Minister would explain his proposals to the Committee, I do not care how shortly, and would treat honourable members with more courtesy. The Tellers : last speech to which' we listened in Committee was caused iby the action of the Minister in snapping at the honourable member who delivered it, when he asked a reasonable question. Courteous treatment will beget courteous treatment.'",42

276,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member must make his explanation in Committee of Ways and Means. He cannot now refer to what took place in the Committee.,43
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.Z6] - I cannot help feeling amused at the remarks of the deputy leader of the Opposition, because he is such a very courteous member himself, and no one can complain very much of any strong language used up to the present in these debates. I am exceptionally courteous, as the honourable member knows, and so his remarks are out of place. If at any time. I say anything which may be considered harsh, it should the remembered that I try to control myself, but it is very tiresome to sit here listening to lengthy speeches and repetitions when I am anxious to get on with business. If I were to give the explanations which the honourable member asks for, they would lead tp about four times the discussion we now have. I say as little as possible, in order to shorten the debates. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.27 p.m.",43
