2,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Russell Offices, ACT. The Russell Office complex is the administrative centre and headquarters of the Australian Defence Force. Most of the existing buildings were constructed during the 1950s and the 1960s and are not suitable for refurbishment to provide the modem office accommodation required by Defence. Under the proposed works eight of the older buildings will be demolished, four buildings will be refurnished and three new office buildings will be built. The complex is located at the third apex of the national triangle, and the proposed redevelopment includes roadworks that the National Capital Planning Authority sees as necessary to complete the triangle. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 29 March 1995, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that it proceed, subject to the following recommendations. Firstly, the redevelopment should proceed, provided the agreed amendment of the national capital plan amendment No. 12 Russell does not require changes to the design and siting of roadworks and buildings. Secondly, if the agreed amendment to the national capital plan-that is, amendment No. 12 Russell-requires changes to the proposed redevelopment, these changes will need to be considered by the committee. Thirdly, the provision of space for a senior officers suite should be reallocated for more essential services. Fourthly, the Department of Defence should proceed with the study of the impact on the staff efficiency and productivity of open office space and other forms of office accommodation as a matter of urgency. Fifthly, further value management studies should be undertaken to reduce the cost of the project. The Department of Defence agrees to all of the above recommendations and will institute measures to conform and, where appropriate, report back to the Public Works Committee. A draft amendment to the national capital plan was prepared to create sites for the new buildings proposed. It was considered by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories which reported to the parliament on 5 June 1995. The report recommends that the draft amendment be approved, subject to several recommendations. The Defence development is affected only by some of the recommendations, and Defence accepts those recommendations. It is estimated that construction for the project will commence in July of 1995 and be completed by the end of the year 2000. I would like to thank the members of the committee for their support and to commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",11
3,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a multi-level car park for the Federal Airports Corporation at Melboume Airport. Melbourne airport, the second busiest airport in Australia, is subject to continuing growth and passenger movements. As a consequence, the present short-term car park is suffering severe congestion and frequent closure. As this growth in passenger numbers is forecast to continue for the foreseeable future, it is necessary for the corporation, in order to provide an appropriate level of service to its customers, to increase the capacity of the short-term car park. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 1 June 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $55 million. In its report, the committee raised a number of issues to which the FAC has provided the  as part of its contract with the project manager for design and construction for a thorough re-evaluation of the concept design for the car park which was considered by the Public Works Committee. The re-evaluation will involve a review of a range of considerations, jncluding the location, size and performance requirements for the links between the car park and the terminal-in particular, the width of these links, which is directly related to the considerexpectations. ation of the provision of the moving walkways within them; the location of the hotel car park and future rail station locations and the interrelationships between them to ensure the final site selections represent the best planning outcome for the airport; and a design development process which includes close consultation with the airlines on all design issues, including the location and functionality of the proposed loading dock and associated service tunnel connecting the loading dock to the terminal. The pAc will also consult with the Melbourne metropolitan fire brigades on the design of the car park and, should they a-ise, refer matters which depart from the Building Code of Australia to the Building Appeals Board for dispensation. If approved, construction of the first stage of the project is expected to commence in September 1995 with completion by April 1996. A second stage will then be commenced with final completion expected in mid-1997. I would like to thank the committee for its report. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Refer-nce",11
4,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Provision of living-in accommodation at HMAS Harman, ACT. The aim of the proposal is to provide an increase in the current living-in accommodation on the base from 232 personnel to a total of 428 and to replace the existing, unsuitable and substandard accommodation for 54. This equates to a total provision of living-in accommodation for approximately 85 per cent of those entitled to live in. The 15 per cent reduction is to take account of the estimated number of those entitled to live in who will choose to live out at their own expense. The proposed accommodation will provide a level of amenity consistent with community This increase in the live-in accommodation will require a corresponding increase in messing facilities and car parking and a new gymnasium to replace current substandard facilities that are beyond their economic life and unsuitable for extension to meet the additional demand. The project will be undertaken at an estimated out turn cost of $18.3 million. It is estimated that the costs of providing the proposed living-in accommodation will be recouped in less than 10 years through savings in allowances paid to navy personnel presently unable to be accommodated atHarman. It is anticipated that construction will start in January 1996 and continue until late 1997. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gear; ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA BILL (No.2) 1995 Consideration resumed from 30 March. Second Reading",12
5,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the superannuation policy statement of 28 June 1994. In that statement, the Treasurer outlined several major initiatives to enhance the government's retirement incomes policy and to alleviate the small amounts problem. Some of the measures in the bill, such as the employee share scheme provisions, are new and largely self-contained. These have been drafted in the new tax law improvement style. Other measures in the bill either amend existing provisions of the law or interrelate with concepts already contained in other parts of the law; for example, the late lodgement penalty and interest provisions. For these reasons, it has not been possible to fully the new drafting style as this would entail changes to a much broader range of provisions. The tax law improvement project will be redrafting the tax law over the next three years. Employee share schemes The bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to provide a new income tax regime for the taxation of employee share schemes. The new regime will generally apply from 6 p.m. in the ACT-and the equivalent time elsewhere-on 28 March 1995. Transitional arrangements will apply so that, in certain circumstances, the existing provisions of the income tax law will continue to apply to shares or rights to shares acquired after the tax law. date of commencement of the amendments. The government is making these changes to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislashare tion and to ensure that the tax concessions that are available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company in which they are employed or a holding company of the employer. The measures will increase the taxation benefits available to employees under these schemes; The amount to be included in a taxpayer's assessable income in respect of the shares and rights acquired will be the difference between the value of the share or right and any amount paid by the taxpayer to acquire the share or right. Generally, the amount is to be included in assessable income in the year that the share or right is acquired. However, in certain circumstances, a deferral of taxation of up to five years without any upper limit on amount will be available. Conditions have to be satisfied before a share or right qualifies for the deferral concession. The share or right must be acquired under an employee share scheme. At the time the share or right is acquired, or at an earlier time, each permanent employee should have been entitled to acquire shares or rights of the employer or holding company of the employer. The shares or rights should be ordinary shares or rights of the employer· or holding company. The employee should also not hold more than five per cent of shares or voting rights of the adopt employer company or holding company. An exemption concession will apply for certain shares or rights that are issued to employees under a scheme operated on a nondiscriminatory basis. The employee can elect that the discount received be included in his or her assessable income in the income year in which the shares or rights are acquired. Where this electiori is made, benefits up to a limit of $500 for an income year will be exempt from tax. If the exemption concession applies, the provider of the benefit will be entitled to a tax deduction for up to $500 of benefits provided to each employee. This deduction will apply if the deduction is not allowable under the other provisions of the The bill will also amend the capital gains provisions and the fringe benefits tax law to ensure that there is no double taxation of or right benefits. The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided. Capital gains tax-rollover relief for merging superannuation funds The bill will amend the capital gains tax, CGT, provisions to allow certain superannuation funds which merge to defer any CGT gains or losses that would be realised at the time of the merger on the assets transferred. Although the government remains of the view that CGT should, in general, be payable on assets realised when entities merge, it considers that special circumstances exist that justify this concession. For example, the government recognises that the new member protection rules may put greater pressure on supera,nnuation funds to merge to improve their economies of operation. It also realises that current CGT rules may affect the short-term liquidity of such superannuation funds. This temporary relief will improve the efficiency and performance of the industry. The amendments will apply to superannuation funds that merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 July 1997. The notional cost to the revenue from the proposal is estimated to be $50 million for each of the three years of its operation. The actual cost to the revenue will be less because many funds would not merge if rollover relief was not available. Superannuation guarantee-jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission The bill clarifies the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, AIRC. It is generally accepted that the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation has not affected the jurisdiction, powers or functions of the AIRC. However, there is no express statement in the superannuation guarantee legislation or the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to this effect. For this reason, and because there has been doubt expressed in some quarters concerning the power of the AIRC to continue to arbitrate on superannuation, the amendment makes it clear that the superannuation'. lation does not alter in any way the substantive jurisdiction, functions and powers of the AIRC. The amendment will apply from the commencement of the superannuation guarantee law on 1 July 1992. The amendment has no impact on the revenue. Superannuation guarantee-flat dollar contributions The bill also amends'the superannuation guarantee law to ensure that the percentage level of superannuation support actually provided for an employee for flat dollar contributions is calculated based on actual contributions, rather than the amount specified in the award. The current provision causes problems where contributions differ from the award amount. The effect of the amendment will be to make it easier for some employers to satisfy their superannuation guarantee requirements. The amendments will take effect from 1 July 1994. There is no cost to the revenue from the change. Superannuation guarantee-local government councillors The bill proposes to generally exempt from the superannuation guarantee law the payments received by local government councillors in the course of their duties. The paymerits will not be regarded as salary and wages for superannuation guarantee purposes, enabling councillors to claim deductions under the income tax legislation for any personal superannuation contributions. The exemption will not apply to payments from certain local government bodies. Local government councillors will retain their status as employees for the purposes of the superannuation industry supervisory legislation to prevent some funds which have councillors as members from being treated as public offer funds, which entails higher compliance costs. The amendments will apply from 1 July 1993. Cost to the revenue in the 1994-95 and subsequent years will be less than $500,000 per annum. Superannuation-various amendments to guarantee legisthe income tax law Following the Security in Retirement statement of 30 June 1992, the government has introduced a number of changes to the income tax law to encourage superannuation pensions and annuities, and to ensure that superaimuation moneys are kept within the superannuation system until withdrawal. This bill makes some minor adjustments to some of these changes to clarify their operation and further ease administrative requirements. In addition, the bill changes the income tax law to ensure that superannuation pension and rollover annuity recipients who started receiving a pension or annuity before 1 July 1994 will be able to change providers without losing tax concessions. This change will allow pensioners and annuitants to move their investment without being disadvantaged by a different tax treatment. The bill also amends the income tax law to ensure that tax concessions for employer superannuation contributions are restricted to superannuation funds established primarily for the benefit of employees. The amendments are not expected to have any significant impact on the revenue. Superannuation-miscellaneous amendments The bill also makes a small number of miscellaneous amendments to superannuation law administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The two main amendments allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to undertake statistical surveys of the superannuation industry and change the method of collection of the superannuation supervisory levy. As a result, the manner in which the late payment penalty for the levy is calculated is also changed. The bill also makes some other more technical amendments. No overall impact on revenue is expected to result from these amendments. State and territory bodies Amendments in the bill will create broad new exemptions ""from income tax and sales tax for certain state and territory bodies. These amendments arise from an agreement reached at the 1994 Premiers Conference, which aims to promote efficiency and competitive neutrality in markets in which state and territory trading enterprises operate. One aspect of this is removing the tax advantage enjoyed by state and territory trading enterprises over private businesses. It was agreed that the tax advantage could be eliminated if the states and territories imposed tax equivalent regimes on their trading enterprises. A tax equivalent regime is basically equivalent to Commonwealth income tax and sales tax in its principles and the rates imposed. Before tax equivalent regimes are introduced, the states and territories need to be certain that their trading enterprises will be exempt from Commonwealth income tax and sales tax. Certain state and territory bodies will, therefore, be made clearly exempt. Some bodies will be specifically excluded from the exemption, including bodies prescribed by regulations. These amendments will not change the tax status of many of these bodies. For the 199495 year, the bodies which were taxable at the time of the 1994 Premiers Conference will remain taxable. These bcidies will in most cases become exempt from 1 July 1995. The amendments are expected to be revenue neutral. Late lodgement penalty The bill introduces a new penalty regime for late lodgement of income tax returns. The. penalties will apply to 1994-95 and later year returns where the due date for lodgement occurs after the later of 30 June 1995 or 60 days after the date of royal assent of the bill. Companies, superannuation funds and certain trusts will be liable for a flat rate penalty of $25 for each week that a return remains outstanding up to a maximum of $500. All other taxpayers who are late in lodging an income tax return will be liable for additional tax of eight per cent per annum on the amount of net tax payable for the year of income. In addition, they will also be liable for interest on the net tax payable at the same rate that applies to underpayments and late payments of income tax. That interest rate is currently 10.8 per cent per annum. The additional tax and interest will be calculated from the due date for lodgement until the return is lodged. A reliable estimate of the impact on the revenue cannot be provided. Refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error The bill will also amend the income tax law in a number of respects to ease compliance costs encountered by investment bodies when they are required to refund tax incorrectly deducted by them because of a mistake concerning an investor's tax file number. One amendment limits the refunds to be made by investment bodies to requests for refunds received on or before 15 July following the year of income in which the incorrect deduction of tax file number amounts occurred. This will reduce investment body tax compliance costs associated with refunds that they are presently required to make in respect of amounts deducted in earlier years. Any incorrectly deducted amounts not refunded by the investment body within the 15 July time frame would normally be allowed as a credit to the investor upon assessment of the investor's tax return for the relevant income year. However, where it is not reasonably appropriate for an investor to wait until an assessment has been issued, the Commissioner of Taxation will be required to make refunds directly to an investor. This will ensure that an avenue for a refund is always available to an investor. A further amendment will provide for investment bodies to choose to offset any amounts that they refund against other amounts they deduct during the same year. This will also reduce compliance costs for investment bodies. These amendments will have no impact on the revenue. Pensions, allowances and benefits When the mature age partner allowance was introduced, it was exempted from income tax. This is inconsistent with the treatment of the mature age allowance which is taxable. The bill ensures that, as from 1 July 1995, the mature age partner allowance will be taxable. Recipients of the allowance will generally be eligible for the pensioner rebate, which will offset the tax on the allowance subject to any other income received. The financial impact of this measure is a negligible gain to the revenue. The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments of tax provisions related to social welfare matters which have no impact on the revenue. Sales tax-new credit ground for unregistered exemption users Under the existing sales tax law, an assessable dealing is taxable unless an exemption applies. An exemption applies when a quotation is made or the goods in question are always exempt goods. The law requires that a quote for a dealing be made at or before the time of the dealing for it to be effective. If a person does not quote for a taxable dealing, then the dealing is taxable. A credit ground currently exists to enable a registered person to obtain a credit of tax paid on a dealing for which they had borne tax even though they were entitled to quote a registration number. The bill proposes to insert a similar credit ground to enable unregistered persons to obtain a credit of tax paid on a dealing for which they had borne tax even though they were entitled to quote an exemption declaration. The effect of this amendment on the revenue will be negligible. Sales tax-exemption for UHF transmitters The bill proposes a limited extension to the operation of an earlier exemption from sales tax for certain UHF transmitters for use in commercial television broadcasting to cover the period 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1995. The new exemption will apply to transmitters for use in connection with the equalisation program which aims to provide services in regional areas comparable to those in capital cities. The government considers that the extension is appropriate because the equalisation program is not yet completed in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, and it would be inequitable to deny licensees in those states the benefit of the incentive which had been available to eastern mainland licensees. The total cost to the revenue for the period of the exemption is likely to be about $2 million. Minor amendments The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments which have no impact on the revenue. I also foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments in the House to the provisions relating to employee share schemes and state and territory bodies. Copies of the amendments and supplementary explanatory memorandum have been circulated to members. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.",13
6,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) is an omnibus tax bill dealing with tax exemptions for state and territory bodies, employee share acquisition schemes, refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error, pensions, allowances and benefits, superannuation measures, late lodgement penalties and sales tax. The most substantive changes in this bill are contained in schedule 2, which deals with the tax treatment of employee share acquisition schemes. This is the government's third attempt in 13 months to change the tax rules on employee share acquisition schemes. The approach taken by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and his office on this matter could only be described as bloody-minded and intransigent. It has been part of a continuing pattern to restrict and marginalise employee share acquisition schemes. In commending the bill to the House, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in relation to these measures: 'The nature of these measures is such that a reliable esiimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided.' The government cannot say it is doing this to raise revenue or, if it is defeated, that it will revenue. The government says itself that it cannot give any estimate of the revenue impact. Probably closer to the truth is the fact that the government cannot estimate the revenue implications because this is not so much designed at revenue; it is designed to have the effect of restricting or wiping out employee share acquisition schemes. If that be its effect, there would be no revenue implications as a result. When it was clear to everybody that the Treasurer's plan to bring employee share ownership plans into the net of fringe benefits was atrocious and would effectively destroy the operation of all existing schemes, the Treasurer carried on regardless, not listening to anyone, steadfastly ignoring industry concerns, and seeking to push ahead with his plan, under cover and with all sorts of outlandish claims. The Treasurer and his office even ignored warnings and advice coming from their own department. In a particularly poor display, the Treasurer .lashed out at his critics as supporters of tax avoidance. That has never been the case. If there is any rorting going on under the current system I make it clear, and those companies which support our stand on this matter make it clear, that it should be identified and such amendments undertaken as would prevent it. The Treasurer was finally forced to concede at the end of March this year that his plan to impose fringe benefits tax on employee share acquisition schemes was ill-conceived and ill considered. He was forced into a humiliating backdown. He had to admit that he was wrong, that the charges that he had levelled against his critics were wrong, that they were right, and that his charges had been nothing more than an attempt to cover up a major policy bungle. So has he got it right the third time with the proposals that have been brought back to this House for debate today? The answer is a resounding no. Wrong the first time, wrong the second time, wrong the third time. Three strikes and you are out. We the coalition will vote against that part of the bill. The government could have amended section 26AAC, taking out the flaws, but it cost has chosen to introduce a new regime with onerous features designed, one can only surmise, to make employee share acquisition schemes less attractive and less available to the Australian work force. The government's legislation threatens the viability of current schemes and restricts the potential for further expansion of employee share ownership in Australia. Last year we had the quite amazing spectacle of the Treasurer asserting a massive conspiracy and growth industry of evasion in respect of employee share ownership plans. That, he said, was the rationale behind the FBT plan. But when it came to the cold hard facts the government has unable to produce any evidence to substantiate these charges. The Treasurer failed to identify the alleged problem which he was trying to counter. I give this undertaking to the government: the coalition will support any amendments to current section 26AAC to prevent any rorting that can be identified; however, we will oppose the implementation of provisions covering employee share ownership plans as contained in this bill. We will vote against them. We call on Independents and fair minded parties in the Senate not just to support us but to support those companies that have taken the step to distribute shares to employees and, even more importantly, to support those employees who have taken up shares in companies that they work for and that they want to invest in not only with their time and their labour but also with their financial security. We recognise that existing provisions in section 26AAC could be improved, but this legislation goes way beyond addressing any flaws. By acting to retain the existing law, the coalition will secure the existence of plans currently in force. In government we will iron out the flaws but we will iron them out in the context of expanding employee share ownership in this country-not in the niggardly way of the Treasurer of trying to restrict it. The Treasurer has merely replaced his FBT mess with an income tax disaster. There may be no FBT but the government seeks to impose a complex set of income tax rules. The bill seeks to replace one section in the Income Tax Assessment Act with 40 new sections. The coalition will once again stand up and defend employee share ownership schemes, which are under attack by this Labor government, and assist and encourage the hundreds of thousands of employees who want a stake in corporate Australia. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the tax discount under this proposal are far too tight. They mean that many plans would have to be substantially modified to take advantage of them. Overseas and international share plans cannot be quickly modified to meet Australian requirements when they are operating on an international basis. It is far more likely that they will be modified to exclude Australian employees rather than amended to include them and have an effect on employees in each and every other country in which they operate. The tax treatment of share options is still a complete disaster. The taxing of options is inequitable and harsh. It taxes a potential gain that may never be realised. This is contrary to the general principle that income is taxable only on realisation. No allowance or concession is provided for employees participating in schemes operated by foreign parent .companies, where options may be issued with a maximum exercise period of 10 years. Employees in Australia would be forced to pay tax either up-front or five years after acquisition. The five-year minimum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with a tax liability to be met most probably by selling options in that case for the benefit of paying the tax accrued. The Treasurer's flawed proposal will discourage employers, especially international companies, from offering employee share plans to their Australian employees. In a joint submission to the Treasurer the American Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council of Australia, the Corporate Tax Association, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of CPAs said, if this proposal were enacted in its current form, they expected many international companies would cease offering participation in their share plans to Australian employees. This legislation contains a very limited right to refund of tax paid on acquiring rights. It provides no entitlement to a refund of tax paid where the option lapses owing to a variety of circumstances, including the non-fulfilment of performance in length of service conditions or where the option is not exercised because the market value of the share has fallen below the option exercise price. The valuation rules contained in the legis lationare complex and unrealistic. The valuation of options is yet another minefield contained in this legislation. It is quite unreasonable to ignore restrictions in conditions when valuing options. In government, the coalition will address such flaws as exist in the current scheme and introduce a new scheme designed not to discourage but to encourage wider employee share ownership. We will seek to promote and enhance the growth of employee share ownership plans and let them flourish right across the work force. These schemes have an important part to play in lifting workplace productivity and raising international competitiveness. The coalition wants employees to have the opportunity to take a stake in the businesses which employ them. We want to see as many employees as possible owning shares through employee share schemes. Through these schemes we can promote greater industrial harmony. This is one vehicle which can be used to break down the barriers between management and employees, to break down the division which has been created through a complex and legalistic industrial relations system. It is this Labor government which stands in the way of a new enterprise culture and consensus emerging within the Australian work force through the widespread promotion of employee share ownership schemes The level of private share ownership in Australia is still far too low. Although the level has risen in recent years, it is still below that of the United States and the United Kingdom. Promotion of employee share ownership has a critical role to play in raising Australia's scarce level of national savings. The coalition will increase participation in employee share schemes by opening up access to the discount available to employees in such plans by giving them fair treatment and allowing them to qualify. We plan to expand employee share ownership as part of our policy on national savings. As I said before, this matter has been on the books now for 13 months. This is the third strike, the third failure, that has come from this government. But corporate Australia, those that already offer employee share plans, those that already have employees joining together in their companies with common stakes in its financial productivity and its financial success, has been watching this very carefully. I have received a myriad of letters over the last couple of days from companies protesting this government's stand and supporting the coalition in its efforts to promote employee share ownership. A letter from Cadbury Schweppes stated: ""The Coalition's decision to oppose the proposed amendments is wholeheartedly welcomed by this company ... It is our view that employees will participate in share plans because they believe they will increase their wealth ... We applaud the Coalition's opposition to this Bill."" The Lend Lease Corporation stated in a letter: As major practitioners of employee share ownership in Australia we support the position outlined in your Press Release of 20 June 1995. It is referring to my press release. Ernst and Young went on to state: On behalf of the following organisations: - The American Chamber of Commerce in Australia - The Business Council of Australia - The Taxation Institute of Australia - The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia - The Australian Society of CPA's - Ernst and Young I confirm the support of those organisations for the Coalition position that Section 26AAC should be reinstated subject to the introduction of appropriate safeguards to protect the revenue. The letter sent from Coles Myer stated: ... the position of Coles Myer Ltd. is that it has a clear preference for the retention of the present Section 26AAC over the proposals contained in the Government's current draft bill. Finally, BHP stated in a letter: BHP is only too happy to see any of the supposed tax avoidance schemes addressed through existing or new legislation, but agrees completely with you that the present proposal has consequences far beyond this objective. Thank you for your support. These are all companies that are currently operating employee share schemes and this is legislation which threatens the viability of such schemes. It is not just the companies. The government should not sit there and think to itself, 'This is just the companies' position.' This is the position of the employees of those companies. That is whom we are talking about here: the employees of those companies that have been given a stake in those companies through employee share ownership plans, and they want to continue on with it. It is good for them, it is good for the company, it is good for savings and it is good for Australia. The only person who seems to want to cut all of that out is the Treasurer. even say what the revenue implications of his proposal are. This is a thoroughly misguided and ill-conceived proposition. It is one should be rejected in this House. It is one we will vote against. If we cannot defeat it this House, we call on fair-minded parties the Senate to support us and defeat it in House. There are some other matters contained this bill and I will traverse through them indicate the position the coalition relation to them. Schedule 1 of this bill amends the income and sales tax laws to exempt wholly owned state and territory bodies from income tax and sales tax, except for certain specified bodies in accordance the agreement reached at the 1994 Premiers Conference for equivalent state regimes to introduced. Many state and territory covered by these amendments are already exempt and the aim of the amendments is to clarify the existing law. Municipal corporations and other local government bodies, public education instituJuly tions and public hospitals are to. be excluded because they are not intended to be subject tax equivalent regimes. State government insurance offices are also excluded and will continue to be taxed only on their ance and superannuation business. Other bodies may also be excluded by agreement between the· states and the Commonwealth. The income tax exemption will apply from and including. the 1994-95 year of income. The sales tax exemption will apply to dealing ings occurring on or after 1 July 1994. coalition supports rationalisation of this area. Schedule 3 of the bill will limit refunds investment bodies of tax file number amounts which have been deducted in error to amounts deducted in the current financial year only. Claims for refunds will have to be made 15 July in the financial year following the error. This proposal is intended to reduce costs incurred by investment bodies where amounts are incorrectly deducted. Where claim is not made in time, the investor will entitled to a credit on assessment for the amount incorrectly deducted. However, the tax commissioner will be able to give direct He cannot refunds in appropriate areas. Currently, investment bodies must deduct a . prescribed amount, unless an investor has that quoted a tax file number, and remit the that amount to the commissioner. Where the body in has deducted an amount in error and remitted in it, the body must always refund the amount that to the investor and recover the amount from the commissioner. Investors are currently not in entitled to obtain a credit on assessment for to the amounts. The coalition does not oppose takes in these amendments. Schedule 3 of the bill removes the income tax exemption for the mature partner allowance. Only the supplementary amounts are to be exempt. The allowance was inadvertently with exempted from tax and it was the government's intention that the allowance be be taxable. We recognise that intention and do bodies not oppose the amendment. The bill will also amend the capital gains provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow certain superannuation funds which merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 1997 to roll over any accrued capital gains and losses that would be realised on the to assets transferred as a result of the merger. These amendments implement the decision announced last year by the Treasurer in his life insurstatement on superannuation. The amendments will allow the trustee of a transferor fund that merges on or after 1 July 1994 to roll over any capital gains or losses that would be realised as a result of a merger where: the merging funds are qualifyfunds; the transferor fund is in existence The on 1 July 1994; the disposal of the asset occurs under a merger between the transferor by and transferee; the transferor and transferee elect that capital gains rollover relief will apply to all the assets transferred under the merger; and the transferor keeps the election by and gives a copy to the transferee. The government's capital gains tax rollover relief for merging superannuation funds has been criticised for a number of reasons. To a begin with, the government fails to extend be relief to small super funds. The government's legislation specifically excludes super funds with fewer than five members. As a result, about 90 to 95 per cent of superannuation funds are excluded funds and are not eligible for rollover relief. The proposal also only applies when a merger takes place in a year. It is not always possible to plan and carry out a merger within the confines of a year. The proposal also prevents the transfer of realised capital losses from a fund closing down. This will penalise transferring members who will never be able to utilise capital losses quarantined in old superannuation funds. The amendments will not offer small funds, which make up the majority of super funds, any tax relief for merging with larger funds. It is for this reason that the coalition will move amendments to extend the application of the capital gains tax rollover relief to with fewer than five members. The coalition also believes that the capital gains tax rollover relief should not be restricted to the three-year period announced by the government. For this reason, we will move to extend this period. The bill also makes amendments to the taxation arrangements for superannuation pensions and rollover annuities. The bill clarifies the start date of pensions and annuities. The deductible amount of a life time superannuation pension or annuity will be calculated based on life expectancy at the beginning of the period in respect of which the pension or annuity is payable. As the deductible amount is the undeducted purchase price of the pension or annuity divided by the term the pension is expected to be payable, the commencement date of pensions and annuities is vitally important. The bill will ensure that the undeducted purchase price. which applies to pensions and annuities purchased prior to 1 July 1994 will also apply to pensions and annuities wholly purchased with an eligible termination payment representing the commutation or residual capital value of a pension or annuity that commenced prior to 1 July 1994. The coalition supports this measure. The bill will also make changes to disability superannuation pensions. The amendments contained in this bill will ensure that taxpayers, in receipt of a disability pension prior to 1 July 1994 will retain their entitlement to a rebate. The definition of death or disability annuity pension will be replaced by a new definition. The coalition . does not oppose these measures. The bill will also restrict deductions for employer superannuation contributions to contributions made to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an eligible employee, whether or not the benefits are payable to a dependant of the employee in the event of the employee's death. This will ensure that a deduction is not available to an employer for contributions to a superannuation fund established directly for the benefit of a spouse or any other dependant of the employee. The bill will also ensure that a taxpayer who received an eligible termination payment funds between 1 April 1994 and 30 June 1994 will have 90 days, or such longer period as the Commissioner of Taxation allows, to roll over the eligible termination payment. This amendment has been made necessary because past amendments have resulted in superannuants who received an eligible termination payment between those dates being denied access to both the 90-day rollover and the facility to retain moneys while they decide how to invest their entitlement. This is one of the failings of the government's confused approach to superannuation. We support efforts to correct the government's failings in this area. This bill will also make various amendments to the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The bill will make it clear that the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the ambit of superannuation is unaffected by the enactment of the superannuation guarantee legislation. The bill will also ensure that the actual percentage level of superannuation support provided for an employee for flat dollar contributions is calculated on the actual contributions paid by the employer. The bill will also amend the super guarantee legislation to generally exempt the income which elected local government councillors derive in the conduct of their duties as councillors. The bill will insert new definitions of employee and employer in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to overcome unintended consequences resulting from the exclusion of councillors from the superannuation guarantee legislation. The coalition has strongly criticised the government for the application of the superanpay nuation guarantee charge legislation to local government councillors. It has taken far too long for the government to act to rectify this situation. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended this change back in June 1992. In September 1993, Senator Ian Macdonald, a coalition senator from Queensland, introduced a private member's bill with the same objectives, which passed through the Senate. Of course, there has been benign neglect by the government in the House of Representatives until this time. The government's amendment will apply only to assessments back to 1 July 1993, whereas the superannuation guarantee regime commenced on 1 July 1992. It is for this reason that we will move to amend these provisions to ensure they apply from 1 July 1992. This bill will also make a number of miscellaneous amendments in respect of superannuation. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be able to undertake statistical surveys. The bill will ensure that trustees or investment managers of an excluded fund will not be preciuded from taking advantage of the exception to the rule in section 66(2) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act prohibiting acquisition of a member's assets relating to 'exempt business real property' simply because the member's business is established in company form and not as a sole trader or partnership. The bill will allow the financial backing requirements imposed on approved trustees and custodians to be met by having an approved guarantee and net tangible assets which together amount to at least the prescribed amount, which is currently $5 million. The coalition will not oppose any of these changes. The bill will also introduce a new regime penalties for late lodgement of income tax returns. Two different late lodgement penalty systems apply, depending on the category of the taxpayer. The coalition is concerned about the imposition of late lodgement penalties on relevant entities and instalment taxpayers, including super funds and companies, irrespective of the size of the tax liability. In other words, it does not matter whether they $1 million tax or have a tax loss. The bill does not seek to impose late lodgement penalties on individuals when no tax is payable. For this reason the coalition will move amendments which remove the application of late lodgement penalties on companies and superannuation funds where no tax is payable. In addition, we will move an amendment which will defer the commencement of the late lodgement penalty scheme for instalment taxpayers and relevant entities to the 1995-96 income year. Companies and superannuation funds are just coming to grips with the new company tax payment regime which commenced for small and medium companies and superannuation funds this financial year. The new regime will commence for large companies next financial year. The government has now also hit companies with a higher company tax rate of 36 per cent, which is in breach of its election promises. There was an uproar by accountants and tax agents concerning the lodgement return dates for small companies this year. We will give small companies a break by deferring the commencement of this extra penalty regime by our amendment to a time when the lodgement dates of returns in the new instalment regime should be settled. The bill will amend the sales tax regime to extend the operation of an earlier exemption for certain UHF transmitters, which the coalition does not oppose. Finally, the bill also inserts a new credit ground so that unregistered persons can claim refunds of sales tax they have borne on an assessable dealing, even though they were entitled to quote an exemption declaration. Theseproposals were originally put forward by Senator John Watson, a Liberal senator from Tasmania. He put these proposals of forward in the Senate in the form of a private member's bill in order to pick up these anomalies. Again, the government sat on its hands. It has taken quite some time for it to come around and recognise the necessity of these proposals. I am not sure that these proposals are as good as those of Senator Watson, but we know that government ministers do not have the same attentiveness to the tax act as has Senator Watson. But this is a recognition of his proposals which were supported by the coalition. I have gone through some of the areas in which the coalition will seek to improve this legislation, but let me make it clear: we will seek to stop misconceived legislation which has the effect of undermining savings and good industrial relations, which has the effect of making life difficult for employers and employees to share in productivity together, and which has the effect of restricting employee share schemes. We in the coalition draw the line. It is one of the great differences between us and the government. We will vote against those proposals in this bill.",17
7,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995, as has already been pointed out, is an omnibus taxation bill containing some very important amendments and proposals. These affect employee share schemes, new lodgement penalties, superannuation and capital gains tax roll-overs for merging superannuation funds. The bill sets out to amend seven acts; including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. In all 14 measures are dealt with by this bill. I intend to deal with only some of them. Most notably, I intend, as did my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), to focus on the proposals relating to employee share schemes. The tax treatment of employee share schemes was debated in this place last November while we were considering the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994. It was then that Labor first tried to strangle the operation of employee share acquisition schemes. Labor tried to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to impose FBT on employee share benefits which arise when an employee acquires shares or rights to shares for an amount less than the market value. The premise on which the government decided to impose FBT on employee share acquisition schemes, which are known as ESAS, was the same as is now being offered. The government claims there is a potential and a likelihood that ESAS will be abused by employees and employers as a means of providing increased remuneration by non-PAYE means. Its reasoning is that this would have the potential of corrupting the tax base. To date, the fears of the government seem to be without foundation. There is no evidence of widespread abuse of these schemes. The government has consistently failed to justify why changes are needed. Nor has the government quantified the extent of the alleged rorting and where it is occurring. We simply do not know. The big problem with Labor's heavy-handed approach now, as it was then, is that it will destroy ESAS. Last year after the government tried to implement its changes, several companies froze their schemes. Some wound up existing schemes and others merely held off putting schemes in place. This bill is just another instalment which will continue to send out the wrong signals to companies and prospective employee shareholders. The measures in the bill tackle the government's illusory problem in a different way while trying to preserve the approach of the current law. However, with this measure the government has shown itself yet again to be overly heavyhanded. As the law now stands, section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act taxes benefits arising from shares or rights to acquire shares-which, for ease of speech in subsequent remarks, I will refer to as 'rights'-underan employee share acquisition scheme. Shares or rights are acquired in a company under an ESAS if the shares or rights are a consequence of employment or services rendered by the taxpayer or a relative. The shares or rights acquired may be in the employing company or another company. If the shares are subject to restrictions or conditions so that the right of the taxpayer to dispose of the shares is restricted or the employee can be divested of ownership, then the employee is automatically taxed on the discount in the year when the restrictions or conditions are lifted. But the taxpayer can elect to be taxed in the year that the shares or rights are acquired. If the shares are not subject to· such conditions, the employee is taxed in the year that the shares or rights are acquired. Rights are not normally taxed until they are sold or exercised but the taxpayer can, in these proposals, elect to be taxed when the rights are acquired. There is a limited exemption of up to $200 per year for discounts on shares or rights acquired by employees for which certain conditions must be met before the exemption can be applied. The bill replaces section 26AAC with a new division 13A which provides for the taxation of shares or rights provided to employees under ESAS. In the hands of the employee the shares or rights are subject to income tax. Income tax can, nevertheless, be deferred for up to five years in certain circumstances. There is no limit on how much tax can be deferred. Where the shares are not subject to tax when acquired, the point at which the shares will be subject to tax is when the employee sells the shares, when the employee ceases to be employed by the employer company or holding company, and five years after the time the shares were provided to the employee. An income tax exemption on qualifying ESAS shares or rights up to a value of $500 per employee per year will be available in the year of income in which the shares or rights are acquired, provided stringent requirements are met. An employee will only be eligible for the exemption if he or she makes an election to be taxed at the time of acquisition on all shares and rights acquired in that year. The effect of an election is that no further tax is payable under the division, and the shares or rights will then be subject to general provisions of the income tax legislation, including capital gains tax law. A employee cannot benefit from both the tax exemption and the tax deferral. In general, a tax deduction to the employer will only be available for the provision of ESAS shares or rights where a deduction is available under the general provisions of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, or where the shares or rights· are provided under the $500 concession arrangements. A employee is entitled to a refund of income tax already paid where the employee loses the rights without ever having the power to exercise them. The capital gains tax provisions will be amended to ensure that there is no double taxation and that the advantage gained by concessions for qualifying shares or rights will not be clawed back. Proposed division 13A will apply to shares or rights acquired under employee share schemes after 6 p.m. on 28 March 1995-not 10 May 1994, which is when the original proposal was announced. However, under compulsory transitional rules the existing provisions of 26AAC will continue to apply to some share rights. The proposed scheme has some improvements over the current scheme. By way of example, it restricts employee share schemes to those where the shares are issued in the employer or holding company of the employer. It also lifts the non-taxable discount from $200 to $500 but it is subject to more onerous conditions. As well, it prevents the capital gains tax clawing back the non-taxable discount. The flip side of the coin is that the proposed scheme has the following disadvantages compared with what currently applies: the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised; the five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability; the qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are far too tight; there is no refund of the tax paid on options that lapse; the valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options; and most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up front. Employee share acquisition schemes would be more successful in terms of the number of participants if they allowed a bigger discount; widened the qualifying conditions to allow access to the discount; allowed the issue of shares other than ordinary shares-not redeemable preference or partly paid, but perhaps shares with restricted or non-voting rights; provided the capacity to recover tax paid when options lapse; and allowed a deduction for loss incurred on disposal, although this may have to be subject to restrictions. Employee share acquisition schemes are very important for several reasons, including the fact that they give workers a stake in their workplace, provide a means of creating a fairer society and build the level of national savings. Labor and the coalition come at this issue from entirely different perspectives. ESAS schemes have long been encouraged by the coalition, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out, and have faced their stiffest resistance from sections of the Labor movement. This resistance has come from both the trade unions and the Labor Party. For the trade unions, it has traditionally been important to them to maintain the distinctions between capital and labour. It was not-and still is not, according to somedesirable for workers to gain shares in the company which employs them, because to do so would erode the unity of the labour movement in the face of the influence of capital.",23
8,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,That's an old hat view.,25
9,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Such a point of view, however, is largely outdated-it is probable that not even the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) holds that view; but I would not mind seeing some of his past writingsand is something more appropriate to the 19th century.",25
10,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I've never held that view.,25
11,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Well, you are one of the few on your side-particularly in your faction-who has not. ESAS is important to our longer term economic growth and, increased levels of productivity. ESAS is also an industrial relations issue that helps draw workers and management together. In firms where workers are also shareholders in the firm, the workers have a greater work ethic which is related to their desire to see the firm in which they have a stake do well. It is in the interests of the workers to increase profitability. The very notion of ESAS puts the fear of God into the hearts of some of Labor's mates in the trade unions. Many unions fear ESAS because employees who own shares lose their 'them and us' mentality and, therefore, lose the desire to engage in petty and bloodyminded industrial action. This is possibly an unintended consequence of imposing the fringe benefits tax on ESAS-an unintended consequence which Labor is quite happy to live with and which will be lauded by its union mates. Not only does ESAS provide employees with an: increased stake in the future of their company, but such schemes also give workers a greater stake in their community and in their society. A work force of small shareholders will do a great deal for improving the lot of this country. A nation of shareholders will make society less unequal. and will improve the commitment of Australians to our democratic and capitalist system. Instead, we have a scenario, under Labor where the rich are getting richer, mainstream Australians are deprived of opportunity and the poor are increasingly locked into a welfare induce,d poverty cycle in far too many cases. This does nothing but alienate an increasing number of people. This is a government which claims to be inclusive. It is actually a government which only pays lip-service to social justice. The reality is that it is a government which pursues exclusivist policies. If Labor wanted a society with a harmonious social structure it would be encouraging share ownership, not discouraging it with measures such as this. In terms of increasing the level of national saving, Dr FitzGerald, in his report to the present government, estimated that ESAS could raise national savings by half of one per cent of gross domestic product, or around $2 billion in today's dollars, and increase annual tax revenues permanently by more than $500 million in today's dollars by the end of the decade. We all pay lip-service to increasing national saving, yet the government's approach is based solely on increasing the amount of money going into superannuation, when it could do much more to encourage further savings by inclusive policies. This entire ESAS debacle is illustrative of a pedestrian Treasury, which cannot see the forest for the trees; or, more probably, it Labor which restricts the Treasury from putting forward the best approach. After all, we all know the Treasury boffins were advomost cating widespread tax reform in the 1980s, including a broad based consumption tax. It is no wonder, I guess, that we have a ridicucontroversial lously complex tax system, with compliance costs only lower than those in the USA, and share schemes. continuous legislative changes to the tax laws which have made those very same laws government's unfathomable. The bill introduces a new regime of penalThe ties for late lodgement of income tax returns. Two different late lodgement penalty systems apply, depending on the category of taxpayer. For companies, superannuation funds, apthe proved deposit funds, pooled superannuation funds and some trusts, currently a flat penalty system applies. This is applied at the rate of of issues. $25 per week for the period that a return is late, with a maximum of $500. But it takes account of the level of tax payable, in that, even if no tax is payable or a loss is incurred, the return nevertheless qualifies for a penalty. The Commissioner of Taxation has the discretion to remit the late lodgement penalty, but there is no reason for anyone to feel comforted or rely on that. This bill amends those late payment penalties so that there be a penalty tax at eight per cent per annum and penalty interest at the statutory rate-for the period January 1995 to June 1995-of that track. 10.8 per cent, which will be calculated on a daily basis from the date tax becomes due and payable. The imposition of penalties for late lodgWe ment of returns when no tax is payable is seen by most observers as merely a revenue raiser. It should be dropped or, at the very least, deferred. Such measures do nothing to inspire confidence in the small business community. Companies with no tax bill which have not lodged returns or are late with returns should not be penalised. It is for reason that the coalition will be moving amendments to this measure. Small business does not need, nor can it afford, this extra impost.",25
12,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill first is (No.2) does a number of things. I am sure that the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), went into detail on of them in his response. The bill amends a number of pieces of legislation, but my interest in this matter, and indeed the most part of the bill before us, is the government's attempt to regulate employee As has already been pointed out, this is the latest attempt-I think the third attempt-to regulate employee share schemes. member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to this debate put it particularly well when he said that, although in a lot of respects this is a technical bill, it does get to heart of the fundamental philosophical differences between this government and the opposition in our approaches to a whole range When we talk about employee share no schemes, we are focusing very strongly on relations between employers and employees. As the member for Curtin quite rightly pointed out, the fact is that the government is wedded, by virtue of its commitment to the trade union movement, to a system of industrial relations that is outmoded. The extent to which it will be able to facilitate or encourage will employee share ownership will be limited by the unions' incapacity or unwillingness to allow the government to move too far down From our point of view, the vehicle of employee share ownership is integral, crucial, to our whole approach to industrial relations. want to see and encourage employers and employees to work together at the enterprise level. One important element of allowing and facilitating that is by virtue of employee share ownership; hence our attitude on this side, as has been stated by the shadow Treasurer, is that we are opposed to what the government those now proposes. We will be moving amendthis ments to reflect the opposition's approach, which I believe, quite clearly, is a much more enlightened approach to this whole issue, as is our approach to industrial relations, of which this forms one small part. The government clearly got it wrong the time. It was caught out badly in its hamfisted attempt to extend the fringe benefits tax to cover these arrangements. There were some elements of concern about the way the arrangements were being abused. They could have been fixed easily. Instead the government, buoyed by the success of its FBT-the fact is that FBT has grown and grown and, as a consequence, businesses have groaned and groaned under the impost of it-could not help itself and rushed into extending cover to these arrangements. These arrangements did not pass the Senate and were subsequently taken out of the legislation. But 10 months later, on 28 March 1995, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who unfortunately is not in the House this morning, issued a press release in which he finally admitted, after all that time and despite all the input the government must have had from small business about how ill advised its approach on the whole issue was, that the government had got it wrong. Backflips and unintended consequences have been a feature of this government over many years. It gets things wrong so often because it rushes into things, because it is pushed and because it is cornered philosophically so that, rather than do the right thing, it is forced to effectively do the less than optimal thing. Even yesterday we saw a major and welcome backflip in industrial relations, with the final acknowledgment, months and months down the track, by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) that the government got it absolutely wrong in respect of the unfair dismissal provisions. But you have to drag the government screaming to that point. It sometimes takes a very long time to wake up. We have before us a new proposal with respect to employee share ownership schemes which will enable employers to receive an unlimited value of ordinary shares or rights in their employer companies or on a deferred tax basis, providing certain conditions are met. Tax deferral has a five-year limit and tax exemptions will be allowed to a limit of $500 per annum. They will also be available on a conditional basis. The biggest criticism we have of the new proposal is that, in the great majority of cases, recipients will have to sell their shares to raise money to pay the tax. I think the honourable member for Curtin also referred to that. The government has a problem with ordinary people owning shares. If that were not so, it would do something to overcome that particular problem. Legislation is currently in place which prevents pensioners and self-funded retirees from owning shares. The taking into account of unrealised capital gains has effectively forced many retired people and pensioners to sell their shares. Of course, the government's proposal that deeming provisions be introduced from July 1996 will not improve that situation at all. The fact is that it will be very difficult for people to own share portfolios. Certainly that will be the effect of this legislation. People who have shares in businesses will have to pay tax and many of them will have to sell their shares in order to do that. This is an obvious disincentive for businesses to enter into such an arrangement with their employees, who, once they become aware of the downside, may be unwilling to enter into these arrangements. It is difficult in the end to see how this new proposal is justified at all. It is quite clear that the bureaucrats who put all this together have failed to understand all the issues involved with employee share plans. They have taken a very limited and restricted view rather than consider the whole picture which, as we have already said, encompasses industrial relations and a range of other issues. They have taken a very narrow approach in the proposals they have presented to the parliament today. Despite the current changes that represent a considerable improvement over the original proposal, Australia will still rank very poorly in the world in its treatment of employee share plans. I suspect that that reflects where we rank in the world in industrial relations systems. We are clearly pointing out here this morning that there is a very strong nexus between the two. By world standards, we have an outdated industrial relations system and we will be seen to be still treating employee share plans very poorly. There is still a real sense of uncertainty in the community, which is caused by the government's inept handling to date of this whole issue. A major flaw in the current provisions is the restricting of concessional treatment to ordinary shares and rights issued by employers to employees in their own companies. That has been clearly pointed out in the past. The government's new proposal effectively excludes all small unlisted companies and non-incorporated businesses from being able to pass on share plan tax benefits to their employees or to utilise new generation share plans for the same purpose. This is obviously a major limitation in the current legislation. Employee share plans have major implications for national savings. They are a valid plank in the approach to improving our national savings performance. As has been said in this place very often, our savings performance has been very poor historically and remains at historically low levels, not only for Australia but also compared to other OECD countries. It is interesting to look at a table that shows household savings rates as a percentage of disposable household income. The figure for Australia in 1993 was five per cent and, for 1994, is 6.7 per cent. The projection for 1995 is 5.3 per cent and, for 1996, 4.4 per cent. So there is a downward trend of household savings as apercentage of disposable household income. We compare unfavourably with other OECD countries. The percentage for Japan is 15 per cent; Germany, 11.6 per cent; France, 12.6 per cent; Italy; 14.1 per cent; and so on. Very few countries are performing worse than Australia by that measure. But perhaps a more important measure is gross national savings as a percentage of gross domestic product. That table is alarming and reveals the poor performance of Australia in this respect. The table that I have here shows the trend between 1977 and 1993. If we take the 1993 figures, the figure for Australian gross national savings as a percentage of GDP was 16.5 per cent. In 1992 it was 15.6 per cent. The interesting thing about this table is that it shows us being about the same level as Mexico. Mexico is way down the bottom. If you take the 1992 figures, the total OECD average is 19.4 per cent. In that year Australia's performance was 15.6 per cent. Mexico's was about the same, at 16.1 per cent-way below the OECD average. Very few countries are performing worse than Australia and Mexico. They are right at the bottom in terms of OECD performance in this table. It is quite concerning that Australia and Mexico seem to be comparable on so many scores. We heard yesterday, much to the chagrin of the government, that our balance of payments deficit level is once again at the bottom of the list, on a par with Mexico.",26
13,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,A very sad record.,28
14,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"A very sad record. Most Australians would be alarmed that we should compare ourselves in any respect with Mexico. The Minister for Finance tried to wiggle his way out of it by saying that on other measures we do not compare directly with Mexico. But we do compare directly with Mexico. I do not want to cast too many aspersions on the Mexicans, but the Mexican economy is a basket case. Mexico had to race off to the United States only a few months ago and ask for what amounted to a handout of billions of dollars to stop the country from going completely under. It is an odious comparison to make to compare the Australian economy with Mexico's but it is a valid comparison on a number of measures. In terms of our savings performance we compare directly with Mexico at the bottom of the table. In this context employee share plans have major implications for national savings. They are a vehicle to improve national savings and ought to be encouraged and facilitated. Yet to date the government has attempted, and is doing nothing different with this legislation, to effectively discourage employee share ownership purely because it has some philosophical problem because of the strictures placed upon it by its union masters in respect of embracing wholeheartedly by world standards an enlightened approach to employee share ownership and the implications that approach has for improving industrial relations in this country. Even if in the end it has a detrimental effect on the unions that should not be the motivation, but it is the motivation of this government to look after its union mates. Hence its philosophical opposition to these sorts of approaches. That is why these plans are important. Opposition speakers have said-this has not yet been contradicted by the governmentthat this is the reason why we support the plans. We support them, but we find the government is effectively discouraging them because of the impact they have on national savings. A coalition government, as the shadow Treasurer said, would be committed to encouraging these programs. We understand they have positive implications for industrial relations. It is important that we undertake a major review of them with a view to making sure they are facilitated. I am sure the governTheophanous), ment is attempting in part to overcome their downside in terms of possible rorts, but they can be overcome without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. That is effectively what the government has done with this legislation. There clearly needs to be a further report along the lines of the FitzGerald report which looks further at the whole issue of private savings. As I pointed out, the need to increase savings is evident but the mechanisms for doing so are not so clear. Employee share plans are one. Perhaps looking at tax concessions for interest on savings accounts would be another enlightened way of encouraging savings. In this country we need to encourage savings. We have not done that up to date. The coalition opposes many aspects of this government's approach. We oppose the fact that the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised. We are opposed to the fact that the five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before employees acquire shares, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability. We are concerned that the qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are too tight and that no refund of tax will be paid on options that lapse. We are concerned that the valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options, and that most employee share schemes in foreign owned companies will be taxed up-front. We are doubtful about the government's bona fides in respect of this legislation. The effect will be that the government will discourage these schemes. We strongly believe they ought to be encouraged. The national interest demands that they be encouraged. At the appropriate time in the debate we will move amendments to reflect our support for these schemes.",28
15,Mr JENKINS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I intend to intervene only very briefly on a couple of matters in this debate. I apologise to the House that, because of my duties in the Main Committee, I did not hear the earlier debate. I am indebted to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr who is at the table, for giving me what I believe to be a very fair and concise overview of the direction of the debate so far. Having listened to about 10 to 15 minutes of the speech made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), I think I have the drift of it. I have been baited a little by what he said and will address some of his remarks towards the end of my comments. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is a fairly wide ranging tax amendment piece of legislation. It goes to a wide variety of matters. There should not be any great concern that from time to time bills such as this come before the House. Without going to the matter that is involved, I want to illustrate one aspect. What we are talking about in the part of the legislation. dealing with sales tax exemption on UHF transmitters is that we have had in place a policy for equalisation but have found that certain things were not able to be achieved in the time frame that was first envisaged. Therefore, we are extending the exemption. This is an illustration of how from time to time different aspects of our tax law have to be amended because we want to ensure that consequences we expected from the changes are achievable. Sometimes time frames are paramount in what needs to be achieved. The one aspect of this piece of legislation that really caught my attention, and led to my being so bold as to put my name on the speakers list, was that dealing with superannuation guarantee and local government councillors. There was quite a campaign about the way in which the superannuation guarantee levy impinged upon elected councillors, impinged upon the allowances that elected counciIIors received. One aspect of the case was put to me by the local government in the city of Whittlesea, amongst other municipalities that came to me and sought my assistance. That aspect was that we managed to have the peculiar situation where there were apparently two definitions of 'employee'-one for the purposes of in-ome tax and one for the purposes of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act. I do not often do this but I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) about these matters, and he quite rightly took advice from the Australian Taxation Office. In replying to my office, he provided copies of determinations by the commissioner. I have to say that, in respect of the reply he sent to me in August 1993, I noted on my file copy 'the logic escapes me'. It was even worse when we had a second go at it. We got a reply back in January 1994 and a member of my staff described the Assistant Treasurer's letter as a disgrace. . I suppose we' should not be so emotive about different aspects, and I am pleased to see that this legislation addresses some of the perceived problems. I think that is fair because the nature of the allowances received by local counciIIors previously, especially in the state of Victoria, was that they were in lieu a reimbursement of expenses. They were hardly a salary. When those allowances were first put in place they were set at the level of $1,200, and that may have reached the level of either $2,000 or $3,000 by the time elected councillors were dismissed by the Victorian government and replaced by commissioners. It was really something that was basically a voluntary effort by those elected to those municipalities. I am pleased that the result of the amendments we see in this piece of legislation acknowledge that. I will not stray too far from the bill but I just want to make some comments. In Victoria, with the changes we are seeing in local government, there is under consideration a different role for elected councillors when we see a return to democratically elected councillors in March 1997. There is some contemplation that they will better represent part-time or full-time positions where the remuneration can be seen as a form of salary. I accept that, if that is the eventuation, salary will come within the ambit of all our tax laws, the income tax superannuation guarantee and the lik- . That move really does highlight the fact that local government in Victoria is going through a great transition. Unfortunately, that transition has led to commissioners being appointed for a period of nearly two years. That is a disappointment. I do not wish to reflect upon individual commissioners but, at the end of the day, they have been appointed by the state government and have been asked to achieve an agenda that the state government has put in place for them. It will be interesting to see whether the role of a local councillor is given a greater status. If during this period the state government is realistic in defining a wider role for local councillors, perhaps that will make the full time positions more attractive to people and that would lead to those elected people getting a remuneration that more reflects a salary rather than a reimbursement of expenses. I make brief mention of the aspect of this legislation that appears to have got the oppoof sition well and truly in a lather: employee share schemes. Unless I have completely and utterly missed the point, I think this really is setting out to achieve a number of thuse things the honourable member for MCPherson tried to say it is not. I understand that there has been the notion that the measures in place in this legislation are as a result of some capital 'I' ideological bent of the government. I do not know that I really agree with that. I often have to reconcile in my own mind that this Labor government is a government of the modem Labor Party. It is the government of a Labor Party that is evolving. Whilst it might give me concern from time to time that that has meant there have been shifts in the ideological basis of a number of things the government doesthe clearest example of that is the government's attitude in certain areas to public ownership-we do see that still it is a government that has many of the fine tradit.ions of previous Labor governments, still it attempts to look at those issues of equity and fairness, and still it looks to the way it can try to achieve things that can be seen as being for the wider common good. Towards the end of his contribution, the honourable member for MCPherson at"" least admitted that, in part, what we were trying do with this amendment as it deals with a employee share schemes was-to use his ant words- 'to put a lid on any rorts that going on'. Having come to a realisation that that is the intent, I find it a bit sad understanding, amendments proposed to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposihistory tion (Mr Costello) in the consideration in detail stage are to completely delete schedule 2, which deals with all those matters to with employee share schemes. I also understand that the drift of much of the case put by the coalition is that in some way this exemplifies some erroneous attitude that the government has to industrial relations. I would have thought that if we really read the intent of not only this amendment but the basic legislation being amended, we would see that it gives scope for employees to take the option of investing in shares within the companies they are employed in. It is therefore a form by which workers participate in their companies. It tightens way in which any tax concession would be given. It gives options for the way in the employee might decide to have the tax considerations of any discount he or she was to get on the share offer. That appears to very fair. Likewise, I think it goes honourable member for MCPherson highlighted: national savings. I do not think we have to have the great argument, this argy-bargy, about the situation at the moment. We need to have the argument about how we are going to best address it. The FitzGerald inquiry clearly showed that we, as a nation, need to address the level of our national savings. Much of this year's budget provisions went to addressing that. The.. whole intent of what we are trying to achieve in the area of superannuation has as an underpinning tenet that it is a measure to improve our national savings position. The superannuation measures will have a twofold outcome. These measures will not only attempt to give individuals the opportunity to put in place arrangements that will best suit them in their retirement but also attempt to, through these collective efforts, to achieve a pool of national savings that we as nation need. I think that this is most importand it is sotpething that this· government are has had high on its agenda for quite some time. It is something that this government that, to my recognises needs to be achieved. If we look at this Labor government's on superannuation, we find that a national superannuation plan has always been high on its agenda. It is something that has do often been under active consideration. The situation prior to the Second World War was that superannuation was basically restricted to white-collar workers. The situation improved only marginally in the postwar period. Former Prime Minister Menzies-someone I know the honourable member for Warringah also (Mr Abbott) has a high regard for-promised a national superannuation scheme in 1949, but for various reasons did not deliver. Figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that at the time of the Whitlam government in 1974 only can 29 per cent of the employed population the belonged to super schemes. On three occasions-notably, September 1970, April 1971 which and September 1971-the Labor Party was defeated in the parliament on motions calling for the establishment of a national superanbe nuation scheme. Consequently, in the 1972 budget then Treasurer Snedden announced to the issue the such a scheme. At the time, former Prime Minister Whitlam said that it took 23 years and much cajoling from the ALP for the government to honour its commitment. In March 1973, the Whitlam government established a national superannuation committee of inquiry, the Hancock committee. The task of ensuring that Australian workers have access to superannuation has taken a long time. After the experiences of some two decades, we now see that by using different mechanisms-mechanisms that were not envisaged at that time-we have gone a long way to achieving a commitment towards a broad superannuation scheme that is accessible to all workers. If members of the coalition want to highlight in this debate the issue of industrial relations then they should realise and acknowledge that the organised union movement has played its role in getting to this point. Representatives of the union movement have sat down and talked to the government-and they have not agreed entirely with the direction the government has taken on all occasions, but they have been at the table-and they have been willing to make concessions. On behalf of the workers they represent, they see the merits in not only the employer contributions but also the employee contributions. They recognise that to forgo, at this time, salary in lieu of making these superannuation contributions will benefit individual workers-if we are to look at their whole life, which is important. It is true that that money is not in their pockets now and that will have a consequence for them, but it has to be seen in light of the fact that this will have a benefit down the track. If employees choose to forgo part of their salary in order to make superannuation contributions, it will have a benefit for those workers as individuals and it will also have a benefit for the nation. Down the track more individuals will have their own form of income support in their retirement and will not have to rely on safety net provisions or social security payments and other types of welfare payments that the federal government has historically had to provide. If we were to keep the system that we have seen over the past few decades, it would place an almighty burden on taxpayers as we go into the next century. The taxpayers would not be able to sustain the level of income that people enjoy at present. That is an important outcome of our move to this wider access to superannuation. Another benefit of the movement that we see in this area is that it will increasingly give a savings pool of significant proportions. One of the great challenges for future governments will be to ensure that there is proper prudential management of those pools of money so that benefits can be accrued by individuals. The other benefit will be that, in the investment of those funds, those managers will be acting in the best interests of the whole Australian community. I urge those involved in that management to give consideration to being able to place investments in things that will have that wider good. They should look at the different types of mechanisms that have been put in place as it will encourage them to invest in infrastructure. As I have often said in this place, if we do not ensure that we have proper investment in the infrastructure and the maintenance of infrastructure, it will lead to almighty problems that are being illustrated in other parts of the world such as the United States and some European countries. In conclusion, I have great pleasure in supporting this piece of legislation.",29
16,Mr ABBOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Warringah) (11.22 a.m.)The employee share ownership concept is about working together; it is about turning adversaries in the workplace into partners; it is about establishing property owning democracy; it is about giving workers what they do not always have-the dignity of a stake in their business. I imagine that, if the government was thinking this through properly, it would support everything that is being put by the opposition. I do not believe that many members opposite-there may be a fewhave adopted their position out of ideology. The government's position is basically the result of indolence, thoughtlessness, avarice and the bad habits of a government which has been in power too long. The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) talked about rorts. This legislation of the government is supposed to eliminate rorts. What rorts? This issue has been debated three times now in this parliament, and not once has the government been able to come up with chapter and verse of the rorts that this legislation is supposed to eliminate. What we in the opposition believe is that workers and managers should be partners in enterprises. They need to be friends, not enemies. This is why we are insistent that everything possible should be done to maximise the spread of employee share ownership. The government says it is in favour of employee share ownership, but its actions speak louder than its words. Under the tax regime that operated until last year,' if an employee obtained. shares at a concessional rate, then instead of paying tax on the value of that concession that tax could be deferred until the value of that share was realised. As I said, three times this government has tried to change the tax regime governing the issue of shares to employees. Twice it has been defeated. Three times it has got it wrong. This proposal will similarly be defeated-if not here, in another place. The result of the government's ham-fisted approach to employee share ownership is that 90 per cent of the employee share schemes currently operating in Australia are on indefiin nite hold. Of companies employing more than 1,000 people in Australia, 60 per .cent at present have employee share schemes. These share schemes are on hold. In other words, companies employing 10 per cent of the work force have these schemes on hold. That is to say, one million Australian workers, who should have the benefit of employee share schemes, are being deprived of the benefit of these schemes because of this government's ham-fisted handling of the issue. These companies are the household names of Australian industry. These companies are a rollcall of blue chips. These companies with employee share ownership schemes are not trying to rort the system; they are not trying to rip off the Australian people. These companies are trying to build a decent economy and a decent society. They include: AW A; Advance Bank; Amcor; Apple Computer; the Australian Industry Development Corporation, which in fact is owned by the federal government; the Bank of Melbourne; Baulderstone Hornibrook; Boral; Brambles; Bums Philp; Cadbury Schweppes; Clyde Industries; CocaCola; Commercial Union Assurance; the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; Country Road;CRA; Fletcher Jones; Gillette; Goodman Fielder; Hills Industries; James Hardie; Jennings Industries; Kraft Foods; Leighton Holdings; Lend Lease Corporation; National Australia Bank; Newcrest Mining; Normandy Poseidon; North Broken Hill Peko; Pacific Dunlop; Pasminco; South Australian Brewing; St George Building Society, now St George Bank; the Austnilian Gas Light Co.; BHP; Tubemakers; W.e. Penfold; Westpac; ANZ; BTR Nylex; CSR; Email; Mayne Nickless; Pioneer International; Rothmans; and Western Mining Corporation. These are companies which this legislation implicitly accuses of cheating and defrauding the taxpayer. Quite frankly, these are not companies that would ever do that kind of thing; these are companies which have employee share ownership schemes in place because they want to do the right thing by their workers and by society. Qantas plans to issue each one of its 27,000 employees $500 worth of shares in the company. That exercise democratic capitalism, that exercise in extending the benefits of government policy to workers, is on hold because of this foolish piece of ham-fisted legislative bungling. As I said, the previous position was that the concessions on shares issued to employees only attracted tax' when those shares were realised. Under the latest government scheme you can do it two ways: if you eleCt to pay the tax up front, then you can get a tax concession of $500 on the shares issued. To just consider for a moment how trivial and how petty this concession is, $500 worth of BHP shares is probably about 50 shares. That is the trivial nature of the concession that this government is offering. The alternative is to take the shares and then pay tax in five years time. Let us consider this: an average worker is offered shares in his company by management. He thinks to himself, 'Interest rates have just gone up three times in the last year. My mortgage is costing me more and more to carry each month, as the government's recovery peters out, as the economy hits the wall. My job is not as safe as it was.' That sort of worker is not going to be able to accept shares on a five-year deferred tax basis. If that worker does accept shares on that basis, what will happen is that he or she will take the shares, hold them for five years and then have to pay tax before having had a chance to enjoy their benefits. This scheme of the government is not a share owning scheme; it is actually a share renting scheme. By saying that workers can take the shares but that then they will have to pay the tax in five years time, the government is not turning workers into share owners; it is turning them into share renters. If a benefit is worth giving, it is worth giving for keeps. This is the shareholding equivalent of saying to people who currently get concession travel on the railways, 'Okay, we'll let you buy your ticket for half price now, but at the end of the year for all those tickets that you've bought for half price you'll have to pay the rest of the full fare.' It just does not make sense. This government is attempting to apply to shareholders the same sort of logic as it has previously applied with the deeming principle to part pensioners. It is really saying, 'You will have to pay tax on benefits that you haven't actually received.' Just as the government has said to pensioners, 'Okay, we're cutting your pension and you can toddle off to Telecom and pay your phone bill with a BHP share,' it is really saying to workers who would like to own shares in their companies, 'You've got to pay in tax good cash before you actually have the cash in your pocket to meet that tax bill.' There are many other problems with this bill. I mention just two of them. The only people who will qualify even for these limited concessions that the government is offering are people who are taking ordinary shares. What that does is exclude from the operation of this kind of scheme companies which do not issue ordinary shares-that is to say, all those unlisted and private companies which employ something like two-thirds of the people in the Australian work force. In other words, this scheme of the government cuts out from the benefits of employee share ownership something like two-thirds of the Australian work force. Sure, these small family run companies can go through all the legal and accounting trouble of establishing a class of ordinary shares so that they can cut their workers into the action and benefits of ownership. But the problem then is, unless those shares are traded regularly, unless there is a regular market in these shares, every time companies issue a share to a worker they will have to call in an auditor to get a valuation. Mr Deputy Speaker, how many companies will do that? The simple truth is: very few. What this legislation is doing is restricting the scope of employee share ownership. It is tying up in endless bureaucratic and accounting red tape the ability of companies to help their workers and help themselves at the same time. Consider the case of employee buy-outs. We all know that sometimes companies go bad-not because the workers are incapable but because the managers are incapable. In lots of instances the workers have tried to preserve their jobs and to keep those companies going by buying them out-by saying, 'Look, management, you haven't done much of a job; let us see how we can go.' Under this legislation, if those companies then issue the shares back to the workers, the workers will have to pay tax on those shares in five years time and the worker buy-out will last only five years. Just as soon as the workerowners of those companies start to get used to being men and women of substance, they will go back to being wage slaves. Everyone in this place agrees that Australia needs to lift national savings. Lifting national savings is important to get interest rates down, to get debt down and, in the long run, to be able to increase the wealth of our society so that real wages-which today are five per cent less than they were in 1976can start to go up again. The problem with this piece of government legislation is that it will actually reduce the ability and incentives for Australians to save. At the moment, employee share schemesschemes which are currently frozen in practice because of this legislation-have an estimated value of $3 billion. Vince FitzGerald, a very respected economist, has estimated that the government would get $500 million more in tax revenue every year under the regime that used to apply to these sorts of schemes than it has under any of the three schemes that the government has tried in the last 12 months. This legislation is an example of the government's propensity to tax first and think later because, if it had thought through, it would understand that it was actually going to make everybody worse off. With a few exceptions that are not of great account and with the exception of a few members of the Victorian socialist Left, everyone in this parliament believes that the free market is the best method humankind has yet devised to generate wealth. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the market principle. The only problem is that the operation of the free market leaves some people with unequal market power. The solution is not to close down the market and thereby abolish people's freedom to buy and sell. The solution is to even up the market power of the citizens who are participating in the market. Employee share ownership is a way of turning workers into participants in the market, rather than leaving them slaves in the market. The Labor Party, as the member for Scullin pointed out, has come a long way. Unfortunately, in coming a long way, it has forgotten some of the enduring values that all members in this House should hold dear. It has forgotten that light on the hill that Ben Chifley talked about-the light to be reached by 'working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand'. If the government were thinking of Ben Chifley and his memory and example, it would not be proceeding down this path. It would be encouraging employee share ownership schemes, not talking out of both sides of its mouth. On the one hand, it is saying, 'Yes, we believe in these things,' and, on the other hand, it is introducing legislation which makes it practically impossible for these schemes to flourish and which has frozen 90 per cent of the schemes that are in existence. With this legislation, the government is saying, 'It is okay for the Prime Minister to make a fortune and have his entrepreneurial investments, but we will not give the workers any chance to get a look-in.' The government, through the modem Labor Party, may have betrayed the Australian workers, but there are other people in this House who are prepared to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Austhe legislation tralian people.",32
17,Mr CONNOLL Y,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The legislation before the House is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995. The coalition is strongly of the view that the proposals put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in relation to employee share ownership schemes are fundamentally flawed, and this is the subject. I want to discuss in the House today. The concept of employee share ownership in terms of taxation support in this country goes back about 17 years. I think it is fair to say that, when the concept was initially developed, it had bipartisan support. Both government and opposition accepted the clear advantages which were to be found in having a mechanism by which people would be encouraged to make contributions through their income-normally by salary sacrifice type techniques-towards investing in the company which was employing them. The advantages underlying the concept of worker participation through share ownership c-an best be described as follows: they reward good performance and the attainment of specific business objectives; they give the recipients a positive incentive to increase their company's productivity and profitability; they increase industrial harmony; they help to create a greater awareness of the company's operations; they encourage greater employee identification with shareholder interests and with the company's interests; they assist in remunerating staff properly and in line with overall market conditions; they can keep the fixed component of wage costs at a lower level than would otherwise be the case; they are a motivational tool which is good for morale; they can inspire greater loyalty to the company; they can provide another form of saving for retirement and they can do so without restrictions applying to conventional superannuation; they are tax effective; and they can help to attract and retain key staff. This mechanism was developed initially in the United States which is regarded, somewhat euphemistically, as the home of capitalism. What we have seen in recent times-on three occasions in fact-are attempts by this Labor government to tinker with the system, not to improve it, not to make worker participation schemes through share ownership more attractive; but to fiddle around the edges, with the effect that we are firmly of the view that it will make this proposition less attractive than has been the case in the past. Putting it quite simply: the proposals put forward in this legislation are fundamentally flawed. The Treasurer's amendments will question and threaten the viability of current schemes and restrict the potential for the future expansion of employee share ownership in Australia. That is something which the opposition regards as fundamentally important in regard to not only the role it should be able to play in the overall need to increase national savings but also participation-that is the most important word of all-shared ownership, involvement or the ability of the workers of Australia, regardless of whether they are executives, white-collar workers or workers on the floor of the factory, to feel that the success the enterprise to which they make such a real contribution can be reflected not just in their salaries and wages but also in their being part owners of the enterprise to which they have made such a major commitment. This is the third attempt in the last 13 months by the government to deal with this issue. We regard it as a third failure. The essence of the problem seems to be that the government believes that there are new schemes in place which are rorting the system, which are an effective means of tax avoidance and which therefore should be closed off. These schemes have been referred to within the taxation and accounting industry as 'new age' schemes. We in the opposition will be the first to agree that, if there is evidence that people are using these mechanisms to avoid taxation in an illegal sense, they should then be stopped. For example, if there is a means by which people can nominally buy shares in a company or in a trust fund which, in effect, can then be used to buy them overseas trips, to buy them boats, to buy them smart sports cars or even to buy them homes or real estate, one could legitimately say that was a gross misuse of the principles underlined in the original legislation which allowed these schemes in the first place. Of course, we would oppose such propositions. What has been made clear in this whole debate is the inability of the government to specifically identify these problems and then go about changing the law in an effective way to stop them. Instead of that, it is effectively changing the system in a way that will radically transform the whole basis upon which decisions are made by companies-often outside Australia-as to whether or not they are willing to continue to provide worker share ownership schemes to the benefit of their employees. We believe that the government needs to encourage the distribution of shares right across the work force. We want employees to have the opportunity to have a stake in the businesses which employ them. That is really the basic difference between where we stand of on this issue and where the current Labor government stands. We want as many employees as possible to own shares through employee share schemes. Clearly, the Labor Party wants to discourage them from owning shares by introducing new and extremely unfavourable tax treatment. We believe that Australia must encourage and increase employee share ownership to address our critically low level of national savings, as well as being a mechanism for encouraging a further lift in productivity and improved harmony within the workplace. The level of worker participation schemes in Australia still remains far too low. Although the level of private share ownership has increased in recent years and is still increasing, it is still well below that of both the United States and the United Kingdom. Although the Treasurer has attempted to justify his proposals, he has failed over the last 13 months to quantify the extent of the tax minimisation or tax cheating problem which he claims is the basis of these changes. While he continues to do that, he cannot be surprised that the professional organisations, the employer organisations and the opposition will continue to be sceptical about his propositions. There are many aspects of the proposal which we find unacceptable. The proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefits are realised. The five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee even acquires a share. This leaves employees with an unfunded tax liability well into the future. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are far too tight. There is no refund of tax paid on options that may lapse. The valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options. Most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed upfront. The sad fact is simply that today Australia is a derivative economy. Today the vast majority of the work force involved in major companies are employed by international corporations which have in place overseas worker participation schemes which they want to make available to their employees in this country. Surely, that is in their interests. a mechanism by which we can ensure that, while companies may be foreign owned, at least Australians working for them will have the capacity to make a contribution and to gain dividends-from their labour and the result of the success of that company internationally. The opposition wants to see a situation where employees take a stake in the businesses where they work, where employees have a stake in the productivity of the business where they work and where, ultimately, they can see a share in the profits coming to them and to their families. It is very clear that as a nation we have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world, some 74 per cent. It is equally very clear, as I have already stated, that Australians' share of capital ownership, particularlyon an individual basis, is well below where it should be in relation to other countries. Therefore, this is one of the major problems which have to be addressed if we are to have a nation which is less dependent on foreign capital; a nation where the employees can feel that they are part owners of the corporations and the companies they work for. One proposal put forward by the government is a $500 discount for employees taking shares. The facts are that most people will not even qualify for those shares because they have to take the shares in the year in which they were issued; they cannot see them as an advance which can be utilised later when they have the funds to pay for them; shares should have no conditions for forfeiture; you cannot dispose of them before five years of employment; and the discount is restricted to people who have been employed for 24 months, rather than 12 months as previously. There should be discounts for employees taking shares. They should be open to all employees and they should have the option of holding on to those shares and getting the discount at the same time. The second fundamental flaw in the government's approach is the proposal that taxation liability on shares or options at the end of five years will arise whether or not those options are exercised or you have those It is shares. That is patently absurd. If you have not exercised those options, you may find yourself having to pay a tax liability for something that you never take up. There is no prospect for a refund in the eventuality that you do not take them up or that the options have lapsed. What is also fundamentally flawed in this proposal is that many international companies which operate worldwide, as I have said, have employees around the world involved in share ownership plans and most of those international plans allow a 1O-year period before any tax liability falls due on the options. But that is not what has been offered. This legislation is limited to a five-year period. That means that Australian law, by changing the goalposts at this stage, is effectively cutting out of the action thousands of Australian employees who otherwise would have access to the international worker participation and share ownership plans of their foreign employers. There is simply no logic whatsoever in applying such a law. Any adverse effect upon employees of international companies posted in Australia will obviously arise out of the proposed legislation. The reason is that the legislation directly negates and inhibits the government's important and commendable objective, which I thought we always had, and certainly this government has made much noise about in recent times, that we want to attract to Australia international regional headquarters for operations in the Asia and Pacific region. The class of employee of an international corporation, through international practice for many years, has involved these-various forms of employee share acquisition schemes. If an officer on being posted to a headquarters in Australia is going to be directly discriminated against, clearly it will be a fundamental factor in determining whether or not the headquarters will be transferred to Australia. We welcome the removal of the FBT impost appearing in previous proposals-:..that is, the last three proposals of the government-nevertheless, the current proposals are clearly inadequate, mainly in the following areas: the conditions for qual-fication are too stringent and do not recognise a wide variety of employment practices and conditions; the five-year rule is too short and should be based on the period permitted under the law of the country of issue of the shares or rights, with a maximum period of, say, 10 years; the lack of an adjustment or refund where an option lapses or is unexercised is inequitable; and valuation rules are clearly unrealistic, because employee options are usually non-transferable and non-tradeable. Those factors have been totally ignored in the development of this particular concept. It would therefore appear that while most, if not all, of the concerns the government has announced in the context of the so-called new age schemes, and the clones which can develop from them, need to be resolved-and the opposition has made it very clear that it would consider any sensible proposals in that regard-it is perfectly obvious that what has been happening in this particular set of amendments will make the situation for many people who are within the law, and many companies which have been doing the right thing by their employees and applying principles and practices on an international basis, will be effectively cut out of the action in terms of the Austra1ian circumstance. I conclude by making the point that we in the opposition believe the worker participation schemes are important. They can be a mixed blessing if they are.not properly designed. But the practice of the last 17 years or so demonstrates that it can only be to the benefit of Australia and Australian employees and employers to have in place a rational, sensible scheme of proposals which lock in intern ationalpractice on the one hand and domestic practice on the other.. With regard to employee. schemes, whether you are the employee of an international corporation or whether you are the employee of a national corporation in Australia, the rules must remain consistent in both cases. Unfortunately, after 17 years of practice, after three attempts· to change the rules in recent times, the government has still, regrettably, failed to make it worthwhile. The point needs to be made that Vince FitzGerald, in his eminent report of last year on national savings, made the point that there is a potential to increase revenue by some $500 million a year under the old scheme, provided it is administered effectively. I see no advantage whatsoever to Australia, or to the employees who have previously been covered by these schemes, for the the government to now change the goalposts at a time when it is quite clear that the proposals it is putting forward are not going to achieve the ends it wishes, but will simply reduce revenue, reduce the capacity of companies to want to offer these schemes and share participation arrangements. Consequently, this will directly result in a diminution in the quantum of Australian ownership of foreign shares of companies that operate in this country and will do absolutely nothing to increase Australia: s capacity to be more independent in tenns of capital raising, both here and overseas.",35
18,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"in reply-I would like to thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) today. I am told that there is only one point of contention that has arisen out of the debate, and that is on the employee share acquisition schemes. So I will say a few things about that, and maybe some more when the amendments are moved. I can say that, arising from the debate today, we see, once again, the opposition with absolutely no policies of its own.",38
19,Mr TUCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Oh, George! These are policies that you can't steal from workers. We are opposing your legislation. That's our policy.",39
20,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I do not expect the member for O'Connor to understand. Of course you are opposing it. That is all you ever do-but no policies. That is your policy exactly. The policy of members of the opposition is to oppose-in the words of the member for O'Connor-but not to put forward any positive proposals. They are not doing it today. Today they have put up some amendments which, in effect, would just maintain the status quo. We know that the status quo is highly tilted towards executives getting the benefits of the employee share' acquisition schemes provisions. The government wants to make sure that all employees get the benefits of these schemes. That ""is why we have brought the amendments to the legislation in. It is well recognised throughout the industry that the existing legislation is being abused. If we accept the amendments of the opposition, that will continue .. Members of the opposition say, 'Trust us. Once we get into government' - and that is some way off-'we will do something about it.' In the meantime they are happy to see this abuse carryon .. We know that in a lot of public companies the main benefits of this scheme are going to the executives. I rule out the companies like th- BHPs: they do have schemes in place in which all employees can participate. It is not as if the government has not listened to some of the criticisms that are around the place. We made some changes to the provisions when they were here last year. We have made sure that FBT does not apply and that the tax will be paid by the individual but that the tax can be deferred for five years. Currently there is no requirement for the benefits to go to all employees- and mainly the executives get it. . I heard a couple of the opposition speakers talk as though the opposition stands for all employees getting the benefits of these shares. The practical effect of its amendments is exactly the opposite, and the opposition knows it from experience. It is not as though we are talking academically here. We know what is happening in the marketplace now. We are saying that these benefits should go to all employees. We have made sure that that happens. To accommodate some of the concerns there will be a five-year tax deferral. There is no limit on the amount, but it will be taxed after five years. On-e again we are seeing the opposition opposing for the sake of opposing, with no constructive policies. It is a. bit like the mystery flights that we hear about. In Perth now it is very fashionable to buy mystery airline tickets. When you go out to the airport you do not know whether you are going to Kalgoorlie or Sydney or Melbourne or anywhere. You tum up at the airport with your ticket and you could end up in any of those places. It is bit like that with opposition members. They are offering a ticket. You do not know where they are going. They do not know where they are going. It is apparent that they do not know where they are going because all they are doing is opposing. As the honourable member for O'Connor is honest enough to admit, it.is their policy to oppose, but not to put up constructive alternatives. The amendments I will be moving will make sure that .aU employees of a company get access to the benefit of the employee share acquisition scheme, which is something the opposition talks about but, as practice shows, fails to deliver on. .

'(2) A deduction to which this section applies is not allowable to the body for any year of income unless the requirements of subsections (3) and (4) are complied with. '(3) For the deduction to be allowable, the body must obtain a certificate by an authorised actuary stating the actuarial value, as at the time the body ceases to be an STB, of liabilities of the STB to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the body, where the liabilities: (a) accrued after 30 June 1995 and before the time when the body ceased to be an STB; and Sum of all deductions to which this section applies for the year of income where: Unfunded liability limit for a year of income is: (a) if the year of income is the one in which the body ceases to be an STB-the actuarial value of the liabilities set out in the actuary's certificate; or (b) in any other case-that actuarial value as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection (5), have not been allowable to the body for all previous years of income.

(2) Schedule 1, page 9, item 1, omit proposed section 24AZ, substitute the following section: Meaning of relevant period and prescribed excluded STB ""24AZ. In this Subdivision: prescribed excluded STB means an STB that is an excluded STB as a result of regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the definition of excluded STB in section 24AT; (b) were, according to actuarial principles, unfunded at that time.

'(6) If the sum is greater than that limit, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following forinula is not allowable: Amount of deduction Unfunded liability limit for x the year of income relevant period has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 2A.'."".

Application The amendments made by items 5 and 10 of this Part apply to income derived on or after I July 1995. All other amendments made by this Part apply to income derived on or after 1 July 1994."". (9) Schedule 1, page 13, item 17, proposed subsection 3D(6), omit paragraph (e) of the definition of excluded STB. The government's amendments deal with state and territory bodies contained in schedules 1 and 9 of this bill and the employee share acquisition scheme provisions contained in schedule 2 of the bill. I present the explanatory memorandum. In relation to the amendments to item 1, amendment 1 inserts new section 24A Y A. This section will disallow superannuation contributions of certain privatised STBs to the extent that those contributions are in respect of unfunded liabilities that accrue during the period from 1 July 1995 until the STB is privati sed. Amendment 1 is part of a revenue safeguarding package. The package consists of restrictions on the use of losses and certain deductions of state and territory bodies, STBs, which are remaining in the Commonwealth tax net because they will soon be privati sed. The item is also being amended to insert a definition of 'prescribed excluded STB' into proposed new section 24AZ. The definition is necessary because the revenue safeguarding provisions all use the term. It is convenient, therefore, to have one definition rather than define the term.in three separate provisions. I tum to the amendments to item 5. Amendment 4 removes the definition of 'prescribed excluded STB' from section 51AD. The definition is being centralised into proposed new section 24AZ by amendment 2. Amendment 3 also amends the item to ensure crossreference of the term 'STB' back to division lAB. Amendment 5 inserts new item 6A. This is a consequential amendment which ensures that paragraph 73C(2)(b) continues to have its intended effect following the introduction of a new exemption provision-that is, 24AM. Paragraph 73C(2)(b) reduces a deduction for research and development expenditure where the taxpayer receives or becomes entitled to receive a recoupment of or grant in respect of the expenditure from a government or a government authority. The amendment will include STBs as sources of such a recoupment or grant. Amendment 6 inserts new item 9A. It expands the definition of 'exempt public body' in subsection 159GE(1) by including in that definition an STB, the income of which is wholly exempt from tax. This is a consequential amendment to ensure the section continues to have its intended effect. . As regards amendment to item 10, amendment 7 amends proposed section 159GEA by omitting the words 'an STB' and substituting them with 'a prescribed excluded STB'. This amendment, along with the amendment to item 14, amendment 8, ensures that STBs which are taxable are treated as exempt for the purposes of division 16D of the act until those STBs are sold to private interests. In relation to the amendment to item 14, amendment 8 ensures that items 5 and 10 are given a date of effect of 1 July 1995. Due to an oversight, the amendments which deemed otherwise taxable STBs to be exempt for the purposes of section 51AD and division 16D had a date of effect of 1 July 1994. The agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories is that those provisions shall apply from 1 July 1995, the date from which only bodies due for privatisation by 1 July 1997 will be listed as taxable. In relation to the amendment to item 19, the bill currently excludes state and territory owned superannuation funds from the new sales tax exemption for state and territory bodies. Amendment 9 will remove that exclusion so that state and territory superannuation funds will now be exempt from sales tax if they satisfy the necessary conditions and are not otherwise excluded.

Elections ""lOB. An election under this Part must be in writing in. a form approved by the Commissioner and be made before the taxpayer lodges his or her return of income for the 1994-95 year of income, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows."". The government is aware that tax planners have already developed one arrangement which will ensure that shares or rights provided under an employee share scheme, which would otherwise be taxed without any concession, will now be treated concessionally. In its simplest form, this arrangement makes selected executives of a holding company employees in an investment company. Those employees are also granted shares in the subsidiary. The subsidiary may hold shares in unrelated companies. The end result is that, in effect, employee shares are treated concessionally. Amendments 10 and 12 will ensure that employer. shares or rights provided through these arrangements are not treated concessionally. Under proposed section 139DC, an employee er can, under certain conditions, claim deduction for the imputed cost of qualifying shares or rights provided to employees. Subsection 139DC(2) limits this deduction the market value of the shares or rights or $500, whichever is less. Amendment 11 will limit the deduction to the discount given to cases. the person receiving the shares or rights. Without such an amendment, an employer claim a deduction under this concession even where the employee has received no benefit. In determining the market value of shares or rights under subdivision F of the proposed division 13A, it is necessary to refer to values quoted on 'an approved stock exchange'. Amendments 13 and 14 will define what is an approved stock exchange. Under new item 7A, some shares which fall to be taxed under the new employee share scheme provisions may also, in some circumstances, be subject to tax under foreign investment fund provisions. To avoid any double taxation, and to ensure that the deferral concessions of the employee share scheme provisions remains available, amendment 15 will exempt the shares or rights from the foreign investment fund provisions for the period prior to the time at which those shares or rights are taxed under the employee share scheme provisions. I will now tum to amendments to item 10. Item 10 of schedule 2 provides three transitional arrangements for the new employee share scheme provisions. These are contained in sub-items 3,4 and 5. While the transitional arrangement in sub-item 5 require a taxpayer to make an election for it to apply, sub-items 3 and 4 apply automatically. Amendments 16, 18,21, and 23 allow those taxpayers who fall within sub-items 3 and 4 to elect that those sub-items not apply. The transitional arrangement of sub-item 10(3) of schedule 2 currently applies only to shares or rights of the employer company. nonAmendment 17 extends this arrangement to shares or rights of the holding company of the In the transitional arrangement of sub-item 10(4), there is a requirement that the employshare scheme be approved by shareholders a before the date the new employee share scheme arrangements are announced. As some overseas jurisdictions may not require their to employee share schemes to be approved by to shareholders, amendments 19 and 20 ensure this requirement is not necessary in these Also in sub-item 10(7), the term 'public can company' has been given the same meaning as in the Corporations Law. It is possible that in some situations the term 'public company' in this provision may exclude foreign holding companies and companies which have been established by statute. Amendment 22 defines the term to include companies listed on approved stock exchanges and companies which have been established by statute.",41
23,Mr ANDREWS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I indicate that the coalition will not be opposing the amendments which have been moved by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but we will be opposing schedule 2 after it has been amended. The reason we will be opposing schedule 2, to reiterate our position, is that we believe the government's propositions and proposals are fundamentally flawed and that, in fact, rather than aiding employee share ownership in Australia, the provisions in this bill actually threaten the viability of current share schemes and restrict the potential for future expansion of employee share ownership in Australia. This is the third attempt by the government to deal with employee share ownership in 13 months, and it is its third failure. The justification for much of the changes contained in this bill, and even in the amendments which are now being moved by the Assistant Treasurer, is, firstly, that we want to bring employee share ownership to the availability of all employees in Australia and, secondly, that there are some rorts and abuses of the system. You would think that if it were the case that there are rorts and abuses of the system, the Assistant Treasurer and other members of the government would be able to come into this place and· signal, in chapter and verse, the rorts and the abuses that are alleged to be occurring. But when we ask them to do so, there is a deafening silence which crosses the length and breadth of this nation. All we get is this general assertion that it is known in the industry that there are some rorts and abuses. When the government is making changes to the taxation laws of this country based on the assertion that there are rorts and abuses of the system, it is incumbent upon it to set out what those particular rorts and abuses are, rather than make this general allegation, implying as it does that those persons and companies involved in employee share ownership are somehow rorting the system. The companies involved include some of the most major companies in Australia-the BHPs of Australia and· the Labor government's former icon, the Commonwealth Bank, which it is now selling off. Qantas is about to make offers of this nature in its share release prospectus to the general public and as part of its general transitional arrangements. There is simply no real evidence of what the government alleges. The reason we oppose this particular measure is that there are aspects of the proposal which are simply going to work against employees gaining, in any real sense, a share of the company in which they are employed. For example, the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised. The five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving .employees with an unfunded tax liability. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are too tight. There is no refund on tax paid on options that lapse. The valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options. Finally, most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up front. Rather than aiding and abetting the many hundreds of thousands of workers in Australian industries and Australian businesses to do that which we on this side would seek-that is, have a share in the ownership of those businesses-this legislation will in fact have the opposite effect. It will restrict the ability of employees to obtain a real part of the ownership of the companies in which they work. I hear the Assistant Treasurer saying that we do not have policies. Of course, it piques the government at the present time that the policies of the government are somehow being challenged when flaws are shown to exist in them. What does the government expect? Does it expect that in relation to every piece of legislation, even though industry groups say it is flawed-that happened in relation to this piece of legislation-we are going to get up here and cheer and say, 'Bravo, this is a great piece of legislation?' Of course not. We are going to carry out our responsibilities to bring to the notice of the government and the people of Australia the flaws that exist in legislation, such as those that exist in this piece. As I said, the coalition will not be opposing the further amendments which are being made to the schedule, but we will oppose the schedule itself. Amendments agreed to.

24,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"Menzies) (12.25 p.m.)by leave-I move: (2) Schedule 3, page 49, omit proposed paragraph 160ZZPIA(2)(d), substitute the following paragraph: ""(d) the merger beginning is not before 1 July 1994;"". (3) Schedule 3, page 50, omit proposed subsection 160ZZPIA(5), substitute the following subsection: ""Meaning of qualifying superannuation fund '(5) The expression qualifying superannuation fund means a superannuation fund other than an eligible rollover fund within the meaning of section 242 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.' "". Part of this bill gives rollover relief from accrued capital gains and losses where certain superannuation funds merge. The amendments allow the trustee of a transferor fund that merges on or after 1 July 1994 to roll over . any capital gains losses that would be realised as a result of the merger where a number of conditions apply. In particular, two of these conditions are of concern to the coalition. The first is that the merger take place between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997. The second is that the merging funds be qualifying superannuation funds. These two provisions relate to the amendments which have been circulated in the name of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). In particular, the first amendment deals with the timing of mergers. It is the belief of tht; coalition that the application of the rollover relief ought not be restricted simply to mergers which occur between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997. If this is an amendment to the legislation; which in principle is desirable-and that would seem to be the case because the government is moving this way-then why restrict it to mergers between funds that occur only between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997? Therefore, the amendment which has been moved seeks to make that time for merger open indefinitely. The second amendment which is being moved relates to the condition that the merging funds are qualifying superannuation funds. We seek to amehd the definition in the legislation because the effect of this bill fail to extend the relief which is provided to small superannuation funds. By specifically excluding superannuation funds with less than five members, the legislation neglects some of the funds which are most affected. Approximately 80 per cent of superannuation funds are excluded funds and are not eligible for the rollover relief which is. provided in this bill. Given that so many funds-about 80 per cent-are excluded by the provisions of this bill, our amendment seeks to allow those funds which have. five or less members to be included in the provisions that the government seeks to implement by way of this bill. They are the reasons that the amendments have been moved.",45
25,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"In relation to amendment No. 2, the proposal would give unlimited extension of the capital gains tax relief for merging superannuation funds. The capital gains tax relief is designed to encourage superannuation funds to merge so there are fewer and more efficient funds. The coalition agrees with us that this should happen. The government will not be supporting the amendment. I point out that no other unrelated taxpayers who merge their businesses get this relief. This measure is designed to reduce the small amounts problem by trying to encourage the merger of funds so there are fewer and more efficient funds. It is not equitable to extend this relief permanently. In the government's view, three years is long enough to allow these mergers, where they will take place, to take place. In relation to amendment 3, the issue here is to allow superannuation funds with less than five members-that is, the excluded superannuation funds-to get capital gains tax rollover relief. Once again, the government will not be supporting the amendment. The reason for our not supporting this amendment is that capital gains tax relief is designed to reduce, as I said, the small amounts problem, and funds with fewer than five members do not have this problem. So small funds have more control over administration and costs to their funds; the erosion of is to superannuation benefits by fees is now not a significant problem; and excluded funds do hot generally have members with small accrued benefits, such as transient members, et cetera.

The provisions of schedule 4 in the bill relate to local government councillors. The bill seeks to amend the definition of 'salary or wages' and 'employee, employer' in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to ensure a number of thingsnamely, that persons in the capacity of a local government councillor are excluded from the definition of 'employee'; that members of an eligible local governing body are included in the definition of 'employee'; and payments made to local government councillors, other than those who are members of an eligible local governing body, are excluded from the definition of 'salary or wages'. The amendment seeks to ensure that payments received by local government councillors in the course of their duties are exempt from the scope of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act, but that payments to members of eligible local governing bodies will continue to be subject to the requirements of the superannuation guarantee legislation. Currently the remuneration allowances of members of local government bodies are exempt from the PAYE collection system, unless the body unanimously elects to be treated as an eligible local government body. This amendment applies to assessments of super guarantee shortfall for the year beginning on 1 July 1993 and later years. The government formally announced this measure on 26 June 1994 through the then Minister for Local Government, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who wrote to local government councils in July 1992 advising that, as far as local government elected members were concerned, the new superannuation arrangements would only apply to councillors in receipt of salaries. However, the amendments are only retrospective to 1 July 1993, whilst the superannuation guarantee levy commenced on 1 July 1992. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended in June 1992 that the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 be amended by the government to ensure that local government councillors who receive salary or wages are covered by the superannuation guarantee while other local government councillors not be covered by the superannuation guarantee. We have criticised the application of the superannuation guarantee legislation to local government councillors and the failure of the government to enact legislation to give effect to the letter of the former Minister for Local Government. In September 1993 Senator Macdonald introduced a private member's bill, which passed through the Senate, with the same objectives as the current provisions but dating back to 1 July 1992. The effect of this amendment is to remove or omit the date '1 July 1993' and substitute for it '1 July 1992'. Given that that would then be consistent with the introduction of the superannuation guarantee, we believe that this is an amendment which would then clarify the situation completely and place the situation of local government councillors on a consistent footing with the date of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy.",46
27,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"The effect of this amendment would be to bring forward by one year the exemption from the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act of payments to local government councillors. The government will not support this amendment. The first point to be made is that the amendment will favour employers who did not comply with the super guarantee legislation. Secondly, amendments will mean that super funds have to refund contributions already made. I am informed that there would be costs involved-for example, they may have to amend trust deeds. Thirdly, the change was announced on 18 April 1994, as the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) said, so the councils knew not to make contributions for the 1993-94 year.",47
28,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"The other very important issue which needs to be addressed in the context of this amendment is the effect which the government's rule is having not just on local government councillors but on doctors and other professional people who have been caught up in what could best be described as an unforeseen consequence. Let me give an example: if doctors have a private practice-and have consequently made private superannuation arrangements-and have also worked in a hospital, the effect of the current arrangement is that they are caught by what I call the 10 per cent rule. That is, if 10 per cent or more of their income is related specifically to the activities undertaken in a professional capacity in a hospital, it effectively means that their private superannuation is negatived because they are included in the superannuation guarantee arrangements. The effect that this has had on many doctors-especially anaesthetists and various specialised service providers-has been enormous. It is clearly inequitable. I hasten to add that it does not apply only to those people working under contract in a hospital. There is a perception that this applies only when a person actually has a contract to provide services in a hospital environment. I am reliably informed by representations which I have received that it affects an anaesthetist who is under contract to a surgeon to facilitate an operational procedure. The anaesthetist does not, therefore, have a legal relationship per se with the hospital but is also caught up in this situation. The implications of that are quite wide ranging. I certainly urge the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, to review this matter. As we have suggested, to make the commencing date 1 July 1992 instead of 1 July 1993 would be a serious attempt to overcome what is becoming a serious anomaly. The 10 per cent rule as it currently applies affects a wider selection of people than just local government councillors. It covers a whole range of professional servicesespecially in the medical area-which are being provided. I suggest to the minister that this rule is having an effect which can only be described as an unforeseen circumstance. I think the government's actions are grotesquely unfair.",47
29,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"It is very generous of the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) to take up the plight of the doctors, given his recent experience. He has invited me to review the impact that the 10 per cent rule might have on them, and I will undertake to do that. Amendment negatived. Schedule agreed to. Schedules 5 to 7-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 8.",48
30,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"Menzies) (12.39 p.m.)by leave-I move: (5) Schedule 8, page 76, proposed subsection 163A(1), omit ""Subject to subsection (2), if:"", substitute ""Subject to subsections (2) and (2A), if:"". (6) Schedule 8, page 76, after proposed subsection (2) insert the following subsection: ""No penalty payable if no income tax payable '(2A) If income tax is not payable by a person in relation to a year of income no penalty is payable under subsection (1) in respect of the person's failure to furnish a return in relation to that year of income.' "". (7) Schedule 8, page 80, omit item 4, substitute the following item: ""Application 4. The amendments made by this Part, other than new section 163A, apply in relation to a return if: (a) the return is for the 1994-95 year of income or any later year of income; and (b) the return is required to be lodged on or after the 60th day after the day on which this Part commences. Section 163A applies in relation to a return if the return is for the 1995-96 year of income or any later year of income."". These amendments, which were circulated in the name of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), relate to the provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) pertaining to late lodgement penalties. One of the provisions of the bill is to introduce a new regime of penalties for late lodgement of income tax returns. For relevant entities and instalment taxpayers, a flat penalty system applies. They will be liable for a penalty at the rate of $25 per week for the period where they are late in lodging an income tax return, subject to a maximum penalty of $500-that is, equal to 20 weeks-regardless of the level of tax payable; that is, a penalty will be applied if there is a late lodgement of the return even if it subsequently comes to light that there was no tax payable or a loss was incurred. Taxpayers affected by this provision include: companies, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, pooled superannuation funds, trustees of corporate unit trusts and trustees of public trading trusts. The late payment penalties will continue to apply. the basis of the amount of tax outstandmg. The commissioner has a discretion to remit the late lodgement penalty and the objection on time. procedures of part IVC of the Taxati.on Administration Act apply. These late penaltIes consist of a penalty tax at eight per cent per annum and a penalty interest at the statutory rate-for the period January 1995 to 1995-of 10.8 per cent, which is calculated on a daily basis from the date tax becomes due and payable. The imposition of penalties for late ment of returns where no tax is payable has been criticised by many as a revenue raiser. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, has called for this provision to be dropped or, at least, deferred by the government. It claims that the provision will place unacceptable burdens on small business. Apparently, the Australian Taxation Office has argued that the penalty was needed to assist in the improvement of its statistical collection. Companies with no tax bill which have not lodged returns may now be penal1995 ised. This may lead to increased compliant costs to lodge these returns. The principal amendment which is being moved-there are some consequential amendcourse, ments-inserts the following subsection into the bill: ""No penalty payable if no income tax payable' '(2A) If income tax is not payable by a person in relation to a year of income no penalty is payable under subsection (1) in respect of the person's failure to furnish a return in relation to that year of income. '"" Basically, we are saying that if there is no tax payable then there ought not be a penalty imposed, or if there is a situation where a loss has been incurred and there is a late lodgement then these automatic penalties should not apply. For that reason, we are moving these amendments to the legislation.",48
31,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"Amendments Nos (5) and (6) propose to exclude from the late lodgement penalty relevant entities and instalment taxpayers that do not have a taxable inc?me; that is, loss companies. The amendment IS at odds with what the government is trying to achion eve. The penalty is in response to problems the Commissioner of Taxation has experienced with loss taxpayers not lodging returns The information contained in returns is necessary for the purpose of providing data to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as well as enabling the Taxation Office to manage its June compliance programs. If companies and superannuation funds that did not derive taxable income were not subject to late lodgement penalties then there would be no administralodgtive sanctions to enforce lodgement. As with amendment No. (7): the amendment proposed is to delay the application of the late lodgement penalty in respect of relevant entities and instalment taxpayers so that it applies to the 1995-96 income tax returns. The earliest due date for lodgement by this group of taxpayers is 1 February 1996, with the exception of taxpayers on substituted accounting periods. Small companies required to lodge by this date have been given a twomonth extension-that is, from 1 December to 1 February 1996-by the commissioner for the lodgement of returns. We think taxpayers are being given sufficient warning of the proposed penalty. The easiest way, of for companies to avoid the penalty is to lodge their tax returns on time. The government will not be supporting the amendments. Amendments negatived. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 9.",49

BANKING (QUEENSLAND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 2 March. Second Reading",49
33,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to bring the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, QIDC, under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. QIDC is a financial institution which is wholly owned by the Queensland government and which undertakes commercial lending to primary, secondary and tertiary industry within the state of Queensland. While in recent years it has sought to adhere to Reserve Bank standards, QIDC has not been formally supervised by the Reserve Bank. The Queensland government has recently corporatised QIDC and as part of this exercise is seeking to enhance the accountability of QIDC by enabling it to be brought under Reserve Bank supervision. This bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to bring QIDC under Reserve Bank prudential supervision. To this end, the Queensland government has recently referred its banking powers, with respect to QIDC, to the Commonwealth. Specifically, this bill includes QIDC within the definition of a bank in section 5 Of the Banking Act 1959, thereby establishing a legislative basis for Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. This will ensure that QIDC follows Reserve Bank requirements and is subject to the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters. The Commonwealth government endorses Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. As a substantial commercial lender, QIDC effectively operates as a business bank and its formal supervision by the Reserve Bank is entirely appropriate. Such supervision will help to ensure that QIDC remains financially sound and, accordingly, will help to underpin the security of the financial sector more generally. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.",50
34,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"Menzies) (12.50 p.m.)As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has indicated, this bill is before the House because the Queensland government has sought to enhance the accountability of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation by enabling it to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is being facilitated in the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill by listing the QIDC under the definition in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959. This establishes a legislative basis for the Reserve Bank supervision of the QIDC. The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation, under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power, as it relates specifically to the QIDC, to the Commonwealth government. The purpose of this measure is to ensure that QIDC follows the requirements of, and is subject to, the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters. I indicate that the coalition does not oppose this legislation. However, there are two or three concerns which I wish to raise in the House. The first matter I wish to raise is the provision of prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank itself. If it is expected, or told to Queensland people, that this somehow provides a degree of insurance or immunity for the activities of the QIDC, then one only needs to look at the report of the Reserve Bank itself to illustrate that that is a limited immunity or a limited insurance which is provided. For example, the Reserve Bank stated in its annual report for the year ending 30 June 1991: Prudential supervision does not have as an objective the immunisation of banks from the risk of loss. The report went on to say: Managers and shareholders should factor the inevitability of the economic cycle into their decision-making, and they must pay the price for errors of judgment and carelessness. In his remarks to the Queensland parliament, the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, pointed to Reserve Bank supervision as an insurance against loss by taxpayers. To suggest that somehow prudential supervision will, by itself, provide an insurance policy against any loss that could be incurred by the QIDC as a bank and an insurance against loss by Queensland taxpayers is somewhat misleading. One has only to look at what happened to banks in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to see that the ultimate insurance for such activities is not the Reserve Bank through its prudential supervision but, in fact, the taxpayers, the constituents, of those states themselves. The second matter I wish to raise is the activities of the bank and what seemed to be suggested to the people of Queensland that the QIDC would be able to do. If honourable members look at the explanation of the Queensland QIDC bill, they will see that the Treasurer of Queensland, Mr De Lacy, told the Queensland parliament that the QIDC would not be able to call itself a bank because: ... it is not able to fully perform as a bank in that it cannot provide retail banking facilities or provide finance for what are essentially owner-occupied homes. He went on to say: Although QIDC would gain the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank, the State legislation precludes the Commonwealth of Australia from requiring QIDC to possess a banking authority to carry out the business of banking. The Queensland Treasurer summed up by saying: This option means that although QIDC is defined as a 'bank' under the Banking Act 1959that is, the Commonwealth actit is not authorised to operate as a bank in the wider sense because it does not have a banking authority. This bank, if one looks at the speech that has just been made by the Assistant Treasurer, is able to carry out a whole range of banking activities. I quote the Assistant Treasurer's remarks prior to mine in this chamber today: QIDC is a financial institution which is wholly owned by the Queensland government and which undertakes commercial lending to primary, secondary and tertiary industry within the state of Queensland. There is no restriction on the .activities of the QIDC and as a bank it can carry out a full range of banking functions. So for Mr De Lacy to indicate to the people of Queensland that somehow prudential supervision and the passage of this legislation and the complementary legislation in the Queensland parliament are going to restrict the activities of the QIDC is simply misleading. If one takes it further, the QIDC will, under the very provisions of this legislation, be able to entitle itself and call itself a bank in any other part of Australia. So anybody who would be seeking to invest or to have some operation in relation to the QIDC, for example a resident of New South Wales, Victoria or any of the other states, would for all intents and purposes and under the terms of this legislation be dealing with a bank constituted as such under the authority of this bill and the authority of the complementary bill in Queensland. It was somewhat misleading for the Treasurer of Queensland to suggest to the Queensland parliament and to the people of Queensland that this would in some way restrict the activities of the QIDC. In fact, the passage of this very legislation has the opposite effect: it gives the QIDC a wide range of banking authority under the Commonwealth and under the legislation of Queensland as well. The third matter I want to raise is what this means in terms of the direction of banking itself. It is interesting that in some respects this indicates that the Queensland government is moving in a direction which is opposite to that being taken by state governments elsewhere in Australia and, in relation to the proposal by the Commonwealth to sell its share in the Commonwealth Bank, opposite to that which the Commonwealth has taken. We see other states getting out of the business of banking. The Commonwealth is doing that in its budget proposals for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet under the direction of the Goss government it seems to be moving through this legislation in the opposite direction, namely, by expanding the operation of the QIDC and turning it into a more fully fledged bank than it has operated as at present. That is curious and intriguing because the Premier of Queensland has said in.parliament that he did not resile from the position that 'state governments should not be in the banking and insurance business' . Yet· in an indirect way this does involve the state government of Queensland in the banking and insurance business. Whilst there is nothing to suggest that the activities of the QIDC are anything but carried out in the most professional and most competent manner, it is a curious matter that we have a different direction being taken here in relation to banking by a state than has been taken by the other states in Australia after the disastrous occurrences with banks such as Tricontinental and others, and different from the direction which is being taken by the Commonwealth in relation to the Commonwealth Bank itself. Apart from those concerns, the opposition will not be opposing this bill.",51
35,Mr GIBSON,PAIRS,"I rise to speak on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995, to talk about the purposes of the bill and to indicate my full· support and the support of all Queensland members of this parliament for this legislation. As has been outlined by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), this is complementary legislation to similar legislation that was passed in the state parliament of Queensland some months ago. The Queensland Industry Development Corporation commenced operations in July 1986. The main functions of the QIDC are the provision of financial services to Queensland industry and the administration in Queensland of certain federal and state business and rural assistance schemes, including ment scheme, the natural disasters assistance scheme, the small business debt assistance scheme and the rural housing scheme. The QIDC provides a broad range of products, including development capital, interest rate swaps, bridging loans, mortgages, commercial bills and investment services. It is a very important institution for the economic welfare of Queensland and Queensland businesses. As of 30 June 1994, the QIDC had net assets of $151.335 million and total operating revenue of $248.444 million. Government sion of the QIDC. business enterprises in Queensland are currently undergoing a process of corporatisation. The reform and restructuring of the QIDC a part of that process. It should be noted that the administration of the QIDC under the this Goss Labor government is in marked contrast to the administration during its formative years under the National Party regime that we, thankfully, threw out of office on 2 December 1989. The QIDC was a potential financial disaster when it was taken over by the Goss Labor government in December of 1989. If it had not been for the sound administration that came in on 2 December 1989 and the very sound administration by the Goss Labor government of the QIDC, the problems that were alluded to in terms of other state cial institutions could very well have been visited upon the QIDC. Prior to the election of the Goss Labor government, the QIDC was a considerable risk to Queensland taxpayers because of the way in which the National Party administration had supervised its operations. It had used the QIDC as a slush bucket for its own cronyism and pork-barrelling. It was a breeding ground for the corruption and porkbarrelling that was endemic in the National Party administration prior to 1989. If it were not for the election of the Goss Labor government, there would have been a major financial disaster, and Queensland taxpayers would have been responsible for paying for it. Thankfully, the Labor government of Wayne Goss was elected on 2 December 1989, and sound financial administration was put into place-and I can verify the rural adjustthose statements. An independent review of QIDC was undertaken in 1990. It found substantial evidence of political interference by National Party members and ministers in the operation of the QIDC. That review identified cases of commercial conflict of interest with directors and staff; lack of proper board leadership; poor or no risk management systems; and examples of rorting of government assistance schemes. That is the track record of the previous National Party government's superviI note that, according to today's speakers list, a number of my Queensland colleagues, is particularly a number of my Queensland National Party colleagues, will be speaking on bill. I am sure it is no coincidence. I am sure they are speaking on this bill today because they want to use the opportunity to try to engage in a bit of political doubletalk with regard to the Queensland state election. They are going to try to use the debate on this legislation to prop up their failing colleagues in the Queensland state election. Let us have the facts on the record before we start hearing the distortions that I am sure some of my National Party colleagues will come out with. The fact is that an independent financial review of the administration of finanthe QIDC by the previous National Party government proved, beyond doubt, that that National Party administration was guilty, in its operations of the QIDC, of using political interference. Members of the National Party used the taxpayers' funds which the QIDC had supervision of to pork-barrel their own electorates. They were also guilty of poor administration and poor management of the QIDC. That will come as no surprise to the people of Queensland, because they saw that type of endemic problem within the administration of the previous National Party state government across all areas of administration in Queensland. This was the same National Party administration that saw five of its ministers convicted of and gaoled for various levels of corruption. We saw its former leader, its former Premier, tried for corruption and for contempt, and we saw the Queensland Police Commissioner and half of the senior members of the Queensland Police Service proven to be corrupt and on the take. Mr Bruce Scott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells having been rung",53
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for North Sydney should bebrought back into the chamber. Once you are in - the House you cannot leave the House for a quorum. (Quorum formed),54
37,Mr GIBSON,PAIRS,"It is clear that National Party members do not like the truth being told in this parliament about their total maladminiHouse. stration and the fact that they were proven to be such a corrupt administration in Queensland. One of the very good examples of that was the way in which they administered the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. There was an independent financial review of the QIDC that clearly indicated that they used the funds of the QIDC for corruption and pork-barrelling of their own electorates. No phoney attempt by National Party members opposite to try to silence me by calling quorums is going to stop me emphasising the fact that the people of Queensland know the truth about the National Party-and there is no way they are going to put the National Party back into power so that it can get its grubby fingers back into taxpayers' money in Queensland. It is absolute hypocrisy on the part of Queensland National Party members and Liberal Party members in this federal parliament to come in here and try to criticise the Goss government over this, because it was the Goss government that got the QIDC back into a sound financial position-and that is very much exemplified by this legislation. The Queensland government is seeking through this legislation to put prudent financial auditing requirements and prudent regulatory requirements in place so that the Reserve Bank is able to adequately supervise the operations of the QIDC. Interruptions from members of the National Party are not going to silence me. The members of the National Party should hang their heads in shame. I am still to hear any member of the National Party in Queensland apologise for the massive corruption that was imposed on the people of Queensland. The fact is that the National Party corruptly used taxpayers' money in the state of Queensland. Five of its state ministers went to jail for their corruption, yet we have not heard any apology from anyone in the National Party for the disgraceful way it acted to the detriment of the people of Queensland. What amazes me even more is that the Queensland Liberals are now back in bed with the Nationals. They are now in this unholy alliance called the coalition in Queensland.",54
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The member will return to the matter before the,54
39,Mr GIBSON,PAIRS,"I am speaking about that matter, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about the fact that the Queensland Liberals and the Queensland Nationals have taken a position in regard to the QIDC of disagreeing in the state parliament with the Goss government's legislation on this matter, which is the complementary legislation to the legislation that we are debating here. It is very clearly an indication of their failures. I am surprised that the Queensland Liberals are prepared to go back into coalition with the Queensland National Party and to seek votes from the people of Queensland to become the next government, when they know that there are still many members of the Queensland National Party who were members of the proven corrupt administration of the last National Party government. It must be of great surprise and disquiet to the former Queensland Liberal leader, Terry White, that today's Liberal Party in Queensland is prepared to",54
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will speak to the bill. The chair has so ruled.,55
41,Mr GIBSON,PAIRS,"I recognise that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am speaking about the position that the Queensland Liberals and the members of the Queensland National Party have taken in the state parliament on this complementary legislation that was carried in the state parliano ment. It is clear that under the Goss Labor government the QIDC is no longer going to be used as a political brown paper bag, which was the way it was used under the former National Party administration. Instead of being used as a slush fund for political favours for the rural and regional areas of certain National Party members, under the Goss Labor government the QIDC has now diversified its lending portfolio to include secondary and tertiary industries. The QIDC is now a much broader inVestment portfolio bank, which is designed to support the depth of Queensland industries, and not just narrow sectional interests. That is why we have this legislation before us today. QIDC is a development corporation designed to benefit all Queenslanders and to benefit all Queensland industries, not just the narrow sectional interests that the National Party represented. There is a very good example of that. Recently, on the border between my electorate and that of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), a national relay service was established to assist deaf people and people with communication difficulties. That service was established with assistance from the QIDC, which saw it as not only a sound business enterprise, because QIDC would be paid for the phone calls that it is providing the relay service for, but also a major community service. The service will also receive $21 million of Commonwealth funding over the next three years-joint funding from the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Department of Human Services and Health. It was the QIDC that gave that service a start, and that gave it the money to get under way. That national relay service is going to benefit deaf people and people with communication difficulties throughout Australia. It is funded by the QIDC. Such a loan would never have been possible under the former National Party administration because, to get any sort of money from the QIDC, it was then necessary to b- a member of the National Party or a mate of the National Party. That longer occurs because the QIDC is now on a sound financial footing. The QIDC still has a very strong rural focus. Its lending to rural producers has been increased from $250 million to more than $1,000 million in 1995. So the QIDC still has that very strong rural focus, but it has also diversified and broadened its interests into a lot of other areas as well. The reason the legislation is before the House today is that the Reserve Bank of Australia has the power, under the Banking Act 1959, to supervise the prudential standards applicable to this bank, as it does with all other banks. The honourable member for Menzies made some points in his address about the fact that by this legislation the QIDC can operate as a normal bank like every other bank registered under the charter. That is recognised, but it is not the intention of the government to go that way. The Queensland government has made it quite clear that it is not going to expand the role of the QIDC into a full state bank with all the normal operations a bank would have. That is a clear political statement that the Queensland government has made. It believes the benefits to the people of Queensland, by bringing the QIDC under Reserve Bank supervision, is very important. Such an arrangement ensures that all taxpayers in Queensland will know that this bank is adequately and very carefully being supervised, that its operations are open to full public scrutiny and that there will be none of the slush fund and corrupt actions that were the hallmark of the previous National Party administration of the QIDC. That is not just me the politician talking, for the track record of corruption and misuse of QIDC funds was clearly outlined in. an independent examination of the QIDC in 1990. The move to RBA supervision has not been done by stealth. It is not some sort of secret deal. It is being made clear at all times that the QIDC would become technically a bank for the purposes of prudential supervision, but the government has made it clear that there is no intention to expand into that role. What is relevant is that the QIDC is now a prudentially sound financial institution which is free of corruption and political interference and is now subject to rigorous independent supervision. The restructuring and the realignment of the QIDC is just one of many major achievements of the Goss Labor government which has a record second to none in Australia for financial management and prudent dealings with taxpayers' funds. The operation and supervision of the QIDC is just one example of the way in which the GossLabor government has been extremely careful to ensure that the state of Queensland is well run and well administered. There are many indicators to show, as independent market assessments from around the world have shown, that the Queensland state government and the Queensland financial situation is second to none. I will quote from the Natwest capital markets report of October 1994. The report was called 'State of the states' and it said: It would be hard to find a national or sub-national government anywhere in the world that has a superior financial position to Queensland. This unique financial position has enabled businesses throughout Queensland to have a huge competitive advantage. While the other states use, on average, $25 in every $100 of their own source revenue in servicing their $75 billion debt load, Queensland actually earns net interest income. We are net debt free in Queensland. Queensland has the lowest per capita tax collections of any state in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that in 199495 residents in other states were paying an average 37 per cent more in state taxes than the average paid by Queenslanders. Queensland is the only state to be net debt free. The Goss government has completely eliminated the net debt of $4.2 billion that was inherited from the previous National Party government. Let there be no excuses such as, 'That was all because of the sound policies of the previous National Party government.' When the Goss government was elected it had $4.2 billion of debt and now it is net debt free, and that is due to the sound administration of the Goss government. I commend the QIDC legislation to the House. (Time expired)",55
42,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"I am very pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill. The QIDC, as we affectionately know it in Queensland, commenced operation in July 1986 under its new name. Prior to that it had a role as a development bank in Queensland. One of the great things about the QIDC is that it has always kept its base out there in rural Australia. As we have seen only recently, the major commercial banks are continuing to withdraw their presence in a physical sense from rural Australia, while the QIDC has been expanding its operations, particularly in rural Queensland. The QIDC offers very important banking services to the people of rural Australia. In future, the void that is being created by the withdrawal of the major commercial banks from rural Queensland may be filled by banks such as the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. The main functions of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation are the provision of financial services to Queensland industries. These include a broad range of products, such as development capital, interest rate swaps, bridging loans, mortgages, commercial bills and investment services. It is also responsible for the administration of Commonwealth and state business and rural assistance schemes. We all know of the situation out there in rural Australia, because of the high interest rates that are a legacy of the Labor administration here in Canberra. We know what those interest rates have meant to rural communities, not only to the farm sector but also to the small business sector right across this nation. Amongst the schemes that the QIDC administers are the rural adjustment scheme, the natural disaster assistance scheme, the rural housing scheme and the small business debtor scheme. It is a bank that has a major role in rural Australia and in rural communities generally. The QIDC is not only a bank which lends to the agricultural sector, as did the former Agricultural Bank of Queensland, it now lends to a broader cross-section of the community and administers many schemes, both state and federal. The purpose of this bill is to subject the QIDC, for the first time, to prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. These are the same standards which apply to banks, and relate to matters such as capital adequacy and prudential risk management of bank assets. This arrangement will be implemented by including the QIDC in the definition of a 'bank' under the Commonwealth's Banking Act. This bill is a stark reminder of the duplicity of the Goss government and why Queenslanders should not trust it with their future on July 15. On repeated occasions the Queensland Labor Party, both in and out of government, gave cast-iron guarantees that the traditional role of the QIDC would be respected, and that its prime purpose would be to promote the interests and development of Queensland. On repeated occasions the Premier has stated that the QIDC would not become a bank, with all the implications that this would carry for the bank's operations. Premier Goss gave these assurances as recently as last year, when introducing legislation complementary to that now before this House. He said that the QIDC would not become another bank. However, the net result of declaring the QIDC a bank under section 5 of the Commonwealth's Banking Act, will be to give it a complete range of banking powers. The Premier's assurances obviously amount to nothing. Whilst this breach of firm undertakings is bad enough, the consequences for Queensland of the corporation's change of status could well be diabolical. As a result of this legislation, this great Queensland institution will be subject to federal banking controls. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was earlier referring to the corruption or the maladministration of the previous conservative administration in Queensland. He failed to tell the House that the Queensland government inherited a very well managed state. The finances were in excellent order, and the QIDC was a bank that was fulfilling a role. We only have to look at Labor administrations in Victoria and in South Australia to find that a bank under a Labor administration in Victoria cost the taxpayers $2 billion to bailout and in South Australia, notwithstanding the fact that it was under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank: The cost to the taxpayers was $2.2 billion. No such evidence of this sort of failure within a state controlled lending institution can be levelled at the former administration in Queensland. One can witness also the former administrations of Western Australia and Tasmania. The member for Moreton berates the House with points about a previous administration which left Queensland in a great position. The Queensland Industry Development Corporation was not broke; it was not costing the taxpayers any money. In fact, as the member for Moreton said, the rating of Queensland for its financial performance ranks second to none. The Goss administration inherited that position; it did no- build it. It is about time members on the other side of the House told the truth about where the great legacy that was handed to the Labor administration came from, something the people of Queensland know very well. We must also always remind members on the other side of the House that the Labor Party cannot be trusted to be in charge of money, particularly taxpayers' money. Examples which will illustrate the cronyism and downright disregard for taxpayers' funds that have hecome the hallmark of Labor in power include the $170 million of fees to outside consultants hired by its departments to tell the departments what to do. Only recently we have seen a $10 million consultancy go to the advertising agency which ran the Labor Party advertising campaign in the last federal election, a $10 million consultancy to identify the best way to sell and float Qantas. Eighty-six million dollars of taxpayers' money has been given to the ALP for escalating rent on Labor's Centenary House, which is now occupied by the National Audit Office.",56
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I had to call on the last speaker to stay with the bill, and I repeat the request to the present speaker.",58
44,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I respect your ruling. I was merely going on from the failure of the State Bank in Victoria and the State Bank in South Australia to how the Labor Party misuses taxpayers' money when given control of it. However, I will come back to the bill before the House. The Queensland Industry Development Corporation, as I said earlier, has a proud past and I hope it has a proud future in developing the state. One of the great visionary projects which have been promoted by independent commentators and investors recently has been the building of the great inland rail bridge between Brisbane and Melbourne via the inland towns of Goondiwindi and Moree, through Narrabri and the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin. Such a bridge could well mean the further development of value adding industries where 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from. The QIDC could well play a role in the development of that visionary scheme, particularly through the provision of finance. Queensland and the port of Brisbane are so near to the great Murray-Darling basin river system where 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from. It is those sorts of projects which the QIDC and other development organisations could well look at as projects which would bring benefits not only to Queensland, to the people who live along that rail link, but also to the nation as a whole. The Queensland Industry Development Corporation will now take on the status of a bank and have a wider role in rural Queensland, perhaps taking over the role of some of the major banks. That is a role which I commend to the bank. I only hope that it keeps up a presence in rural Australia. Perhaps it will find a niche under its new charter to be more of a bank out there when the major commercial banks leave rural Australia. I hope that because it is going to become a bank with full prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank of Australia it does not go the way of our major commercial banks that are leaving rural Australia. I hope that it does not in tum, because of the decisions of economic rationalists that are made at a capital city level, withdraw its agencies from rural Queensland. It is vitally important that it consider a service to the community in rural Queensland as well as attempt to broaden its base into more development opportunities by lending in areas beyond the rural and small business sector. I hope that the economic rationalists are not in there saying that it is not commercially sound to have these branch structures throughout rural Queensland. I hope that we do not see the QIDC going down the same path as did many of our major commercial banks that have removed their physical presence from rural Queensland. Whilst it is their right to make those commercial judgments and withdraw their physical presence from rural Queensland, I think there is a role for government to ensure that there are banking services provided to the people who live in rural Australia. I want to touch on a comment made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in relation to the Commonwealth Bank and what its privatisation and sale could mean. In answer to a question from the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) the other day whether free banking services would still be available under a fully privatised Commonwealth Bank to almost 4.5 million pensioners, students and veterans, the Treasurer failed to give an assurance to this House and to those peoplethose 4.5 million people, those low income families who bank now with the Commonwealth Bank and those who may have a housing loan-that they will continue to have free banking services once it isa fully commercial bank and there is no longer any ownership by the Commonwealth. It is extremely important that we ensure that out there in rural Australia we still have banking facilities that are available not only to the business sector and the farm sector but also to people on low incomes-families, pensioners and veterans-so that they have access to banking services. It is one of the fundamental services that any community needs. It is not good enough to say that with modem technology you are going to be able to replace banks with plastic cards and electronic funds transfer and that this will be able to be a service that will be understood and be completely adequate for the people who live and work in rural and remote Queensland. In conclusion, I trust that the QIDC, with its changed status as a result of this bill, continue to develop and push its agencies and its branch level activities out into rural Queensland whilst at the same time it develops into a larger, more commercial bank in the activities of capital city lending and opportunities in the wider investment world.",58
45,Mr DODD,PAIRS,"Leichhardt) (1.36 p.m.)Listening to the previous speaker and shadow minister, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), speak on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995, you would think that there were no problems with the QIDC when the Labor government came into power in Queensland in 1989. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that in 1989 the Goss government was faced with a real problem, in that the QIDC presented a great risk to the taxpayers of Queensland at that time. If the situation had been allowed to continue, as happened in other states, the Queensland taxpayers would have been required to pick up the tab for years of National Party mismanagement of the QIDC. The Goss government had to do something about that and in 1990 it got an independent academic, Mr John Polichronis, to undertake a report into the QIDC. The report that Mr Polichronis gave was damning of the previous National Party government and damning of its administration of the QIDC. It showed evidence of political interference in commercial matters under the National Party government. As well, it showed cases of commercial conflict of interest by the National Party appointed directors and staff of the board of the QIDC. It also gave evidence of lack of board leadership and abuse of schemes administered by the relevant division of the QIDC. We should not be surprised about that, given the record of that government. That was the government that would not even introduce a public accounts committee into the parliament of Queensland. It would not even have parliamentary scrutiny of any government institutions. That was the government, as was said earlier, that operated by the brown paper bag. If you wanted to become a knight, that required a financial transaction with the previous National Party government. If you will wanted a knighthood, you sent some money in a brown paper bag to Bjelke-Petersen House. That was the sort of financial transaction that was highlighted by the Fitzgerald royal commission. So that is the sort of government the people of Queensland had before 1989. That is the sort of government that was highlighted by the Fitzgerald royal commission and that is the sort of government  report on the QIDC. SO, far from the picture that was painted by the shadow minister, who is at the table, the QIDC was in a mess. Not only that; potentially it was in the same situation as those other unfortunate financial institutions in the southern states. But a Labor administration in Queensland saw the situation, picked up the report that I referred to and introduced reforms. One of the major reforms is before the House today, that is, bringing the QIDC under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. National Party members do not seem to like that. I can assure them they will not be in government after the middle of next month, but I suspect that they think they have a chance. They want to get their finger in the till again, so they do not want the QIDC to have prudential supervision by the Reserve BankMr Bruce Scott-That's rubbish.",59
46,Mr DODD,PAIRS,"The honourable member says that is rubbish. It is certainly the situation that  Goss government acted to reform the QIDC. One of the reforms was the corporatisation of the QIDC. The second reform was to bring the QIDC under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. There was an option of bringing the QIDC into the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision, but that institution looks more at smaller banks and building societies and it was considered more appropriate that the Reserve Bank be the supervisor. It is very significant to note that the Goss government has led the way in terms of national reform of building societies and credit unions. The national financial institutions scheme is the model scheme for other states and territories and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission has its headquarters in Brisbane. So there is no doubt that there has been significant recognition of the Queensland government's achievement in this area. Queensland is widely recognised as having the strongest financial position of all the Australian states and, indeed, its financial position is unrivalled amongst its competitors in the Asia-Pacific region. The Natwest capital market report, State of the states, in October 1994, said: It would be hard to find a national or sub-national government anywhere in the world that has a superior financial position to Queensland That is the true situation. Of course, this unique financial position has given business in Queensland a huge competitive advantage. While other states use on average $25 in every $100 of their own source revenue in servicing their $75 million debt load, Queensland actually earns net interest income. Queensland is the only state to be debt free. The combined debt of the other states and territories is about $75 billion. The Goss government has completely eliminated the debt of $4.2 billion inherited from the previous National Party government. Indeed, by June 1996, the Queensland government is expected to have net assets of $1.6 billion. So let us not hear any of the nonsense that has been bandied about here that somehow the Goss government does not have a good financial record in Queensland. Getting back to the QIDC, the QIDC has been substantially reformed in other areas. The government schemes that I previously referred to, the government schemes that were previously manipulated by the National Party government, have been removed from the QIDC and are now administered by the Queensland Rural AdjustmentAuthority. The QIDC is now run by an independent professional board-no more National Party cronies on the board. It is an independent board that is running the scheme very well. I would not want the House to think that, by changing its emphasis and transferring the government schemes to the administration of the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority, there is a neglect of the rural sector. I think there was some suggestion in the previous speaker's remarks that that was the case. The proof is I in the figures, because lending to rural producers from the QIDC increased from '$250 million in 1986 to over $1,000 million in 1995. Before this legislation could come into place, the Reserve Bank expected and got an audit of the QIDC. The Reserve Bank found that the systems of the QIDC were of the highest standard. One may compare that with the report which was brought down in 1990, which referred to cronyism and to conflict of interest, and see the vast difference between the administration under the Goss Labor government and that under the previous National Party government. This is not the only monitoring of the QIDC that takes place. The QIDC is monitored also by the government owned enterprise unit within Treasury. So there is a whole range of systems. There is now a public accounts committee in the Queensland parliament. Someone coming from any other parliament in the world would say, 'So what? We have had public accounts committees for 10 or 20 years,' but in Queensland it has come in only since 1989, when the Goss government came in. Yet these people claim that they can govern Queensland. These are the people that claim that they are ready to govern again. I think the Queensland people will have a very different message for them and a very different message for the Liberal and National Party government-or the National-Liberal government, I am sorry, because there will never be a Liberal government in Queensland. We know that a vote for the Liberals in Queensland is really a vote for the Nationals, and that is something that we will be very clearly telling the people of Queensland in the next two or three weeks. The Queensland government does have a very good economic record. The previous speaker was talking about economic development. In April this year the Goss government released From strength to strength, a comprehensive blueprint for the state's future economic development, which included public sector reform, micro-economic reform, tax concessions-$9 billion worth of fiscal infrastructure-programs for the development of education and training, research and development, and trade and investment initiatives. There has been some debate in the House about the Queensland government's economic performance in the social welfare area, in terms of social justice. Mr Bradford-What's that got to do with it?",60
47,Mr DODD,PAIRS,"There has been a debate, and it is relevant because there has been a wide ranging debate here about the economic performance of Queensland. There are long term structural problems in relation to social infrastructure in Queensland. In 1989 Queensland was the lowest spending state in public housing and in 1989 Queensland had the lowest expenditure on education of any state. That was consistent through the 1970s and through the 1980s-totally consistent. The figures are there and these things do not change overnight. The opposition, in the parliament yesterday, was handing out a document that purported to suggest that poverty was worse in Queensland. Unfortunately, it forgot to look at the document at close range. That document referred to prior to 1989. But I understand that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) will take a point of order and I will return toMr Andrews-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am reluctant to interrupt the honourable member but he has strayed so far now from the topic of this bill that I invite you to draw him back to it.",61
48,Mr DODD,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will return to the bill, because I think it is significant to",61
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I have reminded the last two speakers to return to the bill and I am pleased to hear the honourable member for Leichhardt say that he will return to the bill. Thank you.,61
50,Mr DODD,PAIRS,"It is important, for contrast, to  1990 about the QIDC. He said there was political interference in commercial matters under the National Party government-and I am glad the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) is in the House, because he might  said that there were cases of commercial conflict with National Party appointed directors and staff, a lack ofleadership and abuse of government schemes. I understand that, for some time, the honourable member for Kennedy was the minister responsible for the QIDC. Correct me if I am wrong. Maybe he might explainMr Katter-Unfortunately for you, that is correct!",61
51,Mr DODD,PAIRS,"He might be able to explain why that report came in 1990, and why he, as minister, allowed this to happen. But, as I said, 1989 came and the Goss government won the election and instituted reforms, not only in relation to this legislation to bring the QIDC under the control of the Reserve Bank but also in relation to all the other things such as corporatisation and scrutiny by Treasury and by the public accounts committee. The real danger signals that were given by that report were that Queensland would have been in a situation where Queensland taxpayers would have had to bailout the QIDC because of the stated mismanagement of having loans being determined by political cronyism and not by commercial considerations. In some ways, that is what happened in the southern states in relation to other institutions. It was not quite the same thing but, clearly, there were inappropriate loans in the southern states. The difference with Queensland is this: the people in Victoria and South Australia were overly generous with their loans, but there was never any suggestion that there was political interference in terms of who got the loans; and it is very clear indeed that the QIDC, pre-1989, was subject to political interference. That is why this legislation is before the House: if we are to avoid that sort of situation, we have got to have proper supervision. The Goss government, with obvious cooperation from the Keating government, has provided that supervision. I have no difficulty in supporting the legislation before the House.",61
52,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"MCPherson) (1.53 p.m.) I see that my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) cannot wait to get going, but I am sure that he will have a chance in a moment. This is a timely debate on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill because it coincides with the election campaign that is now under way in Queensland. In many respects, this particular debate also brings us, as has been noted on this side, to the important question of credibility as far as the Queensland Goss government is concerned. This may not be a major election issue up there, as I can think of a number of others; nevertheless, this is an important issue and it ought to be an election issue. A lot of Queenslanders, once they become completely aware of what the Queensland government is up to, will be a little unsure about what the government actually proposes to do. Earlier this year, the Queensland Treasurer assured the parliament of Queensland that the QIDC was not to become a bank. Clearly, he misled the parliament when he said that, and he has also misled the people of Queensland. He seems to think that this is a debate about semantics. I note that the Courier-Mail editorial of 9 May makes this point, when it states: But the Treasurer must expect to be closely scrutito nised on any agency within his brief that has large cheques to offer people with ideas. The Opposition was right to ask the question. A clear answer, without semantics, should be put on the public record. It has not been put on the public record. In a sense, the question is still unanswered, the concerns remain-and they are very real concerns as far as many other Queenslanders and I are concerned. When is a bank not a bank? By any definition, the QIDC will be a bank with the passing of the legislation that we are dealing with today. It will be registered under section 5 of the Banking Act. No amount of obfuscation by the Queensland Treasurer, no amount of quick sidestepping, can avoid that issue. It will be a bank. The fact that it will be a bank should be of concern to many Queenslanders because, clearly, governments do not run banks very well. In fact, what this amounts to is the people of Queensland signing a blank cheque for the Goss government, and many Queenslanders would want to think very carefully about whether or not they want to do that. Mr Katter-They had a good history in South Australia and Victoria.",62
53,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I am coming to that, which is the point of raising the whole issue. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in his contribution to this debate earlier talked about the previous administration of the QIDC, and I am sure the member for Kennedy will want to talk about that. But the member for Moreton and none of his colleagues want to talk in any balanced way about the state banks of South Australia or Victoria. They really want to avoid those issues. I can understand why they do not want to get into that area because the performance of those state owned banks ought to be-and will be for a very long time-a great embarrassment to the Labor Party because the losses in those stat;'!s amounted to billions of dollars. Let us be quite clear that, when the QIDC was corporatised and went through that process, its debts were guaranteed and are guaranteed by the Queensland government. While it had limitations on its activities, those guarantees may not have been of great concern but, once it becomes a bank, they ought be of concern and that ought to be a worry to all Queenslanders. Let us just get back to what the extent of this problem was. The State Bank of South Australia has so far cost the taxpayers of that state $3,200 million-over $3 billion lost the State Bank of South Australia so far. fiasco in Victoria in banking cost the taxpayshingle ers of Victoria $2,000 million, over $2 billion. Now we have the Goss government going down the same track of getting banking business. Make no mistake: the QIDC is operating a high-risk area. It is essentially lending industry. It is not engaged in lending for home loans, which of course is the safe end of the lending spectrum, by and large. And Queenslanders might not be aware that, by virtue of this authority, it is authorised operate in the derivatives market. I do not Queensland. want to overstate that because, frankly, I am relieved from discussions I have had with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and others ties involved in the derivatives area that there is no real cause for concern about our banks' activities in respect of derivatives, which a genuine part of their operations. Of course, there may be a Nick Leeson hanging around there somewhere. I am not suggesting he would be but, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank told the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration on 20 April: You cannot legislate against incompetence dishonesty. The fact is that this bank, QIDC, will be operating in a high-risk area, as were the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria. Honourable members and should look at the losses they made. I am casting aspersions on the board of the QIDC at all. It happens to be a very well balanced and qualified board, but the point we are making is that there has been some obfuscabecoming tion by the Queensland Treasurer· about whether it was a bank of not. It is a bank and it is operating as a bank. It is guaranteed the Queensland government, and that ought be up-front. Why has the Treasurer of Queensland not admitted that this is the case? At least what he is doing in Queensland would then be in the open. If and when he does do that, Queenslanders should ask themselves: why does the Queensland government want to down that track when everywhere by proved to be a disaster? In fact, people are The heading back in the other direction. But the is up. The QIDC is opening branch offices in southern states. In those states it is seeking retail funds. It is competing in the into the retail sector for funds. That is another fundamental objection in Queenslanders ought to have: the QIDC is to competing with the private sector on less than a level playing field. It has, by virtue of its government guaranteed status, a position of preference as far as credit rating is concerned. That it is competing in the private sector is of to concern to me and should be of concern to We see with the Goss government's activiin this respect that it is no different from any of its relatives in the southern states. It is just a few years behind its southern and are western counterparts, who have all since been thrown out of office, as they might well have been, for their ineptitude and the fact that they cost, by virtue of their entrepreneurial activities, ratepayers in their respective states thousands of millions of dollars. The Treasurer. in Queensland is entitled to rely on the prudential supervision of the or Reserve Bank. That is the peg upon which he hangs his hat in respect of this issue. That might be some comfort, but in the end that is not what this issue is about. There was unofficial supervision of the state banks of Victoria South Australia, but that certainly did not not save them. We know-it is on the public record-the Reserve Bank was well aware of the potential dangers faced by those institutions months in advance of those dangers public. So prudential supervision is not in any sense a guarantee of performance. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank by admitted in a meeting of the committee of to which I am deputy chairman, we cannot legislate or guarantee against incompetence. This bank will be operating as a business and taking risks in the high-end risk spectrum of out the marketplace in Queensland. We hope it does well. It is performing well now, but it is venturing into a new and distinct area of go operation, and Queenslanders should be else it has warned about that. To date our objection and that of the state opposition in Queensland has been that the Treasurer has failed to come clean and tell the people of Queensland the fact about this matter: he wants to get into the banking business. Why does he want to get into the banking business? We are not quite sure about that, but he still manages to maintain his position that this is an argument about semantics-about whether or not it is a bank. The point is that it is a bank and he ought to come out and tell the people of Queensland that it is a bank. So far the Queensland government has had a very poor record for investment. I, frankly, do not trust it with a bank. As a Queenslander, I prefer the Queensland governmentor any (government when it comes down to it-not to be in the banking business. I certainly do not trust the Goss Labor government with a bank. The Goss Labor government invested $6 million in Compass Airlines. That was a brilliant investment! Most of us watching were quite aghast that a state government would want to get into that business at all, let alone so unadvisedly. It only had to look a little beyond its nose to realise what a high risk little venture that was. The government did its $6 million in a matter of hours. The money lasted hardly any time at all. The Indy car race is another example. So far the Queensland government has endured an accumulated loss of around $80 million. We are not quite sure of the extent of the loss because the government has not told us the entire story. It has cost the Goss government, therefore the taxpayers of Queensland, between $8 million and $15 million a year. We are told the race has an economic impact of $30 million a year. By that I assume the government is telling us that the race cost X amount but the government is getting a return. I happen to doubt the veracity of those figures. I am not casting aspersions so much on the accountants who prepared them but rather on the government that trotted them out as some justification for that particular investin ment. Those of us who live on the Gold Coast remain very sceptical. We are not sceptical of the event, except those in Surfers Paradise who are directly affected by the race either because of the noise or because of the effect it has on their businesses. More broadly, we are concerned about why the government should besubsidising it to the extent that it is. We also have some definite and understandable doubts as to whether the event is having that economic impact or how the economic impact is measured because it tends to be such an intangible thing. The plain fact of the matter is that governments are not good at picking winners. I doubt that we ought to have any confidence in the capacity of the Goss government to operate a bank. I say that governments are not good at picking winners, but Labor governments in particular are very bad when it comes to picking winners. In the end they spend other people's money, and sooner or later they fail. There could be no clearer example than this federal Labor government. It has irresponsibly punched this country headlong into an enormous debt burden that will not be repaid by our children or grandchildren. That is an example of how every Labor government in the history of this country, at both the state and federal level, has ultimately proved itself to be incapable of running the country's affairs on a responsible level. I believe this federal government is as culpable as any other has been. The people of Queensland need to be warned about what the Queensland government is doing in respect of the QIDC. I would like to congratulate Mrs Sheldon, the state shadow Treasurer, who has taken up this issue publicly on a number of occasions in both the parliament and other places. She has taken a stand on this issue on behalf of the people of Queensland. She has asked questions that should be answered and have not been answered. Perhaps in the course of the election campaign broader questions may arise about the future of Suncorp and the QIDC and whether fact they might be sold for the benefit of Queensland. The Premier himself said in the Queensland parliament not so long ago: State governments should not be in the banking and insurance business. Yet, despite those words, the Queensland government is rushing headlong down the track of getting into the banking business. No doubt there will be some opposition in the Queensland Labor Party to the sale of those particular instrumentalities but that is the way the rest of Australia is moving. Even here there is a move to sell the Commonwealth Bank, and for very good reasons too. We support that sale but we do not support what will be done with the money. It will be a misuse of the money that will be raised. In principle, governments do not need to be in the banking business. Even the federal Labor Party, for one reason or another, has come to that realisation. All the states except Queensland have certainly come to that realisation somewhat because they have had their fingers very badly burned. Apparently the Goss government has not learned any lessons at all from that and wants to get into the banking business. If the Queensland government were to sell Suncorp and the QIDC, I am sure the money raised from their sale could be put to very good use in Queensland. I could suggest a number of very worthwhile ventures in my electorate that could benefit from the money. We really need some money spent on roads. I will not get too far off the track here, but if I were allowed to I would have prepared a wish list of things that we could put those proceeds towards.",62
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Hollis)We will not allow that.,65
55,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I know, and I am not going to tempt you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We want to make the point in this debate that the people of Queensland need to be warned. They need to be made aware of this fact because the Queensland government has failed to make them aware. The members of the Queensland opposition have attempted to do so, and we on this side of the House are helping them by making the people of Queensland aware that this should be an election issue. As I said at the outset, this not be a first order issue. There are a lot more important concerns relating to the credibility of the Goss government-law and order, health and some of the other disasters that have befallen the people of Queensland. The sale of Suncorp and QIDC ought to be an election issue because it gets to the very fundamental issues and credibility about what governments ought to be about. The people of Queensland need to understand that, in terms of the banking business, their government is going in the opposite direction to every other government. I believe that the Queensland Treasurer has been less than honest in his dealings with this matter. He should have come clean. He should have said, 'Yes, we're getting into the banking business and this is why we're doing it.' He has not done that. I believe the people of Queensland need to be well aware that, with the passage of this legislation today, we are giving the Queensland government a blank cheque with regard to the banking industry. The people of Queensland should be very worried about this in view of what has happened in other states.",65
56,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"Capricornia) (2.11 p.m.)I am pleased to speak in support of the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995. This bill seeks to bring the Queensland Industry Development Corporation under the. prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I was interested to hear the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) talk about Compass. It is my understanding that his colleague the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was most enthusiastic about the government putting taxpayers' money into Compass. As usual there is very little policy cohesion on the opposition side. We certainly should take a great deal of notice of what the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who spoke earlier in this debate, has to say. I refer to the member's attempt at policy when he was the opposition spokesperson on regional and rural development. He stated: It is important when considering initiatives in the portfolio of Regional and Rural Developmentwill that is an issue that is most important in relation to the QIDCto distinguish between those which are essentially beneficial to the development of Australian regions and those which will win the Coalition seats in regional Australia He went on to say in relation to infrastructure investment: We need to set a figure ($1 billion, $3 billion-the actual number is insignificant) as an indication of our commitment to putting roads, dams, port, airports, bridges, whatever, into regional Australia. He further stated: A new roadlbridge etc is a proven electoral winner. That is what the member for Maranoa said when he was the opposition spokesperson on regional and rural development. How have those opposite moved on in the area of effective financial responsibility-an issue that they have made much of in this debate on the QIDC coming under the prudential supervision of RBA? The current spokesperson on this issue, Senator Macdonald, a Queensland senator, spends a lot of his time putting out press releases. He outlined his grand vision in this area to the shadow cabinet in Cairns recently. He stated: The policy indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long term visionary projects we would specifically like the Coun-il to investigate and prioritise, for example: DarwIn to Alice Railway, turning coastal waters inlandthat is always a good policy for the National Party in Central Queensland; it always wants to tum the rivers aroundrejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin, Adelaide Airport. This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them. That is the sort of economic responsibility we can expect from the federal opposition. Those opposite are now engaging in a political point scoring exercise by having a crack at the Queensland government. Politics is the game we are in and I have no problem with those on either side of the House getting into the political debate, but I think it shows the opposition's lack of policy when the best the member for MCPherson can say is that it wants the QIDC to be a bank. It is quite clear from the statements of the Queensland Treasurer that the government is trying to make sure that the financial status and independence of the QIDC are protected and that it has very high prudential standards. That is why it is entering into this technical arrangement as far as the QIDC is concerned. It is quite clear that what it is requesting of the Commonwealth government is that the QIDC be defined as a bank under section 5 of the Banking Act. That section requires it to be a bank in only a technical sense. The QIDC is not going to be competing with the private sector. It is interesting that those opposite are from the so-called party of competition but, when you suggest a bit of real competition, they say, 'We don't want that. We mustn't have a level playing field here.' The real intent of this legislation is to ensure that there is proper supervision of the QIDC. In doing this, the Queensland government is prepared to refer certain powers to the Commonwealth government. In addition to what the Reserve Bank of Australia will do, the Queensland government has in place very effective supervisory arrangements. As my colleagues the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) have previously said, when the Goss government came to power in 1989 an independent report indicated that the QIDC's management had been very poor. There was political interference in commercial matters, cases of commercial conflict of interest with directors and staff, lack of board leadership, poor or no risk management systems in place, and instances of abuse of the schemes of assistance administered by the government schemes division of the QIDC. This effectively meant that the organisation of the QIDC was at very high risk of failure. That had to be turned around, as did a lot of major difficulties that were the legacy of years of Joh's management of Queensland. The corporatisation of the QIDC under the government's own Corporations Act ca-e into being on 1 October 1994. Its mam purpose was to ensure that the taxpayers of Queensland received the full benefits while at the same time being exposed to minimum risk. What we have ensured not only in the Queensland parliament but also here as part of this bill is that those statutory arrangements are effective. One of the important things that the government has done is to move community based facilities, such as the rural adjustment scheme, into an entirely separate organisation. I know this has been most important in the effective operation of the Rural Adjustment Authority and in getting Commonwealth government assistance to people who have been affected by drought. It also means that funds associated with the QIDC are now available to provide investment into core enterprise operations. Mr Katter-You reckon the drought doesn't exist.",65
57,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"We have the member for Kennedy interjecting as usual. I was quite prepared to listen in silence to the member for MCPherson, but it is just too hard for the member for Kennedy to restrain himself. What we do not see from the member for Kennedy is restraint in any direction. After all, he was a member of the Bjelke-Petersen government. Therefore, he has a great deal of responsibility for the criticisms that those of us on this side of the House are making in this debate. As we have moved a number of the community service obligations out of the QIDC, we have a much more effective operation. However, that does not mean that we, with the QIDC, are moving away from supporting rural investment. If you look at the loan book of the QIDC, you see that as recently as 1992 rural sector loans made up 67 per cent of the total loan book. So the QIDC is still very heavily supporting rural and regional development. However, the reliance on a one-industry sector approach constitutes a major commercial risk. It has diminished over time. It has achieved a much more balanced portfolio. Currently, the rural sector represents about 50 per cent of the QIDC's loan book. That indicates a very proper management of development in Queensland. The one thing that is quite clear-I suspect we will not hear it from the member for Kennedy because I heard his contribution in a debate yesterday-is that, while beef and in particular coal mining are major industries for export not only for Queensland but for the country, the great challenge for Queensland is to diversify its industrial and manufacturing base and to bring on stream other competitive export enterprises. What we do know is that commodities are at the mercy of international trading cycles. It is very important to have an effective investment operation in Queensland to provide for that investment. I think the Queensland government has been very successful in the turnaround of the QIDC, giving it a much more effective financial position. That also means that it is part of the achievement of the Queensland government not only to become the only state that is net debt free but also by June 1996 to have expected net assets of $1.6 billion. We are not servicing debt in Queensland because of the prudent financial management of the Goss government, including the Treasurer, Mr de Lacy. My colleague the member for Leichhardt quoted the Natwest Capital Market's report State of the states. I think it is worth repeating. In October 1994, it reported: . . . it would be hard to find a national or subnational government anywhere in the world that has a superior financial position to Queensland ... That is not a bad financial reference. It means that not only are we not servicing debt in Queensland but also we have more money to spend on infrastructure and community services. This equates to there being $2 billion more now available to not only keep taxes down but also provide quality infrastructure and community services. A Queensland government report recently indicated massive infrastructure projects. I am particularly delighted to see that Central Queensland will be the recipient of those. This is going to mean investment into regional and rural areas of Queensland which will translate into jobs and support in areas where we need it. Mr Katter-What are those projects?",67
58,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"In my own area, Central Queensland, the government will be providing increased dam infrastructure which is vital, particularly to the coal industry and to the agricultural industry-issues that I would have thought the member for Kennedy would be interested in. Effectively, that is about $9 billion worth of proposals. Mr Katter-What are they?",67
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member for Kennedy is listed to speak next. He will have his opportunity then.,68
60,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"Effectively, this blueprint includes public sector reform, micro-economic reform, further tax concessions but $9 billion worth of infrastructure, programs for development of education and training, research and development, trade and investment. The problem with the National Party is that it can only think about dams and railways, but one of the most effective infrastructure developments is training and developing people skills, human resources, so they can make a contribution to the service sector, which is making a huge contribution to our export income. So we have $3.6 billion worth of capital expenditure already allocated in the budget. Infrastructure spending has increased enormously under the Goss Labor government. For instance, I will mention the family services portfolio. In 1989-90 the budget for the Department of Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs was $159.57 million. Today, in the current budget, it is $500.9 million. So there has been an increase not only in family services but in police, education and hospitals. We had to tum around years and years of neglect. What is happening to the QIDC's operations in Central Queensland? Just yesterday the official opening of the new premises in Emerald took place. At that opening the chairman stated that the loan book for the branch had gone past $100 million, which makes it one of the largest loan books of any branch of any financial institution in Queensland regional areas. There has been a necessity, both in Rockhampton and Emerald, to move to larger premises and put on more staff because of the development of business investment in those regions. This is also happening at the Mackay and Longreach branches. QIDC's economics department has just completed a study of the beef cattle industry, with particular reference to Central Queensland, to assist with trade and finance for the export of live cattle. This is one of the key issues in my region of Central Queensland and is very important to our economy. The Queensland government is effectively providing support for the cattle industry. That is all just too hard for members of the the National Party because they are still back in the bad old days of pork-barrelling and providing a bit of infrastructure here and there to win a few votes. Of course, at that time that was a lot easier because we had a gerrymander. The National Party could govern in its own right with 36 per cent of the vote. We have moved a long way from that period of corruption. This bill is about finalising arrangements that have already been put in place by the state government, having learned from the mistakes made in other states about the support of various state banks. The kind of furphy the member for MCPherson peddles is that state governments cannot be responsible in providing infrastructure investment. What is very clear from these arrangements is that the Reserve Bank will have very effective powers of supervision. The Queensland government itself has effective auditing requirements in place to make sure that not only will the QIDC work in the interests of investment in Queensland, but also taxpayers' money will be effectively looked after. In fact, it has already made a profit and will continue to make a profit and put money back into the Treasury for further infrastructure investment and for further services to the people of Queensland. The problem for the opposition in the state campaign is that they have not got any policies. They have no track record of financial management on which they can build. Therefore, we are having particular debates in this House along the lines of the ones the opposition is running on this bill and ran yesterday in the MPI on the poverty issue. The opposition can run those arguments and can put that case, but the track record of the Goss government is that of a very effective financial manager. What it is doing with the QIDC indicates its responsibility. Making the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority a separate organisation has meant effective Commonwealth support for primary producers in my electorate and in other parts of Queensland who are still suffering from drought. There is a lot of money available there. I am glad to see that the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority is advertising the fact that it would like to talk to· primary producers who are in difficulty. This is about efficient, effective and responsible management of the state finances of Queensland, and indeed it is about the Commonwealth government taking an approer, priate role to provide a technical definition banking. The QIDC will still be an mechanism for the benefit of the people of Queensland.",68
61,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"I not want to spend too much of my time commenting on the speeches of speakers, but their speeches have been so priceless that I really must make some comthose words. ments. I will deal first with the previous speaker, the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). She stated-and I noted it downthat the National Party in Queensland used to ruling under a gerrymander. We have never had a minority government; we have had a majority of the vote in every election. The honourable member for Capricornia sits here as a member of a minority government. The Labor Party did not win a majority of votes in the last election campaign. The honourable member should not come in here and talk about a gerrymander when the Labor Party is in that situation. She ought to check her facts before she starts shooting her mouth off. She is an intellectual lightweight with no a while. substance at all behind her. Let me move on. She said that the National Party only thinks of railways and dams. Deputy Speaker, shame upon us to only think of railways and dams! But the reason she that we only think of railways and dams, and that in a previous speech she commented on how they were building all these marvellous dams, is that in six years they have not built a single solitary weir in the state of Queensof land. We were building one every",69
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I take it that the honourable member is going to get to the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995.,69
63,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. But with all due respect, I would like to see her speech and discover how much she spoke about the QIDC.",69
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I was listening very carefully.,69
65,Mr KA TTER,PAIRS,"It would be hard to find any references whatsoever. Mr Deputy SpeakI take your point. Let me move on. She of said, 'We make investments in people.' investment Presumably, this was through",69

69,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with all due respect, that is the fourth time you was have interrupted me now.",69
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I have asked you to come to the bill. I am also reminding you that, according to the standards of the House, you will refer to members by their correct titles. The title of the honourable the member to whom you are referring is the honourable member for Capricornia, not 'she'. Mr Moore-Is she not a she?",69
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"If you are going to be smart, perhaps you can leave for",69
72,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to get on with the speech. The Mr honourable member who spoke previously was talking about projects. I interrupted her put three times because I was quite curious to know what the projects were. That was not a facetious comment-I was really interested in what the projects were. She stood up and said, 'We had all these projects, $9 billion worth them,' but there was no substance in her two years. speech whatsoever. In the state house in Queensland, my knees used to knock when Tom Burns got up to speak. Unlike all three of the ALP speakers whom I have heard previously in this debate today, when he stood up to speak he had substance. He never opened his mouth unless he had hard facts behind what he said. People used to tremble when he stood up. It was very hard for me to pin down a single solitary statistic or fact from the speeches of the three previous ALP speakers-and I have been taking notes on all three speeches. Let me move' on to the issue of corruption, which is very relevant to this debate. The state banks in Victoria and South Australia failed completely, . losing thousands of millions of dollars for those states. All ALP speakers who have spoken prior to me have got stuck into the corruption of the Queensland government. It is really very good, in so far as we can objectively assess the relative corruption levels in Queensland and in the three ALP states by the royal commissions that were held in all four statesThe losses to the public purse in Queensland are fully documented; $26,000 was lost to the public purse. That was defined, firstly, as 'the private usage of the government car'. Members in this place have access to a government car which they are allowed to use for private purposes-,-yet Brian Austin went to gaol for it. The second reason he went to gaol was that he used his plastic magic to take people out to dinner. His was the leading case. Everyone in line behind himjust said, 'They're going to throw us all in gaol' and they pleaded guilty. But on the record, the charges that were laid involved $26,000. The losses to the public purse in Western Australia were $876 million. The losses to the public purse in Victoria were $3,000 million. The losses to the public purse in the South Australian State Bank collapse were $3,100 million. That puts this matter in perspective. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are looking for corruption, let me quote the famous old policeman-a legendary policeman in his lifetime-old Ben MCNicoll in Brisbane, the great crime buster. Ben used to say, 'Have a look at their houses, have a look at what they own, have a look at whether they have any wealth, and you will see who was corrupt and who wasn't.' I would simply point the attention of this House to the wealth of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to the wealth of the last Prime Minister and also to the wealth of our former leader in Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Peterse.n. Mr DEPUTY 8PEAKER-I would also point your attention to the fact that you have yet to come. to the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill. r have let you make a few points because you were saying you were answering previous speakers who spoke before I took the of the chair. But now I want you to come to the contents of the bill we are debating. If you continue as you have been, you will have to sit down. I have allowed you to have a fairly wide range. Now I want you to come to the bill we are actually debating. It has nothing to do with the wealth of Prime Ministers past or present.",69
73,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I must make",70
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Do not argue. I have given my ruling. If you cannot follow it, you can sit down.",70
75,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,You have given your ruling; am I allowed to speak now?,70
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Go on. You can speak to the bill we are debating in this chamber.,70
77,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"I would like to make the point that we are talking about corruption. Every speaker who has spoken so far has spoken about corruption. With the collapse of two banks in Australia, we lost $6,100 million. Corruption is at the very heart of the debate we are talking about, and that is why I am canvassing these issues. If three ALP speakers are allowed to get up here and absolutely vilify the National Party in Queensland and I am not allowed to reply or even defend the performance of those people with respect to a state bank that was set up by the Queensland government, I put it to you, Deputy Speaker, that my chances of getting a fair go here are very small. But you are the referee, so I will listen to your ruling.",70
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I will just answer that. The previous occupant of this chair, the member for Cook (Mr Dobie), did call members' attention at several times back to the bill. I am only following the rulings that he gave. I have allowed you to make fairly wide ranging comments because you did say you were responding to the comments of the honourable member for Capricornia, but I want you to come to the bill now. I see nothing in this very short bill about collapsing banks and corruption, and I have the bill here.",71
79,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are taking my time. Please can I say what I have a right to say in this place?",71
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Stick to the bill.,71
81,Mr KA TTER,PAIRS,"You have taken three minutes of my time. Let me talk about the Polichronis report on QIDC. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) was quite right in saying that I was very heavily involved. I was in fact the secretary of the review committee of QII)c. I read the Polichronis report and analysed it in great detail. I found it absolutely staggercent. ing that the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Leichhardt and the member for Capricornia stood in this place and said that the report referred'to corruption. There was not a single reference in the Polichronis report to corruption, from the first page to the last page. The report was highly technical and demonstrated classical economic rationalism throughout. Clearly the three members who quoted extensively from the report had no- read it. They had absolutely no idea what was in the Polichronis report. Polichronis recommended that QIDC stop being an agricultural bank or anything of that nature and be,come a: purely commercial bank. The reason he recommended this is that he believed QIDC should offer purely commercial interest rates, not preferential interest rates. At that stage, all of QIDC's loans to the public were at two per cent less than those being offered by commercial banks in Queensland. He was reflecting the attitudes, philosophy and self-interest of the other banks in Queensland. Our policy was completely opposite to that. In fact, Bill Gunn, the Deputy Premier of Queensland, and I served on the committee of review, and we said, 'In a commercial field, we can borrow the money at two per cent less than the banks; therefore, we can loan it out at two per cent less. We can choose our blue chip lendings.' Quite frankly, we thought that, if that was going to be to the detriment of the private banks, that was a criticism we would have to bear. I do not think anyone in Australia--even our harshest cri-ics-ever accused us of incoll).petence when it came to financial administration. Heaven only knows how we left the state in such good order, but we did it with our policy and philosophy. Polichronis threw that out completely. This is the staggering part of the report. Interest rates were 20 per cent at that time. Polichronis· advocated that we abolish all of the special loan funding arrangements via the QIDC special lending arrangements to people in trouble in small business or the farming sector. He said that that should be abolished and the interest rates should become 20 per He got his way, even though it was over the broken backs of tens of thousands of Queensland small businessmen on the land and in the cities. That is what happened as a result of the Polichronis report. I wish to heaven that the members who spoke before me knew something about the report or had read the report's foreword. They made mention of the fact that the Queensland government is in a very strong and sound financial way and its resources are in a marvellous way and, therefore, it should be a,llowed to run the bank in a right and proper manner. Previous speakers on our side pointed out the ALP's record in running state banks. The State Bank of Victoria fell over, with a loss of $3,000 million. The South Australian State Bank broke that record and fell over with a loss of $3,100 million. I would have thought it would be the last thing on the planet that an ALP government would want to become involved in. But that is what is happening here today. The Queensland government is going into the field of banking. If you looked at Rothwells as a state bank-if I could be facetious and say that Rothwells was a state bank-you would see that it fell over, with a loss of $1,000 million, as well. We come to whether these people are capable of running the financial administration of Queensland. Quite rightly, the speakers from the government side said yesterday that the poverty report in Queensland was a 1990 report. It was a 1990 report. It would be very unfair to blame the present Queensland government for that 1990 report. So what did I do? I got the figures out and upgraded the report to find out whether or not the government in Queensland was culpable. I suspected that things were going all right in Queensland and the figures would not be as bad as the ones in the report. The first statistics that I chose, naturally, were the figures for average weekly earnings. I found out that Queensland has by far and away the lowest average weekly earnings in the entire nation. In Queensland average weekly earnings are $496 a week, whereas for our. two neighbours, the Northern Territory and New South Wales, average weekly earnings are $593 a week-almost $100 more in the Northern Territory, and almost $70 a week more in New South Wales, with $567. The only other state that was low was South Australia, with $522, which is still miles ahead of Queensland on $496 average weekly earnings. Even more worrying for Queensland is that it is the only state in Australia where average weekly earnings have fallen since 1993. So if the situation was bad in 1990, it is now. Yet these are the people who are saying to us that they should be running a state bank. The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, said that we on this side of the House do not take into account investment in people. That was the expression she used. It is very unfortunate that she used that expression because investment in people comes down to education, for example. In Queensland we have the lowest retention rate in Australia, with the exception of South Australia, for people between 15 and 24 years of age-which is the education age, if you like, We have the lowest TAFE participation rate in Australia. Those two things come under the auspices of the state government. In Queensland gross state product per head of mean population is the lowest in Australia, household disposable income is the lowest in Australia and its main income source is government benefits. We are the second highest in Australia there. Only South Australia has more people on the public purse in Australia. It pips us out there, but then Mr Bannon gave South Australia a great head start on us. I have already mentioned the mean total weekly earnings of all employees. So in every indicator that exists in Australian social trends, which one of the other ALP speakers was referring to as the social wage, Queensland is the worse in Australia bar two, and in both those cases we are slightly behind South Australia. In the other six we are well ahead of South Australia and are the worse in Australia. As far as the retention rates in schools go, everyone of the speakers has said, 'Queensland has had a massive increase in spending on education.' It has massively increased spending on education. Ms Crawford-Well, they had to.",71
82,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"You are dead right. But this is how effective it has been. The retention rates to grade 12 have fallen from 85 per cent to 78 per cent. There has been a massive increase in spending and it has a hell of a lot less people in schools. All I can say is, that demonstrates the state government's towering incompetence. Yet it is saying to us, 'Give us a lot worse control of the state bank.' I did not use the arguments about the social wage; the other side used the arguments about the social wage. If we come to health, which is part of the social wage, the Queensland government says, 'We're good managers, we're spending more on health.' Yes, it is. There has been a massive increase in spending on health. But what is happening on the ground? This is a staggering statistic. I had enormous difficulty believing it. The Queensland government has cut the number of beds at the Townsville General Hospital, which is the biggest hospital north of Brisbane, from 540 to 360. Of course, if you cut the number of beds, the queues extend right out into street and people die because they simply cannot get attention fast enough.",72
83,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,73
84,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"Yes, they have. I cannot help speak for other parts of the state, but all keep hearing on the radio is that things are dreadful in other parts of the state. But I know that over 1,000 people in Mareeba, almost one-seventh of its population, turned up for a mass meeting after beds were rerately moved from the Mareeba hospital, and that 230 people in Tully, about 10 per cent of population, and 500 people in Charters taking Towers turned out for mass meetings because health services were being cut right across the board in Queensland. The Queensland government massively increased spending on education, but there are 10 per cent fewer people in schools now than before. It massively increased spending on health, but fewer people now have beds than before. It has kicked all the people out into the streets. As for housing, each of the previous speakers said that there has been a massive increase in housing. But housing starts in Queensland are down 21 per cent. I would not trust Labor with a piggy bank, let alone a state bank. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",73
85,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"It assistance from my very intelligent colon leagues. This is not my chosen ground fight on; the ALP chose to fight on its inve-t­ ment in people. Each of the speakers has srud, 'We've invested all this money.' They have, and they have invested it so toweringly incompetently that we have the lowest numa ber of housing approvals in Australia. On front page of the Courier-Mail, which is no great supporter of the government, it says 'Lowest housing approvals in Australia: a dip of 21 per cent'. I agree with that. The ment is spending more money on housing, education and health than it ever has before, and in each case it has a disastrous record. I do not hesitate to say that we looked to QIDC taking $2,000 million in lendings in go across. Queensland. We were after blue-chip because we could get it. We could lend the money out the at two per cent less than the money coming in. We could choose the sorts of people we wanted to lend to, and obviously housing was a very attractive area to us. The profits we got from that area would have been repatriated to small business, which is staggering under I the load imposed by the federal government, which took interest rates up over 20 per cent do for the first time in Australian history and which took bankruptcies from 4,000 a year to 17 ,000 a year. At that time we were despetrying to help these people in small business, whether they were in a town or on its a farm, and we thought we could do that by the profit from the $2,000 million and repatriating it into this other area. Each of the previous speakers referred to the disastrous mess that QIDC was in. When we handed QIDC over to the incoming Goss government, it had the lowest delinquency rate of any bank in Australia-and that is in the Polichronis report. Those opposite not only have not read the report but also have come in here and told flagrant untruths. I do not think they were lying, because I do not think any of the three people, who are world champion lightweights, made any attempt to check the facts that were given to them by the state government in Queensland.

86,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"Dawson) (2.49 is a delight to speak in the debate the Banking (Queensland Industry Develto opment Corporation) Amendment Bill after the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), because all the misrepresentations made by government members, who were allowed to go on with them, have been adequately answered by person who was there, in the Queensland the government, at the time and who obviou-ly participated. The suggestion about exte-sIve corruption being endemic in the NatIOnal Party time and the reference to the QIDC - re governobviously ploys by them for the commg election. Premier Goss may now have some regrets that he allowed himself to c-ll - n election before this matter was debated m thIS House, because it does give us a full range to The bill itself is a simple one. In fact, it is just a few pages in length. The most significant part of the bill is the proposed amendment to section 5(1) of the Banking Act to include the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. That is the nub of the whole bill. What will this give the QIDC that it does not have now? If you look at the Reserve Bank and its supervisory powers-for a large part of the last 13 years the Treasury has been the responsibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as the Treasurer-you will see that the protection offered under the Banking Act is not as great as it seems. Mention has already been made of what happened to other state banks, in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, under supervision. The member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) was a member of the banking committee inquiry into the banking system following deregulation. The massive incompetence in the supervision of those three enterprises, particularly the South Australian bank, is on the record and is quite evident. We also found during that inquiry that, while the QIDC was being operated by the Labor Queensland government, there was a lot the QIDC had to answer and account for. That was at the time of those high interest rates imposed by the Treasurer of the day, the present Prime Minister. I well recall going to Charleville at that time and having it explained to us what the QIDC administration was doing for. those people with rural loans and the manner in which it was trying to collect debts from people who were suffering from the vicious droughts and under those high interest rates. It is no panacea for the QIDC to be included in this bill, particularly if the record of the South Australian and the Victorian state banks is anything to go by. It was interesting to sit here and listen to the earlier comments of the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). He obviously had not read the report that was referred to. I doubt whether he was in Queensland at the time. I have grave doubts as to whether the member for Leichhardt was a Queenslander at that time. Mr KaUer-No, he was not. You're right.",73
87,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"That is right. If we go back to the start of the QIDC in Queensland, we see that the opposition supported its formation. It was obviously a transitional stage. It was formed out of the Rural Reconstruction Board, and it also took up the Agricultural Bank facilities. Let us not be embarrassed about what the Agricultural Bank and the QIDC were set up to do. They were set up so that higher risk loans could be made to the people on the land. Those loans were made for a purpose. They were made for .the development of the farming and grazing sectors of Queensland. The farming and grazing sectors still help out to a large extent the balance of trade. Advantages were also being given by the Commonwealth. The bank was set up to make sure the resources of Australia were strengthened. We have heard of the repayment of the debt that the Labor government has been able to effect over the last six years. I can recall that the day the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, arrived on the treasury bench the headline in the Courier-Mail-not a friend of ours-was that the set of accounts handed over to the Labor government was the most competent of any legacy given to a Labor government in any state in Australia. That is on the record. It does not matter how much it is denied or how much that is corrupted by the government, that is a fact. Since I have referred to the repayment of the debt, I should say that the debt was created by providing resources through the Agricultural Bank and others to make the farming sector strong, provide us with powerhouses, railway electrification, mining ventures, roads, dams, weirs and water conservation. It is all those sorts of things that have made Queensland great. If we had a $4 billion dollar loan on that type of productive infrastructure, think in terms of what has happened since. We have a nil debt, apparently. But we do not have any major water conservation scheme. We have tolls being put on our roads. Our railways are to cease operating. Worst of all, we are now to buy power from New South Wales. We cannot produce enough power. Our resource is unemployed people. Our resource is a highly funded hospital system and education system and all the other systems catering to a lower degree of need or want than they were before. It seems strange to me that the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) comes in here to complain about these things when at the beginning of the year he was complaining about his own redistribution. If it looks as though things are not going his way he is the chief complainant. He said that Mr Longmans, the redistributor in Queensland, was biased and did not understand the principles of his act. So much for the member for Moreton. The QIDC was established initially to provide rural loans at reasonable risk rates and reasonable interest rates. When people criticise the board they must remember that the initial chairman, Graham Tucker, was a very competent person. He never saw eye to eye all the time with the Premier of the day but he was able to bring a degree of integrity to that bank which I believe has survived to this day. It is still providing a larger range activities to the industry of Queensland than it did before and certainly at a higher rate. This brings me to the point: what are the activities of the bank? I want to mention, in particular, its activities in connection with rural reconstruction. Rural reconstruction was the activity of the old Agricultural Bank right back in the early days. It is important to understand that the bank will continue to be the distributor of these funds. While I have a lot of respect for some people working within the rural reconstruction area and the rural adjustment area, I believe that the QIDC and the government of Queensland are profiting by the fact that this money is not getting out as readily as it should to those people in grave need. Part of my electorate is now going through the fifth year of drought. I can speak for a lot of the rest of Queensland that is not getting the funds required to help these rural people, experienced people on the land with a future in front of them. One aspect of the reconstruction where there seems to be a deficiency-and I have heard this right throughout Queensland-is that the amount of funds to reconstruct farmers off the land and give them a place in a town or somewhere are only available if arrangements are made with the rural reconstruction area of the QIDC before the event of reconstructing that debt with the major lenders. This has not always been the case. We have seen many people thrown off their property because of the lack of security, because of the high interest rates, with nothing to go to. Any application after that date is not a viable turnout. I did mention that the incorporation in 1986 of the QIDC was a move designed to assist, in particular, those people in rural Queensland. Since that time it has picked up many other aspects of help to industry, as the title suggests. In that period it has had a chequered history. There have been loan write-offs. We have heard the member for Kennedy say that in the time of the National Party government the write-off was the lowest of any of the banks throughout Australia. Since that time it has had massive write-offs of debt, particularlyon high risk ventures. I mention Compass of Airlines. I believe it lost on that. I am not sure whether it is putting money into the Indy participation on the Gold Coast, but obviously that is money that has gone too. So there has not been that same history of accountability, in spite of what the Labor government says. Perhaps the supervision to be given by the Reserve Bank will assist in some way in ensuring that that risk factor is not as high as before. But I say again: don't count on it too much because many banks in Australia have failed even with that supervision.",74
88,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member for Dawson will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",75
89,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I table ministerial arrangements and the standing of the second Keating ministry. It will show that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has been elected by the parliamentary Labor Party as Deputy Prime Minister, which is a great honour for him. He was elected unanimously. As I said in my public remarks, the sense of warmth and seamless commitment to the work of the government in the very gracious resignation of Brian Howe and the election of Kim Beazley unanimously I thought spoke volumes for the unity and cohesion within the government. Given the very long history of the Minister for Finance in major portfolios and his very deep commitment to this chamber and its processes, he has also decided to stay on as Leader of the House. Now when he speaks in the House he will speak with the added authority of being the Deputy Prime Minister of this government. NA Foreign Investment",75
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might say before I ask my question that the opposition had something to say yesterday about the Deputy Prime Minister's elevation. As with the French nuclear testing, this is a bit more catch-up politics by the Prime Minister. My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I remind him that after eight accords Australia now has the worse current account deficit in the industrialised world-worse even than Mexico. Prime Minister, what explanation can you offer for the disastrous slump in foreign investment in Australia other than your failure to tackle the current account deficit problem? Does the fact that foreign investment in Australian equity has fallen from $5,000 million in the March quarter of 1994 to just $20 million in the corresponding quarter this year not confirm the OECD's serious concerns that continuing high current account deficits threaten to drive foreign investors of Australia?",76
91,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bennelong every now and again returns to the current account deficit. Mr Downer-With good reason.,76
92,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. He returns in eSsence to one of the country's remaining problems: the paucity of private savings, which is the underlying reason for the current account imbalance. In doing so, he returns to the scene of the crime. He returns to the fact during his stewardship of economic policy in Australia, with double digit inflation he destroyed the propensity of Australians to save. Australians, bitten and burnt once, were not about to come back and lend their money to people at less than the inflation rate, as happened in the 1970s. There were negative rates of interest at some point in the 1970s with the rates of return being less than the inflation rate. Is it any wonder that we had a trend decline in private savings? After the former Labor government commissioned the Hancock committee to look at the introduction of a comprehensive superannuation scheme to approach· the savings issue in a direct way, the member for Bennelong said-I quote from his press statement-'The government has decided not to introduce the scheme of national superannuation recommended by the majority of the committee.'

104,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not only did he see that no mtegnty. paucity of private savings, but he also saw budget deficits under his stewardship go into a massive level of public sector dissaving. When he had the chance to do something about it with superannuation he did not. He said he wanted the freedom of choice individuals currently enjoyed in arranging their own affairs to be retained. When he had a policy of zero tax on contrimaking? bution, a zero tax on fund earnings and a five per cent tax on lump sums, we had less than 40 per cent of employees covered and only $40 billion in fund assets. We are heading now towards $1 trillion-that is, $1,000 billion-in fund assets and expect it to be trillion by the year 2020. That is why and how the government has responded to this. When Mr Howard was the Treasurer, he had an 18 per cent wages growth in 1980-81.

Could you imagine J.W. Howard, Treasurer, talking about a wages accord importance guaranteeing wage restraints to deliver to three per cent inflation rate? I-m-possible! As a consequence we have seen this enorThe mous change to the economy's competitiveAIRC ness, which is best shown by these two of $9 statistics: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable incomes since 1983. Is it any wonder that whenever the Liberals hear the word 'Accord' they start to say that they know in their hearts they could never deliver such a thing? They have faith in the Australian people. Above all els-, they' have no imagination and definitely . Accord Mark VIn",77
108,Mr HUMPHREYS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My very important question is directed to the Prime Minister and concerns the outstanding achievements announced today of Accord Mark VIII. Can the Prime Minister outline to the House the benefits which the Accord system brings to Australia as an instrument of national policy,77
109,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The eighth Accord comes after the successful seventh accord, which had an employment target of 500,000. We reached that target in two years and have now created $2 630,000 jobs since the time it was signed. This Accord shows that the Accord process of managing an economy-that is, not putting all the burden onto fiscal or monetary policy but having a third instrument such as wages-is the way that the Australian economy can best operated and run in the context of a set of cooperative agreements between the government, the work force and the trade union you'll movement of this country. I am happy to advise the House that the government has today agreed to and entered into its eighth accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions entitled Sustaining growth, low inflation and fairness. It states: This accord is based on and consistent with maintaining an underlying rate of inflation of 2 to 3 per that, cent on average over the cycle. talks about the prospect of creating 600,000 Jobs over the cycle of the agreement. It talks about the further extension of enterprise bargaining and the provision of an award safety net. It refers very specifically to the of putting a safety net under those a two people who cannot access the enterprise bargaining system. It states: Accord I?arties will support an approach to the to deliver three further annual adjustments to $12 per week available at the award level. For low paid workers, particularly those on award rates, this range will be $11 to $14 per week. This provides an element of redistributive support from the growth the economy is enjoying. It is that very great change to a flexible enterprise bargaining based system of industrial relations underpinned by the equity of a safety net, which is the quite revolutionary way in which Australia has changed from a centralised wage fixing system to a system that guarantees economic efficiency and equity-and it guarantees it with low inflation. Is it not a change to see the trade union movement of this country, under the Accord Mark VIII, committed to low inflation and sustaining economic growth? We should ponder for a moment the success of the accord. We had the original stabilisation of the economy in 1983 and its return to growth, the extension to superannuation and the productive and skills formation accords of the 1980s. Mr Reith-Like your banana republic statement! What about the one that led to the recession?",77
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Flinders will have his chance in the MPI.,78
111,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have seen the change to the award system through award restructuring and a shift to productivity, the devolution of the wage system away from centralised wage fixing to an enterprise bargaining system, with the seventh accord, jobs being put first with employment and the 500,000 jobs target and, now with the eight accord, sustainable growth with low inflation and fairness and equity. This is the model for running an OECD country with higher rates of growth than would normally be able to be obtained with low inflation and high productivity. We have developed skills changes in the labour market, coming under the accord, through productivity, award restructuring and the education and training system. We have come to the point where we can run a growth economy and can have a naturally contestable market producing volumes of productivity naturally from the system while holding the inflation rate down. If you look at the production of a sustainable rate of economic growth with low inflation you would find that the government has engaged three policy instruments in the last 12 months: adjustments to monetary policy late last year, which were relatively small; adjustments to fiscal policy through a strong change to the budget balance, but one that protects the social wage through outlays; and, there is a lot of weight on the third instrument, the accord and wages. By spreading the weight over the three instruments and not over two we did not have to pull the monetary lever hard with a massive increase in interest rates and we did not have to cut government spending to pieces. We have seen the economy come back to 3.7 per cent economic growth and we have seen inflation remain at low levels. This accord says that we will have low inflation and good growth for the coming four-year period. Could you imagine the coalition being able to produce a document like this providing low inflation for four years? Could you imagine those opposite having the wit or the courage or the faith in the Australian working person to actually enter into a real discussion of principle and integrity with them and producing in parliament a detailed document of commitments to a two to three per cent rate of inflation in this country and at the same time the equity under the safety nets, the equity of those people who cannot access the enterprise bargaining system? We saw in this parliament last week the sort of quality that we have coming from the opposition. The regional infrastructure policy document from the Liberal Party says: This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long-term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them. This is deceitful, unprincipled policy.",78

113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for O'Connor, resume your seat.",78
114,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the TWU?,78
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,78
116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Compare that unprincipled rubbish with the quality which the government has produced now in the Accord, following a budget which sees the budget go back into surplus, following the detail of all those changes and the accountability in the budget documents by the government. Now, point for point, all of these things have been articulated and committed to by the ACTO and the government. There is a stark contrast between the governrrient, which has policies that actually work, that are thought through and that are articulated, and the unprincipled, irrelevant nonsense of the Howard-led opposition. Is it any wonder they hate the Accord? Is it any wonder they hate the discussion with the trade union movement? We know what their policy is-to cut the wages of working people to pieces, to push them onto individual wage contracts, to turn them out of the award system, to not give them a share of the national economic cake and to not let them have part of the bounty which this country can afford. This is another milestone document in Australian economic history. It is the eighth principled agreement between the government and the work force. It is in public. It is there for all to see. It explains every point. It does it with integrity. The commitments are made with integrity. It is in very stark contrast with the shabby anti-Australian, anti-working class policies of the Howard-led opposition which cannot produce a policy statement beyond two pages without cynical, unprincipled elements to it. When given the opportunity to produce the so-called headland speech, it looked like the work of a year 1 freshman backbencher. At the end of question time, I will table a copy of the Accord Mark VIII document for all members to read and see that there is a better way of running Australia than simply constraining growth and crushing employment. Let me repeat what US Labour Secretary Robert Reich had to say. He said: The choice between an American style economy with high employment growth and low wages or a European economy with high wages and lousy employment is a fairly rotten choice. Australia has come right up the middle, and it has come up the middle again with Accord Mark VIII.",78

121,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In 1983 Australia's current account deficit was the fifth worse in the OECD; in 1984 our current account deficit was the fourth worse; in 1985 it was the third worse; by 1994 it was the worse, except for Mexico; and now it is the worse in the OECD-even worse than Mexico. Do you regard this as a result of policies that work? Do you regard this as a better way of running Australia or do you now concede your absolute failure on the current account deficit?",79

144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is not helping to set the example.,80
145,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On inflation, on profits, on investment, on wages growth-on all of these things-Australia was in a vulnerable position by the early 1980s, so much so that the current account deficit was six per cent of GDP in 1980-81. Our debt had risen from about five or six per cent of GDP to 30 per cent in the three years after the government came to office; that is, the long-term rot had produced a change in just three years of 30 per cent. In the period the government then substantially stabilised the growth of that debt, so today it is about 36 per cent or 37 per cent of GDP, from memory. That is with the placing offshore of $86 billion of Australian assets. In the imputation of the question from the deputy leader, he failed to mention the fact that we have offshore now $86 billion in private Australian assets, against $7 billion of private Australian assets in 1983-84. So there is $80 billion of our national debt sitting out there, which has basically been accommodated by this shift in assets offshore by Australians. That is because we have made the judgment that it is better to be in these markets in western Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific than to have the choice of saying that we would basically not have these placements abroad but have a lower level of offshore Australian debt. Obviously, in Australia's best interests it is better to have these assets offshore, but they must be part of the equation. They are part of the equation with the foreign exchange markets. They know this. That is why when they see the sorts of figures that the deputy leader is referring to they immediately put the other side of the ledger into the account-that is, $135 billion of offshore assets and the $86 billion of offshore private assets, of equity placements offshore. That is why the markets have a much better understanding of the quality of change in economic policy and the balance between the onshore debt and the offshore debt. Mr Downer-That's why they are not investing in Australia.",80
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Mayo!,81
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Notice that today we will not get any questions from the opposition about wages policy or about inflation because they are embarrassed to hell about the Accord Mark VIII again, as they always are. As if they could deliver a document saying, 'Here we are, we have sown up the work force to two per cent to three per cent· inflation over the next four years!' Could you imagine the breast-beating from opposition members if they were able to stand up with any voracity and say, 'We have come to an agreement with the work force to have two or three per cent inflation over the next four years; we have a commitment there to 600,000 jobs?' Could you imagine the breast-beating we would get from them? What are they about today? They are not about wages and not about inflation. Today it is only about the current account deficit. It is not about employment. It is not about investment. It is not about growth. It is not about exports. It is not about training and the labour market. It is not about the skills base. It is only about the current account deficit, without even acknowledging these great changes which have taken place and even this great policy change of today and the changes we have seen in Australian assets abroad. I am afraid the opposition is going to have to do much better. I repeat: the member for Bennelong will always return to the scene of the crime. He will always revisit his old work in the 1970s, or his lack of it, when the current account was at about six per cent of GDP in 1980-81 and former senator John Stone, as Secretary to the Treasury, said in that note to him in the last week of the 1983 election: 'Treasurer Howard, this is the biggest fiscal deterioration since the Second World War.' And Treasurer Howard kept it quiet in the dying days of the 1983 election. He hid it-so-called transparency and honesty in economic policy making! A few of us around here have a good memory for J.W. Howard's tricks, or the absence of them. Unemployment",81
148,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it also concerns Accord Mark VIII. Can the minister inform the House of the implications today's Accord agreement will have for employment growth? What will be the impact on the government's commitment to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000?",81
149,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, Accord Mark VIII has very significant and important implications for the government achieving its job target of five per cent unemployment or better by the year 2000. The government has been committed to the Working Nation initiatives, prior to this Accord, for achieving that target. It is interesting to observe that· in Monday's Sydney Morning Herald Ross Gittins, having talked about the things that are important to get unemployment down and also paying due regard to the initiatives under Working Nation, said: So, if all these things come together ... we may come a lot closer to 5 per cent unemployment in 2000 than many people dare to hope. I think it is a very important recognition by a significant economics writer that these are policies that are working. Today, Accord Mark VIII is another one of those significant things coming together. What Accord Mark VIII does is commit the parties, and the trade union movement in particular, to working with the government to achieve a minimum 600,000 new jobs over the life of the agreement. Another important dimension of the Accord is the way in which it describes the significance of achieving that five per cent target. It says: So important is the jobs target to the social and economic well-being of Australia, that the union movement agrees that wage claims will be assessed against satisfactory progress being made on the employment goal. In other words, not only is it an Accord that is important for jobs growth and the jobs target, but it is an Accord that is important to sensible wage outcomes and to low inflation. This is an Accord that, in terms of its 600,000 jobs, builds on the commitment in the previous accord-Accord Mark VII and its commitment to 500,000 jobs over three years. As has already been noted, we have achieved in excess of 600,000 jobs in two years. The Prime Minister has indicated that we will not hear much from the opposition about the Accord in relation to wages and jobs, but let us just recall what the former opposition spokesman on industrial relations, now the Leader of the Opposition, had to say when Accord Mark VII was handed down. Back on 20 February 1993 he said: Accord mark 7 is, 'an insult to the intelligence'. Its target of 500,000 jobs over the next three years is 'unachievable' . He said that on 20.2.93. Further, he went on-seeing he was so buoyed up by the fact that this was not only unachievable but it was an insult to the intelligence to say: It insults the intelligence of the Australian people to suggest Accord Mark VII can help generate a half a million jobs.",81
150,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did you say that?,82
151,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"None of the more than 600,000 people who have jobs feel insulted. Yours is the insult to the intelligence of the people by hiding your policies in terms of how you would produce job outcomes. But, in that same article, the Leader of the Opposition went on to say: We would not have an Accord approach. So here is a document that is producing jobs growth, producing low inflation, producing a wages policy that underpins that low inflation, commitment to superannuation and building the national savings of the country-and you would reject it. The simple fact of the matter is: these are people bereft of ideas. The reason they are bereft of ideas is that they have no talent sitting on that side of the parliament.",82
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could I remind the member for Fisher about the provisions of standing order 58. I might say the same to the member for Maranoa. Prices and Incomes Accords,82
153,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it not true, Prime Minister, that, since the inception of the prices and incomes accords in 1983, real average weekly earnings have fallen by 0.4 per cent; the distribution of income, even allowing for the social wage, has become more unequal; Australia has suffered its worse recession in 60 years; unemployment went to more than a million Australians a few years ago; and the current account deficit has now become the worse in the industrialised world-worse even than Mexico's? With this record, is it any wonder that Australian workers have grown tired of your overblown and empty rhetoric?",82
154,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I gave the answer before: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income,82
155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Rhetoric!,82
156,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, not rhetoric. This is from the statisticians' records: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income since 1983. But the import of the question is about the wages of Australians. The Leader of the Opposition has opposed every wage increase since 1981, bar two-the last two safety nets of this government. In other words, he has supported $16 in 14 years. He so hates working Australians that he wants to rip away at their wages, tear away at their income; he opposed every wage increase through the period until we got to the safety net. The reason he is arguing that is not that he wants to give them a wage increase but that he wants to get away from his draconian policy or the cosmetics of it and say that, in a cosmetic way, he would support some kind of safety net. Mr Costello-You said he was the bloke who blew out wages!",82
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Mr Costello-What are you saying now?,82
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,82
159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here'is a headline in the Australian: 'Howard calls for cuts in real wages and delay the wage indexation'. It goes on and on. Let me just repeat some of the things he himself said: Wages policy was the Fraser government's weakest point in the economic area. We would 'blow every economic recovery with a wage explosion'. He said this: We did not really try decentralised wage fixing when we were in government ... We had a schizophrenic approach to wages policy. These were all statements by the Leader of the Opposition-they were. He said: Wages policy was the Fraser government's weakest point in the economic area He was the Treasurer-and we: blew every recovery with a wage explosion. We did not really try decentralised wage fixing because we were in government. He is engaged in conversation now. The quotes are a bit too hard for him. All of a sudden he gets interested and his puppeteer friends give him a question or have a conversation when the hard answers come back. He said, 'We had a schizophrenic approach to wages policy.' That is from his own mouthnot claims by me. You can see it in his utterances-'Howard calls for cuts in real wages,' a delay to indexation. He opposed every wage increase, bar the last two safety nets. He supported $16 in 14 years. It is outrageous. Then he talks about the wages of Australians. He wants a system where the no disadvantage test does not apply. That is the system he wants. He wants to tum Australians out of the wages system to a system where their meal allowances, overtime and penalty rates are no longer part of their wages. He wants to drive them back to award minimums and award minimums only. If workers move out of the wages system-and 1.6 million Australians change jobs-they lose all the award protections. He is going to gut the award system, and these people are going to come back into the system without protection and only under individual wage contracts. John Howard is out there to butcher working Australians on their wages, just as he has always done. He has been the complete tory on all this. He has opposed all the wage increases. He is basically about ripping the low paid down. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, what an objective! Here is an economy with an enormous strength and wealth. This year we have had four per cent growth-four per cent of $500 billion-and $20,000 million of extra wealth, but John Howard will not see someone on a $20,000 wage get a decent adjustment or protection under the awards. What a philosophy! What a view of life! He is saying, 'Here I am. I've spent 20-odd years in parliament, and my main objective is to grind the low paid and those on modest incomes-under $30,000--out of the award protections and into a jungle of individual wage contracts.' As if the profit share in the economy is not high enough! As if you would need to drive it any higher by taking these reprisals against ordinary working people! But that is what he has always been about. The member for Mayo has been interjecting. He was born with a silver cutlery set in his mouth. I can understand him taking these views. He has always held the working people in contempt. But the member for Bennelong was a bowser boy at Canterbury. What a bowser boy has against working people and what he can gain by trying to grind their wages down has got me beat. Let us understand this. Page 6 of the Accord states: The Accord partners are opposed to any actions which seek to undermine: the efficiency and effectiveness of award protection; collective bargaining; the no disadvantage testThe no disadvantage test will let people move out into the enterprise bargaining stream so that they are not disadvantaged. If they are disadvantaged, they get picked up under the safety net arrangements. Increases over the period will be $9 to $12 and, for those who are on award minimums, $11 to $14. What could be possibly wrong with it, other than an absolute cynical desire to rip away at the award protection and push wages down?",82

You are the remnants of Australia's failed upper class, the bunyip aristocracy hopping into working people and trying to cut their wages. Let this House understand that this opposition has two key policies-to cut into the social wage of Australians and to rip the guts out of Medicare. They are the opposition's two policies to try to drive Australians back to the sort of jungle John Howard was talking about when he said, 'We had no wages policy in the 1980s. That was our record.'

169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will just wait. I now issue a general warning in this place. The Prime Minister in conclusion.,84
170,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"His tactic is to disrupt the parliament, to have his members behind him screech, roar and interject so that there is not a sensible debate and the House bec()mes disorderly as a result of his leadership. That is all that matters to him. The public opprobrium is for him to wear. Let me say that we on this side of the House will always stand for the rights of working Australians for a decent wage, for a decent social wage and for decent protection via schemes like Medicare. These are the things that Australians expect from a government like this. Industrial Relations",84
171,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. It also concerns Accord Mark VIII. What contribution will Accord Mark VIII make to maintaining fairness in Australia's industrial relations system? Will Accord Mark VIII ensure that those workers who need protection get it?,84
172,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to answer the honourable member's question about Accord Mark VIII, the Accord that is so much in keeping with the totality of our IR reforms, and, I might say, the Accord that continues the process of encouraging federal award employees into the enterprise bargaining stream. In doing so, at the same time we maintain fairness and at the same time we maintain employee protection, the very hallmarks of our policies. Already under the framework established by the Industrial Relations Reform Act, we have seen some 60 per cent of all federal award workers covered by enterprise bargains-a figure more than double that achieved by any state system. At the same time we have achieved high economic growth; we have achieved record jobs growth; and we have done so at a time of industrial harmony, low inflation and wages moderation. It has been a fantastic outcome. Accord Mark VIII released today will maintain that. It will do so while delivering responsible safety net wage increases to the low paid and to all employees unable to secure enterprise agreements. For the benefit of the House, I will just outline the five or six key elements of that Accord announced today: firstly, a strong emphasis on workplace bargaining underpinned by a comprehensive award safety net-the sort of award safety net that you would rip away; secondly, safety net adjustments from $9 to $14 to protect those unable to benefit from bargaining, particularly the low paid; thirdly, the maintenance of an effective and comprehensive award safety net-the award safety net those opposite would destroy-but also making it more understandable, user-friendly and relevant to the needs of enterprises and individual workplaces; fourthly, support for phased-in employee contributions to superannuation to coincide with safety net wage increases supplemented by employer and government contributions; and, finally, assistance to families and the encouragement of work practices that better balance work and family responsibilities. These are the key elements Accord Mark VIII. In combination, this Accord and the Industrial Relations Reform Act guarantee Australia's industrial harmony. They guarantee the continuity of the processes of decentralising our labour market, but they do so while maintaining all the vital protections required to give employees confidence as they move into the bargaining process. Together they deliver workplace change and productivity increases, but they ensure that employees get a fair share of the dividend. Whether through bargaining or through safety net adjustments, no-one under this system is left behind. The opposition can deliver no such promises at all. All it can promise is the end of industrial peace, the end of wage moderation and the end of worker protection. That is what its policies stand for. The anti-worker policies that have been advanced by the member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition can only return us to the industrial chaos, the high unemployment and the inflation that we saw from them in the early 1980s. This week the member for Flinders spoke about safety net adjustments, but there is never any detail about safety nets or any mechanism for how the coalition would adjust its existing policy. The coalition can guarantee only that workers will be worse offbecause, as the Prime Minister said today, it stands for the abolition of the no-disadvantage test. That is one of the great fundamentals underpinning our whole system. It is a fundamental that you would remove. The very cornerstone of your policy is to remove the no-disadvantage test and to replace the award system with four miserly minimums: four weeks annual leave, two weeks non-cumulative sick leave, 12 months unpaid maternity leave and a minimum hourly wage-not even a minimum weekly wage. That is all we get from the opposition. When it comes to workers' penalty rates, their leave loadings, their shift allowances, their overtime and their family leave-all these things are on the chopping block under the opposition's policies. No contrast could be of more stark: the opposition' s recipe for industrial mayhem and for wage slashing, and the proud accord we have released today. Real Household Disposable Income",84
173,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement he has repeated a couple of times today that real household disposable income increased by 40 per cent between 1983 and 1995. I ask the Prime Minister: will he confirm that the increase in it is the number of households between 1983 and 1995 means that real household disposable income has increased on average by less than one-third of one per cent per year per household?,85
174,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The increase per capita which I read out in this House in question time a few weeks ago was, from memory, 20 per cent. That is household disposable income, which is measured by",85

176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have repeatedly reminded and warned members in this place of the provisions of standing order 55. The Prime Minister is entitled to be heard in silence and he will.,85
177,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Household disposable income measures wages, salaries, supplements, pensions and benefits, and the per capita measure is after tax. That has seen a per capita rise, I think, of 20 per cent. I need to go back and check that the number is 20 per cent. It is certainly 40 per cent for households over the period. Mr MCGauran-No.",85
178,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,",--I know you do not like the number, but that is the fact-because more households are in work. We have had two million jobs created. Do you think those two million people do not earn anything? What do you think they are doing? Do. you think they are martians: they come and do the work and then disappear at night or something and are not paid at the end of the week? Of course there has been a massive improvement. We have given you the numbers for the rate of employment growth. They have been three to four times the employment growth of the Fraser years. They are three times the OECD average. There is no economic mix in the OECD area that has been producing more employment with decent levels of remuneration. This is the point that Robert Reich, the US Labour Secretary, made. Mr O'Keefe-In New Zealand the rates have gone down.",85
179,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are not running New Zealand.,86
180,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You always talk about an individual contract system. You talk about the US system, but when the United States Labour Secretary says, 'We have had more employment growth than any other country, but we have had falling real wages for 14 years'Mr O'Keefe-You should look at what is happening there.",86
181,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are wrong when you talk about us. We are not worried about them.,86
182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor and the member for Burke are again conducting an exchange across the chamber. I will give you the opportunity to do it outside. I invoke the provisions of standing order 304A against both of you. The honourable members for O'Connor and Burke thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,86
183,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With those most revealing remarks from someone with such standing in the system as the Secretary of Labour in the United States about the system that he presides over, I would have thought that at least some members of the coalition here would ask, 'What sort of a system is that?' Enormous growth in American wealth and high levels of profitability but a continuing decline in the real wages of Americans over a sustained period of 14 years is an appalling outcome. Opposition members would have seen references I have made in the House about a number of the European countries and the fact that they have high wages growth but very lousy work force growth. In Australia, we have come up the middle. We have strong employment growth and a sensible basis for remuneration. But we do want to look after the less advantaged with a safety net. It is a safety net that the opposition is opposed to. rt wants flexibility. But it does not want flexibility upwards; it wants flexibility downwards. I repeat the point: why anybody would want to hop into people on $20,000 a year and reduce their wages, or reduce the wages of people on average weekly earnings, those on $33,000 a year, is beyond me. I can see no economic point to it-not when the profit share in the economy now is so high. What are you arguing for-a higher level of profits to GDP? It knows no historic precedent. Why would you get it by tugging away at the people on the bottom? That is your vicious prejudicial position against working people. That has always been your vicious prejudicial position against working people. Even the people who run businesses do not have your position. It is just the snaky ideological position of your political party.",86
184,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,86
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order!,86
186,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The MTIA came to see me, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industrial Relations the other day. I did not hear from them any such claims for flexibility downwards. I did not hear them saying, 'Take away the no disadvantage test.' I did not hear them saying that the safety net did not matter. I did not hear them say these things, because they do not hold those views. The only people who hold those views are those with the narrow, vicious, political interests of the Liberal Party. The member's question is wrongly based because of the fact that we have had a twomillion job growth. Can you imagine if the opposition had had two-million job growth? We would never hear the end of it. If you had two per cent to three per cent employment growth, we would never hear the end of it. Yet when we go through these things, it says, 'What's next? What about the current account deficit?' Well, what about the growth in employment? Economy",86
187,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that Australia is heading for an 'economic apocalypse' and that 'severe corrective measures' are required? What is the Treasurer's response to these reports?,87
188,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Werriwa for his question because it does raise an interesting issue. I have seen these reports. They relate to comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday following the release of the OECD half-yearly economic outlook. The sorts of things that he talked about, as the member for Werriwa said in his question, were 'an economic apocalypse occurring unless drastic action is taken'Mr CostelIo--No, no, no; quote it correctly.",87
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Mr CostelIo--He should not misquote.,87
190,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and 'they, the government, ought to be announcing some severe corrective measures which they will take to fix things up', and 'what is absolutely clear now is that the government has been running a fiscal policy which is too loose and the OECD has made that point'. The fact is that the OECD made no such point. What the OECD said in its half-yearly economic outlook was that the forecasts for Australia were very similar to those the government has. They were slightly different at the margin because it was talking about calendar years, not financial years. But with that minor difference they essentially endorsed our forecast. What they said was that we would have economic growth in 1995 of 3.8 per cent and in 1996 of 3.5 per cent-no sign of an economic apocalypse there. What needs to be clearly understood is that those rates are quite high by the standards of other countries. In 1995 that rate of 3.8 per cent is the fifth highest of all Western developed countries, that is, there are only four other countries with a higher rate of growth expected in 1995. For 1996 we are the fourth highest, that is, there are only three others with a higher rate of growth forecast. So, far from saying this country is facing an economic apocalypse, the forecast of the OECD is that this country is going to grow with the very top rates of growth in the OECD this year and next year. What about employment growth? The forecast by the OECD for this year, 1995, is 2.8 per cent employment growth and for 1996 2.6 per cent. Again, these are relatively very high rates of employment growth-the equal third highest rate of employment growth in the whole of the Western developed world in 1995 and in 1996 the third highest. No sign of economic apocalypse there. The OECD expects the continuance of very good outcomes with relatively high rates of economic and employment growth. What the deputy opposition leader said yesterday was based on the fact that we had a forecast for the current account deficit by the OECD in 1995 of six per cent. That reflects the six per cent figure that is in the budget for 1994-95. So there is nothing new in that figure; it is just endorsing the figure that we had in our budget. Like us, the OECD forecasts that that current account number is going to come down. They say that in 1996 it will be 5.3 per cent. They do not see it getting worse; they see it coming down with the breaking of the drought and reduced growth in imports. . The government cannot be accused of being complacent about the current account. We have taken very substantial steps in this budget, as everyone in this House knows, to address the need to reduce the current account. We have done that by reducing the public sector dissaving through moving to budget surpluses and by the very important additional development built up under the Accord process, which we have talked about a lot today, to develop the new superannuation initiative, which will be an enormous boost to household and national savings in years to come. What is the opposition's position in respect of both of these major steps towards reducing the current account deficit? In relation to the budget opposition members are desperately trying to prevent the corrective measures that the government has announced and is trying to put in place being put through the parliament. They are opposing $1'12 billion worth of tax increases this year and $2.6 billion worth next year. So whilst we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition parading around saying that what this country needs is severe corrective measures he is doing his very best to stop the corrective measures in the budget from being put into place. What abundant hypocrisy! It does not stop at taxation, either. The opposition is also opposing expenditure cuts. We have already seen the opposition in this budget debate oppose the cuts in child care which limit the number of non-work related hours of child care to 12. They are saying that they will not support that; they are voting against that. That saves $150 million over the four year:s of the forward estimates. They are against expenditure cuts as well as increased taxes. So we have the broad 'Oh, yes. Let us have severe corrective measures. There is a terrible problem.' But when it comes to dealing with individual measures, which this government has responsibly put before this parliament, to reduce the pressure on interest rates and to reduce the current account deficit, they are opposing them one by one. That is incredible hypocrisy and shows how shallow this opposition is. The same goes for the superannuation initiatives. The opposition opposes them too. They are not in support of those initiatives to give a major boost to household and national savings. What we are seeing is an opposition opposing much of the measures that the government announced to ensure that the current account deficit is reduced and then calling for more severe corrective measures. The fact is that this economy needs the budget measures to be passed. The forecasts that are made by the OECD are a follow-on from its spelling out in that document of the budget measures-that is, in the broad, the move to surplus. On the basis of that it says this country will grow by almost four per cent in 1995, will be at the top level of the OECD and will have similar results on employment with those measures. If those opposite try to take away those measures, they are simply sabotaging our efforts to produce good economic outcomes in this country. That is what is being done. Doing that and at the same time saying this country needs more severe corrective measures is just an extraordinary amount of abundant hypocrisy and it shows how abysmally unsuitable the opposition is to govern this country. Governor General",87

From the second quarter of 1983 to the second quarter of 1995 household income per person rose by 19 per cent real. So the whole basis of the question was wrong. That may be an inconvenient number for those opposite, but that is the progress which has been made by the government for Australians under the Accord process.

196,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Mr MCGauran-The Prime Minister has answered only the first part of the question and has avoided answering the second.,89

198,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Telephone Services for Low Income Earners  Minister for Communications and the Arts; Can the minister advise the House about action being taken to improve access to home telephones for people on low incomes? Can he also advise the House about the outlook for other changes to telephone services?,89
199,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given the alleged interest of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kooyong in the interests of low income earners, let us see what they have to say about the new service which the honourable member for Chifley was kind enough to ask me about. Last November I advised the House that Telecom would be trialling a new service to make it easier for low income earners to get a telephone on at home. It is the government's view that, with telephone carriers investing billions of dollars in cable and with telephone companies investing large sums of money in improving the mobile telephone service around the country, we think the least they can do is also make it easier for the one million Australians who do not have a phone on at home by bringing in this service as soon as possible. Yesterday the chief executive bf Telstra, Frank Blount, and I launched this new service, which is called InContact. It will allow households to receive calls and to ring the 000 emergency number. InContact will be provided with no rental, connection or service charges. However, where there is not an existing telephone line there will be a connection fee. But the good news is that, in the 20 of per cent of cases where Telecom estimates there will be a need for some cabling to be done, people will have that credited against the normal connection fee if customers subsequently upgrade to the standard telephone service. Mr Speaker, as you would know, this service has been trialled in Wollongong. The feedback suggests people who are looking for work find it easier because they can leave a contact number with prospective employers, and people believed they were safer and more secure knowing they could contact the emergency services number, especially those with young children and especially the elderly and retirees. Also, families and friends were more confident that they could ring to check people were safe, and children found it easier to ring their parents to let them know where they were or that they were safe. At the launch yesterday, Gwen George from the Older Women's Network made a point about how important the telephone service is for elderly Australians in particular. She gave examples of where people do not buy food because they know how important it is to maintain that telephone contact. We have had support from the Telecom Australia Consumer Council including the Smith Family and ACOSS, and The Pensioner and Superannuation Federation; who said that this is a great new initiative. There was one lone voice across the Commonwealth saying he was against this new service. It was the voice of the spokesman for the Liberal Party on communications, Senator Alston. In Senator Alston's press release yesterday he said that 'this new service was a limited and short-term solution'. So it is the view of the Liberal Party that it is a limited and short-term option to help people who are looking for work be able to leave a contact number with prospective employers. It is the view of the Liberal Party that it is a limited and short-term solution to let pensioners and isolated families be able to ring the 000 emergency services number. It is the view of the official Liberal Party spokesman that it is a limited and short-term solution to allow families and friends to be able to contact relatives at night; they would rather force them out of their homes to use the public telephone boxes. That being the official view, which was expressed by the Liberal Party spokesman on communications, I think we are entitled to khow: is that also the view of the Leader of the Opposition? Does the Leader of the Opposition think that the InContact service is a limited and short-term solution? Do you agree with Senator Alston? There is no answer. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could you rule whether it is proper for ministers to ask us questions? If it we answer them?",89
200,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am quite happy to answer him.,90
201,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. I am not into that.,90
202,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be pleased to answer. May I, Mr Speaker?",90
203,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Just contain yourself for a minute. I remind all members, including ministers, that they must respond through the chair.",90
204,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does that mean that they can ask us questions, Mr Speaker? Through you, Mr Speaker, I say that we are entitled to ask: does the Leader of the Opposition support Senator Alston? Does he think that the InContact service is a limited and short-term solution that should not be made available to the one million Australians out there who do not have a home telephone? I can certainly tell this House that all of the feedback from the people in W oIl ongong has been that they think it is a great service for them. In three states alone, Telecom has had more than 1,000 calls to the inquiry number from people saying that they are interested in this new service. Is it any wonder that we have the support of the welfare organisations and the people who have trialled the product in W ollongong? The only one who is saying he is against it is the Leader of the Opposition. The other comment Senator Alston made yesterday was that he believed this new service was creating a two-tier phone system and an information underclass, especially for rural and regional Australia. Those of us on this side of the House know that the quickest way to get a two-tier phone system and an information underclass, especially in rural and regional Australia, is to sell Telecom, which is what those opposite want to do. No doubt, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way and the new owners of Telecom included substantial shareholdings by foreign telephone companies, we would then be entitled to ask: how would the Leader of the Opposition guarantee that those foreign is, may telephone companies would maintain the services in rural and regional Australia? How could the Leader of the Opposition assure the member for Parkes that the foreign telephone companies would not cut back the services in Broken Hill? How could he assure people that services would not be cut back in Mackay or in other National Party electorates? When you look at the opposition spokesman's briefing papers for the opposition shadow cabinet, you can see there are no policies. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on another point of order. This really is going on for far too long. As you know, questions have to be short and to the point so those opposite can answer them. I suggest that you instruct the minister to wind up because this call really is taking a long time.",90

206,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister in conclusion.,90
207,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I agree with the Prime Minister. Let me also say that is why when you look at Senator Alston's submissions to shadow cabinet it is like a headline clipping service rather than a development of policy. That is because he is afraid to say what it means for the National Party if he sells Telecom. Same Sex Couples,90

225,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right. It is getting a bit late in the afternoon. Let get this wrapped up. The member for Leichhardt has the call.,91
226,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the minister's attention been drawn to claims by the United Graziers Association of Queensland that students of farm families do not qualify for Austudy? Are these claims accurate?,91
227,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. I am aware that the United Graziers Association of Queensland has written to a number of provincial and rural newspapers on this matter. Its claim is that 'the government has consistently maintained that unless a farm is in exceptional circumstances, students from farm families do not qualify for Austudy'. This is untrue, but, worse than that, these allegations have the effect of deterring farming families with student dependents from applying for Austudy when they may be eligible. Austudy is a financial grant to help students from less well off families. It is income and assets tested. If a family operates a farm or a business in which the owner works for more than 17\12 hours a week-and we are not talking about Pitt Street farmers, obviouslyAustudy grants a generous discount on the business or farm assets. For Austudy purposes, only 50 per cent of the net worth of the farm assets is counted. Net means the value after subtracting any debt owed on the assets. A family can have a business, such as a farm, under these rules valued at around $750,000 net-that is, three-quarters of a million dollars-and still get Austudy. Mr Bruce Scott-But a Prime Minister can have a $2.5 million home.",91
228,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Maranoa constantly interjects. I have rebuked him this afternoon. I now invoke standing order 304A Austudy in respect of him as well. The honourable member is suspended for one hour. The honourable member for Maranoa thereupon withdrew from the chamber,91
229,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suspect that the member for Maranoa is an accomplice in this. It is a pity he will not be here to hear the rest of the answer. For farmers, the value of the home and curtilage of up to two hectares is also a us deductible item. The United Grazier Association refers in its letter to exceptional circumstances. What it is talking about are areas declared as drought affected special circumstances. In those areas no assets test applies at all. According to the latest ABARE statistics, the average net equity which the owner holds in broadacre farms in Australia, given over to mixtures of livestock and crops, is $663,630. That is below the Austudy assets test threshold, even without deducting the value of the house and the surrounding land. For wheat and for other crop farms the ABARE figures show the average net value of about $790,000, which is about $40,000 over the assets limit. But, when you deduct the value of the house and curtilage, again it comes below the threshold. For sheep and beef farms pretty much the same applies. The average equity is $790,000. For sheep properties the average net value is $707,000, which is again within the assets test. In other words, the average farming family is not disqualified under the Austudyassets test. Of the 208 farms valued by the Australian Valuation Office in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia for Austudy purposes in 1993-94, only 33 were over the limit in gross value. More than five farm families in six had no difficulty qualifyMayo! ing under the assets test. Apart from that, there is the drought assistance package which I mentioned which provides a safety net for those in special circumstances. The Australian Valuation Office will provide valuations where weather or market conditions have forced the value of a property down. I should point out that farming families can apply for Austudy at any time during the year if their assets fall below the threshold. I would ask all honourable members, particularly those members of the National Party, including the member for Maranoa, to disown the claims of the UGA. Telling farmers that they should not apply for assistance is quite wrong. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",91
230,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that earlier today Senator Evans told the Senate that he had written to French Prime Minister Juppe after the election of President Chirac indicating Australia's opposition to nuclear testing but that Senator Evans refused to table the letter? Is the Prime Minister aware that subsequently today Senator Evans has revealed that in his letter to Prime Minister Juppe he did not make any direct representation whatsoever concerning French nuclear testing but simply congratulated him on his appointment? Is it not now obvious that the government wanted to hide Senator Evans's letter to the French Prime Minister because that letter is proof that from the time of the election of President Chirac the government has taken a soft and weak stand on the issue of French nuclear testing?,92
231,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The adolescent fantasies about gunboat diplomacy from the member for Mayo are just too much. This is somebody who a few years ago was saying that the nuclear-free zone treaty was basically an antiFrench treaty and little else. He said that it would swamp ultimately the Western alliance in the Pacific. That was the sort of thing you were saying at the time of the last test. Mr Downer-You are too weak to answer Tim Fischer's question.,92
232,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for,92
233,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make very clear that this government has expressed in very strong terms its objection, its condemnation and its contempt for this decision by the government of France to test these weapons again. I wrote to President Chirac urging him not to take up a weapons testing programMr Downer-Will you table the letter?",92
234,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Mayo!,92
235,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the member for Mayo keeps this attack up on Senator Evans, I remind him of the Leader of the Opposition's response. He said: ... what the Government has done is appropriate. I think it's one of those situations that you've got to keep under review and ... the response today is not necessarily the final response ... it's never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once.",92
236,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was before.,92
237,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Just relax.,92
238,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of the government's view-it was annoyed, angry, disappointed about what had been decided by the government of France-of the very wilful decision that that country had taken, I wrote, after a cabinet discussion of the issueMr Downer-Table the letter.",92
239,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Mayo, on the last warning!",93
240,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 8 June, I wrote to President Chirac urging the continuation of France's moratorium on nuclear testingMr Downer-Table the letter.",93
241,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will table the letter if it suits me to table the letter. You don't get letters between governments. You lost the election. You came second, mate. On polling night, you came in second. As a consequence, the government met as a cabinet to consider the position in detail and I wrote to the President, as I say, on 8 June. The moment the announcement was made by President Chirac on 14 June I immediately issued a statement deploring the decision. Defence activities were frozen until the cessation of French testing, visits by French military aircraft or vessels, except those relating to humanitarian or surveillance activities which benefit South Pacific countries, were denied and the transits which, in any way, supported the testing program were forbidden. I foreshadowed contact with Pacific leaders. On the same day, the acting foreign minister, Senator MCMullan, called in the French ambassador and issued a formal protest. Our ambassador made similar protests in Paris. On 15 June, I issued a statement on behalf of my South Pacific colleagues condemning the French decision and announcing that a delegation from the forum would go immedi, ately to France. On 15 and 16 June, Australian representatives at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and the UN in New York took action to protest the French decision. On 19 June, I moved a motion in this House condemning the decision. On 20 June, Australian time, the foreign minister, acting as leader of the forum delegation, conveyed to French foreign minister de Charette the strong opposition of forum countries to the decision. On the same day, I sent an immediate report on the results of the delegation meeting to other forum heads of government and asked them to consider what further steps the region might take to reinforce our concern about the French decision. Senator Evans returned to Australia last night. He and I had a discussion upon his return. The government, as we have said all along, will now consider the report from Senator Evans and what further steps might be taken to register our opposition. We have begun receiving responses from our partners in the South Pacific. We look forward to their last replies and being in a position to announce some coordinated regional responses. I think that on those issues the government's position has been a very strong one. Let me say this also the government of France: the decision taken by the government of France is no deterrent against the greatest nuclear threats now facing Europe and the world-that is, the emergence of new nuclear weapon states, the rotting carcasses of old Soviet reactors in eastern Europe, stockpiles of degrading nuclear weapons and weapons systems and contaminated nuclear sites. It is worth reminding the House there are 21 Chernobyl type RBMK reactors, which are considered to have an inherent design fault, operating in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. When I saw Prime Minister Balladur in France over a year or so ago, he said to me that one of the great concerns facing his government and Europe is the state of the 21 Chernobyl type reactors that are sitting in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. We have seen already the damage that came from Chernobyl. Could you imagine if there were any further reactor failures of the kind we saw spread across 21 reactors which have to be, over time, replaced? If the government of France wants to worry about the protection of its people, it needs to worry about a nuclear cloud over Europe, threatening a civilisation of people, which can come in a very real way from the design fault and collapse of this reactor system in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. There are also 100 nuclear reactors from an estimated 50 idle Soviet submarines",93
242,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister may well be giving us some interesting statistics but, pursuant to standing order 145, he ought to reply to the very specific question from the honourable member for Mayo, which related to a letter Senator Evans allegedly wrote to the French Prime Minister.",93
243,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister is responding to what I thought this House considered to be a very serious issue, and the Prime Minister has the call.",94
244,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, there are around 100 nuclear reactors from an estimated 50 idle Soviet submarines, which will need to be dismantled and the spent nuclear fuel treated and safely stored. They are laying around Vladivostok. They are laying around in the other eastern ports of the former Soviet Price, L. R. S. Union. They are laying around the Black Sea. They are laying off continental Europe. These are the real threats to France and to the other Smith, S.

250,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I conclude on these points. I would have thought that opposition members would be concerned about the state of Western Europe in terms of these reactors and not have interjected in way in which they did. Let me make it very clear: as far as the government is concerned, we will keep focusing on the nuclear weapons proliferation issue. We will keep Australia's best endeavours going towards these things, such as chemical weapons and the comprehensive test ban treaty. We will be doing all in our power to basically stop the spread of these weapons to non-weapon states. We will try to stop the diversion of these materials and we will keep reminding the French, amongst others, of the imminent prospect of some catastrophic failure to their north in those programs which er. do genuinely put the French population at some severe risk-but, unfortunately, as well, not just the French population but the population of Western Europe.

257,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Twice during question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) misrepresented my position in personal references to me. He claimed that, during the period of the Fraser government, Australia had the worse current account deficit in the OECD. That is completely wrong. The worse current account deficit recorded during that period was minus 4.8 per cent of GDP. the During that year, five other nations in the OECD area recorded worse current account deficits. That was the first piece of deception on the part of the Prime Minister. The second was when he quoted from the doorstop I gave in Queensland last week regarding French nuclear tests. He omitted to inform the House that that doorstop was given before the pusillanimous response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans).",95

261,Mr SPEAKER,PAPERS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The continuing failure of the Government to deliver higher living standards as a result of its inability and unwillingness to provide the necessary leadership to introduce genuine labour market reform. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",96
262,Mr REITH,PAPERS,"When I put the MPI in at quarter to 12, little did know that I would be starting did I know that we would have just enjoyed a classic, cameo performance from the ernment during question time. In away, demonstrates all I want to say about the Australians, failures of the accord during the last 12 or years. Not only were we entertained by the infergood ences of the non-answer of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the social policy question when he said, 'That is a matter for the case. states'-a novel position for him!-not only were we subjected to the usual personal when he was asked reasonable questions about the conduct of the government; not only did we have diatribe references to the coaligo tion as offering 'snaky ideology'; and not only did we have claims that the coalition would 'cut the wages of Australians', 'cut guts out of Medicare' and 'hop into working people', which is the usual performance recipeDr Kemp-The tired old rhetoric.",96
263,Mr REITH,PAPERS,"That is the usual performance, with the tired, old, worn out rhetoric, as the member for Goldstein so properly reminds us. The Prime Minister even went back to my predecessor in the seat of Flinders, Stanley Melbourne Bruce. For heaven's sake, he used to get around the electorate with polo ponies and spats. How desperate would you have to to make such a reference? In a senseMr Costello-Do you have polo ponies?",96
264,Mr REITH,PAPERS,"I am out of horses. Whilst the Prime Minister's performance has its usual entertainment value, you would have to say that, in a way, it is a very sad reflection on the state of public debate in Australia. When you think about it, the history of economic management in recent years for a lot of Australians has been no laughing matter. It was again a classic, I thought, that the two principal operators for the labour movement in this country-the Prime Minister of a Labor government and the head of the ACTU-should appear on television to announce the latest political deal that they have done. The perception they were creating was one of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the word in tablets of stone. Yet I the reality is a very different one for many so late and little Australians. The truth is that the accord is not an instrugovment for constructive economic reform to that provide benefits to the average working but a political deal to foster the 13 political position of this government and to keep this government in office. It would be a thing if an accord were directed to genuine economic reforms but, sadly, after 12 years of this government that has not been the Let us look at the history of a few of the abuse accords. The accord arose out of Bob Hawke's win back in 1983 when Labor came into office. That accord saw the government on a spending spree, the like of which we had not seen since Whitlam. It led to massive demand pressures in the Australian economy the and, as has happened on so many occasions in Australian economic history, it basically blew out the current account deficit and led to the current Prime Minister announcing that Australia was on the path to a banana republic and to the economic policy of the following few years. That is not the only example of the accord I would remind the House of. The 1989 accord was a classic in itself. The 1989 accord included some significant tax increases. That fed into demand. Again, as h""as so often happened, that led to a blow-out of the current account deficit. Whilst promising as the government went into the 1990 election that we were going to have a soft landing, the government so jacked up interest rates that it brought on the worse recession in this country's history since the Great Depression of the 1930s. So much for the accord. All through this period we have had promises of better economic management but in reality a different picture. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said, as Australia attempts to go past a growth rate of about three per cent, we always, given the current structure of this economy, blow the current account deficit. In 1983, ours was the fifth worse in the OECD; in 1984, it was the fourth worse in the OECD; in 1985, it was the third worse in the OECD; by 1994, it was the worse in the OECD except for Mexico; and, in 1995, we finally get to the top of the tree-we are worse than all in the OECD, including Mexico. It is an interesting reflection to go back one of the few times the Prime Minister has ever really told the Australian public the truth about the Australian economy. It was on 14 May 1986 that he said that we were heading towards a banana republic. If we are to give those many hundreds of thousands of Australians who today are unemployed the real chance of a job as we go through to the year 2000, we will have to do a hell of a lot better than three per cent. Only last year the Prime Minister said that if you could not do four per cent then you ol!ght to get out of the business. When he is asked that question, he always fudges 3--e answer. People say to him, 'We are not at four per cent now. So are we not matching your own criteria for your continued stay as Prime Minister?' He says, 'Oh, well, we are near four per cent: we are 3.25; we are 3.75.' The fact is that we are nowhere near four per cent. We are moving away from four per cent. The prospect is not of more jobs in the future but of fewer jobs, particularly of full-time jobs. If you look not only at the current account deficit situation, you see that the underlying nub of this debate is whether or not Australia can achieve the gains in efficiency in the way in which we run our economy so that the average Australian family can enjoy a higher standard of living. If you look at labour productivity in Australia. I do not have the figures for the last two or three years-the labour productivity figures have picked up during the recession, which is a cyclical effect. But, if you take the figures from 1985 to 1991, the latest OECD figures which are availableMr Brereton interjecting",96
265,Mr REITH,PAPERS,"I will come to that if you like, if time permits. Give me an extension of time, Minister, and I will give you a real burst and give you something to answer, instead of the usual rhetoric we have from you. Over that six-year period on only one occasion did Australia do better on labour productivity than our OECD trading partners. People should ask themselves: after 12 years of Labor, am I any better off? The answer is no. They are not better off because those opposite oppose the to sorts of changes that would make our economy a far more efficient place and that would give people real prospects for increases in the future. People should ask themselves: why it is that we have a poor productivity result? They do not have to take the opposition's view on this; they can take the latest OECD economic survey on Australia. The language the OECD uses is sort of Byzantine, polite, indirect and very often constrained, but its message on the labour market is crystal clear. The OECD report says that the industrial relations system still remains very complex and highly prescriptive. It says that our industrial relations reforms generated considerable confusion about the role of the commission and unions, and that, as a result, the negotiation of enterprise agreements is time consuming and costly. The OECD report says that it was questionable 'whether awards are best suited to perform a safety net function' and that the complexity of the safety net structure constrains 'the capacity of the labour force to adjust to change'. It is the change we want, Minister. You stand here and say you are moving us in the direction of that change, but the OECD report-it is very informative; only a short read, but well worth reading-notes that the government's rhetoric on enterprise bargaining goes back to 1987 and that even the changes made in 1988-89 were cumbersome, too complex and unable to achieve the productivity benefits that we need. So you have been talking about these things for years and years, but the Australian people have suffered as a result of your failure to get the productivity gains. The impact of the accord process on individuals again is not a happy picture. Real average weekly earnings, for example, have fallen by 0.4 per cent. If you look at the nature of our society-whether it is a fairer and a better place-you will see that the distribution of income, even allowing for the social wage, has become less equal. Basically, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer under you. We have suffered the worse recession for 60 years. Our current account deficit, as I have mentioned, is now worse even than Mexico's and worse than those of the OECD. We have had record numbers of bankruptcies and small business failures. There are also the social implications, including the impact on Australian marriages and the impact on young people-the high suicide rates and the absolutely disgraceful high youth unemployment rate we have in this country. It is a disgrace, Minister. We have a society with all the riches and a good democracy, but 25 per cent of our young people cannot get a job. Why is that? It is because of the constraining, rigid, inflexible policy that you have. The accord process over the last 12 years has a very poor record at the economy level, the macro level and with its impact on individuals. I ask anybody listening to this: how have the accord and the government's economic policy affected you in the last 12 years? After the last 12 or 13 years of Labor, are you and your family better off? It is not a politically generated question. I think most people would say they are not better off. The truth is. that in that time a lot of people have lost their businesses and the opportunities they otherwise would have been provided. Then those opposite have the gall to front up, as they did to the Australian people, and attempt to be the incarnation of traditional Australian values. We had plausible Martin Ferguson saying he represents workers. He does not represent workers; he represents a minority of workers and, furthermore, the minority of workers he has are deserting him in droves. They are so desperate for members that one union in Sydney last year advertised discount strippers to attract more members. That is how low your union mates have gone. Instead of fronting up with Martin Ferguson, the Prime Minister would have presented a more accurate picture if he had turned up with his shadowy troika including George Campbell. He is the one with 100,000 scalps on his belt from the 1980-81 gross campaign they waged, which cost a lot of people their jobs. George Campbell is the bloke who knocked off Bruce Childs to come in here and be the Prime Minister's lackey in the upper house. The troika would include that bloke Coombs from the Maritime Union, the doyen of the aristocracy of the working class-the bloke whose members, generally speaking, earn three times what the average Australian earns and the bloke who has done more to retard, with your acquiescence, Minister, decent workplace reform on our waterfront. The last one I would throw in would be Bill Ludwig-your mate from Queensland-who is the man who provides the factional clout to keep Wayne Goss in power, and Keating and Brereton, with their numbers in Queensland. When you look behind these operators, he is the man, far from supporting the average battler, who is actually raiding the battlers in his own organisation because he has a request out to his own organisers that they surrender their long service leave entitlements-a pool of funds of about $3 million-to the union to pay for the mismanagement of the AWU by Bill Ludwig and people. So, far from representing decent Australian values, when you look behind some of the powerbrokers and the crude factional dealing and operations of some of these people, you see not Australian values but in fact the grubby, political, cynical· deal playing which is so much part and parcel of the way in which you people operate. The accord is a con. If people think they are going to get something out of the latest deal, the truth of the matter is, based on what has happened in the last 12 years, they will not get anything out of it. We would like to see people get real wage increases. Under us, of course, application could be made for a safety net increase. And we will genuinely look after those low paid workers who have had such a rough time under the Labor Party. Until we have real productivity gains in this country, the accord is a mirage. It is simply a deal, as you always do, with your union mates, with the union bosses-not to the advantage of Australian workers but to the disadvantage of Australian workers. You are not the champion of workers; you are the champion of low wage rights. (Time expired)",97
266,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (4.53 p.m.)-What a welcome surprise. What an absolute little gift from the new shadow minister, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who has just returned to industrial relations. And what a day to do it on. What a wonderful day to contrast our industrial relations policies with theirs-on the very day that Accord Mark VIII has been released. I have looked over at the embarrassed faces behind the member for Flinders. You would really think the member would know better. You would have thought by now that he would have worded it better and that he would understand that this is the last day he calls on the debate the opposition can never win. What is even stranger is that he has called it on on the very day we have released the details of Accord Mark VIII, the very day we indicated to the House that we have tied up this wonderful package-a fantastic package-of expanded enterprise bargaining, of safety net increases, of industrial protection, of commitments to low inflation and of commitments to employment growth. Yet the member for Flinders has walked into the House and said, 'Oh, no, the Accord is not an instrument of constructive economic reform.' This is the Accord that gave us Medicare. This is the Accord that stabilised the economy. This is the Accord that repaired the social wage. This is the Accord that gave the Australian economy productivity, that gave us skill enhancement. This is the accord process that gave us worker superannuation. This is the last in the line of accords after the one that gave us the concept of the trade union movement committing itself to putting jobs first. The Accord is committed to low inflation at two per cent to three per cent, to high growth and to sharing the benefits of that in a way that is absolutely fair. Yet the honourable member comes in here and says that it is not an instrument for constructive economic reform. What does he come armed with? He comes armed with Jobsback, the document that has persistently been on the nose with the electorate, his IR policy, a document which earlier this week he tried to apply a bit of perfume to, it is fair to say, by talking about safety net rises. You try to deceive the public by pinching a little of the government's rhetoric and pretending that your safety net is a real safety net, as we provide under the Industrial Relations Reform Act. The fact is that there is no mechanism in Jobsback for any safety net rises and for the honourable member to change his leader's views. We all know his leader's views. Mr Reith-You are shadow boxing.",99
267,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"I am not shadow boxing. I am indicating to the House the absolute paucity of your performance in coming in here and raising this matter of public importance in the House. At the last election the member for Flinders was trying to have the debate on the GST wrapped right around his neck. Now he has Jobsback. He has a document that has about as much credibility as the Hitler diaries. Jobsback was drafted by a man whose record is irrevocably tarnished by the wages blowout of the early 1980s. It is a rerun of the Victorian model that has led to the great exodus of workers from the Victorian IR system. More than half a million workers have flooded into the Commonwealth system, the national system. That has left its architect, Phil Gude, a national IR joke. That is Jobsback. That is what you will do to the whole of Australia-industrial relations Victorian style, the industrial relations that you champion. Having been given the job of arguing the policy, the honourable member has probably got a bit of a reason to be bitter. He has probably got every reason to be a bit bitter. This is not the choicest of jobs. Why does he keep bashing his head against the wall, arguing that Jobsback is some decent alternative to our policy? Jobsback is now in its fourth run. It has been rejected thrice already. Within the next 12 months it will be rejected for the fourth time. Whom does the honourable member think he is going to convince? How is he going to convince people that tearing away the award safety net is going to be good for them? What chance have you got? You have no chance at all. How does he think he can rationalise this while his leader is out there saying, 'I'm for the battler. I'm for the families,' when he wants to tear away the award system that is so central to protecting the very interests of families and so absolutely fundamental to protecting the interests of the battlers in the community? Yet the member for Flinders and his leader know that their policy would tear away penalty rates, shift rates, loadings, award based superannuation, family leave and a multitude of award conditions that battlers and families depend upon. Why is he bringing himself forward in this debate? Why does he do it today? The member is just playing into our hands. With the Accord and the success of the reform act behind us, all we have to do is point out to the people of Australia that the opposition's policy will only guarantee them those poor miserly, Dickensian conditions. That is all they will get. We all remember that the opposition was going to release its draft bill two days after the last federal election. Remember that? It was going to be ready beforehand, but then they said, No, it won't be ready, but we guaranteeMr Beyis-John Howard said that.",99
268,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"That is right; the now Leader of the Opposition. The opposition guaranteed that it would release the draft bill two days after the last election. Have we seen it yet? Not on your Nellie. We are still waiting. All we have is four Dickensian conditions. Sure, there will be plenty of obfuscation and plenty of pinching of rhetoric, but no-one will be conned by that because we know those opposite hate the award system and the idea of a comprehensive safety net and they are revolted by the very concept of a compulsory application of a no disadvantage test-all the things that fundamentally underpin a Labor style IR system. The very conditions that workers won over the last century would be Mr Reith-They would be swept away! Decimated!",100
269,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"They would be swept away. Workers would be left with four Dickensian conditions. What sort of a policy is that for families? What sort of a policy is that for battlers? I will tell you what it is: a disastrous policy. We have told people this before. Every time we tell them, they believe us. All the surveys show, at a rate of five to one, that people believe we are better at handling IR-not those opposite. The conservative governments have at every tum helped us underline this very reality. There they are, the Victorian IR system and now the Western Australian IR system, like big beacons. People only have to read this morning's West Australian to see an editorial openly and very comprehensively criticise the model being pursued by Graham Kierath. The Western Australians are flat out going down the Victorian path. They are flat out being trailblazers for the policies of Jobsback. Mr Deputy Speaket:. you would have really thought they would have learned by now that while they have Howard they will have Jobsback and while they have Jobsback they will have one great big dud. No matter what Mr Representation over there, the member for Flinders, says, he will be able to put no decent light on Jobsback at all because it will get the thumbs down, as it has every time it has been tried out in the past. Yet he comes into the House and misrepresents the success of our system. The success has been outlined-seven accords now and the latest one done today. Success is guaranteed under Accord Mark VIII. Those opposite will not be able to deny the statistics, and nor will they be able to babble on about unfair dismissals. Both employers and unions have today very warmly welcomed the amendments that we announced yesterday. Opposition members will not be able to obfuscate any longer. They will have to produce their own policies. They will find them standing up very badly against ours, the achievements of the accord process and the benefits that will flow from Accord Mark VIII. Just look at the success we have achieved. It puts the very real lie to what has been said in the chamber today by the member for Flinders. Since 1991, 4,500 agreements have been completed, with 2,300 of them since the IR Reform Act came into effect. Mr Reith-How many have expired?",100
270,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"They have all been rolled over. Sixty per cent of all federal award employees are in the enterprise bargaining stream. How many do you have in Victoria? Three per cent, is it, in your discredited system? Seventy-five agreements have already been ratified in areas where no unions are available, the non-unions areas, to provide the benefits of representing employees. Look at the performance of inflation against the backdrop of the accord process and the Industrial Relations Reform Act. It is sitting on two per cent to three per cent at an advanced stage of the recovery, with economic growth of up to five per cent. Since the last election, 640,000 jobs have been created320,000 of them since the new IR act was put into place. We have an average wages growth of four per cent to five per cent for people under agreements. Inflation is down at two per cent to three per cent and we have four per cent to five per cent average wages growth as a result of the productivity that has flown from the enterprise bargaining process. Of course, there have also been three $8 safety net adjustments for those who have not been able to get agreements. Under this new Accord, there will be safety net adjustments of up to $14 for those who are least well off in the community. All of this was achieved under the accord process against the backdrop of the lowest level of industrial disputes for 50 years. This is an unparalleled success story. It is going to be mighty hard to rationalise those statistics with your allegation that we have in some way failed in the area of labour market reform. It is going to be even harder to rationalise it when your Jobsback policies have failed so dismally in so many of your own conservative states. It will be harder still with people who remember the wages breakouts, your miserable performance, the high inflation, the high unemployment and the industrial mayhem that you gave us in the early 1980s, particularly now when the man responsible is your leader today. The opposition will not be able to deny history or the statistics. It will not be able to convince people that Labor has failed them when they have enjoyed industrial stability, improvements in the social wage, low inflation and rapid employment growth for almost a decade. Whilst the opposition has Jobsback, you can bet your life on one thing: the public will not support it. The public knows, we know and you know that your policies are, and always have been, anti-worker. They are anti-worker policies from an anti-worker party led by two of Australia's most anti-worker politicians-the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard); and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). Mr Bevis-The member for Higgins has a big record in industrial relations.",101
271,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"He has a huge record of being one of the most anti-worker politicians ever to sit in the House of Representatives of this country. We will keep reminding the electorate of this fact right up to polling day. Come polling day, the result will be the same as it has been for the last five elections. Once again, Jobsback will be one of the major reasons for that result. So please do us a favour: keep sticking to it. We think it is terrific. On every point we know that the facts favour the government. Those facts counter everything that the member for Flinders says, everything his leader says and everything ACCI says. We know we have the balance of policy right, and we know that our policies are working. Over the last 12 years we have got the results, and that is why people still support us. I repeat: every issues survey on IR shows very comprehensively that we have the results. You will not listen to the people in IR, you? You cannot listen to them. You are determined not to listen to them. You are determined to punish them on IR. No-one will believe your rhetoric about being pro-family or having pro-battler policies. No-one will care about whether it is opt in or opt out because it is still anti-worker Jobsback. We will be delighted if you go on with all the humbug you have trotted out today. But the facts, and the people of Australia, will support the current federal system-the one we are so proud of.",101
272,Mr NEVILLE,PAPERS,"Hinkler) (5.08 p.m.)Today's Accord Mark VIII is the eighth accord since 1983 and should be seen for what it is. It has more to do with providing the government with an election platform than improving the real conditions of ordinary workers. Today's statement is full of rhetoric, like the fatuous rhetoric we have just heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). But, like the previous accords, it will deliver very little to Australian workers. One has only to look over the government's record of the last 12 years to see how this is true. We have had the worse recession for 60 years. Let me stress to the minister that, during that recessional period, we had four of those eight accords. So they were not very successful and I doubt whether this eighth one will be any better. We had record bankruptcies among small business. We had unemployment rocket to one million people out of work-800,000 of whom are still out of work-the highest in the nation's history. Now we have a massive balance of payments crisis which, according to reports this week, puts us in the same league as Mexico. Is it any wonder that the workers themselves do not have any confidence in the government? Is it any wonder that the workers doubt the credibility of the ACTU? One has only to look at the dramatic fall in trade union membership for evidence of this loss of faith. ABS statistics between August 1988 and August 1994 show that trade union membership dropped seven per cent to 35 per cent of Australia's 6,5 million employees. Today's Accord Mark VIII agreement has will been framed with tomorrow morning's newspaper headlines in mind. But the hundreds of thousands of ordinary workers around the country will be saying tomorrow morning, 'Here we go again.' It is more smooth talk from Keating and Ferguson. The question they are asking is: what is it going to do for me? This is the sort of questionI get asked every day as I move around my electorate and talk to small business operators, shop keepers, factory employees, trades people and young people. I get asked: why can I not get a job; why am I not getting ahead; and why am I little better off than being on the dole? If they are in small business they ask: why is government taking more and more off me the harder I work? These questions are not being addressed by this government.  who is a public servant in my electorate. He is a very focused and hard working man with four teenage children. He is married and his wife does not work. Mr Hajenko's gross income is. $34,600 a year. One of his teenagers has reduced Austudy and another is on an unemployment benefit. After allowing for the basic family payment,' the home child-care allowance and deductions for superannuation, the family nets $1,146 per fortnight. If he had exactly the same family circumstances but was unemployed-and I am assuming $100 per week in casual employment-the family would earn $1,272 per fortnight. That is a difference of $126 per fortnight. Where is the equity? Where is the incentive for battling Australian families to get ahead? It is ironic that oli the day of this new Accord, in the local Bundaberg newspaper, the News Mail, Mr Hajenko's story has been told under the headline, 'Average working families ignored'. Mr Hajenko is quoted in that article as saying: I am just very concemed that the government honouring its commitments to the of the country and I was under a false impression that those who work get some reward for their labour. He obviously thinks they do not. It is obvious from true stories like this that workers concerned about their job security and dard of living, yet this government's coaster approach to economic policy served to create uncertainty and division in the workplace. I will now deal with the issue of unemployworking ment. Today's Accord claims to create proprietor, 600,000 new jobs by the end of the decade. Yet unemployment remains a critical issue regional Australia. I wintake you on a trip the Queensland coast. In my electorate of Hinkler in Central Queensland, one in every three teenagers looking for work cannot a job. That situation extends from the Sunlevel shine Coast to Ingham.' In the Wide Bayeconomy, Burnett region, the southern part of my regulations. electorate, the figure is closer to 40 per cent. The general unemployment rate, according to the DEET small area labour statistics, is 9.9 per cent in Gladstone, 10.5 per cent in Rockhampton and 12.4 per cent in Bundathat, berg. They are all well above the Queensland and national unemployment averages. The facts are that this government the answers and its inability to perform even permeates Working Nation-the government's closing big attack on unemployment-which is they clearly faltering. The statistical decline in long-term unemployment since Working Nation is largely a government inspired mirage. It has more to do with the government redefining 70,000 longof term unemployed as short-term unemployed after putting them through a labour' market program. In other words, if you keep them g()ing through labour market programs, you can say that they are no longer long-term unemployed. What a hopeless fraud. Comresponsibility mencements in jobstart, the government's most successful labour market program-l do not knock it, but those opposite boom it up with rhetoric-in the first six months of Working Nation collapsed to 30,000 fewer than in the same period the previous year. is not Commencements in other programs have also working families fallen well behind. The unemployment figures are further fudged by redefining certain groups of unemployed. For instance, the Department of Social Security figures now exclude those previously are unemployed people who receive the mature stanage allowance and the widows allowance. rollerLast month these redefined unemployed has represented a total of 46,000 people. Last week in some 48 hours I was confronted with three gut tearing cases of hardsmall business people-a nursery a stainless steel fabricator and a locksmith. The nursery, the Pennyroyal Herb in Farm, is a marvellous tourist attraction and up production nursery. It was a state finalist in the Queensland tourism awards and a finalist in the business executive of the year awards get in Queensland. This nursery has reached a of exasperation with the market, the raising finances and government All of this was heightened by the fatuous statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Brisbane on 11 May this year that 'this is as good as it ever gets' for small business and if they cannot hack it, they should 'get out'. The nursery proprietor in a letter to the Prime Minister-a copy of which she gave does not have me-asked rhetorically: Please tell me how to tell my 15 staff that we are down-if that is what you suggest and that should join the unemployed-as we will have to do. Mr Nehl-And Labor laughs.",102
273,Mr NEVILLE,PAPERS,"Yes. I am not a bit surprised that those opposite laugh about the fate these 15 employees in a provincial city. But we will see what happens to them in the upcoming state and federal elections. The other two small businesses have been through the ringer with the recent unfair dismissal actions. This is the area of the minister's on which he has been forced to back down ignominiously this week. One of these small businesses is also having trouble with inconsistencies between state and federal superannuation regulations. The other is having a horrendous paperwork war over sales tax, which has been exacerbated by the proposed 12 per cent sales tax on certain building materials. These are just three small businesses in my electorate that have come to my office in 48 hours. If you multiply that by 800,000 small businesses in Australia, who I remind this House are the nation's biggest employers, you have the formula for a disaster in a sector which could offer considerable hope for our unemployed. I would have liked to touch on a recent report on poverty in Queensland but time prevents me from doing so. It is an outrage that in Bundaberg, which is in my electorate of Hinkler, 46 per cent of all households are living on an income of less than $25,000 per annum. Mr Forrest-Shameful.",103
274,Mr NEVILLE,PAPERS,"Indeed, it is shameful. One of the key provisions of today's accord agreement relates to the government's backdown this week on the unfair dismissal provisions of the current Industrial Relations Act. It was just three weeks ago in this House that the Minister for Industrial Relations defended these provisions. He said: The fact is that we have got the balance of policy right and our policies are working. Those policies are not working and neither will Accord Mark VIII.",104
275,Mr LATHAM,PAPERS,"Werriwa) (5.18 p.m.)Every member of this House would know that the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has had some pretty low moments in his political career. You only need to go back to the night of the last election to understand how his baby, Fightback, blew the coalition right out of the water. He must have had that same sinking feeling this afternoon when, after having lodged this MPI at the Speaker's office before midday, he came to read the text of Accord Mark VIII, which has quality, reform and improvements written all over it. The blood must have drained right out of his face as it did on the night of the last election. What the member for Flinders and the opposition are saying through this matter of public importance is that they do not believe in cooperation with the Australian trade union movement, Australian workers and the Australian work force. They do not believe in the accord process which has created over 600,000 new jobs since March 1993. They do not believe in the target that has been established in accord mark 8 of another 600,000 new jobs over the next four years. Just as the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was wrong two years ago when he said that could not be achieved, the opposition is wrong again in 1995 in saying that the target set by the government and the ACTU will not be achieved. This MPI is proof positive of how the opposition does not believe in an accord process which can produce sustainable low inflation for Australia through cooperation with the trade union movement. The opposition does not believe in a process which provides an achievable target of underlying inflation in Australia of being between two and three per cent. This MPI is proof positive of how the member for Flinders and the opposition do not believe in a system which has lowered industrial disputes in Australia since 1983 by 66 per cent. They do not believe in a system which has the sophistication, the guile and wit to link industrial relations to rates of money wages in Australia, to the fabric of the social wage. They do not believe in a sophisticated safety net in Australia, how a government can put together a package of flexible industrial relations, skill development and training in Australia, employment growth and a strong social wage and do it in consultation and cooperation with the trade union movement. The proof is there again today. The union movement in Australia is leading the cheer squad for low inflation in a manner that could never be achieved by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) or a coalition government. Quite simply, the trade union movement in Australia in 1995 has the sophistication, experience and good sense of national interest to know that there is no point pursuing aggressive money wage increases if that produces undesirable economic outcomes. The sophisticated model is to understand that dollar in the hand from the social wage is worth just as much as a dollar in the hand from the money wage. The union movement can cooperate with the government to coordinate those two aspects of economic policywage claims and the social wage. Dr Kemp-Battlers are not impressed by sophisticated models.",104
276,Mr LATHAM,PAPERS,"That happens in this country because of the purpose and unity of political and industrial labour. The member for Goldstein, with his jackboots on, might scoff but the truth is it can only happen in Australia under a Labor government through the purpose and unity of political and industrial labour. This MPI today is proof positive of how the coalition does not believe in an award safety net through cooperation with Australian trade unions and how it does not believe in enterprise bargaining and the growth of enterprise agreements through cooperation with workers. At the end of the day, the coalition does not like the accord. It hates the idea that it has been successfully renewed seven times, including today's historic Accord Mark VIII. At the end of the day, the coalition does not like trade unions. It does not like talking to trade unionists. It does not like consulting with Australian working people. It does not like the idea of the Australian work force having a legitimate say in the way in which this nation and its economy are managed. Only Labor has demonstrated the unity and purpose of political and industrial labour to put together a sophisticated economic and industrial model. This has beet! the historic transformation. The MPI seeks to talk about industrial relations reform. There has been a bucket load of it in the last decade. Only under Labor has the nation made the historic transformation-80 years of centralised industrial relations out of the court in Melbourne-to a flexible, workable, cooperative industrial relations environment. If it had been the Liberal Party and the National Party, spearheaded by the member for Goldstein, attempting that task over the last 10 years, what would have happened? We would have had the jackboots style of the a H.R. Nicholls Society. We would have had legislation drafted by the wordsmiths at the H.R. Nicholls Society with the member for Goldstein scribbling away. He would not be able to scribble the words down fast enough, as John Stone, Judith Sloan and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) put the jackboots on and try to deregulate the Australian industrial relations system through confrontation and disputation. That would have been the inevitable result. There would not have been a single productivity improvement. We would have seen the closing down of Australian industry through confrontation and disputation-strike after strike after strike. Only under Labor have we seen 4,500 enterprise agreements formalised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission60 per cent of federal award workers under an enterprise bargain. This applies not just for big business but also for small business-70 per cent of the agreements cover enterprises with fewer than 100 employees. The member for Goldstein asked about productivity. There is a bucket load of productivity out of these enterprise agreements because 75 per cent of them address specific productivity measures, with a positive flow-on impact for standards of living in this nation. The member for Goldstein should forget about all the neanderthals and jackboots at the H.R. Nicholls Society. He should just start writing down the notes of the Labor government. He should write down the sophisticated model for a smaIl trading nation. He should get his pen out and write it down-industrial relations flexibility in cooperation with the trade union movement, genuine enterprise bargain. Mr Cleary interjecting",105
277,Mr LATHAM,PAPERS,"Mr 45 per cent wants to join the debate. We are talking about productivity. Mr 45 per cent, the member for Wills, has joined the debate. He is the sort of person who would drive productivity down. If we took him as the model worker, productivity in Australia would be halved. We would go back to the centralised industrial relations system in Melbourne with the member for Wills out there writing out productivity agreements for every workplace in the country-not 100 per cent under Labor, but 45 per cent. It would be half rates under the member for Wills. So he has no right whatsoever to be interjecting in this debate. He is the least distinguished worker in this place. In terms of the sophisticated model, I will round out the model for the extreme Left and the extreme Right. One thing about politics is that, if you come around far enough, you reach a point of consensus. The extreme Left and the extreme Right in the end agree with an authoritarian approach to public policythat is, bash people. That is the style from both the extreme Right and the extreme Left. The truth is that only Labor knows the middle way. Only Labor has the sophisticated model of IR flexibility, the genuine enterprise bargaining, the productivity focus, the low disputation and low strike rate around Australia and, in the end, low inflation and wage restraint because workers know the relationship between wages and productivity. It is not 45 per cent productivity with the member for Wills and that authoritarian, extreme Left, Albanian style of industrial relations. Instead, it is the sort of approach that produces gains in cooperation with the trade union movement and produces employment growth. There have been 600,000 new jobs since the last election. With the new accord comes the promise of another 600,000 jobs in the next four years. This is a beautiful, sophisticated model for a small, successful trading nation. It all adds up and the bottom line is higher standards of living. That is the point of the historic Accord Mark VIII. It shows that in the food chain of public policy it is an advanced species. While the Liberal Party and the member for Wills are still dragging their knuckles with an old authoritarian style of industrial relationsMr Cleary-Albania.",105

279,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"Brian Howe's departure from the deputy prime ministership calls for some reflection on the nature of politics, particularly as his seat of Batman, adjoining my electorate of Wills, is now being targeted-as is my electorate and the electorate of Maribyrnong-by a trinity of retreating state Labor MLAs. Brian Howe's departure has opened the way for yet another state Labor MP to run up the white flag and lay down arms in the battle against Kennett. These are the same characters who run around the northern suburbs telling us how devastating life is becoming because of Kennett. All the while they deceive people about their own intentions and the complicity of the federal government in the privatisation, freeway-widening juggernaut that is consuming Victoria. I did not agree with the member for Batman's position on the Medicare surcharge, and I think he should have been a stronger critic of Kennett and the state ALP's freewaywidening agenda. Nevertheless, I acknowledge several of the initiatives which he has taken, particularly in urban policy and the needs of the inner city residents of Melbourne. The electorates of Wills and Batman-and indeed Maribyrnong-share distinctive qualities. All three electorates are situated in the northern suburbs of Melbourne-areas where free market policies of the kind that the Whippet from Werriwa endorses have destroyed manufacturing industry and created rising rates of unemployment. And hardly a person has taken up the Whippet's offer to fly to or ring Sydney to escape their own social reality. The Whippet's hero, Margaret Thatcher, had a simpler solution. She just told displaced workers to get on their bikes. The better cities program facilitated by Brian Howe goes some way to fostering a distinctive inner urban culture. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by contrast, is more interested in his grand vision for waterfront Sydney, the restoration of 18th century Paris and the redesign of Berlin-all of which show that he is a cultural aficionado but none of which will enhance the lives of the battlers, which both sides of the parliament claim to be so concerned about. In the northern suburbs of Melbourne, the future of the material resources of the locality is open to question. Sydney Road, the spine of the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg, has in the past been a vital and lively urban environment. Along the street are a number of heritage listed buildings, including the Presbyterian church in Sydney Road, Coburg; St Ambrose church and school; Cumberland Arms Hotel; Duke of Edinburgh Hotel; and the Mechanics Institute-all, excluding the first mentioned, of Sydney Road, Brunswick. Only a Francophile or a textbook architect would be oblivious to the grand Victorian streetscape of Brunswick. Around these buildings are rows of two-storey shops which locals claim make Sydney Road the longest shopping street in Australia. Many of these buildings still support a rich Brunswick Mechanics Institute, the Retreat Hotel and the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, for example, are favourite places for regular music concerts, drawing on all of the rich multicultural traditions of these suburbs. I may not hear Mahler in Sydney Road but come the Brunswick Music Festival you will hear some of the best and most diverse traditional music in the world. It is buildings such as these in Sydney Road which need funds for recycling so that the whole street, rather than merely a handful of bUildings, can once again playa part in the community life of the northern suburbs. We need to extend the better cities program into new areas of social need in inner city areas, especially areas ravaged by the free market policies of the last 15 years. I know that this government has set up REDOs to promote local investment. These, I believe, are too broad in their geographical reach and so ALP driven that they cannot truly reflect the political and cultural aspirations of local communities. We do not want 'yes men' and 'yes women' on REDOs. We want people with independence and vision. While the opposition's recent briefing paper on regional development alludes to this problem, it is based on the assumption that regions do not exist in the city. Looking at the list of ALP candidates lined up to run for inner city seats in Melbourne at the next federal election, we have to wonder whether Brian Howe's vision is about to be passed on. Why do Bob Sercombe, Kelvin Thomson and Theo Theophanous want to run away from state parliament? Where do they really stand on the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway, the privatisation of public assets beyond the ones targeted by Kennett-the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom and Australia Postand the rejuvenation of the northern suburbs? It is a sad fact that the Brian Howes of the world are not being replaced in the parliament; they are being replaced by the likes of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)devotees of free market policies. This is a bloke who wants to point the finger arrogantly at people and who really gets about one point out of 10 for substance and about 3Y2 cultural life. The points for gall. Brumer, Mr M.",106
280,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"In the adjournment debate this evening, honourable members may be surprised that I will speak not on Jeffrey Kennett but on a constituent of mine, Mr Maurice Brumer. Maurice is a qualified second generation optometrist who has had continuous sole practice in Frankston for over 25 years. He is actively campaigning on behalf of children who, through no fault of their own, are condemned to a life of reading difficulties and early departure from the education system. Maurice has been punished for raising concerns about current standards of optometrical practice and the need to better incorporate findings of research into current modes of practice. In a paper entitled 'Optometry: light of a perverted science', he initiated a discussion on the issue of spectacles being a harmful drug when not prescribed properly. He canvassed a number of matters relating to prolonged and intensive near-seeing, which he believes is not good for our eyes and our health. He firmly stated that the public has a right to know how glasses may adversely affect good health. Maurice made the point that he did not think this would happen while the optometry profession put the public interest in second place to its own selfinterests. For his efforts, Maurice Brumer was expelled from the Victorian division of the Australian Optometrical Association, a first in history. He dared challenge the cabal that rules optometry in Victoria when he spoke out at a 1992 annual meeting of the Victoria AOA and the national AOA. An extensive body of theoretical and clinical evidence already exists to show the harmful effects of current optometrical practices. The analogy could be made to tobacco companies, where no amount of research and evidence will convince them of the health related problems of smoking and to the scandal it would be if they could successfully suppress such evidence. In the belief that the burden of proof lies with the profession to show that its current standards of practices are in the best interests of its patients, Maurice presented a paper before 400 optometrists. The only response since was for the Australian Optometrical Association to make him the first member ever expelled from the association. The Australian Optometrical Association rigidly enforces the code that the first obligation of the optometrist is to his professional colleagues. Maurice insists it is to his patients. Public Service",107
281,Mr SMYTH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I have a question-in fact it is almost a riddle that my little girls would ask. It goes like this: what do the following all have in common-the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission now located in Sydney, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal now located in Brisbane, the Industry Commission now located in Melbourne, Australian Defence Industries now located in Sydney, the Australia Post national stamp collection now located in Melbourne and the CSIRO headquarters now located in Melbourne? They all used to be Public Service bodies located in Canberra, and it is this Labor government that has moved these bodies and staff out of Canberra. If the government had had its way, it would have done more. It would have moved the Maritime Safety Authority to Newcastle, but it backed down under intense pressure. It was the federal Labor government that voted for the Australian National Training Authority. to go to Brisbane rather than to the ACT. It was this government that suggested the transfer of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to Sydney. Yet it is this government, through Senator MCMullan, that is attempting to ridicule the coalition and wrongly and incorrectly say that the coalition will move departments and public servants out of the Australian Capital Territory, when it is those members opposite who have been doing the moving. They are hypocrites. There must be an election in the air! What is more, the Labor Party trots out the old chestnut that it is the coalition that slashes the Public Service. Let us look at the government's recent record. The front page of the Canberra Times on 11 May 1995 says 'Budget '95: The Aftermath: Many to be out of job, says Johns'. The government should come clean. When will it say how many jobs will be lost in the federal Public Service through its budget? What hypocrites and deceivers government members are. Let us look at some of the figures for last year. In 1993 there were 143,100 permanent public servants employed under the Public Service Act. A year later, in December 1994, there were only 132,500 left. If it is not the Labor Party slashing the Public Service, then who is it? Admittedly, some of those public servants moved across to the Australian Capital Territory health department, but it is about time Senator MCMullan came clean on what his party is doing to the Public Service instead of trotting out old lies and deceptions. Senator MCMullan said in a press release that I should stand up for Canberra. Perhaps he should have listened to my maiden speech. Perhaps he should practise what he preaches. I have written to the responsible minister, the foot-in-mouth member for Petrie (Mr Johns), and asked about his comment that large numbers of public servants would be out of a job after the 9 May budget. I am yet to get an answer. Perhaps Senator MCMullan, as a representative in Canberra, could hurry him up and get an answer for all Canberrans and all Australians about their Public Service. While he is at it, he might ask the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) when the promised Lake George upgrade will begin. Let us go a step further. What about the jewel in the crown of the government's cultural policy in the lead-up to the 1993 election? 'We will build a National Museum of Australia,' it said. Here we are in 1995, another election in the air, and do the people of Australia have a museum? No. Are the numbers of public servants who will be employed at the National Museum of Australia growing? No. Here is a promise, which has been made several times, that the coalition will fulfil: will build a National Museum of Australia at Yarramundi Reach here in the ACT and there will be public servants employed at it. Unlike the Labor Party, which is full of deceivers and tellers of half-truths who pull out chestnuts before every election just to bolster their own aims and to scare ordinary Australians, the coalition, when we are elected, will build the National Museum of Australia and we will staff it with public servants. It is about time the old myth that the Public Service and the Liberal Party have no affinity with each other is put to rest. I am proud to say that during the Canberra by-election-a by-election at which I must admit John Howard was more than welcome to attend, unlike the Prime Minister who will not be going to Queensland-John Howard made it abundantly clear that the Liberal Party has never been philosophically anti-Public Service. Indeed, we will have an effective and efficient Public Service-unlike under the Labor government-that will allow us to put in place our party's policies and to build a better Australia. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific Mr GmSON (Moreton) (5.41 p.m.)-Over the past few days there have been a lot of words said, both inside and outside this House, about the issue of resumption of nuclear testing by the French.· There have been a lot of words spoken by members of the opposition who have suddenly newly discovered this issue after having ignored it for some 20-odd years. I want to welcome the support of the opposition on this question. I am pleased to see that the opposition has discovered the fact that nuclear testing in the South Pacific is a risk to all the peoples who live in the South Pacific. I welcome the fact that the opposition has finally, after some 20 years, decided to support the peace movement in Australia in its continuous campaign against nuclear testing. I hope this means that the opposition will support motions in this place which condemn the development of nuclear weapons, in any country. I hope it means that the opposition will become a strong supporter of the peace we movement around Australia. I hope that, in the next couple of weeks when rallies are held in various capital cities around this country campaigning against the nuclear testing by the French, we will see opposition members at those rallies. It will be a new experience for them because they have never been to a peace rally in their lives. They do not even understand what a peace rally is. They have usually bagged the peace rallies and called them all sorts of names. But I am delighted that they have now joined the peace movement and that they are prepared to support end nuclear weapons throughout the world and to end nuclear testing in the South Pacifjoin ic. I would also welcome the support of the opposition for a petition that I have distributour ed. Mr Speaker, you will be aware that I have sent a petition to every member of the parliaAustralian ment - all members of the House of RepresenFrance tatives and of the Senate-because this issue is one that is above politics. This is an issue that affects all Australians. All Australian members of parliament should be nuclear behind the campaign to stop testing in South Pacific. I have sent a copy of my petition to every member of the federal parliament, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. I hope that they will do as I am doing. I distributing it to every community group, sports club, senior citizens group and pensionsignatures er group in my electorate. I hope they will distribute it throughout their electorates as any water. well. What we need to do is to mobilise the people of Australia in this campaign. A lot words have been spoken about what the national government should have done, who should sion. have said this and who should have said that; but what we are here to do is to represent the people of Australia. The people of Australia are outraged at this decision of the French government. It is something that we all condemn. We need to give the people of Australia a clear opportunity to voice their concerns. The petition I have distributed throughout this country is one way that the Australian people can have their voice heard. It is the only way and it is not by itself going to change the French government's know that, but I am optimistic enough to believe that, if the people of Australia can gather together a loud enough voice to tell the people of France that we do not like what they have done in deciding to resume testing and that we are opposed to the dangers and the risks that this will pose to the health not only of our people but of people throughout the South Pacific, then maybe they will start telling their government that they disagree the campaign to with that decision. This petition is one more way that we can together to add our voice to this campaign. It is a way that we can have millions of Australians supporting our government in campaign to end testing in the South Pacific. We need to gather the voice of all people and tell the people of that they need to tell their government I believe to stop testing. I hope that all members of parliament will distribute the petition entitled 'Stop French tests in the Pacific'. It is a petition to the the French ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Dominique Girard. I hope that all members will distribute the petition around their electorates, get lots of signatures and send it back to me by 10 July, so that I can am deliver to the French ambassador on Bastille Day, 14 July, hundreds of thousands of on behalf of the Australian people. Mr Tim Fischer-You won't be drinking Mr GffiSON-I certainly will not be going to any celebrations at the embassy, nor will of I be drinking any wine to celebrate French day, unless France reverses its deciAboriginal Health",108
282,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"A couple in my electorate run a highly successful training and rehabilitation program for young Aboriginals who are trying to give up petrol sniffing. The young people are trained to be stockmen and stockwomen at a station in the remote north of Grey. Petrol sniffing is a major concern in the community. It kills; it not causes lifelong diseases; and, like most destructive addictions, it tears families apart decision. I and ruins young lives. DEET has supported this training and rehabilitation program for some time because of its success. Late last year, an officer of the Department of Human Services and Health met with the couple who run the program. The officer was impressed and suggested that, because the program dealt with petrol sniffers, perhaps funding applications should be directed to the Department of Human Services and Health; after all, petrol sniffing is a health issue and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had been telling all of us in this House that she wanted to include Aboriginal health in her portfolio. Given such encouragement, the couple running the stockman program wrote to the department in October 1994 asking for funding assistance. November and December ticked by without a response. It was the new year and still the minister had not responded to the funding application. The couple obtained letters of support from the South Australian minister and they also obtained a recommendation from the Catholic archbishop, but still no word from the minister. The couple learned that the minister was going to be in Adelaide. They asked to meet with her and-Io!-they finally received a letter from her. She wrote to inform them she was not available to meet them. When do you think these people, who work very hard and run this great program in the middle of Australia for young Aboriginal people who desperately need a new start in life, heard from the minister? The couple received a letter from the department's alcohol workplace unit on 11 May 1995. I suppose it was only seven months after the initial inquiry. You cannot complain about that, I guess. You are probably lucky to get a response from this minister at all. It was an enormous slap in the face when we look at the minister's rhetoric on Aboriginal health during her time in the federal parliament. In February this year during a debate on Aboriginal health the minister said: It is very important indeed ... that we do make progress in this area and I for one am determined to do so ... That is from Hansard of 28 February 1995. It is very important to make progress? She is determined to do so'? She cannot even answer a letter about Aboriginal health in the same year as she receiwd it. The minister also admitted in February this year that 'funds that we have applied in .-boriiinal affairs have not had the desired effect that we would all wish'. She went on to say: I want to point out that this serious matter requires cooperation: it requires bipartisan support. Minister, I think it requires you answering your correspondence. As for bipartisan support, the minister has received a wealth of it. The coalition supported the national Aboriginal health strategy, the Aboriginal education strategy and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, just to name a few. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and have worked on the issues for many hours. My electorate takes in many traditional Aboriginal communities, including Pitjantjatjara lands and Maialinga-Tjarutja lands-in fact about 30 per cent of Grey is Aboriginal lands. The case I have just outlined shows that we have a health minister who cannot cope with Aboriginal health. Her treatment of this issue has been totally incompetent. She cannot even answer correspondence. I despair for the direction of Aboriginal health under this government. Timber and Dairy Industries",110
283,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I note that the last speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). has worked for hours on Aboriginal health. My father has been working in that area since 1949 and so have a lot of other people. I think a few hours by the member. as opposed to what has been put in by our Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). leaves his comments where they need to be left. Mr Speaker. I wish to speak about something positive in my electorate. You will recall that I haw stood up in this House on a number of occasions and given the House and the parliament progress in the building. timber and forestry industries in mv area. It is a subject that many walk awa;.: from because they find the difficulties in the industry beyond their comprehension or because their ability to do something is limited. In my electorate. you wi 11 remember. I became involwd virtually the week after I was elected because there was a resource called water being pushed out into the ocean in ocean outfalls. In fact. there was a rather outrageous proposal being put forward by the local council, the Shoalhaven City Council, to try to propagate ocean outfalls. After a long time, and after a number of public debates with the mayor and others, it was resolved that, with the help of DEET, we would go through and have a look at ways employment might be generated by the use of that water. Surprise, surprise! The Shoalhaven City Council is now having problems allocating the water equitably among farmers. My dreams of it being used in the forestry industry will not come to fruition. That is not because of my lack of trying, but because more profitable uses for that water have come to the surface. In fact, there have been people who have contacted the council and said, 'If you drought-proof us, we will bring large amounts of money to your area and spend it.' I did not give up. Over the last two years, we have been looking at other ways we can go about it. True, the corporate structure I had envisaged, of the council, the landowner and the timber industry components putting in an effluent management scheme which had a capital component built in behind it, may not eventuate in the near future. However, there is a team from the government working in my electorate, headed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook. Because of that team effort I am in a position where I have agreement, in principle, from a number of business people in the timber industry to form a holding company, which will aim to bring together production from some 30,000 hectares of plantations over the next few years. These people joining with the landowners will benefit the forestry industry, which was once the backbone of the industry along our section of the coast, Mr Speaker, stretching from your beautiful electorate of Cunningham down to the. electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). You would recall the red cedar from Kiama that adorns the Sydney Town Hall. That timber, the internals of Kiama, is spread out in those benches. Much of the timber from the Wollongong and Illawarra areas adorns Parliament House in Macquarie Street in Sydney. Many of us have looked at the industry. We have seen the cleared lands. We have seen that the agricultural use after clearing is not outstandingly successful in terms of profits and attractions of the area. However, the dairy industry is one of those industries which are an exception. It has brought great wealth to our area and has been the mainstay of our area for a large number of years. It will continue to be so, despite the efforts of some, such as my former aldermanic opponent, Neville Fredericks, to try to urbanise those areas. The dairy industry will survive because it is able to diversify. The timber industry offers the dairy industry a way of keeping its lifestyle and a way of keeping its land together, and, by doing that, a way of improving the agricultural output of the dairy industry and its own productive units. What I say to you, Mr Speaker, is that with continued prescience in this place I believe we can achieve goals. Agribusiness will develop in a big way in our area. As you understand, Mr Speaker, coming from the region, we are taking it very seriously. We will provide, where the National Party and the Liberal Party have not, not just rhetoric but results. (Time expired) Pethidine",111
284,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (5.54 p.m.)I wish to bring to the attention of the House a situation that I find quite extraordinary and a matter that must be addressed by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) as a matter of urgency. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has made a decision that pethidine for long-term use is no longer available under the national health scheme and, despite the matter being reviewed some two weeks ago, the decision has been confirmed. The PBAC has displayed what I would consider to be a mixture of gross ignorance and unsubstantiated assumption that cannot in any way be condoned by the Australian community or many of Australia's doctors. By way of background: this situation came to my attention via a local constituent and her doctor. If the opportunity presents itself I will read the letter from the doctor which clearly sets out the position and shows the advisory committee's total lack of compassion. It seems extraordinary to both me and my patient's treating doctor that he can prescribe morphine or methadone for long-term use and this apparently is condoned by the PBAC as acceptable, but not so for pethidine. There is absolutely no reason why pethidine should be treated any differently, and I find it absolutely galling that the committee can make a unilateral decision without having any awareness of the likely impact of that decision on the individual patient. The simple fact is that my constituent has undergone specialist examination, has attended pain clinics and has done everything that would reasonably be expected of someone in her position suffering from chronic pain. It is about time that the committee accepted that there will be people severely affected""by its decision. What is equally galling is that the basis for the committee's decision is that it believes the use of pethidine long. term is 'inappropriate treatment'. As far as my constituent and her doctor are concerned, the treatment by way of long-term pethidine prescription is totally appropriate treatment and I fail to see how the committee can make such a widespread value judgment without in any way taking into account individual circumstances. The other galling aspect is that, relative to other drugs, pethidine is extremely cheap and, therefore, there can be no financial reason for the advisory committee's decision. I am angry about this decision. My constituent and her doctor are angry about this decision. I understand that many doctors throughout Australia are angered by this deCision. If, as I believe may be the situation, the committee has made this decision on the views of one member of the committee, can I respectfully suggest that all committee members take a long, hard look at that advice. Prior to reading out that letter from my constituent's treating doctor, I would like to make a final comment, and that is: how dare the advisory committee presume to know more about a patient's appropriate treatment than the patient's treating doctor. The letter from my constituent's treating doctor reads: This pleasant woman suffers chronic pain due to having developed an arachnoiditis, i.e. Iflflarnmation surrounding the spinal cord. There is no cure and essentially she will probably become paralysed. Unfortunately she has lit very low tolerance to opiates, i.e. morphine and methadone. These cause her severe nausea. The one drug that did assist her was pethidine in injectable form and used once daily in combination with other therapeutic agents. Unfortunately pethidine (injectable) is no longer available for long term use on the N.H.S. Scheme, and any attempt to prescribe them in this manner would be questioned by the Health Department. She does use pethidine tablets but these are largely ineffectual and of course she has to pay for these at the rate of $36.00 per hundred tablets. She requires a minimum of six fifty mgm tablets daily which really do not give her effective relief. Apart from this there is the cost to her as a Pensioner. Is it possible to get through you peimission to prescribe pethidine injectable for this woman. For the life of me, I cannot see why pethidine is only allowed for short term use only, when I can prescribe other opiates freely! This is an extraordinary situation. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is denying my constituent and many other constituents the ability to obtain relief from chronic pain. How dare the committee have the gall to tell my constituent and my constituent's doctor that it knows more about appropriate treatment for her than her treating doctor does! Question resolved in the affirmative.

There is an expectation, as we have indicated and the Main Committee to oversee the passage ministers have been very responsive to their portfolio responsibilities to the chamber but of the chamber and to this parliament as an courteous reminder to ministers that they do and to ensure the passage of their legislation. MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2187 memorandum also fulfils that legal purpose as in expressing the government's purposes behind as far as the courts are concerned. But, as I is a political statement, so the opposition reading speech in advance of its leading speaker are not necessarily reflected in the text of which the shadow minister or the person leading since they need to respond, under these current minister's second reading speech, they are often that should be allowed to persist and we have in detail stage.

Question time is, and will continue to be, is a gladiatorial time, an adversarial time and in which members of the opposition seek information. a question they do not want an answer; their government under pressure and then, frequently, the opposition quite understandably complain On most occasions the claim that the answer the answer is not the answer they I would like members of the House of Representatives the nature of question time, to the purpose minister to get expert advice from the bureaucracy advisers to the ministers and the ministers answers go out.

Firstly, Committee has been a successful innovation comments in the report indicate that the Main part of the process of debate, consideration. certainly endorse that and endorse the comments in that regard. I note the comments that were made in the need to take steps to encourage visitors to the Main Committee as well as the proceedings members of the committee did not go into any might want to pursue in that regard: perhaps assist.

This is probably a reasonable suggestion, other things; they do have other responsibilities. suggestion is that we would need to ensure that were going to be required to attend question schedule alternative commitments: meetings MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 enhanced the workings of the parliament.

Both the rostering raised in the report. With respect to the timing that the later time of question time is marginally other obligations that backbenchers have. I about the alternative that has been put forward the question of rostering. One recommendation entitled to demand the presence of one minister that, where there is a particular issue running that minister cannot hide behind the fact of not but it needs to be kept in mind that ministers do Part of the difficulty in pursuing this ministers actually had some notice that they time. Otherwise they would not be able to with delegations, functions and the like.

(2) Will the Government meet the Centre's funding requirements after 30 June 1996; if so how. (3) What action is the government taking to avoid the Centre experiencing a funding crisis.",155
359,Mr HOWE,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Albury Wodonga Ministerial Council decided on 27 August 1993 to provide the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre with funding from the Albury Wodonga Development Corporation (A WDC) until 30 June 1996. However, continued funding beyond this point was considered inappropriate. The reasons for the decision included: the AWDC' s revised operational arrangements made the funding arrangements inappropriate; the level of funding provided was out of scale with the AWDC' s community services responsibilities; under the current diverse funding mechanisms, Parliaments would not have access to a complete picture of the resources devoted to this project. (2) The Centre receives funding through a number of agencies including the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, the CSIRO, the Cooperative Research Centre Program, and the Water Resources Research and Development Organisation. Future funding support for the Centre will be determined by these organisations/programs according to their budgetary circumstances and NA (3) The AWDC advised the Centre in 1993 that Centre AWDC funding would only be provided until 30 June 1996. It is up to the Centre to respond appropriately. Extreme Disablement Adjustment (Question No. 2292) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon. notice, on 9 May 1995: (1) How many persons have qualified for the Extreme Disablement Adjustment (EDA) since it was introduced. (2) How many unsuccessful applicants for EDA received lifestyle ratings of (a) 4 and (b) 5. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since the Extreme Disablement Adjustment was introduced with effect from 22 December 1988, 7520 veterans have qualified for this rate of disability pension. 3936 of these have since died. (2) Veterans do not have to specifically apply for EDA and there is no special application form. Eligibility for EDA is automatically considered when Disability Pension is being assessed following a new claim for a disability pension or application for increase in pension, and the veteran is: assessed at 100% of the General Rate of disability pension, aged 65 years or over, and does not qualify for the Intermediate Rate or Special Rate of disability pension. To be granted EDA a veteran who meets this initial criteria must also be assessed under the Guide to Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions having a Lifestyle Rating of at least 6 and an impairment rating of at least 70 points. Precise information is not available on veterans considered for EDA. It is known that of those living veterans of all ages assessed at 100% and rated at 70 impairment points since 22 December 1988 some 700 had a lifestyle rating of 4 and some objectives. 500 had a lifestyle rating of 5.",157
