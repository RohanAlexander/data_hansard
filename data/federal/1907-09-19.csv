1,Mr HALL,Unknown,I desire to know from the Acting Prime Minister if he can inform the House when an opportunity will be given for the settlement of the Federal Capital question?,15
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,At the present time it is impossible to fix a date.,15
3,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he remembers having given the promise to me, at the beginning of the session, that an early opportunity would be provided during the session for the consideration of the Federal Capital question, and whether he will be prepared within, say, the next fortnight, to announce definitely when be expects to deal with the subject?",15
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not remember the promise referred to, but I shall adhere to whatever I have said. MAIL SERVICE TO PAPUA, SOLOMON ISLANDS, AND NEW HEBRIDES.",15
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Some little time ago - I think in July last - tenders were called for a mail service from Australia to Papua, the Solomons, ' and the New Hebrides, As there has been a good deal of complaint about the accommodation provided by the steamers ..now' carrying mails and passengers, I wish to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether new tenders have been or are to be accepted, and if he can afford the House information as to the conditions which are to' be imposed ?",15
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The following memorandum from the Secretary for External Affairs gives all the' information available on the subjectThe contract between the Commonwealth and Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company for a steam service to Papua is about to terminate. existing service is an enlargement and exten- tions. sion of the Solomon Islands line, which, with one steamer, gave two-monthly trips to those Islands. At present both the Solomons and Papua have 21 trips per annum, with two steamers. The subsidy paid foT the present service, exclusive of that paid on account of the Solomons, is ,£1,500 per annum. Tenders were called for a new service for three years by advertisement, of which a copy is attached. Messrs. Bums, Philp and Co. were the only tenderers. They submit alternative offers as followOffer No. 1 - To continue the present circular service from Sydney and Brisbane, vid the Solomons and Papua pofts, to Cooktown and Cairns, by the Moresby .(1,763 tons), and the Makambo (1,159 tons). Until recently the running has been maintained by the Moresby and the Malaita (929 tons). The Makambo is a new steamer "" specially built and properly equipped for tropical Tunning with electric light, refrigerators to carry frozen cargo, amidship deck cabins, And all conveniences."" It is proposed, if this offer is accepted, "" to equip, the Moresby with refrigerated space, electric .light, and other improvements, thus providing a thoroughly - up-to-date ocean . service."" For this service the company, ask £4,500 for the first year; £4,000 for the second year; and £3,50° for the third, year. If Cooktown is substituted for ' Cairns ns the Queensland terminal port, the subsidy asked for is £3,750, £3,250, and £2,750 respectively. Offer No. a"" - To revert to the original twomonthly Solomon Islands service from Sydney and Brisbane, with one steamer, extending toPort Moresby, Samarai, and Hall Sound. To supply a three-weekly service with a 500-ton steamer from Cooktown to Woodlark Island, vid Port Moresby and Samarai, less one tripper year omitted for docking purposes. The subsidy asked under this head is £2,500 per annum. The company offer, if the service described under (1) is adopted, to make improvements in the othef lines whichthey run under contract with this Government as follow:Marshall-Gilbert Service - Replac e Y saber (520 tons) by the Inittna. (703 tons). New Hebrides Service - Replac e Induna(703 tons) by the Malaita (929 tons). Gilbert Ellice Service - Replac e Titus (763 tons) by a new steamer of 1,100 tons to beacquired. The service by the existing route has beenfound quite satisfactory to all parties, and in my opinion it would be a matter for regret, now that interest in Papuan development snowssigns of Teal progress, to abandon it in favour of an inferior service with a smaller steamer. I do not see, however, that the advantages of retaining Cairns as the Queensland' terminal port are worth an additional subsidy of £750per annum, as the company undertake to maintain the connection at Cooktown with the vessels of the Australasian United Steam Navigationcoastal service. If it is decided to adopt thecircular service, I recommend the substitution of Cooktown for Cairns as the Queensland terminal port. The company submit a schedule of rates and fares which, if the circular serviceis adopted, - might be amended by reducing the rates to Woodlark Island to those in force to The Samarai.

11,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"the Postmastering General, upon notice I. Is it true, as has been alleged, that mail bags used in the State of Victoria being made in Victorian prisons? 2. If the allegation is true, can the Minister explain how it is that the cost of repairnot. ing the mail bags of Victoria costs more than the making and repairing of mail bags, and other articles used in the service, in New South Wales? 3. Does the Minister intend to continue the practice (if the assertion be true) of having mail bags made by prison labour?",16
12,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as folhave low : 1. Yes, in accordance with State practice thirty years. 3. From reports received, it the cost of both making and repairing mail bags is considerably less per bag in Victoria than in New South Wales. 3. The practice will be discontinued as as the current order has been supplied. ADDITIONS , NEW WORKS, AND BUILDINGS DEPARTMENT or HOME AFFAIRS. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 18th September, vide page 3461): Division 4, sub-division 1 (Post Telegraph, New South Wales), .£34,246. - Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [2.40] - Las night honourable members from New South Wales were loud in their complaints about the condition of the telephone exchanges there, but in these Estimates provision made for a larger number of exchanges that State than in Victoria.",16
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They are all exchanges.,16
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Apparentl y the Sydney metropolitan area is much better served with telephones than is that of Victoria. I desire to urge upon the Postmaster-Genthough eral the need for placing telephone subI scribers more on an equality. I have ready drawn attention to the inequalities which now exist. As the honourable genhas tleman is aware, the Richmond and toria. than yet a mile from any telephone exchange, and a return laid on the table recently or shows that the 241 telephone subscribers there pay on the average about £ 1 2 per annum for their instruments, the telephone subscribers in Hawpay considerably less. There is no telephone exchange in Carlton, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Richmond, and Northcote,' telephone subscribers in those districts havto pay extra mileage rates. The honourable member for Dalley pointed out last the night that subscribers in Camberwell pay are extra rates, while those in Canterbury, a suburb still further from Melbourne, do",16
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is not the present system unfair and absurd?,16
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes . If I rented 'a telephone I should have to pay £ 5 more per annum than would be charged to persons living on the other side of the river in a more fashionable locality. We been told that the exchanges are not to be less than 3 miles apart, but the for South Yarra exchange cannot be 3 miles appears that from the Windsor exchange. - Mr 'MAUGER - It has been found necessary to open an exchange at the South Yarra post office, because it is impossible soon to accommodate all the subscribers in the district at the Windsor exchange. I have SUPPLY. conceded every point which the honourable member is making, and shall endeavour . to bring about an alteration of system as soon as possible.",16
17,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I suppose that we shall have to be satisfied with the promise and that reforms will be carried out in the near future. Of course, the Postmastert General has not been long enough in charge of the Department to make changes. The injustice of which I speak exists in numerous localities. The chargefor telephones, is should be uniform over a certain area, in say within 10 miles of the city, or some system should be adopted under which it old would not be possible to favour certain localities. Persons at - Richmond are not likely to apply for telephones for their private houses when they know that they will be charged £ 8 or £ 9 for them, alHawthorn subscribers pay only £ 5 . t is penalizing certain districts, and I trust althat the Postmaster-General will look into the matter. Evidently New South Wales far less to complain of than has Vic",16
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [2.45] - May I suggest to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat that he will do well to confine his attention to safeguarding the interests of his own State, and to refrain from instituting comparisons between Victoria and New South Wales. Evidently he does not know much about the latter State, otherwise he would not have made the remark with which he concluded his speech. Both the honourable member and myself have a common cause of complaint- a complaint founded upon a gi'ave injustice. My complaint is that the ex-Postmaster-General is responsible for the difficulty which now exists, in that he abolished a system which had worked well for many years. I do not propose to deal with this question at any length. Last night the ex-Fostmaster-General made some most absurd statements. When one sets out to make a ""stump "" speech, I believe that it is proper that his statements should, as far as possible, be in the inverted order, and, true to tradition, the ex-Postmaster General last evening delivered a "" stump "" oration which had little reference to the question under consideration, and in - which his statements were turned topsy-turvy. He asked, "" What about die men who have 6 or 7 miles of wire? Ought not they to pay more than the man who has only 2 or 3 miles of wire ? '' What the honourable gentleman has recently done is to emphasize that very difficulty. My whole complaint is that subscribers who receive least line accommodation are paying the increased charges, whilst those with most line accommodation are receiving the - benefit conferred by the smaller rates. That is the injustice which his recent action has perpetuated. It is an injustice that we hope to have remedied. We have been - promised by the Postmaster-General that something shall be done to remedy it. He has promised two things: first, that the citizens of the Commonwealth who use telephones shall, as far as possible, be treated equally; and, secondly, that he will secure this end by a fair and evenbanded apportionment of telephone facilities.",17
19,Mr WATSON,Unknown,If he would make the toll system universal. it would be a good thing.,17
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not care how uniformity is secured, so long as the ""burden is made to bear equally upon telephone subscribers, and so long as we. do not get a uniformity upwards. It is too late in the day to do that. I complain that the present Postmaster-General is putting the rates up instead of down. I hope that we shall very soon hear from him. that an effort is being made to remedy the shocking injustice of which I complain, so that there will be no further need to deal with the matter in this House.",17
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.48] - I have no desire to revive discussion with the honourable member upon this question, but it is scarcely to be expected that I car. allow him to make the statements which he has made without pointing out what he said last night.",17
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What did I say ?,17
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member said that the anomaly to which he has referred, was due to the fact that Ministers were merely figureheads, and that they were wedded to conservative ideas. He also made a vigorous attack upon the officers of the Department.",17
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The very second sentence which the honourable gentleman utters contains an absolute misrepresentation.,17
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I appeal to honourable members to say whether the honourable member did not make an attack upon the officers of the Departments. When I answered his criticism by putting the cold facts of the case before the Committee, he said that I made a "" stump "" speech. This afternoon he has referred to the framing of absurd regulations arid to "" shocking injustice."" The regulations to which he refers were framed for the purpose of bringing the toll system into operation. We all recollect the "" stump "" speeches which he and many of his friends delivered prior to the initiation of that system. It is refreshing to know that, whilst they then condemned the toll system from one end of the country to the other, they now have, nothing to say in opposition to it. Instead of doing so, the honourable member calmly declared, in answer to a question! put by the honourable member for South Sydney, that he would welcome its universal application- a course which we have always advocated.",17
26,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,We have always advocated it.,17
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Then honourable members opposite had a most peculiar method of advocating it, seeing that they formed large deputations and waited upon the Postmaster-General of the day to protest against its initiation. I recollect that upon one occasion they endeavoured to get the leader of the Opposition to introduce a deputation upon this matter, and when they could not find him they requisitioned the services of Senator Neild. However, we can understand their action because at that time it was popular to scream against the inauguration of the toll system. It is a tribute to the officers of the Department who recommended the adoption of that system that, notwithstanding its denunciation by honourable members, the latter now recognise that it is no longer popular to scream against it. I do not wish to make what the honourable member for Parramatta terms a ""stump"" speech, but when he comes here, loses his temper, and indulges in strong language, it is only right that I should point out how inconsistent he is. He has spoken about the difference between the rate charged to a subscriber with seven miles of wire as compared with that charged to the individual who has only three miles of wire. The regulations framed by me were intended to insure that a man shall pay according to the service which he receives.",17
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No .,18
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The.honourable member has said that a man with seven miles of wire can obtain a cheaper service than the individual with three miles of wire. He was most positive in making that declaration last night in respect of two persons resident in the same place and receiving the same service under the flat rate system. No doubt he has gone through his statement very carefully this morning, but he does not now wish to confirm it. If he could have discovered one weak spot in my declaration of last evening undoubtedly he would have been prepared to criticise it today.",18
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I never gave the matter a thought.,18
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member comes here to interject freely whilst I am speaking, .and when I find that there is no means of stopping his interjections, except by raising my voice to drown his own, he affirms that I have delivered an absurd speech, that I issued absurd regulations, and that he welcomes an extension of the toll system. I welcome him to the fold, because his conversion will make it much easier for the Government to extend the toll system. I am glad that this discussion has had that effect. The toll system aims at placing every subscriber upon the same footing. It gives effect to the principle of payment . by results, and provides that a man shall pay in proportion to the service which he receives. Quite a number of flat rate subscribers in the city, who receive a service which is worth £ 3 0 per annum, pay for it only from £ 5 to £ 9 per annum. The Postal Department has to be made to pay, and it is evident that the difference must be made up by the subscribers who do not get a large service. That is my answer to the honourable member for Parramatta.",18
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is such an an- , swer as the honourable gentleman is capable of making, no doubt ",18
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I am not going to make an answer which will suit the honourable member, and I will not allow him to attack the officers r-f the Department most bitterly-as he did last nightand to endeavour to make it appear that the regulations which I issued were ab'surd, without replying to his misstatements. When the honourable member has no otheranswer to what he has been pleased toterm a "" stump speech,"" he rises in his place and shouts across the table "" Bluff,, bluff.""",18
34,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [2.55] - It affords me great instruction to listen to thespeeches which have been made upon thisquestion by the deputy leader of the Opposition and the ex-Postmaster-General. It is remarkable that whilst the lattercharges the former with advocating the extension of the toll system which he once condemned, the ex-Postmaster-General takes to himself the credit of having inaugurated that system.",18
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Hi s statement is not correct.,18
36,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I cannot say whether it is correct or not, because the honourable member for Parramatta usually denies, everything. In my opinion, no greater bungle has ever been made than that which has been perpetrated in connection with the introduction of the toll telephonic system in the Commonwealth. It is not many years since that system formed a new subject in the discussion of the votes of this Department. The Postmaster-General of the Reid Administration actually knew so little about it that he inquired across the table of the House, "" What is the toll system?"" The introduction- . of that system marked the beginning; of a system of payment by results. After going very deeply into this question, and reviewing the history of telephonic development in older countries, I expressed the opinion by way of interjection - doubtles s the Postmaster-General will remember the occasion-that the scale upon which it was proposed to base the toll rates was an unsatisfactory one. Prior to the introduction of the system in Australia the maximum number of calls permitted in any country was 750, annually, and f d . was charged for each additional call. In other instances a maximum of 600 calls was allowed, and i d . was charged for each additional call.",18
37,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member is referring to other parts of the world.,19
38,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"-Yes . These were the most liberal cases that I can cite. The ex-Postmaster-General, however, declared that he intended to allow 750 calls annually as the maximum. One would have thought that such was a generous offer. Further, he proposed that only Jd. should be charged for each additional c all practically half as much as is charged in other countries. Under these circumstances, one would have imagined that our subscribers were going to secure a service at exceedingly low rates. But we all 'know the hue and .cry which was raised when he proposed the system under which a maximum of 750 calls annually was allowed, with Jd. charge for each additional call. I blame the Postmaster General for not exhibiting more courage upon that occasion, and for taking heed of the howl which was raised",19
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Wir e into him !,19
40,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I do not ""wire"" into anybody for the sake of achieving notoriety-for the purpose of getting a paragraph published in about every three inches of the daily newspapers. There is none of that sort of thing in my composition. Had the Postmaster-General stood firm at the time of which I speak-had he endeavoured to apply the toll system to the whole telephonic service-we should today have been in possession of a system which would not only be paying, but which would enable us to give a cheaper' service to all subscribers except those resident in the large centres of population, who have been thriving upon a socialistic institution by ' securing /[100 worth of service annually for a contribution of £9.",19
41,Mr JOSEPH ICOOK,Unknown,Is there any Socialism about that?,19
42,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is Socialism so far as the man on top is concerned) but when the man at the bottomendeavours to get a share he is repelled with all possible force.,19
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And yet the honourable member says that he desires an extension of that Socialism!,19
44,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I do not know what company the honourable member for Parramatta is now keeping-whethe r he is in company about which he did not care at one time, or whether he is in the company of those for whom his nature used to yearn.",19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I really do not know 1,19
46,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I do not think the honourable member does know. If the exPostmaster-General had had backbone enough to face the metropolitan press, merchants and others, arid see to the interests of the general public, we should now have had a system which would be a credit to Australia; and we should have been enabled to give four times the telephone facilities, that are now afforded in the country districts. Flat-rate subscribers pay only £ 8 a year, and have 2,000 free calls, each of"" which, of course,' means a message and a reply. Is that not a ridiculously cheap rate?",19
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I say that 2,000 calls for £ 8 per annum is not.a ridiculously low rate.",19
48,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I contend that it is a ridiculously low rate, as compared with the charges in other countries.",19
49,Mr STORRER,Unknown,We are not bound to follow the example of other parts of the world.,19
50,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Perhaps not, but we ought to see that there is equitable administration of the Department. If the large users of the telephone are afforded facilities at low rates, it follows that we cannot afford to give telephonic conveniences to the scattered population in distant parts of the Commonwealth at fair rates. It was sheer cowardice on the part of the exPostmaster-General to extend the number of calls from 750 per year to 1,000 each half year; indeed, I never dreamt that a gentleman of his characteristics would have backed down to such a degree. Until the charges are more equitably apportioned, we shall not achieve the object which the telephonic branch of the service ought to have in view; but it will be more difficult now to undo what the exPostmaster-General did, than it would have been to lay down a proper system at the outset.",19
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member's contention' might be met by charging £ 2 ios. per annum, or is . per week, instead of £ 5 per annum, and reducing the calls from 2,000 to 1,000.",20
52,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That would not meet the position, although that course might have been adopted at the initiation of the toll system.",20
53,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It would be an improvement.,20
54,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Possibly ; but it appears to me to be only an apology for a system. I hope the present Postmaster General will see his way to equalise matters by reducing the number of calls to say, 1,000 per annum, and charging Jd. for every additional call, without that sliding scale which was adopted at the instigation of the metropolitan press, and those merchants and others who so in fluenced his predecessor. There is no doubt that the present Postmaster-General could make a name for himself ' if he graspqd the nettle firmly, and adopted some such method as I have suggested, thereby releasing revenue for the purpose of affording telephonic facilities throughout the country. the only way now open to him to bring about that equality of administration which should have marked the initiation of the toll system. When I hear the ex-Postmaster General talking about his courage, and about what he has done, I feel reluctant to express my opinion in the words which occur to me. He showed himself to be most weak when he had the opportunity of his life-to inaugurate a new and equitable system which would have proved of great benefit to the people of the whole of Australia. Mr HENRY WILLIS . (Robertson) [3.8] - I notice that enormous expense is proposed for repairs, building, and so forth, in connection with a number of post offices. For instance, £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 is provided in the case of the General Post O ffice, Sydney.",20
55,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not object to that expenditure ?,20
56,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I do, indeed.",20
57,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The additions are absolutely necessary, owing to want of room in the offices.",20
58,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,I have heard that kind of talk before. During the last twelve years thousands of pounds have been spent on the Sydney Post Office.,20
59,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,And more will have to be spent if business goes-on expanding.,20
60,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,The reason for this continued expenditure is that provision is made only from day to day.,20
61,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member does not know what he is saying.,20
62,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is not talking like a Minister of the Crown, but like a nonentity. He has just assumed the position of Postmaster General, and yet he presumes to know something of the service. All the honourable member knows about is hat making; he knows absolutely nothing about - the Postal Department. If those in charge of this Department were business men, they would make provision for the future. There are three or four services which must expand with the population, and the Postal Department is one. Then, more money than is necessary is being spent in suburban places, where there is not likely to be any increase in population. The officers who make the suggestions are evidently influenced by some one against their own judgment.",20
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not think that the honourable member's remarks apply to That is the Sydney General Post Office. I have known for ' a considerable time that the arrangements there are not at all equal to the work which has to be done.,20
64,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The Treasurer is proving my case, namely, that the policy is only a hand-to-mouth policy, which provides only for the day, and not for the future.",20
65,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is evident we require a new Ministry.,20
66,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Not necessarily; the Ministry can to some extent be excused, because the responsibility has been taken out of their hands by the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner, who appoints responsible officers. On the advice of those officers the Minister reads and signs minutes, and that is about all he knows and does. The additions to the Sydney Post Office are of a florid character, with magnificent and artistic stonework. We should - have business accommodation rather than ornamentation; and the extensions ought to have been made long ago.. But to erect an ornamental building at enormous expense in an out of the way corner of the city",20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not say that the Sydney Post Office is in an out of the way corner of the city?,21
68,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"No ; but the . Sydney Post Office is all complete, and the structure now being erected is going skyward.",21
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member is really approving of what we aredoing.,21
70,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is what I meant by my interjection-that the honourable member was not acquainted with the facts.,21
71,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I have seen the plans in connection with the Sydney Post Office, just as I have seen the plans in connection with the Melbourne office, and I know pretty well what is going on. When a design has once been completed, we must not spend money on ornamentation. Suburban offices should be suitable for the service of the districts. In a place that is stagnant and not likely to move for many years, it is a waste of hard cash to erect elaborate buildings. At Bondi, for instance, it is proposed to spend £1,300, although that place is within two miles of a first-class post office. This is an insignificant place so far as business is - concerned; and, as I have indicated, most of the population are within a short distance of Randwick. At Katoomba it is proposed to spend £1,000 on a post office, although this place is practically forsaken ing all but about three months of the year. I find that it is proposed to expend £2,000 in erecting a post-office at Lithgow, a town that is absolutely dead. Its position today is exactly what it was about five years ago.",21
72,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The honourable memberis not correct in his statement of the facts.,21
73,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"But for the railway officials the town would be absolutely empty. When I referred to another item relating to a town in the mountains, the honourable member for the district objected so strongly that I thought it was well to mention this item, although I was not altogether in earnest in - my references to it. I wish now to say something about the telephone service. The ex-Postmaster-General has described that of New South Wales as being satisfactory. I contend that it is a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Any one who has travelled will admit that he has not met with a more inefficient or unsatisfactory - service. The ex-Postmaster-General said that he had been charged by the deputy leader of the Opposition with being a mere figure-head to that Department. It appears that the honourable member said nothing of the sort, but I have no hesitation in so describing the honourable gentleman. He took exception to strictures passed upon the administration of Departments by officers, but I should like to know whether we have not a right to refer to any case of inefficiency. The responsibility of Ministers has been transferred, to some extent, to the Public Service Commissioner, but, at the same time, we surely have a right to comment upon the inefficiency of any of the services, of the Commonwealth. Are we at all times to blame the Commissioner? I think not. The ex-Postmaster General should have made a minute recommending that a highly competent man of wide experience should be brought to Australia to reconstruct our telephonic and telegraphic services.",21
74,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Why bring in an outsider ?,21
75,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Because we need a man of experience, and to get one we must go to the United States of America. The telephone service of the Sandwich Islands is far ahead of that of New South Wales, arid, even some years ago, was in advance of It. When Mr. Sydney Smith took office as PostmasterdurGeneral, he suggested to his officers directions in which improvements might be made, but on every hand he was opposed by the electricians of the Department, and as soon as he retired they returned to their former inadequate system. The Minister who succeeded him adopted the system which they dictated, and it is for that reason that I assert that, whilst Postmaster General, the honourable member for Eden Monaro, was nothing but a figure-head. The telephone service is far behind the times. That of Adelaide is a tin-pot one. It is impossible to communicate with a subscriber there without giving his name to the officer at the exchange, and it is only a few months since the penny-in-the-slot system was introduced there. If we had an up-to-date officer it would not be long before we should have, in all probability, a system second to none. Some of our subscribers are provided with a maximum service at a minimum cost. The business of our exchanges is congested by a few people. Large business firms are constantly connected with the exchange, and for a very small payment are enjoying a service that is worth thousands of pounds. Compared with such subscribers, those who have telephones only in their own homes pay far more than they ought to do. This is a question, not of the large man being attacked by the small man, but of every subscriber being called upon to pay in proportion to the service rendered by the Department. We shaill not have a satisfactory system until we have at the head of the telephone service an officer capable of reorganizing it. Then again we find that the old practice of allowing persons to own their own telephones has not yet been abolished. Such subscribers enjoy an unlimited service at a peppercorn rental. The, system should have been abolished years ago, and, if necessary, in the interests of the general body of subscribers, these persons should be bought out. The ex-Postmaster-General has declared that the Opposition were always opposed to the toll system. I have 1 always been in favour of it, believing that a man .should pay in proportion to the service he receives. Under the flat system, that is not done. Even if it be true that the leader of the Opposition refused to introduce a certain deputation to the Minister, that is no evidence of his opposition to the request which the deputation had to make. It is a well understood rule that a member of Parliament shall introduce to a Minister any deputation from his district which asks him to do so. It does not necessarily follow that an honourable member, simply because he introduces a deputation to a Minister, approves of its object. I find that, according to a statement' made recently by the Postmaster General, the heads of his Department have gone back upon their reports as to the inefficiency of the service and the shortage - of officers.",21
76,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Who said that?-,22
77,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I understood the honourable member to say yesterday that Mr Arnold,, of the Sydney office, had stated that his former report was overdrawn.",22
78,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I did not say anything of the kind. I said that the later reports showed that' the previous ones, so far as the question of overtime wais concerned, were exaggerated.",22
79,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Her e we have an officer writing an exaggerated report to a Minister,22
80,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is not correct.,22
81,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,If an officer deceived the Ministerial head of his Department he should be suspended.,22
82,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,But did the officer in question admit that his report was exaggerated ?,22
83,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"No ; but we have a responsible Minister talking like a child. If the officer in question submitted an exaggerated report to the Minister he should have been suspended. He had before him books showing the extent of overtime worked by men in the service. All these facts go to show how incompetent the Postmaster-General is. If officers are at liberty to send in reports which are exaggerated, or, in other words, untrue, the service must be in a deplorable state. 1",22
84,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The reports in question were borne out by papers laid, two years ago, on the table of the Library.",22
85,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I do not think there can be any doubt as to the"" correctness of the reports. The speech made during the Budget debate by the honourable member for Gwydir should have been answered by the Minister. When an honourable metaber makes al straightforward statement in regard to the working of a Department, and in support of it quotes from the reports of responsible officers, the Ministerial head of that Department should either be prepared to make a satisfactory explanation or to resign. It seems that we have reached a stage in the history of the Commonwealth when Ministers may be permitted to make random statements and to draw salaries in respect* of offices which they are quite incapable of filling. Something has been said by the Postmaster General with regard to the unjust treatment of officers. This Parliament has never done any injustice to an officer of the Public Service. It is the Minister at the head of the Department in which such a complaint is raised who must accept the responsibility. The Ministerial head of a Department 'is expected to provide in-' creased assistance - for a growing service. The Public Service Commissioner cannot make more appointments unless the funds necessary for the payment of additional officers are provided. All these facts go toshow how incompetent are the men at the head of affairs to discharge the duties expected of them.",22
86,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [3.29] I trust that the Postmaster-General is taking a note of the criticism of his Department, for I can assure him that there is ar> - opportunity for him to effect great provements in it. I brought before the House the inequitable charges posed for the use of the telephone service in Adelaide and its suburbs. Places six miles from Adelaide have cheaper telephone service than more populous districts close to the city. Telephone subscribers in Norwood, Unley, and Kenttown, all thickly populated centres,' have to pay £ 3 more per annum subscribers in Glenelg, Port other districts further removed, where the population is not so dense, and, presumprovided ably, 'the cost of the service greater. There changes. - is no excuse for continuing these inequalities. ' I admit that the present system not the fault of this Ministry, but has grown up under a number of Governments. Still, although I called attention South Australian inequalities three months ago, and was told that steps were taken td remedy them, nothing has yet been done, and I see no proposal on the not Mr. Estimates for new exchanges.",22

Parliament would be quite prepared to vote whatever money is necesabroad sary for a proper telephone system. As matter of fact, it would not cost much remove the inequalities which have been complained of, and which should not be allowed to continue a day longer than necessary. The honourable member for has Yarra was taken to task for having referred imto the condition of things in New South Wales, but, under the circumstances, his imremarks were perfectly fair, and by no means parochial.

I admit that' we must always keep in view the utilitarian aspect of our buildings, but it is not desirable to deprive them of all adornment and artistic finish.",23
100,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Would the honourable member spend £40,000 to get £20,000 in worth of accommodation?",23
101,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Most of the ornate work on the Sydney General Post Office was carried out long before there was any But complaints have been general for a long time past .about the inadequate accommodation proimvided there. This has caused serious to those responsible for the despatch of business. The opinion has also got that for many years the persons a employed in that office have been continuto ously sweated, from the heads of departments right through the service, and I have every reason to believe that this opinion is is well founded. But I understand that it been determined to relieve the overwork of the officials there, giving them muchneeded assistance by increasing the staff. In.looking through the Estimates I have noticed that very large sums are set down for buildings in comparatively out of the way places - For instance, we are asked to vote £ 4 0 0 towards the cost of erecting a post .office at Bellingen. The total cost of the work is to be £ 9 0 0 , a very large sum to be spent on so small a place.",23
102,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Bellinge n is one of most flourishing towns on the northern rivers. - Mr JOHNSON - I do not object to necessary expenditure, but in connection with items such as that to which I am referring we should have full information as to the population to be served. Some justification for proposals of this kind should be put before us. If we are not properly informed in regard to them, I , for one, shall feel inclined to move reductions in many cases. A large sum is proposed for the erection of a post office at Coff's Harbour, a very small place. We should set our faces against lavish expenditure in out of the way places. Instead of erecting large and costly buildings such as are bigger than the actual or probable immediate requirements of districts demand, we should confine ourselves to providing what will meet the necessities of the situation. - In regulating this expenditure we could always have an eye to future development, and see that the designs are such as to per' mit of the extension of these buildings* in conformity with the ultimate plans. I notice, too, that £ 7 0 0 has been put upon the Estimates for the erection of a post office at Culcairn, £ 4 0 0 towards the erection of a similar office at Curlewis-the total cost of the building is to be £ 8 0 0 £ 7 5 0 for a post-office at Kyogle, £ 4 0 0 towards the erection of a post-office at Tingha, the total cost of which is to be £ 8 0 0 , - and £ 4 7 0 for a similar office at K u r ri Kurri .",24
103,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,The hombrabe member must not say anythinc in opposition to the K u r r i Kurri post-office.,24
104,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Doubtles s the honourable member will be able to give the Committee some information in regard to that undertaking. A sum of £ 7 4 9 has also been provided for the erection of a post office at Mullumbimby. I call attention to these items because of the extreme difficulty which I have experienced in securing the expenditure of small sums upon admittedly necessary postal works. As a matter of fact, I had to go through all sorts of formalities to get a coat of paint put upon a post-office in my own district. Before that work was actually undertaken an officer had to inspect the building, and to report upon it , which, of course, is proper - bu t the matter was then hung up for months. When I see large' sums provided upon the Estimates for the erection the of new buildings* I am impelled to ask why it is that such a marked disinclination is evinced to the expenditure of small sums upon necessary repairs. Another example of the extreme parsimony sometimes displayed was afforded by the refusal of the Department to purchase from a retiring postmaster a bath-heater which he had installed at his own expense w h e n j n charge of the office. Little acts of parsimony of that kind are irritating in themselves, and naturally provoke one to inquire why such penuriousness should be exhibited upon the one hand and such lavishness upon the other. Some time since complaints were made of the inadequacy of the livinrr accommodation provided at the St. Peter's post-office. I visited that office with a view to making a personal inspection. I found that a bedroom was provided which was barely large enough to permit of a single bedstead being erected, and that, to insure a supply of light and air it was necessary that the door communicating with another and by no means large room should be kept open. Mn. SALMON - Is that a Government building ?",24
105,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Yes .,24
106,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Was it built by the Public Works Department of New South Wales? Mr JOHNSON!-Yes . At the present time the officer in charge of that post office is a married man with a family. No proper provision has been made for housing the members of his family, and no disposition has been exhibited by the Government to improve the living accommodation. A little time ago the authorities did build outside the house a small weatherboard shed intended to serve the purpose of a bedroom, but it was a mere shed, and unfit for such a use. I mention these matters merely with a' view .to show the parsimony which is exhibited in some cases as compared with the extravagance which is shown in others. I hope that the Postmaster-General will order an officer to make an inspection of the St. Peter's post-office with a view to providing increased accommodation for the postmaster and his family.",24
107,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Does the Department compel the postmaster to live there?,25
108,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I think so.,25
109,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have already written a minute stating that where the Department compels officers to live upon the premises and charges them rental, it must do what any ordinary landlord would do, namely, keep those premises in a proper state of repair. '",25
110,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"In this instance, it is not only a question of keepirg the premises in a proper state of repair, but one of providing sufficient breathing space to enable the postmaster and his family to live under healthy conditions. One of the bedrooms - so far as accommodation is concernedis little better than a wardrobe or linen closet.",25
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Are not these matters really too small to be brought forward here?,25
112,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Unfortunatel y there is no other way in which I can insure that attention will be paid to them. It is idle to make representations to the Department.' Any officer who could reportthat the room to which I have just referred Ay as a fit place for a perso'i to sleep in must be ignorant of the first principles of hygiene. I come now to the question of telephone exchanges - While the honourable member for Parramatta was'speaking last night, the ex-Postmaster-General interjected that any two individuals can secure the establishment of a telephone exchange at any place if they choose,.",25
113,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I was referring to the small telephone exchanges. Under the old regulations it 'was necessary that fifteen subscribers should join together in country districts before an exchange could be established; but under the new regulations only two persons are required to so join together.,25
114,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"At the request of the Municipal Council of Rockdale, I applied to the Department to establish an exchange there. Rockdale is really the centre of the State electorate represented by the New South Wales Premier, Mr. Carruthers - , punt",25
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,How far is the centre of Rockdale from a telephone exchange ?,25
116,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"^I am aware that it is within three miles. I understand the reason why an exchange has not been established there is that a regulation, existswhich prohibits the establishment of an exchange within three miles of another exchange.",25
117,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Surely Ave do do not want exchanges established at every three miles.,25
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member must think that we have an awful lot of time upon hand.,25
119,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Acting Prime Minister will not induce me to. shorten my speech by interjections of that sort. I ami not going to be bullied by him. I repeat that the establishment of a telephone exchange ought not to be the subject of a hard and fast regulation. Notwithstanding. that an exchange may exist within three miles of any centre, I say that the population of that centre may justify the erection of another exchange. The present arbitrary regulation, if continued, will be provocative of a great deal of trouble in the future. I was under the impression that the object of the Department was to popularize the telephone, but that result is not likely to be achieved if obstacles are placed in the way of residents in populous centres securing the establishment of .local exchanges.",25
120,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,The Department is losing money every day.,25
121,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I think, that it is. Certainly its policy is in opposition to a l t . recognised commercial principles. I mayadd that I have unsuccessfully attempted to procure the establishment of a telephone bureau at Como, which is a favourite resort of week-end holiday makers, and of picnickers generally. At present it_ is impossible to transmit a telephone message from that place to Sydney, which is only 13 miles distant. The railway authorities of New South Wales have offered to provide the necessary accommodation for - a telephone bureau at the Como railway station. Then there is another busy centre upon George's River, between Tom Ugly's Point and Sylvania. An immense traffic passes over this particular spot every day in the year-indeed , at week-ends the traffic becomes so congested that persons frequently have to wait an hour for the to take them across to the other sideBut, although there is a post-office at Sylvania, it is impossible to get a telephone installed there, notwithstanding that the place is visited by tens of thousands of persons every year; I am informed that the cause of the delay is the scarcity of instruments; but, although that excuse might be reasonable in the ginning, it cannot last for ever. the heads of the Department know that - the telephone is likely to come into general use in the near future, they should adopt reply from it the ordinary commercial principle of providing for any increase of business, and so 194 days. provide the facilities so often promised by the ex-Postmaster-General. blame the ex-Postmaster-General so much, because, while he was in charge of the partment, he made great strides in the rection of reform. There is, however, too much of a tendency to allow officers to 'run the Department, owing to the. fact, I suppose, that Ministers do not take the trouble to inform themselves. Ministers are very prone to rely too on reports from their officers, although I have known some cases in which such ports have been absolutely unreliable, even to the extent of misstatements of fact. example, in reference to Miranda, where - telephonic facilities were required, the ports of the inspecting officers were of - a dolorific nature that the Minister regarded himself as taking tremendous risks when he finally met the wishes of the residents.",25
122,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable place. member will give me the credit that I promised, if he gave me his assurance as to member serious? the necessity for the telephone facilities, I would provide them.",26
123,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is so, but he has not always acted up to those promises. In the Miranda case I got the telephone cause I was prepared to back my opinion against the official's report by a personal guarantee to make up any financial loss on the line. As a matter of .fact, the turns from the telephone at this place - eminently satisfactory from every point view. I mention this fact only to show that it is not advisable for Ministers to rely too much on the reports of officers; but that, where an honourable member reasonable grounds for telephone extension, the Minister should' weigh those grounds and form an independent judgment, and, when possible, pay a visit to The Progress Association of San Souci - and Sandringham sent a request to the money is for. the Minister for improved postal and telegraphic facilities several weeks but up to the present no definite reply has been received.

130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Is the honourable ago, member an architect as well as a doctor?",26
131,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"No . but I profess to day have a certain modicum of common sense; and I am entitled to express an opinion the inon a matter common to any man of ordinary observation. If the Treasurer would only explain his Estimates and other proposals in a proper way, a good deal of speech-making and inquiry would be saved. I do not take exception to the amount proposed to be expended, because, after all, it is most necessary that our post-offices should be made convenient. I do take exception, however, to the elaborate struc: tures which are provided in many of the country districts, where money, which ought to be devoted to providing facilities for the people, is spent in outside ornamentation. For example, at a place called K u r ri K u r ri we find that the postmaster, with his family of four or five, has two small rooms in which to live. I do not think that the Department does justice to country districts. In various outlying places, where the important industry of dairyfarming is chiefly carried on, there are no telephonic facilities, and I may say, in illustration, that time after time a request has been made in vain for such facilities at Underbank and another similar place. It - would appear that the inspectors, who have to cover enormous stretches of country, areoverworked, and that this fact supplies the reason for the delay. If money has to be spent, I thirik the number of inspectors might be increased. The ex-Postmaster General told me that he quite recognised that the Department was suffering a loss owing to some leakage, which he proposed to stop; but, unfortunately, the honourable gentleman has moved up a step, and his successor, the present Postmaster-General, is so busy with protectionist propaganda, that he really has no time to devote to the work of his office. I do not think that the present Postmaster-General is likely to follow the advanced policy of his predecessor, so ' long as he bestows-so much of his time on furthering the protectionist movement.",26

142,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I wish now to allude to the private telephones attached to hotels.

Reference has been made to several other items relating to the Postmaster General's Department, and I wish to place before honourable members the information I have in regard to them. In the first place, a contract for the erection of the Alstonville Post Office is in progress, and provision is made on the Estimates for carrying out the work.

As to the item of £400 towards the cost of the Bellingen Post Office. I may say that The total cost is exj^ected to be £900. The revenue of the post-office is nearly £2,000. I have visited Bellingen on many occasions, and know that it is situated in one of the richest parts of the north coast country. population is rapidlv increasing. railway line which is now being constructed from Newcastle to Grafton will traverse part of the district, and cause it to be still more productive and valuable. The lease of the present premises expires on 30th June, 1908, and in order to provide for increased postal business, the inspector for the district recommended the acquisition of a portion of the police reserve site in the main street, and the erec- estimated at £900. tion thereon of a building for postal purposes, at a cost, as I have said, of /[ooo. This recommendation was concurred in by the Postmaster-General on 2nd May, 1907. The population of Bondi, where it is proposed to erect a post-office at a cost of £1,300, is 3,000. The site is Commonwealth property. The premises in which business is at pre *"" 1 being transacted are leased at a rental of £ 2 8 5s. per annum. There is no residence attached to the present building, and it is proposed to erect a new brick building to afford adequate accommodation for the public and officials. The total cost of the Canbelego Post Office will be £800. The town has a population of 600. The revenue is £892. The postal business at this place is at present conducted by a non-official postmaster, in premises which are represented to be inconvenient,, and it is recommended that a building be erected on a site previously reserved for postal purposes by the State Government. The estimated cost of the Coffs Harbor post-office is £900. The present rented premises are inadequate, and inconveniently situated, and are leased for a rental of £ 3 3 a year. The proposed site of the new building is the property of the Government of New South Wales. The new Culcairn post office will cost £700, and is about the only new building to be erected in my electorate. For some time past private persons, one on each side of the railway, have wanted the building to be placed on their property, but it was discovered about six months ago that there .is a police reserve almost adjoining the line, and the Commonwealth has arranged to buy part of it for about £ 2 5 , and the post-office will be placed on that land.",29

I feel positive that there are many contract offices in Victoria whose revenue is greater build a post-office there. than that of districts elsewhere in which official post-offices have been erected. have always done my best to bring about the substitution of official for contract offices, but in some cases the Department has gone to the othet extreme by erecting buildings much more costly and elaborate than are required.

184,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [4.41]--The reexperience under State administration was that, if one centre got a good post-office, adjoining centres wanted equally large that buildings, whether the volume of work was large or small. Under Commonwealth administration, however, since works have now to be constructed out of revenue, and not out of loan moneys, an attempt has had to be made to make new buildings conform, as nearly as possible, to the requirements of the districts in which they are",30
185,Mr EWING,Unknown,There has been a minimum,30
186,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,There is no fixed rule.,30
187,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Every rule has its ex T ception, and I know of instances in which post-offices in rapidly-growing places have been made larger than would meet immediate requirements, those who have had of these matters having had the foresight to see that larger accommodation would be necessary in the future.",30
188,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,I have to complain of exwant of foresight in such circumstances.,30
189,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Eve n professional men occasionally make errors.. When a district ' has a postal revenue of £300 or £400, we need not be afraid of spending £900 to The Commonwealth could hardly rent a suitable buildI ing for less than £ 1 a week, which, at the rate at which we could borrow money, postwould be more than the interest on the sum I have named. Moreover, we must feel confident in the prosperity of Australia, and it is easily seen that the acquirement of property by the Commonwealth at reasonin able rates will be to (he advantage of the public. I am with those who think that the fullest information should be given in regard to proposals for expenditure, and a have advocated what is the rule in some that of the State Parliaments, that a column be should be provided in the Estimates for the figures showing the total sum to be expended on any new work, as well as the amount required for the year.",30
190,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,That information is given here by means of foot-notes.,31
191,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It would stand out much more prominently if given in a separate column, and estimates and expenditure could then be easily checked from year to year. I think that this would be an advantageous alteration to make in connection with the compilation of our Estimates.",31
192,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [4.45] - This debate must have convinced the Postmaster General that a. good deal of dissatisfaction exists in regard to the management of the Department over which he presides. think that the dilatoriness is due not so much to any want of attention on the part of its officers as to the fact that those officers have been, and still are, very much overworked. To dwell upon this aspect of the matter can serve no useful purpose, because I believe that the Postmaster-General himself recognises the existence of the evil to which I refer, and intends to do what he can to remedy it. The grievances which have been ventilated this afternoon in regard to the telephone department arise from a similar cause. They are not so much to any want of appreciation by the Department of the necessities of the various districts as to bungling in the ordering of supplies. I should not have risen if it had not been for certain remarks made by honourable members upon this side of the Chamber. It seems to me that the honourable member for Lang displayed a lack of knowledge when he questioned items of expenditure in connection with post-offices at Bellingen, and Coffs Harbor. Bellingen, I may inform the' Committee, is the centre of the rapidly growing northern rivers district of New South Wales. Coffs Harbor is a similar centre, and in these centres a marvellous growth of population has taken place during the past five owing to the development of the dairying industry. We all know that immense coal fields have been opened up at Kurri Kurri , as the result of which a township has been formed within the. past three years. My surprise is that a post-office has not been erected there before. progress of that centre reminds me of the rapid growth of a place in my own electorate. I refer to Wolgan-wher e the population has incronsed during the past eighteen months by perhaps 1,500, and where great difficulty was experienced in inducing the authorities to establish a post office. It was only when the matter became almost a scandal that they consented to the establishment of an office there. It seems to me that K u r r i K u r r i occupies a somewhat similar position. The honourable member for Robertson has questioned the propriety of the erection of new offices at Lithgow and Katoomba. Everybody throughout the Commonwealth has rejoiced over the establishment of iron works at Lithgow. We all recognise that in consequence of the rapid increase in the output of coal, Lithgow has progressed by I leaps and bounds. Its population is increasing at the rate of about 1,000 a year. The small building which does duty for a post-office in the township is absolutely unsuited to the purpose for which it is being used. The Acting Prime Minister has quoted figures relating to the revenue derived by that office. I have some statistics showing its total receipts-which , of course, is a somewhat different matter from revenue-for six months. These figures show that during the first half of the present year the Lithgow post-office received £ 8 5 0 for Excise stamps, due £ 2 , 5 2 9 for postage stamps, or a total'of ^3)379» which is equivalent to £ 6 , 7 5 8 per annum.",31
193,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Thos e are not the figures which were quoted by the Acting Prime Minister.,31
194,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"No . I have already said that these figures represent the gross receipts of the office in question.  K u r r i Kurri , nue derived from?",31
195,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Fro m the sale of duty stamps for beer.  revenue.,31
196,Mr BOWDE N,Unknown,Three-fourths of it has to be returned to the State.,31
197,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It is not calyears, culated as postal revenue.",31
198,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"During the same half year £ 5 , 8 2 1 worth of postal notes were disposed of. Of course, the revenue derived from the sale of these notes would be based upon the poundage rate. The The post-office at Lithgow also derived a revenue of £ 2 5 5 from money orders last year, and that amount will be considerably increased during the current year. Between June and December, 1905, the total amount received from the sale of stamps was £ 0 6 7 , . - which is equivalent to about £ 1 , 9 0 0 annually, showing 'an increase in eighteen months at the rate of approximately £ 3 , 1 5 8 per annum on the sale of postage stamps alone. It will be seen, therefore, that the revenue is increasing by leaps and bounds. The tofwn is provided with an all-night telephone service, and the whole of the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic work has to be carried out in an office which is not large enough to permit of the swinging of the proverbial cat. The telephone cannot be used with any degree of privacy. - cannot write out an application for a money order without other persons in the office being in a, position to read what one is doing. I understand that some temporary repairs are being effected with a view to improve the existing conditions, but it will be utterly impossible to continue the work which has to be done there in the present office. ' Moreover, the population! of Lithgow is spreading towards - Eskbank, and the post-office is situated on - the western boundary of the town. inspector who has reported upon the matter has, I understand, advised the removal of the office towards Eskbank, so as to make it central for both places. wise, a new post-office will need to be erected at Eskbank. At Lithgow, the accommodation supplied to the postmaster and his family is utterly inadequate, and from every stand-point the building is out of date. The necessities of the township demand the erection of a new building. The honourable member for Robertson questioned the need for erecting a post-office at Katoomba, and the Acting Prime Minister said that the population of that centre was 2,500. But I desire honourable members to recollect that those figures represent only the resident population. toomba is the centre of a mountain district, and in the summer time instead of possessing a population of 2,500 has a population of nearly 10,000. post-office there is a building for which we pay £ 1 0 6 annually as rental. seems to me that we can do very much better than that by erecting a building of our own.  ging "" these items ? The Committee will pass them.",31
199,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I am merely replying to the' criticism of the honourable member for Robertson. At Katoomba the parcels post is a stupendous thing to handle, and the Department have found it necessary to erect a building which will provide accommodation for mail carts for parcel delivery instead of hiring vehicles to perform this service, as is, I understand, done at the present time. All the facts show how necessary these buildings are; and I am sure that if the honourable member for Robertson were acquainted with the facts he would be the last to question the propriety of the expenditure.  One been making an analysis of the figures before us; and it is just as well to inform honourable members that, while we are providing for an immediate expenditure of £ 4 5 , 2 0 0, we are in reality committing ourselves to a total expenditure of £ 1 1 5 , 6 0 0 . I am not objecting to the amount, but I urge that the full extent to which we commit ourselves should have been placed before us. For instance, I find that it is proposed to spend £ 7 J 3 IO in the purchase of sites, while, as a matter of fact, we do not The know where the sites' are or anything about them. I quite agree with honourable members who have said that figures should have been supplied, so that we might know Other- exactly what we are voting.",32
200,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,It would be hardly advisable to publish the figures in cases where the Department is negotiating.,32
201,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"But we should know the population of the various districts, and the revenue from the offices.  test that we should have been supplied with more information. Last night the Acting Prime Minister read out a number of figures relating to the expenditure on rifle ranges; and it would have required Ka- only another column in the Estimates, and a little more attention to detail, to supply all the information necessary to a more intelligent vote than we shall be able to Yet the give under present circumstances. If the figures were placed before us more conIt cisely, we should clearly know our position ; and it would not be incumbent upon honourable members to investigate for themselves.",32
202,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [5.4] - I desire to draw attention to the fact that for the provision of telephone exchanges in fifteen large and important municipalities in and around Sydney a sum of £ 4 , 0 0 0 appears in these Estimates; Amongst those municipalities is Balmain, a portion of my electorate; and it will be observed that while £4,000 is deemed sufficient for all these populous centres, a sum of £1,500, involving an ultimate expenditure of £2,560, is proposed for the Redfern exchange, which is in the electorate of the leader of the Labour Party.",32
203,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member surely does not pretend that Balmain is as important a centre as is Redfern?,33
204,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Balmai n is not so important, I admit, to the Ministry. It would appear that I should come provided with a pistol and bowie knife to fight my way through the storm of interjections which always arise when I address honourable members.",33
205,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Redfern people are a deserving class.,33
206,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They are not more deserving than the people of Balmain, but the honourable member is a deserving supporter of the Government. The sum of £4,000 represents about £260 for each of the fifteen municipalities, and, of course, if that-be proved sufficient to provide an effective exchange, I have no more to say. It seems striking, however, that so ardent and straight-out a supporter of the Government as the leader of the Labour Party should have the satisfaction of seeing such a comparatively large sum - devoted to a portion of his constituency. I point out that torate. there are over 30,000 inhabitants in Balmain, who are certainly deserving of some consideration in the way of telephonic facilities. Then, amongst the municipalities, there is Annandale, which, in addition to containing many large works, is a large residential quarter. If it is the policy of the Government to erect telephone exchanges in all large centres, I point out that Annandale has not yet an exchange, though the population there must be about 20,000. I am pleased to see that some attempt to provide an exchange for Balmain is being made, because such an exchange will serve, not only Balmain itself, but a large urban district behind. Then, again, there is Ashfield, which is a "" swell "" quarter, for which we are asked to vote £600 now, with the ultimate intention of spending £1,100 on an exchange. I suppose this is the tribute paid by the Government to my esteemed friend the honourable member for Parkes, although that gentleman is opposed to the present Ministry. It would appear that the leader of the Labour Party and the honourable member for Parkes are bosom friends, see-ing that they are the only two representatives who have secured a satisfactory expenditure on telephone exchanges in their district. On the one hand we have theleader of the Labour Party, and on the other hand the honourable member for Parkes, who is the leader of an inimitableparty of one, though I admit that that party is a very solid one. The electoratesof these two honourable members share between them £3,600 of the money proposed! for the provision of telephone exchanges,; while, as I have already pointed out, fifteen other large municipalities have to be content with £4,000 amongst them. I would be the last to complain, but I must ask if honourable members regard this asfair treatment! I should like some explanation of these items, though I know that the Treasurer is very much worried* having to answer, not only for his own Ministerial sins, but for the sins of his colleagues. Is the sum of £1,500 proposedfor Redfern a kind of return to a Government supporter, while my electorate is; ignored because I am a bitter opponent of the Government? I wonder what the honourable member for Yarra would say if hiselectorate were treated like Balmain?",33
207,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A large sum is proposedunder this head for Hawthorn, while there is no proposal in reference to my elec",33
208,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Anyhow , we can-imaginehow Victorian representatives would howl if their electorates were treated as mine is upon these Estimates. This is a serious matter, and I am Sure that my electorswill not be pleased with the treatment they have received. Why do the Government frame their Estimates on party lines? 1 Even if I . were their bitterest opponent',, they should not have regard to that fact in determining what public buildingsshould be erected in my constituency. I think that I have made out a strong case. You, Mr Chairman, are aware of theextent of the business carried on in Annandale, and I am sure that you will support my contention. I trust that the Treasurer will explain how it is that the electorateof South Sydney has been so generously treated. I do not wish to suggest thati where an expenditure of £4,000 would be sufficient to meet the requirements of a district, £5,000 should be expended; but it seems to me that the Department is either too extravagant in the one case to which I have referred or too miserly in the otheri",33
209,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [5.17] - I should like to introduce into the discussion a serious and relevant note. I have no - desire to scramble for disbursements. - do not say that since £2,000 is to be expended on public buildings in one electo.rate, £2,000 or more should be expended in mine; but I regret that the Government '.have made no provision for the extension of the main trunk telephone line. from - Sydney to Orange. At the present time - the line goes as far as Blayney, and - Orange is connected with that town by means of the condenser system. Orange is the centre of the western district, ;So far as general industrial, agricultural, and pastoral enterprises concerned, and I hope that, as an act of simple justice, the Government will make provision in the Supplementary ' Estimates for the extension I have advocated. The proposition is a business one. The telephonic communication between Orange, and Sydney is unsatisfactory, by reason of the adoption of the condenser system between the points I have mentioned, and I am satisfied that the extension of the main trunk line from Blayney to Orange, a distance - of between thirty and forty miles, would prove a payable enterprise. Another point which I desire to make is that the Department makes no provision for post-office clocks. Since the Postal Department exacts from the public the observation of time limits, in connection with mails, it ought to provide official time in all country towns. In many post-offices in my electorate the clocks are often much agley, and I am told that the Department makes no provision for the supply of suitable ones.",34
210,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It would cost. thousands of pounds to provide them, and it is impossible to do so. Sir WILLIAM L.YNE -*-The States used to provide them.",34

212,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [5.21] - I trust that the Minister will supply the Committee with some information regarding the contract for the extension of the General Post Office, Melbourne. . I find that this sub-division makes provision for an expenditure of £19,000 on that work, I and I am given to understand that the contract now in progress provides only for a one-story addition in the northern end of the building. In other words, the new building will be only one-story high, and after the walls have been carried about 5 feet above the first cornice, they will be topped by a permanent roof.",34
213,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,That would be a rubbishy addition.,34
214,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It will result in an absolute waste of money. The woikshquld not have been commenced if the Governare ment were not prepared to make the additions correspond in height with the main building. At present there is such a lack of room at the General Post Office that Wallach's buildings, in Elizabeth-streei, have had to be rented for postal purposes. A sum of £40,000 is to be expended on alterations to the General Post Office, Sydney, and I fail to see why the additions to the Melbourne office should not be carried to the-height of the present structure. If a - permanent roof be' placed on the one-story addition, an absolute waste of money will take place, because, sooner or later, it will be found necessary to carry up the additions to the height of the main building. I hope that the Government will look into this matter, and, if necessary, provide on the Supplementary Estimates the amount necessary to complete the work in the way I have indicated. The expenditure, like that on the alterations to the Sydney General Post Office, could be spread over a number of years. I notice that it is proposed to expend £4,000 on a post-office at Hawthorn. I have not a word to say against the item, but I think that we should have some information as to the revenue derived from the local post office at the present time.",34
215,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The receipts from the post-office and telephone exchange are over £1.0,006 per annum.",34
216,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member includes in that total all the receipts from the telephone service, I would re_ mind him that at the present time subscribers to the telephone service in my electorate have to pay £ 3 or £ 4 per annum in .excess of the amount which should be exacted from them, simply because they have to be connected with the Hawthorn exchange. , Before the Postmaster-General took office, he drew attention to the unsatisfactory position in regard to contract offices, and I hope that he will be as zealous in his efforts to prevent abuses in connection with the system as he was before he joined the Ministry. I have here a return: presented to the order of the House nearly two years ago, which shows that some of the contract post-offices have a revenue of from £1,500 to nearly £2,000 per annum.",34

221,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That would be impossible.,35

I ' hope that the present Postmaster-General put a check on the contract post-office system. If it grows as it has done, we reasonably expect to find the General Post Offices of the capitals ultimately converted into contract offices. There is a considerable number of contract in my electorate. The rule of the Department is that when the revenue of an office reaches £ 4 0 0 per annum, it may be In some cases postal business is transacted in the offices of railway stationmasters, an unsatisfacPost tory arrangement, though one which is by unavoidable in certain places. But I know of an instance in which the business of such an office was transferred to a conoffice, the contractor binding himself, in consideration of a three years' lease, to put up a building, and to find a telegraph he messenger. Although the revenue of that office is £ 3 5 4 , which is not far short of £ 4 0 0 , the Department would not depart from its rule, and make the office an offiBy keeping so many contract offices, we are preventing our officials from rising in the service as rapidly as they might reasonably expect to do. I trust that the Postmaster-General will obtain a grip of this matter. In some places the contractors have to find the necessary building, provide' the telegraph operators and telegraph messengers-in short, to run the whole concern. I hold that iT a district is likely to grow the Department should provide its own officer. In my own electorate the system to which I refer has been abused, and I protest against it. In my opinion, a sufficient sum has not been provided uoon these Estimates for the payment of these - officials. The Department is acting, in a niggardly fashion, and is really sweating these persons in that they are not fairly remunerated for their services.",36
243,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dallev) [5.48] - The object of dealing with Estimates, I understand, is to insure that no Ministerial > head of a department shall indulge.in extravagance-in short', to secure economical administration. The honourable member for Lang has moved the reduction of this item by £1,000, and the honourable member for Yarra. has pointed out that the money which we are asked to vote is required to enable a permanent roof to be placed upon an unfinished building.",37

245,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Certainly . Mr Mauger.'-In reply to marks of the honourable member for Yarra, I djesire tp say that I have made inquiries, and I find that the present extension of the Gerieral Post Office, Melbourne, provides for' one story with a temporary roof.

Mr Wilks - I would point out that when the honourable member for Dalley was speaking on behalf of his own electorate no such courtesy as has been extended to. the honourable member for Melbourne was extended to him.

255,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [5-57]- There are one or two items connected with the proposed expenditure in Queensland to which I desire to direct attention. I am pleased to note that the Department intends to make some provision for alterations to the General Post Office, Brisbane. These alterations are sadly needed. But I would point out to the Postmaster-General that Queensland is comparatively a new country, and that the rural districts are in need of postal facilities. It seems to me that these have been somewhat overlooked.",38
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member desire any information upon this item?,38
257,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I do not. I merely wish to give the Postmaster-General a hint or two. I have no doubt that portion of the proposed expenditure of £1,633 upon various offices is intended to improve the Beaudesert post-office. ' I desire to point out that Beaudesert is the centre of a very large farming district, which is being thickly settled. Several large estates in that locality have recently been subdivided for purposes of closer settlement, and I am hopeful that others will be similarly treated. Various mail routes radiate from this centre, and consequently it would be a mistake for the Postal Department to "" patch "" up the old building, which is certainly too small for the requirements of Beaudesert. I would, therefore, urge upon the Government the necessity for erecting a new post-office there. I ask the Postmaster-General not ti., be quite so parsimonious in regard to outside post-offices. We have heard.a ffood deal in reference to ""contract or semi-official post-offices, which are really indispensable in country districts. Many of these small offices are conducted by people merely for - the benefit of the locality in which they reside ; and I should be sorry to see them abolished, unless it be in centres large enough to support official offices. I am pleased to note that Gatton is to have a new post-office; and this brings me to the question of the post-offices conducted under the auspices of the Commissioners of Railways. Very often, the dual position of the railway officials in this connection, leads to some inconvenience to the public; and there is another objection which appeals to me as requiring some little consideration on the part of the Minister. Those railway officials, who conduct postal business, are not really in the employ of the Postmaster-General, but they should, I think, be paid directly by him, and, to some extent, be brought under the control of the Department.",38
258,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The States Governments would not allow that; they insist on receiving a lump sum for the services rendered.,38
259,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I understand that the Postal Department pays a lump sum to the Railway Departments; but the officials who conduct some of the small country post-offices in connection with the railways,' seem to have an idea that they are not paid for the services they render. I ' k m sorry to have to refer to this matter, because remarks made here may be taken as a reflection on States Departments with which we have nothing to do. However, I know' from personal experience, that those rail-r way officials, who are employed on postal business, are of. opinion, in some instances, that they are not paid by the Common-; wealth Government for the services , they render. There is another matter which might have the attention of the Postmaster General, namely, the guarantees given by local residents in connection with telephone exchanges. I know of one case in my electorate, wh>re the revenue from a guaranteed exchange exceeded in one month the estimated revenue for twelve months; and the guarantors find that the money they deposited is tied up for seven years. Under the circumstances, I think that the guarantee ought to be refunded. Another matter. I should like to refer to is that of the lighting of country post-offices. These may be matters which could be discussed with the Deputy Postmasters-General, but there appears to be a general instruction that the expenses are to be kept down to the lowest possible limit. On one occasion, I asked to have a post-office lighted so that the holders of private boxes might be enabled to see to open their boxes, and to decipher the addresses on their letters ; but the request was refused on the ground that an hotel would shortly be opened opposite to the post-office, and that the light from the hotel ought to be sufficient.",38
260,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Lang) fo-7]---There are two or three items on which I should like a little information. I notice that a sum of £365 is provided for the Dalby post-office.,38
261,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Has the honourable member been at Dalby during the last five years ? During that time, the town has grown immensely, owing to' the cutting up of big est&>t€s",39
262,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"When I visited Dalby, some six or seven years ago, there did not seem to be any .great necessity for an expenditure of the kind proposed.",39
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The population of Dalby and district is 17,000.",39
264,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not know what che population was when I visited the place, but the post-office at that time seemed adequate for all the requirements of a small township.",39
265,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The big estates are being cut up, and a branch railway is about to be constructed.",39
266,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That being so, the amount proposed is, perhaps, a reasonable one to spend. I see also that there is £ 1 , 5 0 0 provided for additions to the Toowoomba post-office.",39
267,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That office has been built over twenty years, and has not been extended since. The population of Toowoomba is 17,200, and the town is the second biggest, distributing centre in Queensland.",39
268,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If the expenditure is necessary on account, of the increase of business, I have ho more to say.",39
269,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The increased business was represented last year by £ 3 , 0 0 0 - that was in one year.",39
270,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Then there is probably some justification for the expenditure. The large amount of £ 1 , 5 6 5 is provided for the Cloncurry post-office. I do not know whether this town also is' advancing by leaps and bounds.",39
271,Mr GROOM,Unknown,A railway line will be constructed in a few months.,39
272,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Referenc e has already been made to the Roma post-office, for which £ 1 , 5 0 0 is provided, with a total contemplated expenditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0. Roma is right away in the. heart of the desert.",39

276,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"At any rate, the railway journey gives one the impression that the distance is very great. When I visited the town it did not appear to me to be one in which an expe'nditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 on a post-office would be justified.

317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is certainly a most central agricultural town.,41
318,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Quite so., When the present office was erected, no-one imagined that the town would progress as it has done. It is in the heart of the agricultural belt of Western Australia. There are some very fine flour mills in the town, and' since private* individuals and companies have not been afraid to invest money in the erection of substantial hotels and banking institutions there, the Commonwealth should not hesitate to erect a building necessary to meet the requirements of the district. The criti- cism of the honourable member for Boothby cannot count for much, since he was not even aware that there is no refreshmentroom at the local railway station.

351,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,How many officers are located there?,43
352,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I cannot tell the honourable member. There is no doubt that Northam is an exceedinglv progressive town, and that the proposed expenditure will be considerably reduced by the sale of the present office, which is suitable for some purposes, though altogether unsuitable for postal purposes.",43
353,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Therefore , we do not need to vote the extra £ 1 , 0 0 0 ?",43
354,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I can assure my honourable friend that the departmental officers have made a careful calculation, and I find that their estimates are usually pretty near the mark. If we do not need the extra £ 1 , 0 0 0 it will not be expended.",43

I intend to act in a truly Federal spirit-in the spirit indicated by the soft, smooth, honeyed, suave words of the honourable member for Coolgardie. For some time, I confess that I experienced a difficulty in recognising that I voted honourable member as the honourable member who spoke the other evening in regard to my own State.",43
358,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member always says a nice thing, and then proceeds to destroy it .",43
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am not quite certain that the honourable member .for Coolgardie is the same honourable member who spoke here the other evening. He has an entirely different coat on to-night.,43
360,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I have only one suit.,43
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is another reason why we should act liberally towards the honourable member. I sympathized with him this evening when he was referring to the movement towards secession which he declares to be abroad in his own State. He said that unquestionably that feeling would have to be reckoned with. What a difference there is between the tone adopted by the honourable member towards his own State and that which is adopted by a great many of his colleagues towards their own States !,43
362,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Wester n Australia has grievances, and other States have not. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I commend the example of the honourable member toa great number of those who are sitting around him, and who, instead of endeavouring to smooth down the .antagonistic - feeling manifested in their States, are constantly endeavouring to inflame that feeling for purely party purposes. The dis-. tii ction between the conduct of the honourable member, and that of a great manyof his colleagues in this connection is most marked, and I commend his example to his leader, amongst others, who is never tired of tilting at his own State.",43
363,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order . I cannot allow the honourable member to enter upon a discussion of States rights.,44
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not intend to do so. I am, however, entitled to point to the difference between the tone adopted by the honourable member for Coolgardie in advocating the claims of his own State, and that which is adopted by other honourable members of this Committee. When I heard the honourable member talking in the way that he did of the feeling in Western Australia, I could not help admiring him for his patriotism and loyalty to that State, notwithstanding the view which he entertains regarding the merits of the question. I wish that we had more like him in this Chamber. I have yet to learn that to be a Federalist, it is necessary for an honourable member to be constantly tilting at his own State. even the conduct of the honourable member himself is not uniform",44
365,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the item under consideration?,44
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . endeavouring to urge reasons why this item should be agreed to. The honourable member for Coolgardie has made an appeal which merits our consideration. He has appealed to us to agree to the item as a sort of salve to the feelings of the people of the State which he represents. I wish to contrast his action to-night with his action upon another occasion, when the interests of the State of New South Wales were involved. Upon the latter occasion, he declared that he would do nothing for .New South Wales, and he even went to the length of saying that he would vote against the Capital Site because he would not heed the violent incendiary there.",44
367,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I must point out to the honourable member that if I allow him to continue in that strain, I cannot prevent other honourable members from f o l lowing his example.",44
368,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I voted for Lyndhurst.,44
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Since I am not permitted to read what the honourable member did say upon the occasion to which I refer, I cannot do him justice. However, his speech is recorded in Hansard, andhonorable members can turn it up - for themselves. When the honourable member spoke this evening, I could not help looking at him, with a view to ascertain whether he had the same coat on which he was wearing the other evening. But upon the present occasion I intend to "" turn the other cheek"" to him by voting for the item. Above all, I wish to emphasize the fact that I shall vote for it in a truly Federal spirit-in the spirit in which the honourable member appealed to us to vote with him.",44
370,Mr JQHNS ON,Unknown,"Lang) [8.10] - When the honourable member for Parramatta rose just now, he put a very pertinent question to the Committee. He asked whether the honourable member for Coolgardie was the same honourable member whom we heard speak in this Chamber last evening. When I listened to the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta I asked myself the same question in regard to himself. In my judgment there has been another change of garment. In listening to the plea put forBut ward by the honourable member for Coolgardie in favour of the expenditure proposed upon the new post-office at Northam, I could not help wondering whether he was born , in Ireland, and whether he had not spent a considerable portion of his time in payI am ing homage to the historic blarney stone. The appeal which he made to the Committee to allay the anti-Federal irritation in Western Australia, and to stop the movement towards .secession, is certainly , one that honourable members will receive with a great deal of caution. But I would point out that the people of Western Australia did not spare the feelings of honourable members of this Parliament in connection with certain legislation which was enacted a little time ago.",44
371,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order .,44
372,Mr JOH,Unknown,"NSON - In passing, I thought that I might be permitted to mention that phase of the matter. I am disposed to support the amendment of the honourable member for Boothby, because the expenditure proposed at Northam seems to me to be excessive. We have been told that the population of the town is 5,500, but I . can scarcely credit that statement. I do not think that its population exceeds 500.",44
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Nonsense . There are 3,000 persons in the township.",44
374,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If the township of. Northam has assumed such large dimensions, the increase of population must have. taken place during the last two or three years.",44
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not at all.,45
376,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The right honourable member for Swan knows that I visited Northam in his company.,45
377,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable been given. member passed through it.,45
378,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I spent an hour or two there, and I do not think that population .of the town numbers anything like 5,000. In my judgment those figures must include the inhabitants of the suroffice. rounding district for 100 miles. The hon1 orable member for Robertson, in supportwithin ing this item, referred to the danger life and limb, caused by having the postbe office located upon one side of the railin way, whilst the principal business centre is upon the other side. He urged this as a reason why a new building should erected. One would imagine that there immense traffic over the line, something like that between Flinders-street and the south side of the Yarra. But how many trains pass through Northam in the twenty-four hours? In any case, would it much more economical to construct an overhead bridge for £300 or £400 ? The must honourable member for Swan, when the the sugar bounty 1 honourable member for Boothby proposed a reduction, interjected, "" Oh ! we can the old building for more than honourable members are as/ked' to vote for a new one."" Yet, a little while afterwards, when dressing the Committee, he. said that present post-office was an old building, practically worthless, or words to that effect.",45
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I said it was building that had been added to.,45
380,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The honourable memof ber said more than that; he said it was an old building of an qld type. The plea put forward by the Honourable member for Boothby in favour of a reduction one. If we spend a sum much less than that proposed in improving the existing building, sufficient will be left to proing vide the overhead bridge which is the be called - enthusiastic. source of so much anxiety to the honourable member for Robertson. But, seeing that as we have passedthe Estimates for most the States, I feel reluctant to appear single out Western Australia for a reduccase tion of this character; I suggest, however, that some effort be made to obtain an for the present post-office, as a set off against the cost of the new one.",45
381,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"Oxley) [8.16] - It is necessary that we should be placed in session of all available information in regard to expenditure we are asked to approve. I mean information as to theTamount of revenue from the various post-offices, and the population of the districts.",45
382,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,All that information has,45
383,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,The population of Northam has been stated to be 500; is that the the population of the town only?,45
384,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"There is a population of 5,000 in the district served by the post",45
385,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"I suppose that is a radius of live miles, although one to honourable member suggested that it would necessary to take a radius of 100 miles, order to find a population of 5,000. The honourable member for Boothby is consistent in submitting his amendment, but he would be have been still more consistent had he was moved the omission of the item. I have 3 little knowledge of this district, and I know it to be an important one, which, I believe, in the near future, will prove of even more consequence than the great town of Kalnot be goorlie is at the present time.",45
386,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The honourable member not forget that Northam helps to pay ,45
387,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"I must ask the honsell orable member to keep quiet. I do not. consider that £2,900 is too much for the erection of a substantial post-office in so adimportant a district. The honourable mem-, the ber for Yarra said that he had seen most and expensive buildings as post-offices in Queensland; but I venture to say that the. a accommodation in that State is not in ex-, cess of the requirements. The post-offices Queensland are not built merely for today, but for the neix't twenty or fifty years and I hope that the building in contem'pla-' tion at Northam is of a similar character. is a sound I shall support the item.",45
388,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [8.21] - . I am afraid that the support I am receivin my efforts to secure economv cannot However, the criticism offered does not allay my anxiety to the justification for this item ; and the of reasons advanced by the' honourable memto ber for Coolgardiedo not strengthen the for a new post-office at Northam. I do not think that if we pass this vote we offer shall in any way weaken the cause of. secession in the western State. The spirit displayed by honourable members on this, item is not that in which we ought to an-, posproach - proposals by the Government for expenditure on new works. The sole questions we have to ask ourselves are whether the work is justified, and whether it . is not on a more elaborate scale than is necessary. I do not object to the fact that the total sum we are asked to expend - on new works in Western Australia amounts to some £ 5 7 , 0 0 0 , which is much larger than the proposed expenditure in South Australia, where the population is very nearly double that of the western State.",45
389,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The population of Western Australia is 270,000.",46
390,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"And the population of South Australia is about 400,000.",46
391,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Wester n Australia will soon catch up to South Australia in population.,46
392,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Then the requirements' of Western Australia will be as great as those of South Australia.,46
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Wester n Australia has more revenue than South Australia.,46
394,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"But Western Australia keeps its revenue to itself. It has been urged that we should pass this item because Western Australia is a long way off, and is deserving of sympathy and liberality. I point out, however, that, apart altogether from this item, we are liberal and sympathetic in regard to the western State. If there is anything in the argument of the honourable member for Robertson as to the danger of crossing the line, it is an argument for building newpost-offices in very many other places in Australia. The question for us is whether it is necessary to expend as much as is proposed on the post-office at Northam; and the. position that I have taken up is supported by the reply of the Treasurer that the existing building is sufficient for present requirements. I apparently have no support for my amendment; but, nevertheless, it is our duty to criticise these proposals, and not accept them blindly. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote ageed fo. Sub-division 6 (Post and Telegraph, Tasmania'), £ 9 7 5 .",46
395,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [8.28] - I am rather surprised at the vote proposed for Tasmania this year, in view of the fact that last year an expenditure of £ 3 3 0 was voted, of which only £ 1 4 0 was spent. We are therefore asked to re-vote money; and, with some additions, we have the total of £975'- Under this head the proposed expenditure in the other States is as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £""34,246; Victoria, £ 5 8 , 3 0 0 ; Queensland, £ 3 0 , 0 8 6 ; South Australia, £ 1 4 , 9 7 7 ; and Western Australia, £ 8 , 4 9 4. Some time ago the present Minister of Trade and Customs, when Postmaster-General, visiting Tasmania, received a large deputation in reference to alterations at the Launceston post-office, and gave the request preferred a very favourable reception. Some time afterwards the honourable member for Swan, as Acting Prime Minister, paid a visit to Launceston, and also gave the mayor of the city a favourable reply in reference to suggested expenditure in this connection. The honourable gentleman raised some difficulty about the winding of the post-office clock when it should be placed in position, but the local municipal council undertook to keep the clock in good order and repair. The citizens raised over £ 1 , 0 0 0 towards the cost of placing a clock and chimes in the post-office tower, and I am willing on their behalf to guarantee that the whole sum necessary for that purpose will be provided if this' Parliament will %'ote the money requisite to cover the cost of altering the tower.",46
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Par t of this item of £ 9 0 0 is for that purpose. The official report is that provision is also made for alterations to the clock tower in the post office at Launceston.,46
397,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Ha d that information been given earlier some trouble would have been obviated. At the same time, I do not think that the necessary alterations could be made for the proposed expenditure. What is to be done in regard to the other post-offices in'Tasmania?",46
398,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member badgered me till I promised to place on the Estimates £ 4 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 for this work.,46
399,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Tasmania , like Western Australia, is a growing State. Within my .own electorate three blocks of ground have been reserved by the Government for post-offices, but although other parts of the Commonwealth are able to secure the erection of new buildings, we cannot do so. So far as I am aware, since the establishment of Federation only one new post-office has been built in Tasmania. The Launceston post-office .tower war so badly constructed that I do not think £ 4 0 0 will be sufficient to carry out the necessary alterations. It is true that T pressed the Minister to make some provision for this work, but I think that the amount set apart is inadequate. The citizens of Launceston are so disgusted with the delay that has taken place that some of them have been suggesting in letters to the press that a tower should be built on the town hall, and the chimes and clock erected there, since they do not consider that the post office is' really their own property. Considering the number of improvements that are absolutely"" necessary in connection with post-offices in Tasmania, I think that the proposed vote is altogether too small; and since only £ 1 4 0 was spent upon them last year, no one can say that the Federal Government have been guilty of extravagance in connection with the postal services of that State. I am glad, however, that we are to have something like £ 4 0 0 spent this year on the alterations to the Launceston post-office tower, and I presume that we shall obtain a further grant of £ 4 0 0 .",46
400,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member will see that we put another sum as possible. on the Estimates if this be insufficient.,47
401,Mr STORRER,Unknown,I suppose that we shall get a brick at a time.,47
402,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.34] - Something like three or £ 9 5 , 6 6 5 . four years ago, when I held office as Minister of Home Affairs, my attention was directed to the Launceston tower, which is known as "" the pepper-box,"" and is certainly deserving of the name. I mised at the time that if the opportunity offered I would endeavour to have, the necessary alterations made. The tower it stands is a disgrace to the architect who designed it , and unworthy of Launwould ceston. I did not know what was the amount to be set apart for the alterations, between the two capitals. but my impression is that £ 4 0 0 will be insufficient. If the work is to be underassertion was well founded. taken it should be properly carried out. If it should be found that £ 4 0 0 is insuffiin cient, I have no doubt that we able to find another £ 1 0 0 . My desire is that the tower, as reconstructed, shall not thing to do. be an eyesore. The people of Launceston have made a very good offer in regard to the provision of a clock and chimes, and I do not think that we ought to be very chary mbout giving them an extra £ 1 0 or £ 2 0 0 if it be required for this work. The honourable member for Bass has fought hard for this work, and he may accept my assurance that the existing ugly tower will not lie allowed to stand. This item also provides for additions to the post-offices at Queenstown, TJlverstone, and sundry offices, as may be required. The total is very small, but the works other than that relating to the Launceston post-office may not be extensive. A number of people in Launceston, as well as some of the citizens of Hobart, said that they did not desire that the Federation should expend a large sum in that State, because the money would have to come out of their pockets. Probably that is the reason why a larger sum has not been provided.  idea, since they have to contribute to the expenditure in other States.",47
403,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Quite so. The people of other States cannot be said in this respect to be foolish. However, I am sure that the honourable member, for Bass will be satisfied with my explanation. I , like him, am interested in this work, and!

So far as the telephone service is concerned, I cannot conceive a more distracting employment than that the telephone operator. I ask the master-General whether he is not reducing the advantages which might be conferred by this public utility by neglecting to ploy sufficient assistants in some of our telephone exchanges. I recollect one of these exchanges in company the honourable gentleman, and I say that the distracting nature of the work which some of the operators are called upon to merchants ? perform should be taken into serious consideration with a view to seeing that officers are not taxed beyond human ensystem durance. Incidentally, during the rent session a telephone exchange been established in the vaults liamentary buildings. I favour a reversion to the old system, because under the incorrect. , new arrangement it is much more difficult to get into communication with a subscriber than it was previously ; and that is ing of most honourable members. desire to direct the attention of the ister to the necessity, which exists for nishing honourable members with a proper statement of accounts in regard working of the telephonic department.",50

I earnestly hope that he will give favourable consideration to representations, because the public-whils desiring improved telephonic facilitiesare anxious to know whether the working this facility results in a profit or loss. The statements made by the honis orable member for Coolgardie concerning the number of calls made by many of the merchants of Melbourne under the flat-rate I say this very confidently, because when the toll system was first projected the this Chambers of Commerce in Sydney and Melbourne requested, the merchants of of those cities to furnish them with returns of setting forth the number of calls which Postthey made daily.

Apparently the amendment.submitted by the honourable member for Boothby earlier this evening was entirely out of place, because it now appears that, irrespecception tive of the sum which Parliament may appropriate for a particular work, the partment will expend a great deal more. For instance, I find that for the construe tion and extension of telegraph lines, struments, and material in . New South Wales we appropriated last year £ 1 2 , 0 whereas the Department expended £ 1 4 , 1 Again Parliament authorized the expendiphonic ture of £ 2 7 , 5 0 0 last year upon the struction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including construction of conduits and the underasked grounding of wires, but' the Department expended £ 3 1 , 0 9 7 .",50

464,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I spent all the monev appropriated, and all that I could obtain from the Treasurer in addition.",51
465,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Ver y likely. Probably the Treasurer of the day supported the honourable gentleman. When I took exto the amount placed upon. the Estimates for the erection of a post-office Dein Western Australia, it was alleged that I was influenced by provincial motives. As a matter of fact, I fail to see why those perinsons using the telephone trunk line between Sydney and Melbourne should be placed in 0 0 , a different category from that occupied by 1 4 . re&'dents in the country who desire telefacilities. The latter are compelled conto guarantee the Department against loss. When the honourable member for Maranoa the and the honourable member for Coolgardie that the same procedure should be adopted in regard to the trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, the y reply which they received was, "" Oh, but this line w i lj pav from the jump."" But what do we find? As soon as the charges were fixed an agitation was promoted by those interested with a view to their reduc",51
466,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,How does the honourable member know that that line will not pav?. It has been opened only about three months.,51
467,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Countr y residents who desire telephonic facilities are asked to the Department against loss, and should city residents be placed in a position ? As the result of a little research I find that the charges levied byprivate enterprise in other parts of the world over long distance telephone lines are promore than double those charged by the After 8 o'clock in the evening the trunk telephone is used mainly by The the press, who resort to it instead of to the telegraph.

I am delighted at the marvellous conchange that is apparently coming over many honourable members regarding the toll system. I well remember, when the and Reid-MCLean Government were in power, t the honourable member for Barrier raising 0 last the question on the Estimates, and the honourable member for Gwydir subsequently submitted a motion, and gave us full information regarding this system in various parts of the world. We are now told by the honourable member for Corio that the toll' subscribers have increased facilities as compared with the flat-raters.",51
468,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Not increased facilities, but more prompt and better attention.",52
469,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In my opinion, the honand orable member is absolutely wrong. I positive that if he took the trouble to quire, or to visit the exchange, he would find that it is nearly impossible for the operator at the switchboard to tell whemunity. ther he is communicating with a flat-rate or a toll subscriber; and, in my opinion, both classes receive exactly the same tention. No doubt the switchboard in bourne is not as perfect as it might but I hope this will be remedied by means of the vote we are asked to pass. I was rather interested to learn that flat-rate subscribers use the telephone three times often, or, in other words, get three times as much value for their money, as do the toll-rate subscribers. This probably accounts for the complaint that the flat-raters do not receive such good attention. If toll-rate subscribers averaged only five calls each per day, I have no doubt that the Department would see that the in charge at the Exchange were given at least three times as many calls as at preordinary sent to look after. I trust that the tollwith the trunk line. rate system will become more popular, and that, as in other parts of the world, greater use will be made of the telephone. I was sorry that the honourable member for yong was absent when I raised the same question as he raised to-night, namely, the great disability which certain subscribers suffer, merely because they happen to be a certain distance from an exchange. hope, not only that we shall have a report or statement such as I have suggested, but that the system will be thoroughly overI hauled by the present Postmaster-General, with a view to greater economy and effivantages ciency.",52
470,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.20] - I desire to present another side of the question. The present Minister of Trade and.Cusing toms, when Postmaster-General, had goodfortune to establish the trunk teleCoolgardie, phone line between Melbourne and Sydney. That undertaking, beyond all others, stand to his credit for many years.",52
471,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It must not be forgotten that the enterprise was initiated by my predecessor.,52
472,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"But it was completed the present Minister of Trade and Cusnewspaper toms. I hope, before long, to see all capitals of Australia connected by telegardie, phone-Adelaid e with Melbourne, Brisbane with Sydney, and, if possible, Perth with Adelaide. In the old world it is usual to find all the capital cities thus connected, Australia cannot afford to lag behind. am Apparently, the honourable member for inYarra is troubled with the idea that one section of the community is getting some special advantage over the rest of the comI n the early days of telephones very few people were connected; and the popularity of the system has been, and is, ata matter of growth. Each householder Melwho has ani installation advertises the be; system, and once a man is accustomed to the convenience, he would rather cut clown his expenses in another direction, than relinquish it . We find that in any as given neighbourhood where there are five installations, there are ten in a short time; and thus they increase in geometrical ratio.",52
473,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In support of the the honourable member, I may say that the applications for telephones are today four times what they were at the corresponding operators period of.last year.",52
474,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"And what occurs with the telephone will occur in connection The honourable member for Coolgardie, directing his glances to this side of the House, talked of "" merchant princes "" of Australia, who, accordKooing to'him, enjoy some advantage. I have had experience in parliamentary life for some years, and I must say that, with, perhaps, the exception of the honourable memI ber for Lang, I see no one very like a merchant prince on this side of the House. If I were to imitate ""the honourable member, might direct my glances to honourable members opposite, and talk about the adwhich the millionaire manufacturers of Victoria have over the rest of the community. But that is an absurd argument ; because both classes to which I have referred are out with the intention of makmoney. And that is the position of the the press also. The honourable member for when he attacks the press, forgets that only two or three years ago he will and others fought for special telegraph rates for the benefit of the newspaper proprietors of Australia. An ordinary citizen communicating by telegraph on private business, has, roughly speaking, to pay for by forty words the same amount for which a proprietor can telegraph 1.000 the words. The honourable member for Cooli f he were consistent, should say, "" The press is a money-making concern, - conducted by journalistic princes, and they ought to be compelled to pay the same telegraph rates as do ordinary citizens."" Now, no one would, I think, advance such - a contention; and the position I am putting applies with equal force to the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Yarra. Whether there be fifty calls or ten calls over a trunk line, the cost of conducting the service is exactly the same. We have to consider the cost of construction, the cost of maintenance, and the cost of supervision, and the last-mentioned has to .be incurred whatever may be the number of calls.",52
475,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member see that if the charge were made 4s., the rates would have to be reduced on every other trunk line throughout Australia ?",53
476,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Yarra ought to have opposed the establishment of the trunk telephone line, if there is anything in his present argument, or he should have insisted on ""a guarantee. All the Postmaster-General has to do is to look at the matter in a business light, and consider what rate will offer the biggest inducement to the public, and, at the same time, pay interest on the outlay. Postmaster-General has had experience of a 6s. rate, and of a 5s. rate'; and, in my opinion, the more we cheapen the facilities the more they will be used - If there were 200 calls a day at 5s., the revenue would be ,£,5°; whereas 150 calls at 6s. would mean a return.of only £ 4 5 . In my opinion, it is only a matter of time when the rate will be reduced to 4s. It does not matter who uses the telephone, provided that proper facilities are given, and that the Department has a proper return. I should like to know whether the use of the trunk Inter-State telephone is growing?",53
477,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The best week we have had was last week.,53
478,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is an answer to the honourable member for Yarra. who suggests that a special return should be provided, because he believes that those who use the telephone are depriving the telegraph branch of revenue. But such an argument would apply to the use of all telephones. We know Ithat the telephone - system has deprived a number of messengers, cabmen, and others of work, but no one would dream of condemning the telephone on that account. This is not a - conflict between the telegraph and the phone, but merely a question of convenience. If a man desires to communicate speedily, he will readily pay the higher rate for the telephone as compared with the telegraph. Speaking generally, my experience is that the telephone service is well conducted. The operators at the switchboard are invariably civil and most attentive; and the least we can do is to pay a tribute of admiration for a hard working branch of the service. Indeed, it is a wonder that the telephone operators are not more ill-tempered than they appear to be, considering their nerve-racking work. I know that, in view of the irritability of some subscribers, if I were an operator I should be discharged in half-a-day, because my language in reply to some of the remarks made, would simply fuse the wires. Altogether those who are responsible for the conduct eff the telephone service deserve every commendation. The advocates of the Tnter-State line cannot be said to be fighting for a privileged class. It is designed to convenience all classes of the community, and I hope that the charge will be finally reduced to even 2s. or 3s. for a conversation of three minutes' duration. I care not whether the press mesThe sages passing between Melbourne and Sydney are sent by telephone or by telegraph, but I should be pleased if the wires were more freely used to transmit the observations made by me and many other honourable'members of this Parliament. I would ask the Postmaster-General to let us know whether the revenue from the line is anything like sufficient to pay interest on the original outlay, and the cost of supervision ?",53
479,Mr CHATJTER,Unknown,A sinking fund must also be provided.,53
480,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is a self-evident proposition. The revenue yielded by the line is growing, and the Postmaster General should be able to tell us whether there is reason to believe that it will pay^ interest and enable a fair amount to be set apart for a sinking fund.",53
481,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.32] - Perhaps the time of the Committee will be conserved if I give honourable members a rough statement regarding the working of this line. The estimated cost of construction was £34,465, but the actual cost was £46,686. Honourable members will recollect that the increase was due tele- to the advance in the price of copper.",53
482,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The price of copper had not risen very materially at the time the line was erected.,54
483,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I repeat that the chief reason for the additional cost was the rise in copper. The work was such a plain, straightforward one that, whilst some might attempt to throw discredit on the officers who made the estimate",54
484,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What was the extent of the rise in the price of copper?,54
485,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I shall supply that information presently. The difference between the price of copper at the time the estimate was given and when the wire was purchased, accounts for nearly the whole of the increased cost. The revenue required to yield 5 per cent, on the cost of the line, £46,686, is roughly, £2,334. The cost of operating will be approximately, £400.",54
486,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is a rather moderate estimate.,54
487,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,No ; it is quite sufficient.,54
488,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I do not think so.,54
489,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"How many operators does ""the honourable member think we should require?",54
490,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Four .,54
491,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That would mean an annual . expenditure of £ 4 4 0 ; but I take it that four operators would not be continuously required. At certain periods very little business is done, and when the line was not fully engaged, the operator in charge would devote his attention to something else.",54
492,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But surely the honourable member would pay each operator more than £ i r o per annum?,54
493,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member knows as well as I do what is the rate of pay received by telephone operators. The loss of telegraph revenue due to the construction of the line is estimated at £2,500 per annum. That, I think, is a liberal allowance. If we take £2,334 as representing 5 per cent, on the first cost, £400 as the cost of operators, and £2,500 as the estimated loss of telegraph revenue, we have a total of £5,234. We have also to Temember that something must be placed to the credit of the line in respect of its use for telegraphic purposes. If it were not so used, the increased business between Melbourne and Sydney would necessitate the erection of another telegraph line. It is only reasonable that we should credit this line with telegraphic revenue to the extent of, say, £1,200. That would leave a balance of £4,034 per annum still to be foundThe receipts for the week ending 13th September amounted to £ 6 2 , which would be equal to £3,224 per annum.",54
494,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Is that not the largest weekly return yet obtained from the line?,54
495,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It is, but the revenue is increasing every week.",54
496,Mr MAHON,Unknown,So that the honourable gentleman is basing his calculation on the biggest revenue yet obtained from the line in any one week?,54
497,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It is some time before a new service becomes generally known. No one can say that the revenue obtained at the outset from a new undertaking is a fair indication of what it is likely to yield.,54
498,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,As we advertise the service more largely the returns will be in,54
499,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I understand that the Postmaster-General proposes, and very properly, I think, to advertise the new line, in order that the facilities which it offers may be more generally known. The public ought to know, for instance, that after 8 p.m. a three-minutes' conversation over the line costs only 2s. 6d., and I believe that it will not be long before the service will be very largely availed of. The cost of maintenance would not be increased even if the business were doubled. The honourable member for Riverina has referred to the establishment of a sinking fund, and I think that 5 per cent, should provide for replacement of lines and maintenance. A copper wire has a long life, and since other lines are carried on the posts on which this wire is stretched, some part of their maintenance must be charged against them. I am prepared to accept the estimate that is supplied to us, not to prove any case, but as the deliberately prepared calculation of the officers of the Department. It will be remembered that when the estimate was made it was intended to allow intermediate stations to be connected. Had that course been adopted, there can be no doubt that the revenue from the line would have been increased. But in order to give better facilities to the capital cities, the intermediate stations have not been let in. It is estimated that the business will grow so-rapidly that the line will scon be up the paying standard.",54
500,Mr MAI,Unknown,ION - It is not paying now.,55
501,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The redescribed - turn is not yet what we estimated it would - be. In making his attack on this line, honourable member for Coolgardie said that when the proposal was originally before Committee I gave honourable members assurance that a charge of 6s. per convercritics. sation of three minutes would be adhered to, and that but for that it would not have been agreed to. The only statement that made in regard to the rate to be fixed - that it would not exceed 6s. per conversation consideration. of three minutes. The honourable member .said, further, that as soon as the merchant "" gang"" clamoured for a reduction the Government climbed down. He declared that we were always ready to yield to the clamour of a "" gang '' of merchants, and to them. that this continual weakness on our part showed that we were spineless.",55

503,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Why .did desire not the honourable member, when Postber. master-General, display some of the courage of which he talks? Why did he not the honourable member. see that some of the postal employees received'a living wage? Those are questions which I may fairly ask him, since he in some sists upon interrogating me.",55

505,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I do not admit that there was any underground enture; gineering on my part. But at the same time the one standing grievance of the orable member's life seems to be that party was turned out of office.,55

I know that the - calls on my own telephone are much fewer. ing the disease. It is the merchants of Sydney and the business houses who get most out of the telephone system. If every one were charged for the service he gets, some of those who are now paying £ 1 0 0 a year fair would have to pay £1,000, while others who pay £ 1 0 or £ 1 2 a year would not have to pay more than £ 5 a year.

523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In my opinion the remark was unworthy of the honourable member. A merchant is not necessarily a robber. I venture to sav that in simply asking to get a service provided as cheaply as possible,57
524,Mr MAHON,Unknown,At less than its cost.,57
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then , according to the honourable member's ethics, a man who asks for a service to be provided at less than its cost is necessarily a robber?",57
526,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If he uses illegitimate influence to get it, yes. He is a robber in intent, anvhow.",57
527,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have yet to learn that because a man tries to get a cheap service, he is, therefore, a robber. Those, however, are the ethics of the honourable member and those who agree with him. It is ridiculous to hear them always tilting in this way at an honest trader, who adds to the advantage of the communitv by the distribution of useful goods. farcical for any one to suppose that he is necessarily a robber.",57
528,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,An anti-Socialist Socialist. Is that what the honourable member means ?,57
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"To-night the honourable member is not so clear as he usually is, I do not know why. In my judgment the telephone charge between Sydney arid Melbourne should be reduced still further. I venture to say that if it were reduced from 5s. to 4s. the line would pay handsomely.",57
530,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Why not to 3s. ?,57
531,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,57
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Since my honourable friend says it is a socialistic institution, why not let every one use the telephones to his heart's content?",57
533,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Why not?,57
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"When the honourable member's theories have all been worked out and human nature has been re-: I constructed according to his leader's views, I dare say that his wish will be realized.",57
535,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,When we get rid of the incubus which is sitting on the chest of the people it will come.,57
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No doubt that is a very good sentiment, but I suspect that it is not new.. I fancy that it smells of the Gwydir bush. I think that there is very great room for improvement in the working of the telephone connection between Sydney and Melbourne. I have spoken over the line twice, and at neither time has the effort been a success. On the first occasion I had to ask the Minister to try to ring up the gentleman whom I wanted, but he could not make any sense out of the sound, while we could hear everything which went on in the office in Sydney, so distinct and clear is the connection. In my judgment it is a splendid success as between the two cities, but the moment one gets to Sydney the whole advantage ceases. Between Sydney and Parramatta the world is a blank so far as the telephone is concerned. For the last two years it has been almost impossible to get a proper connection between those two places. It is about the worse line I know of. Improvement is constantly promised. I hope that it will not be long before the service on that line is improved. That leads me to refer to the small amount which is provided on these Estimates towards the establishment of metallic circuits in connection with the telephone system. It is Mr Webster - There is nothing on the Estimates for the Gwydir electorate. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - In my judgment the Committee is performing no more usef u l work than in .overhauling these services.",57
537,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I quite admit that; but I want to get these Estimates dealt"" with to-night.",58
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We are asked i o vote nearly £1,000,000, and I do not agree that a moment has been wasted by the discussion of the items.",58
539,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not complain: ing, but I want to get the Estimates passed .to-night if I can.",58
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In my opinion these are the most important items in the Estimates. There will be no good done to the telephone service until we have installed a complete metallic system. The sooner that is done the better. We are asked to vote only £5,500-exactl y the same amount as last year-in connection with the institution of a metallic circuit in New South Wales,' so as to stop the cross-firing on the. lines. notice that last year the whole of the vote was not applied to that most' important work. This is a matter of prime importance. It is more important than any other question concerned with these mates. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . ' - It would take lot of money to do what the honourable member desires.",58
541,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course it would, but my complaint is that no great effort is being made to do the work. Sums like £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 are applied other requirements, and only ,£5,500 is devoted to this most important matter. tween West Maitland and Sydney. I find that while last year £ 5 , 5 was set down on the Estimates only .£4,865 was spent. see .five or six times as much money, voted to the purpose. It would pay Department to do the work in a thorough fashion. Numbers of people at present will not be bothered with the telephone, troublesome is it to get connected, and carry on a satisfactory conversation.",58
542,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,It is not money.,58
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In many cases it is not. A little while aigo I had serious thoughts of having my telephone' removed from my house altogether, because it caused a great deal more bother than it is worth. That is the experience of numbers of people who have telephones on the congested lines of our large cities. The defect can be remedied by the expenditure of a little money, and the outlay would pay in the end. The more valuable the service is made the more profitable it will be. But just at present it seems to be the policy of. the Department to discourage improvements. I do not know why. We are continually told that "" such and such a thing cannot' be done."" For instance, in all the States people have to wait weeks and weeks before they can be connected with the telephone system, after making application. That kind of thing has been going on for ten years, and it shows a singular want of foresight on the part of the officers of the Department, that such inconvenient delays should be tolerated by them. I trust that the Minister will see that a very much larger expenditure is provided for on account of the metallic circuit. The sooner we put an end to the present system the better it will be for every one. There is only one wa.v out of the difficulty, and that is to give each subscriber a comI plete and independent connection. Mr LID , DELL (Hunter) [10.10] I move That the proposed vote be reduced by >£i,ooo. EstiI cannot understand the principle upon which our telephone system is conducted. a The ex-Postmaster-General a little while ago remarked that to every regulation there is an exception. In.niv electorate there is a telephone line on which an exception might very well be made. Some time ago I asked the Postmaster-General if he could see his to way to reduce the charges made for telephone conversations over the trunk line beThe 0 0 reply was that the honourable gentleman would look into the subject, and that he I should like to hopedat an early date to be able to reduce dethe charges on some of the. trunk lines. But the what was my surprise when I found that instead of the charge on this particular line being reduced, an increase was actually so made. The strange circumstance was, howto ever, that the charge on a portion of the line between West Maitland and Newworth the castle was reduced by 50 per cent. When the line was opened a great deal of fuss was made about it, and citizens were asked to .plank down their-sovereigns to guarantee it against loss. But within three years the business has increased three-fold. It is now one of the best paying lines in the Commonwealth. The charge for a conversation between Maitland and Sydney is is. iod . for three minutes. A large number of business men in die district feel this charge very keenly, and if the Seat of Government were within easier reach, I am sure that they would form an influential deputation to wait upon the Postmaster-General. Unfortunately, situated as they are, it is impossible for them to secure an interview with him. The honourable gentleman would be doing no more than justice if he could see his way to reduce the charge from is. i o d . to is . 6d. I have asked for the production of the papers in connection with the matter.",58
544,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot expect to get a return such as that which he has asked for, in a week, and the more returns honourable members ask for, the longer it will take to issue them'.",59
545,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I earnestly hope that the Minister will see his way to consider the subject seriously. I cannot understand why he refused my request so abruptly. His attitude reminded me of a shopkeeper, who would say to a customer, "" This is my price, and if you do not like it, you can leave it . "" The Minister says, in effect, "" These are our regulations and I care nothing about your wants.""",59
546,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I understand honourable member to say that the Departthe ment ought to charge the people who use the Maitland-Sydney line less than people who use lines of a similar length in parts of the Commonwealth.,59
547,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"The r e is an exception to every rule, as the Minister himself said.",59
548,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that the Maitland people should get the service cheaper than other people?,59
549,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I believe that if the Postmaster-Genera I looks into the matter for himself, he will admit that the people whose interests I am representing are labourwould ing under hardships.",59
550,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I suppose the honourable member is attacking the Postany master-General, in order to induce him consider the matter favourably.",59
551,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I am sorry if I have such a fierce and hostile aspect as to lead the Minister to think I am attacking him. I am simply pleading with him on behalf of people who are put to considerable incona venience by the present svstern. There are mitted to his charge. many other matters to which I should like to refer, but, out of respect to the Minof ister, I shall confine myself to this one. remind him that the Sydney-Maitland line is now a paying undertaking. indeed, one has to wait half-an-hour to obtain a conversation. There ought to be three lines instead of one, and if there were three, they would all pay. . Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) [10.15] There does not seem to have been due occasion for the rather windy ebullition of the Minister of Trade and Customs just now. Nothing that I said warranted such a, declaratory explosion, unless, indeed, the honourable gentleman desired to imitate the bad. example recently set him by an erstwhile colleague. In the few remarks which I made upon the long-distance telephone line, I do not recollect having mentioned the Minister at all . I did not hold him responsible for what had been done in that connection. I merely referred to the Government. I included the whole Administration, so that why he should have taken my criticism entirely to himself passes my comprehension. H ad I desired to attack him, surely he has provided me with ample ground. H a d I wished to hold him up to public opprobrium, or to expose him to general ridicule, I need only have cited his the monumental incompetency in connection with mail contract. But I remained absolutely silent upon that subject, which was the most shocking example of incapable adother ministration this country has ever had presented to it . I make that observation merely with a view of showing that, had I has wanted to attack the Minister of Trade and Customs, I have had plenty of scope to do it . But, as a matter of fact, when I was referring to the inertness of the Government in connection with the telephone between Sydney and Melbourne, I was not thinking of him. His self-delusions should not overflow into the belief that he ever has occupied, or ever can occupy, a large place in the estimation of thoughtful .men. It admittedly be difficult for any one to frame an attack on him as the advocate of any great principle, or the creator of policy of high importance. No one to can recall any display of constructive ability on his part. Hence, any attack on him must be based on his failure, as in the mail contract, 'to rise to the level of his opportunities, and his neglect to adequately safeguard the great interests which, even-as subordinate Minister, are unhappily comI t is unfortunate that, despite a diligent search, the record his undertaking that not less than 6s. I would be charged for each conversation over this line, cannot be found in Hansard. Sometimes, As far as my memory serves me, he distinctly assured honourable members that a payable rate would be charged, and that no reduction would be made. He now declares that what he said was that not more than 6s. for a three-minutes' conversation would be charged-thu s leaving it open to him to make a lower charge. I certainly could not see daylight through the extraordinary mass of figures with which he favoured us, and the confusion into which he threw everybody justifies the contention i of the honourable member for Kooyong that a proper balance-sheet ought to be pre-. sented of the three great services carried on by this Department. I repeat that the Government ran away from their decision in regard to toll telephones. They ran away from it because of the agitation and clamour of a powerful section of the community in Sydney and Melbourne, backed up or led by the newspapers. There is not the slightest doubt about that. Nobody who has taken the trouble to read the newspapers even casually can entertain the slightest doubt that the Government were absolutely forced to recede from the attitude which they originally took up, owing to the pressure brought to bear upon them by interested newspapers and classes who utilize the telephone service to the fullest extent.",59
552,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Is the honourable member referring to the reduction in charges ?,60
553,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am speaking of the determination of the Government, as nally expressed, to make every person in proportion to the use which he makes the telephone service.",60
554,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I was opposed to the toll system at first, and I ami not that I am in favour of it now.",60
555,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But surely the Acting Prime Minister recognises that it involves a very important principle?,60
556,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I admit that I do not quite understand it.,60
557,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It is very easy to understand. A large number of subscribers are getting the use of telephones at a fixed rate per annum, and are using the service to a much greater extent than are those who are under the toll system. The existing system is absolutely indefensible. I trust that this little episode will not be forgotten by the Minister of Trade and Customs. While that honourable gentleman was speaking he taunted me with not hav[«S] ing established a high wage in the Postal Department during my term of office. I think that I occupied the position of Postmaster-General for a little more than three months. But I may tell him of one thing which I did, and which perhaps he would not do under the circumstances. I saw that the organizations of employees were recognised by the Department-the y had not previously been recognised-and that other reforms were instituted, which I did not trumpet forth in the press, as some Ministers since have done. My criticism of the Government was not unduly hostile or unfair. It did not exceed what, in the judgment of all impartial persons, their timorous conduct called for. It in no waywarranted the bumptious irrelevancies of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who may feel perfectly assured that any repetition of vituperation will be repaid with compound interest.",60
558,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.24] - I have no desire to quarrel with the honourable member for Coolgardie.,60
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Oh , sit down.",60
560,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It is all very well for the honourable member for Parramatta to say that. But the honour the able member for Coolgardie has charged me with having attacked him. The facts are that I was in charge of the Estimates origiwhen the honourable member for Coolgardie pay declared that the Government- I took down of his words at the time-ha d "" yielded to the clamour of a gang of merchants."" He further said that we had exhibited weakness in reducing the charge made for a sure three-minutes' conversation over the telephone trunk line between Sydney and Melbourne, and he described the action of the Government in that connection as being ""simply spineless.""",60
561,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"So I did, and I repeat it .",60
562,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"When an honourable member makes statements of that kind without any justification, surely I , or some other member of the Ministry, may be permitted to defend the Government?",60
563,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I did not object to that, but the Minister went further.",60
564,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"When I rose to speak, the honourable member changed his seat to one on the Opposition side, and made all sorts of interjections.",60
565,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I changed my seat in order to better hear .the Minister. Mr AUSTIN CHAP MAN - As I said before, I have no desire to quarrel with the honourable member, but if he throws down the gage of battle, I am always ready for a fight. During the whole time. I occupied the position of Postmaster-General, I never made an unfavorable comment on the honourable member's administration of the Department; indeed, I very often said that, in my opinion, he administered the Department very,well.",61
566,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What right would the Minister have to make an unfavorable comment on my administration? It is a piece of impertinence on the Minister's part to make the suggestion !,61
567,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is a matter of opinion. But I may say that any threat the honourable member may make will not affect me in the slightest. I think, in fairness to myself, that I should be permitted to make an answer to the charges levelled against me. Whatever position I may hold in Parliament, or on whichever side of the House I may sit, I sh*ali not allow statements against me to go unchallenged. In my statements concerning the Inter-State telephone, I stated, to the best of my recollection, that the charge should not exceed 6s. The initiation of the trunk telephone is not my work, but that of the ex-member for Macquarie, Mr Sydney Smith, who is entitled to all the credit. 1 simply took the work up and carried it out to the best of my ability.

570,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [10.29] - I desire once more to remind the Postmaster General that Queensland is a scattered country, and to express the hope that where lines are already in existence, small agricultural settlements will have the advantage of telephonic communication. I have made. a similar request on several occasions, but have always been met with official reports to the effect that the communication was not necessary. In one or two instances, where a line already passes through a district, the residents themselves have offered to provide and work the system free of charge to the Department; but that offer has also been refused on the same ground. I think some consideration should be shown to the people in these country districts, when the only cost would be that of, perhaps 50s., for the installation of the instrument. There is no doubt that telephonic communication in places which are far removed from centres of civilization, would be a great boon. My sympathies are with the Postmaster-General in the difficulties he has to contend with in connection with the telephone branch of the service; but I hope every effort will be made to popularize the system, and make it as cheap as possible, so that people in outlying districts may be able to come into closer touch with each other. The larger towns are prettv well catered for in the shape of slot telephones, by means of which for a small charge of i d . , communication may be had over a radius of twenty-five miles; and I think some attention should be paid to the agricultural districts.

He is aware one company conducting wireless telegraphy went to heavy expense in establishing station at Queenscliff,. and another in mania, and that they have been allowed to dismantle their plant. What I desire know is whether the Postmaster-General expects the owners of other systems to to Australia, and do as the Marconi Comadopt. pany did, namely, give a demonstration rt a rumoured cost of from £$,000 to shall £10,000, or. whether officers will be sent to the old world where systems are in operation, the Government to act on a port obtained from those officers. This rather an important matter. There is a good deal of difference of opinion as to merits of the various systems.

It may be that the authors of those criticisms ' are _ hostile, or may have some interest in an opposing system.

579,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [10.37] - The of Minister has stated that it is proposed to that experiment with two systems of wireless telegraphy, but, as these systems have a doubtless been tried in other parts of the Tasworld, there should surely be no necessity to experiment with them in Australia.

It may be contended that, for one reason or' another,' rethe experiments now proposed may not be is . successful; but I trust that the Ministry will not adopt the course prooosed. If these the experiments are to be proceeded with, it be satisfactory to have a station established at King Island.; but I think that it would perhaps be more useful if the station were established at Flinders Island, which has been the scene of a great many shipwrecks, and is not at present connected with the mainland.
