0,NA,Unknown,the lack of business methods in the display and sale of Australian fruit at the Empire Exhibition? Can anything be done to ensure that better methods will be employed in future?,16
1,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I have seen various statements that have emanated from different quarters in regard to this matter; but I remind the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government is participating in the Empire Exhibition only for the purpose of making known and advertising the products of Australia. The responsibility for meeting any demand that may arise for those products as a consequence of such advertisement rests upon the producers, and it is for them, not the Government, to arrange for their commodities to be available for sale. LATE SENATOR E. D. MILLEN .",16
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - I have received from Mrs E. D. Millen a letter acknowledging on behalf of herself and family the resolution of this House expressing sympathy with them on the occasion of the death of her husband, the late Senator E. D. Millen. IMPORTATION OF WIRE NETTING. FORMALMOTION OF ADJOURNMENT.",16
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received from the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) an intimation that he proposes to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the imposition by the Customs Department of a dumping duty on British wire netting imported into Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",16
4,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [8.28] - I desire the House to clearly understand that I am submitting this motion, not for the purpose of making an attack upon the Government, but in order to plead with it to adopt a different policy. If honourable - members opposite have any knowledge of the enactments of this Parliament a couple of years ago, they will realise that the Government is confronted with difficulties in connection with this matter. The importation of wire netting into Australia is of such importance that I urge the Government to use the powers which I believe they possess under the Act to give the concessions for which we ask. I shall give a short history of the decisions of the House in connection with the duty on wire netting. When the Tariff was being considered in this Chamber, I moved that British wire netting should be admitted into Australia free, and that we should pay a bounty to Australian manufacturers of wire netting to enable them to compete with the British manufacturers. I received a good deal of support. Six of the members of the preseut Government voted for free netting. One of my most ardent supporters was the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Austin Chapman). He realized how important it was that wire netting should be made available to the producers. He said on that occasion that we should never lose sight of the fact that the rabbit is the greatest curse Australia has experienced. He also said that unless we had a prosperous and contented yeomanry the industries of Australia must suffer, and we should have grass growing in the main streets of our cities. I ask honourable members opposite to reflect on those words. It is a fact that if we do not look after the interests of the men in the back country we may find gras3 growing in our city streets. Mr Austin Chapman also said that my arguments were an appeal to common sense - I hope that he will feel today that my arguments are an appeal to his common sense and to that of the Government. I trust that other honourable members will feel that I am using common-sense arguments. Unfortunately the majority of the House voted against free netting. Afterwards the Government were induced to bring forward a proposal for free importation of wire netting from Great Britain, a 10 per cent, duty on foreign netting, and a bounty for local manufacture. I am sorry that members of this party received that measure in the spirit they did. I can say on behalf of the producers of the country that they appreciated that action of the Government. But the Customs Department have kept on taking advantage of the provisions of what we know as the Anti-Dumping Act, but which is on our statute-book as the Australian Industries Preservation Act. That Act should not be allowed to remain on the statute-book for a single moment longer. It is the most preposterous and easilyabused enactment on our statute-book. Honourable members always contend that Parliament should be supreme, and I 3ay that no Minister should be able to alter the Tariff at his own sweet will. When Parliament fixes a Tariff the Minister should be obliged to give effect to it. In December of 1922, after Parliament had declared that British wire netting should be free of duty, some consignments of netting came to ""Western Australia from Great Britain.. The circumstances respecting one small consignment came under my notice. That parcel was valued at £113. Tho Customs Department put a duty of £45, or nearly 40 per cent., on the consignment. They said that the home consumption price of the netting was ""£158, and that therefore they must put a £45 duty on it. In consequence of representations made to the Minister for Customs, be ordered that the duty should be refunded, and that a dumping duty should not be imposed on British, netting. In April of the next year, something of a like nature happened, and again we got the Government to remit the duty! All through the Tariff debates in this House it was clearly shown to be essential to Australia's best interests that wire ting should be made available to the producers at the cheapest possible price. Figures quoted revealed that huge sums of money had been spent by both the State and private individuals in purchasing wire neeting. In Western Australia alone we have a fence which runs from the south, near Esperance, to the north, at Port Hedland. That fence and subsidiary fences cost hundreds of thousands of pounds. Their up-keep cost alone is enormous. A photograph printed in one of the Perth Sunday newspapers last week showed a number of men returning from a morning's shooting tour in good wheatgrowins; country which had vermin-proof fences ou either side. These men had 86 rabbits between them. I know, of course, that there are places in which millions of rabbits collect, but the country to which I have referred is good wool and wheat growing country, between two wire-netted fences.",16
5,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Did the men shoot the rabbits between the two fences ?,17
6,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"They did. Last time. I was in South Australia. I made inquiries about their vermin-proof fences. They have hundreds of miles of wire netting fences. I was shown one plan which gave the position of a fence 400 miles long. It runs between New South Wales and South Australia, and is 5 f t . 6 in. or 6 f t . high. That indicates the enormous expense which these fences involve. I ask honourable members to read the speech made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook)"" in the debate on the Tariff. He showed that tens of millions of money had been expended and lost in Victoria and New South Wales through the ravages of the rabbits. He also quoted statistics to show that a rabbit industry had been built up in Australia. The greatest curse of Australia has been made the basis of an industry. I think he said that over £1,000,000 worth of rabbit skins had been exported in one year. Australia has two.great industries-woo l and wheat, but she also has two cursesrabbits and dogs. A paragraph which appeared a few days ago in one of the morning newspapers stated that quite a large number of men had gone out night after night, and day after day, at a place in New South Wales to catch one dog, which had killed some hundreds of sheep. These losses surely show how netnecessary it is that cheap wire netting should. be made available to the producers. I wish to discuss the reasons which caused the Government to take the action they have taken; and I shall ask them to look at this question from a different aspect from that from which it has been viewed so far. I understand that the Minister for Customs has declared that the Act which he is administering is so specific that it leaves him no option but to do as he has done. He says that when it has been pointed out to him that netting has been sold for export to Australia at a lower price than it is sold for use in England, he must put into effect the dumping sections of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I hold, first, that that is not the case. Parliament having declared, by a special vote, that British wire netting should be admitted free, it should be so admitted. Of course, the Minister has certain duties under the Anti-Dumping Act, and he must discharge them. If persons elsewhere manufacture goods in quantities beyond the capacity of the home market to absorb; and sell the surplus cheaper in this country, action must be taken to .protect our manufacturers. I am not in sympathy with any movement for assisting the dumper. But to assume that dumping of wire netting is taking place within the meaning of the Act is absurd. The position of the wire .netting manufacturers in Great Britain today is comparable with that of a large businesshouse which does both a wholesale and a retail trade, charging different prices for wholesale and retail '.purposes. The Act says that 'the Department must find out, first, whether goods are being sold more cheaply in .Australia than for home consumption. I assume that the information an the possession of the Customs Department is to the effect that wire netting is being sold more cheaply in Australia - than in the Old Gountry. English manufacturers tftske 65 per carat, oft their list prices for consumption in England, and 70 per cent., plus :2.$ per - cent, for export rto Australia. Therefore, they are selling netting .cheaper for export to Australia than for iiome consumption. For - the purpose ipff complying with the Act, however., the Minister has to consider the "" fair market value"" of the goods. The Act .says The "" Pair Market ""Value"" of goods 'means iilio fair .market value of the goods, or of goods of the same class or .kind, .sold in the country of export in relation to which the expression is used, tfor home consumption in the usual and ordinary com-sc of trade. There is no "" ordinary course of trade "" in wire netting in the Old Country. A little netting may be sold .for the manufacture of bird cages .and traps for rats and other pests, but the trade in it is almost entirely an export trade. amusing incident occurred some time ago.. A man ordered in England some "" sguizzera,"" which are toys used at entertainments, and found that the - Customs Department classified them .as "" musical instruments."" The Department - handling wire netting in an equally absurd - way. There is nothing like a wholesale trade in wire netting in England. The quantity used in that country is almost .negligible. I believe the .Department has been .advised that a large amount of it is consumed in .Great Britain. Can any one confirm that statement? Has any one seen that uetting in use? I have made careful inquiries [20] with a view to testing the accuracy of the statement, but have not been able to : discover where the netting is used. Has any one seen the countless miles of wire netting fences that must exist in England if the - statement be true ? Other kinds of netting may be used in that country for the purpose of reinfoi'cing concrete roads, but 'they do not come within the same category as netting for fencing. Apart from the .fact that the consumption of - wire - netting in England is very small, this House was given clearly to understand that the powers of the Minister under the Act were not mandatory. - Questions were asked on this point when' the Bill for the Act was before us. I take - the following extract from Mansard:Mr GJJEEItfE - . . . It does not necessarily mean that vthc Minister must ""follow'the report xft 'the Tariff - Board, Init he must get a report before he acts.",17
7,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The question is whether it is for the Board or the Minister to determine. - Jilr. Gi'REENE - It is for the Minister to determine.,18
8,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But who has to be satisfied?,18
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Minister must 'be satisfied. Under the old Act we had to prove intent, and {hat is rather different from a provision 'that the Minister must he satisfied. The Minister must be satisfied, first, that there is a legitimate home .trade in wire netting. T contend that there is <no such ti:ade. The 'demand for - wire net>ting - in England is so ismal-1 that it is negligible in .relation to prices, ifetting is :sold there a few coils - or a few yards at An - a 'time. Im Australia the demand is for hundreds of miles. Certain phases of .this - question which have ;been brought under my notice have not yet been placed before the Minister. I wish to quote from - a letter written by one of the biggest Arms iLn AuBtnaLLa, upon whose truthfulness I is feel I - can :-implicitly rely, 'although .1 atl-mit that their knowledge of 'the facts may not be ^complete.. The letter shows, first, that 'there is a lange .demand for netting in Australia; secondly, 'that the price - of English netting at .the - time - the letter -.was written was higher - than - that of netting in Australia.; and, - thirdly, that the Australian .manufacturer was not able to - execute - the orders 'offered 'to him. The letter, which deals with an .application by a large pastoralist taking up country in Western Australia, saysHe will probably require about 100 miles of netting in the first twelve months. His first order was for 40 miles, and we asked the New South Wales manufacturers to quote for this order, but they could not give delivery of the whole quantity in anything like the time required. Wo ordered a portion from them, hut were obliged to order 25 miles from England. No financial advantage was gained from this step, as the English netting cost 5s. a mile more than the present price of Australian netting, and we think you will agree that it is inflicting undue hardship on the settlers of this State in re-introducing this Dumping Act clause when there is really no justification for it. As you are no doubt aware, the sale of sheep netting in the Old Country is so trifling to what it is compared with Australia, that to take the retail price of a single roll from a retail hardware store as a basis of comparison with an order for 100 miles is absurd. The letter further points out that in the great area north of Kalgoorlie-Lawlers, Leonora, and Menzies-South people are settling in large numbers. look upon it as wonderful sheep country. The letter says that "" one of the most satisfactory features of the new development is that the country is being takeu up by men of long pastoral experience in other portions of the State, and we venture to say that no better body of men could be found in Australia to open up this far-back country."" The firm also says that a new province is being added to the State, and that it will carry an enormous number of sheep. matters of very grave importance. we consider, first, that when this wire was required the Australian turer was not able to supply the whole of it, and, secondly, that the price was higher in England than in we must admit that the imposition of a dumping duty was without I believe netting is cheaper There has been a big in the price of wire. At the of the Ruhr trouble the cost of wire jumped in England owing to industrial troubles increasing the cost of coal, and the price of wire in Australia with the English price, although were paying a subsidy for the facture of it. The Tariff Board have informed Parliament of these facts. Apart from that aspect of the matter, I believe that the cost of wire has been decreasing, and the circumstances now may be different from what they were when the gentleman to whom I have referred Mr Gregory. wrote his letter. The suggestion - that there is a wholesale trade in wire netting in Great B r it a in is, to my mind, absolutely preposterous. We cannot regard the matter in that light.",18
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What percentage of the production would the honourable member consider to be a reasonable thing?,19
11,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I have not gone into tho3e figures. I believe that certain representations have been made, that I cannot discuss, but in view of the doubt that exists in regard to the quantity of wire netting used in the Old Country, I urge the Minister (Mr Austin Chapman) to defer the taking of any action, and to have fuller investigations made. I would be satisfied with that for the time being. We desire to have the matAustralian ter placed on a settled basis, because They those who import netting want to be able to quote prices some little time in advance, and it is unfai r to place them in the position of not being able to ascertain the prices at which they can supply the article. It is unfair also to the purchaser1 sent a long telegram to the Premier of Western Australia (Mr . Collier) asking if he would cable to his Agent-General in England to find out the value of the Home consumption. I These"" are stated to Mr Collier that it had been When represented that that consumption was very large, but that I regarded it as manufac- negligible. I also sought the assistance of the honourable member for Perth (Mr . M a n n ) . That information is not yet Australia, available, but I hope to have it in my possession later. justification. now. Mr Fenton,-The Customs Departreduction ment can supply the honourable member time with that information.",19
12,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I want to obtain information which will enable me to put rose up a bigger fight than I could with the we figures supplied by the Tariff Board. manu- The Government should realise the diffimight culties attendant upon the settlement of new country, and the vicissitudes with which every settler has to contend, such as fire, flood, drought, and exorbitant freight by sea and r a i l . He never knows in advance what price his produce will realise, and often after many years of hard work lie finds himself in a deplorable condition. . Mr ""WEST-How can the honourable member expect people to go upon the land when he paints such a miserable picture of the conditions?",19
13,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If every settlor in the back country were frozen out, I do not think it would worry the honourable member. Some persons are so stupid that they cannot realise that it is wealth which is being produced in the back country that enables the inhabitants of the cities to enjoy their present good conditions.  orable member supports a Government which is responsible for this state of affairs?",20
14,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The honourable  Moloney) knows perfectly well that I am quite justified in my statementsWhile as a Protectionist he desires to see big protection given to secondary industries, at the same time his common sense tells him that the wealth created in the back country makes possible the good condiHad tions enjoyed by the people in the cities. Not one secondary industry would exist for a day were it not for the market provided by the primary producers of the country. Therefore, why do honourable members talk such arrant nonsense? I hope that the Government will earnestly consider the difficulties and privations with which the men in the back country are faced. This wire netting is reqiiired, not for those resident in and around interjections. Sydney and Melbourne, but for those who have their farms and pastoral areas 200 and 300 miles from the centres of populaan tion.",20
15,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Do not forget that if it were not for the people in the city the primary producers would not have a Australia, market for their produce.",20
16,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I wish I could send, the honourable member back to the Northmembers opposite. ern Territory. To show how little he knows about the country, I might that I understand that when he was travelling by train through Northern Territory he was told that certhing tain white ant hills were statues erected in memory of some of the old aboriginal chiefs, and he said that when he got back to Melbourne he would complain bitterly of the extravagance of the Government in erecting them. I hope that the Government will defer the action they propose-, and will endeavour to give relief to the struggling settlers.",20
17,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [3.55] - I endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), the and urge the Government to reconsider this matter. I shall have a good deal more to say to the Government later regarding the administration of the anti-dumping legislation. In this jjarticular case, I regret exceedingly that the Gohave in so inconsistent a manner sought to benefit one industry-prac tically a new industry in Australia-to the serious injury of one of our oldest and best industries. In South Australia the State Government has advanced no less a sum than £3,000,000 on long terms to enable settlers to secure dog and rabbitproof fences, and thus enclose enormous areas of outside country. This work has been going on for 25 years. The wool from the big stations in South Australia provides an immense amount of wealth. it not been for the wool production of Australia, I do not know how we would have fared during the last year or two.",20
18,Mr YATES,Unknown,Tell us about the country that Kidman has ruined.,20
19,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,I am not talking about Kidman at the present time.,20
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to be good enough to disregard,20
21,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I am talking aboiit sheep country. The breeding of sheep is enterprise which, if properly encouraged, will bring into use the greater part of what the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) calls Kidman's country. That will greatly benefit and will prove advantageous to the shearers and working men who are supposed to be represented by honourable",20
22,Mr YATES,Unknown,"It was under sheep when say he took it and ruined it. the Mr Foster - Mr Kidman has noto do with the question before the Chair. Although South Australia has immense areas in full production, there are large tracts of country which have to be exploited by a further enormous expenditure of public money. The Darling country of New South Wales is today overran with rabbits and dingoes, sheep having been driven out entirely. There are enormous areas in New South Wales, and a considerable range of country in. Queensland and in Western Australia, in a similar plight. Is there any consistency in endeavouring to prop up unduly one industry in Australia, and by that action wiping out permanently a bigger and infinitely more important industry ? The value of the wool clip of Australia should not be overlooked when considering the action of the Government. I do not believe that the Government will do what is proposed, but I ask it to remember that the biggest of all our industries is the wool industry. It cannot be preserved if shackles are t© be put upon it in the way indicated by the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs. I join with the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) in the view he takes of the matter. I cannot help referring to the fact that there must have been some recognition of the great need for wive netting when last session the Government 1 brought down a measure to provide for the loan, free of interest, of £2'50;000 to the States to provide wire netting. In view of that fact, it is strange that we should haA'e this kind of treatment of primary producers outback. I ask the Government, in the interests of the primary producers of the country, and in-its own interest,, not to proceed, with this inconsistent action of applying a dumping duty to imports of wire netting. The honourable member for Swan has clearly explained that we in Australia have for a long time been amongst the very best customers of those engaged in the. manufacture of wire netting in the Old Country. Mr ""WATKINS (Newcastle) [*.#} - T V was* only upon my arrival from Sydney this afternoon that I learned that it was intended to. move the adjournment of the House to call attention to the imposition of an anti-dumping, duty on wire netting I saw from the newspapers that it had been imposed'. I am one of those who have never approved' of bonuses for the assistance of any industry. I was against the removal of the duty originally passed by the House in this case, and the substitution of the bonus system. With regard, to the man on the land, one would think from the utterances of the two honourable members who have spoken from the other side that members on this side of the House are utterly regardless of the interests of the man on the land. I think it will be found that the history of politics in this Parliament, and in the New South Wales Parliament, of which I had the honour to be a member before I came here, shows that the true friends 1 of the farmers have always been the Labour politicians. Perhaps in support of this statement. I need do no more than mention the fact that recently in Western Australia and in South Australia, representatives of the parties' opposite nave been practically obliterated by the farmers whom honourable members oprjosi'te claim to represent. We, on this side, have always believed in helping the farmers, but at the same time we wish the farmers to realise that there are some other people in this country, and that if its future is to be what we desire, secondary industries must be given, a fair show, and. reasonable opportunities must be afforded to build up and maintain them. The honourable member for Wakefield' (Mr. Foster) has stated' that this Parliament gave £250,000, free of interest, to the States in order that they might provide wire uetting for the fafniers. No member of this House objected to that. I might further say that the first proposal of the kind was made from this side of the House. There is evidence of ageneral desire to help the farmer. I wish first of all' to deal with the letter to which the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory)- referred, pointing out that the wire netting industry in Australia could not supply orders. The honourable gentleman did not give the date of his letter.",20
23,Mr GKEGOBY,Unknown,I received it only yesterday: Mr W&TKINS;-Does the letter say when orderswere refused ? 1,21
24,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I do not know at' what date the ord'er was issued, but the letter was written only a week ago.",21
25,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"After the war, when as every one knows, trade was disturbed for it considerable time, the big steel works of Australia closed down for something like twelve months. At that time 7,000 or 8,000 men were thrown out of employment, but we heard no special pleading on their behalf from members of the Farmers party. I believe that the honourable member will find that it was at that particular time that farmers' orders for wire netting could not be supplied. The position today in Newcastle, Sydney, and Melbourne, where wire netting is produced, is that the manufacturers can supply more than Australia's require-. incuts.",22
26,Mr GHKOOBY,Unknown,No .,22
27,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"That is what they inform me, and they ought to know. If the honourable member had been at Newcastle recently with the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman), and had seen big storerooms full of wire netting of all descriptions because orders cannot be obtained for it . he would hold a different opinion. Mr M. CAMERON - There are of orders. 1 MrWATKINS-Member s of this House have seen great quantities of wire netting in the stores which the manufacturers cannot obtain orders for. The honourable member for Swan says that he is in favour of genuine anti-dumping legislation, but he says that, in this case, British manufacturers do not manufacture for local requirements as much as they do for export.",22
28,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,There is no comparison whatever.,22
29,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I have not the exact figures by me, but the Minister for Trade and Customs informs me that 70 per cent, of the output of the industry in Britain is consumed in that country. There is a more important matter to be considered. I have referred to it before, and it will shortly have to be considered again in this House, and that is the preference which we give to Britain in respect of articles only 25 per cent, of the manufacture of which is carried out in that country. This preference is operating in such a way at the present, time that British steel producers are not reaving any benefit from it at all. If We ai'e in favour of a truly British preference, we should say so. At the present time many of the rollers of iron and steel, and drawers of wire are obtaining, through Belgium, no doubt, German wire rods, as they obtained German steel through Belgium in the same way some time ago. I remind honourable members opposite of this fact, because they were going to stop trading with Germany for a period of ten years.",22
30,Mr FOSTEB,Unknown,Who was?,22
31,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The Nationalist party, when led by Mr Hughes.",22
32,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That is the kind of wire netting that honourable members opposite want!,22
33,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"That is what we are importing today. It is not the genuine producers of steel and iron in Britain who are benefiting by our preference today, but the drawers of wire who import their wire rods from the Continent. plenty Because the British manufacturers are ---< exporting a large proportion of their output to Australia honourable members opposite claim that they are not dumping, but let us consider the prices of netting in Great Britain and in Australia. For a mile of wire netting the price in England is .€47 10s., and in Australia £30 17s. 6d. They are selling their manufacture here, for about £17 less per mile than they charge in tlieir local market.",22
34,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,-The honourable member's figures are wrong. Mr M. CAMERON - Wir e of what gauge and mesh ?,22
35,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Wir e netting is made of so many gauges and meshes that it is difficult to obtain detailed figures. I have quoted ait average figure. I remind honourable members opposite that on this side we have some concern foT the conditions which operate in different industries whether here, in England, or anywhere else - The wire drawers, with other iron workers in England, today receive 33s. lOd. per week of 47 hours, whilst here the average wage in the industry is £4 7s. 6cl. per week of 48 hours. MrGREGORY - Is the subsidy of use to the industry then? Tell us what the subsidy is per ton? "" Mr WATKINS - The honourable member asks me what the subsidy is per ton, but I told him at the beginning of my remarks that I am against subsidies.",22
36,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,That does not matter. The manufacturers get a subsidy.,23
37,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I may tell the honourable member that I am informed that the steel sheeting bonus is not as good as the duty was for the assistance of the industry. Whilst Labour members are at all times prepared to do justice to the farmer, we want them to realise that their very best market is going to be their home market for most things they produce. If we are to have in Australia the population at which the immigration schemes of the Government aim, we must keep our secondary industries going, or there will not be work for the immigrants. I stand today where I have always stood in connection with these matters, and shall do all in my power to enable Australia to produce and manufacture all articles which she is capable of producing or manufacturing.",23
38,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Macquarie) [4.16]. - This question is of vital importance to Australia. I regret very much the action of the Government in imposing a dumping duty on wire netting. No man in this House realizes more than the Minister the absolute necessity for a plentiful supply-of cheap wire netting being available to combat the rabbit pest. The Act quoted by the honorajble member for Swan (Mr Gregory) is perfectly justifiable, but in matters of this kind an exception should be made. If it is not possible under the Act to make exceptions, the Act should be altered to give the Minister that power. The honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) have instanced what has been done in large areas. But it is not only the holders of large tracts of land who require wire netting; it is quite as essential to many of the smaller landholders. I can speak from experience, and I say unhesitatingly that the figures quoted by the honourable member for no Newcastle ' (Mr Watkins) were absolutely misleading. I do not know the present price of wire netting, but the Australian-made article has always been dearer than the imported material. There is no question, however, that the wire netting manufactured in Australia is of better quality than the imported article, and for that reason I have always been prepared to pay 'a little more to obtain it. Owing to the necessity for conserving space in the ships, imported wire netting is rolled very much more tightly than that made in Australia, aud, consequently, it does not give such good results. If it is necessary to protect this Australian industry, protection should be given by increasing the bounty already existing, rather than by the imposition of a dumping duty. The western division of New South Wales is today carrying about 16,000,000 sheep less than before the rabbits invaded that territory. Under. existing conditions an additional 16,000,000 sheep would be earning for that State £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 a year. At the present time New South Wales is only carrying 50 per cent, of the stock she could carry if we had no rabbits. Without the rabbits the value of our wool and the amount of wages paid would be doubled, whilst the carrying capacity of the country would be increased very considerably. In one part of my electorate, owing largely to the influence of one man, the small landholders have gone in for wire-netting and the-eradication of the rabbits to a much greater extent than formerly, but if the price of netting is raised it will act detrimentally to their interests. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) spoke as if the shortage of netting existed only during the war period, but a little more than a year ago I ordered a supply for my holding which was not delivered for months. By the time. I obtained it, damage in excess of the total cost of the netting had been done to a crop of wheat. if the Minister finds that under the existing Act he is compelled to impose this dumping duty on wire netting, he should give Parliament an opportunity to amend the Act as early as possible.",23
39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.25] - I congratulate honourable members on the reasonable way in which they hare presented their case, but to a certain extent they have misconceived the issue. It is not a question of the price to the farmer, as Australian-made wire netting is cheaper today than the material imported from England - The Act, which is very clear, readsIf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that goods exported to Australia, which are of a class or kind produced cr manufactured in Australia, have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than the fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette specifying the goods as to which he is so satisfied. Although the word ' m a y "" is used, it practically means "" shall."" Honourable members have asked whether a. reasonable amount of the wire netting manufactured in England is used in that country. I have ascertained that 70 per cent, of it is deposed of in Great Britain . That should be considered reasonable.",23
40,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Did you say ' 70 cent. ? Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN. - That is the information which has been furnished, to me by my officers. The question has also been asked what quantity of wire netting is required in Australia. I am advised that Australia requires approximately 25,000 Ions, which also is the quantity she is capable of producing. Mr Sct-LLiN - What quantity Australia produce?",24
41,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I do pot know, but it is nothing like 25,000 tons. When I was in Newcastle recently I saw thousands of miles of wire uetting for which there was no market. The price today for Australian wire netso. ting of the gauge most used is £ 4 3 6d. per mile, and the English invoice price, c.i.f. and e., Melbourne, f o the same material is £41 19s. 6d. per mile. But the price at which soon be brought that netting is sole' in England is £ 5s. 7d. per mile. The dumping duty i * the difference between those two amounts. That shows that there is some reason one-third of the netting manufactured .'n duty was designed to protect us. England is invoiced out here at such greatly reduced price. The wages i England are £ 1 15s. lOd. for 47 hours, while in Australia £ 4 7s. 6d. is paid for 48 hours.",24
42,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"How much do you think the men driven oh"" the interior country are getting a day? They are ruined.",24
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I know as much about that as does the honourable member, but their position is not affected at all. It is not a question of the price, but of the brand of the netting. We are giving the bounty in order that employment may be found for our own people. Honourable .nembers are aware that if 25 per cent, of British labour is employed in the manufacture of imported goods, such goods are classed as British. I am advised that most of ! the materia! for tin. imported wire netting does not come from Great Britain . Such a state of affairs is not satisfactory; but the action of the Government has placed the farmer at no disadvantage, as his wire uetting is no dearer.",24
44,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"The price of netting today is absolutely prohibitive. per Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I admit that, the district represented by rhe honourable member who moved the adjournment is at a disadvantage because of the difference between the freight from Great B r it a in and the freight from Newcastle. The policy of this Parliament is one if Protection, in order that our own people may find employment. That is the reason for the dumping duties. Although the. Act uses the does word "" may,"" a common-sense interpretation makes action by the Minister mandatory. . Mr Scullin - The Minister must judge the intention of Parliament.",24
45,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is If an attempt were made to take ad17s. vantage of any Act on the statute-book to make the price of wire netting greater r than it should be, it would be reprehensible, and the Government would to task for it . 1 9 The disparity between British and Australian wages in the wire netting industry is striking, and illustrates the sort of why competition against which the dumping We a must consider, not Qnly those men who n are engaged in the manufacture of wire netting, but also the men who mine the limestone, coal, aud iron. The decision to admit British wire netting free of duty was arrived at simply in order that we might give some advantage to the users of that commodity. It is a great pity that the wire netting has not been more freely utilized.",24

47,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Parlia - £250,000 ment decided to admit wire netting from Great Britain free of duty, but, unforamongst tunately, the provision regarding 25 cent, of British manufacture often acts injuriously to Australian industry, cause it enables the product of foreign the imported. labour to be admitted into this country upon conditions which Parliament intended to be enjoyedby the manufacthat turers of Great Britain only. The Goan vernment's action has been determined, not by considerations of price, principle at stake. Australia is a Progiven tectionist country, and is paying high wages fixed in a scientific way.",25

61,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The dumping duty is the difference between the English wholesale price and the price at which the article is invoiced to Australia.  Mr AUSTIN 'CHAPMAN - Yes. I recognise that the Government has a duty to prevent restraint of trade. If it proved that the manufacturers of Australia were taking advantage of this protection to increase unduly the price of their products, it would be the Government's duty to take action. Government did not impose this dumping duty without a full appreciation of the facts. The policy of the country is Protection, one of our Statutes provides for the imposition of a dumping duty in certain circumstances, and when the Tariff Board created by Parliament reported that those circumstances existed, I , as Minister, had no option but to act upon the Board's recommendation.",25
62,Mr GHEGOHV,Unknown,"Mr Massy Greene, when piloting that Statute through the House, made it clear that the Minister's power to act upon the recommendation of the Board was not mandatory.",26
63,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I think the course I adopted was the only one that was open to me. There are still a few Free Traders in this Parliament, but whatever may be the fiscal opinions of honourable members, all will agree that, other things being fairly equal, it is sirable that we should give employment to our own people, and use the products of our own factories, especially when they are better than imported goods. If as a result of that policy trade were restrained, and the price of wire netting came extortionate, the Government would have power to act, and I have not the slightest doubt it would do so.",26
64,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [4.40] Many people are not aware that rabbit flesh is a good and healthy food, and that the fur, weight for weight, is frequently of the same value as that of wool. But people complain because the rabbits eat the grass that would otherwise be available for sheep. I noticed that, in Western Australia, rabbit flesh was sold at from 9d. to Is. 6d. per lb., which compares favourably with the nrice of meat, so that, from a producer's point of view, there is something to be said for the rabbit. It has been stated that the number of sheep in New South Wales has been considerably reduced by the depredations of rabbits. Is not the reduction due to multi-millionaires of the Kidman type endeavouring to get rid of Australian workmen, rather than give them fair conditions of living on the sheep stations? As a boy I picked up wool in a shearing shed, and I remember the disgusting conditions in which shearers had to live fifty-five years ago. The improvement which has taken place is something The of which Australia should be proud. Kidman's cattle, no less than the rabbits, are eating the grass that would support sheep. Kidman changed from sheep to cattle because he did not wish to give Australian workmen a fair chance. The Australian Labour party will stand or fall by the policy of the new Protection, which gives fair play to the producer, the consumer, and the men and women who are engaged in manufacturing, and I believe it will be endorsed by the Australian people when they thoroughly understand it. What ground for complaint has Great Britain in regard to duty imposed on wire netting imported into Australia? The English product has a 10 per cent, preference over that of other countries, but Britain is not just to her own workers. I speak with knowledge gained from five years' residence in London, with all its , misery and wretchedness. I hold in my hand one glove of a pair presented to me de- by my daughter. I refused the first pair that was offered to me because I found that although the name "" Fownes, London,"" was on the button, the glove itself was made in Ozecho-Slovakia. That English firm of Fownes tried to injure beits own English workers by pretending that the glove made in Czecho-Slovokia was made, in England. The Only thing that was made in England was the button. I have been informed that the firm was heavily fined for its conduct. A fine is no good in a case like that. Gaol is the only preventative. The diity on English netting was 68s. a ton, and on foreign netting it was 105s. No man in this House Would say, either On the platform or in private conversation, that he preferred to help the foreign rather than the Australian workmen. Our policy is to build up Australian industries. Australia, is now self-contained with respect to wire netting. Twenty-five thousand tons could be manufactured here, and the work would support three primary industries. Is not our iron ore industry a primary industry? And are not our coal and limestone mining industries primary industries? The infernal system which has operated in England for so long with such injustice to the English people has banished the splendid type of Englishman of years ago. It has resulted in the English people being herded together in cities, and in attempts to raise men and women on bread, tea, and what they call butter. The British Parliament will have adopt protective duties sooner or later. The present cost of wire netting to farmer in Great B r it a in is £49 5s. per mile. The price of Australian wire netting is £43 7s. 6d. But the British manufacturers wish to prevent the manuwill facture of wire netting i u Australia. Therefore, while they charge their own English farmers £ 4 5 5s. 7d. per mile, will send netting out to Australia £41 19s. 6d., which price includes commission, insurance, freight, exchange. No industry in the world, let alone our Australian industry, stand undermining of that kind. I is unfair competition. The object of the Australian Industries Preservation Act is to prevent Australian industries and workmen from being injured by - unfair competition. That is the object of all our protective duties. The wonderful commercial rise of Germany was brought about by the adoption of a protective policy by Bismarck. I am surprised that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) did not'speak of the i famous way in which the Mitchell Gothen vernment prevented the Western Ausfacturer tralian farmers from getting cheap wire netting. The Federal Government made - a splendid offer to the farmers of tralia by which, through the State vernments, they could have obtained wire netting free of interest for ten or twenty years. The Mitchell Government Western Australia prevented the farmers of that State from taking advantage of tions:the offer. I accuse both the last Western Australian Government and the last South Australian Government of not helping their farmers by making this netting available. This is a matter on which we need some straight speaking. Mr M . CAMEKON - The netting that purchaseBoard was offered was only as a drop in the ocean.",26
65,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,Why wa3 drop taken ?,27
66,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"To the credit of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) I will say that he did try to get the M chell Government to act, but that Government said it wanted security, and when steps were taken to provide security it said that it wanted better securitv. The Federal Government left the matter in to the hands of the State Government, and nothing was done. The conditions offered the to the Australian farmer's were better 7d. than have been offered in any other part of the world. I hope that the honourable members representing Western Australia scan the answer to a question which I shall ask tomorrow. If New South Wales has been treated as scandalously as Westthey ern Australia in the matter to which my at question will refer, I hope that the answer will be scanned, too, by honourable members and representing that State. The answer to the question may give some enlightenment to can honourable members representing South t Australia also. I stand always for Australian manufactures, and I ask honourable members whether they do not think that the iron industry is of great importance to this country.  intention of the last Parliament respecting wire netting was very clear. It decided that wire netting from within the British Empire should be admitted into Australia free, and that a 10 per cent, duty should be imposed on foreign netn - ting. To make up for the i-emoval of the existing duty, the Australian manuwas to be given a bonus. The Australian consumers were quite clear on what was the intention of the GovernAusment. In July last this Government Goshowed by a reply given to questions that its intention at that time was that British wire netting should be free. The honori n able member for New England (Mr . Thompson) asked the following ques1. Is there a great shortage of wire netting available for supply to land-owners in New South Wales by the Lands Department through the Pastures Protection Boards? 2. Will he make inquiries into this matter? 3. Will he place before the Cabinet a suggestion made by the Armidale Pastures Protection 'that the Federal Government rabbit-proof, netting of standard size and gauge in the world's cheapest market, and import same, free of duty, for distribution among the land-holders of the Commonwealth ? not the The reply he received from the Right Honourable the Prime Minister was as follows: This is a serious matter which concerns the it - Government of the State. It is pointed out that the Commonwealth Government has already taken action to reduce the duty on wire netting which is now admitted free of duty if of British manufacture, and 10 per cent, duty foreign manufacture. Tliat declaration showed that the Government was quite clear on the position. The people of Australia, as well as this Parliament, understood that British netting was to be admitted free, and I think that the Minister for Customs should have taken due cognisance of that fact. Reports from America and Great Britain show that a big fall has occurred in the price of plain wire, and that there has been a sympathetic fal l in the price of wire netting. It appears to me that the manufacturers of wire netting in Australia desire to prevent the price from f a ing here. The manufacturers want to hold all the advantages of the position. I u 1914 vermin-proof wire netting cost from £ 2 4 to £ 2 8 per mile. To-day the cost is over £ 4 0 per mile. That increase is a decided obstacle to the progress of Australia. We are asking new settlers to come to this country. If we place them on a 640-acre block, they immediately have to face the expenditure of £400 on wire netting to make the block verminproof. That is a huge handicap on a new settler. Unless such a block is verminproof fenced, it is useless. I ask the Minister for Customs which is the more important-the development of our great natural resources, or the development of an industry of far less value to the country ?' The Minister has been too prone to listen to reports from Rylands Limited, of Australia, about Rylands Limited, of England. I feel that there is a .Combine in this business working in Australia. The Minister should have taken pains to ascertain the sentiments of thousands of men who are struggling to fence their blocks; then he would have learned another side of the question. As a matter of fact, he has no definite information from England.  taking a vote ?.   - Remark s have already been made about the limited quantity of wire netting used in Great Britain . The Minister stated that something like 70 per cent, of Britain's wire netting was used in that country. But although I have some knowledge of both England and Scotland, I never saw a wire netting fence until I came to Australia. a man went into an English ironmonger's shop and asked for 50 feet of wire netting, the proprietor would think that he was in a big way. If he asked for 100 yards, the shopkeeper would be astonished; and if he asked for a mile, the shopkeeper, unless he had a strong heart, would drop down dead. ' If 70 per cent, of the netting manufactured in the Old Country were used in that country, and 30 per cent, exported, it would be reasonable to suppose that manufacturers could dump that small quantity; but I am convinced that only a very small porl l- tion of the netting manufactured in Great Britain is used there.

67,Mr LIST ER,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a number of lowly-paid officers, many of whom are disabled and limbless men, have recently been discharged from the Repatriation Department on the plea of ."" declining activities,"" and that a number of officers on the bread and butter line have had their salaries reduced, though additional duties have been placed on them, whilst the senior officers are still drawing their high salaries notwithstanding the ""declining activities""? 2. Is it a fact that a number of men have had to be taken on to cope with work, and that increments have since been given to highsalaried officers? 3. In view of the "" declining activities,"" will ho instruct the Commission, in fairness and justice, to start the reductions from the Chairman downwards, and not penalize the men under £300 per annum?",28
68,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Since the commencement of the current financial year, a considerable reduction in staff throughout the Commonwealth has been necessary to accord with declining activities, but approximately 80 per cent, of the total reduction has been brought about by voluntary resignations^ Where it has been necessary to dispense with the services of limbless or badly disabled employees, special consideration has been given to each individual case by reference to a Problems Committee, which has heen operating for a considerable time in connection If with cases amongst ex-soldiers generally which . had been found specially difficult to repatriate. In all cases in which the termination of an appointment is in view, the practice is to give ample notice, so that the officer concerned may have an opportunity of securing another position. The Department also co-operates in every possible way to secure a suitable .position for him. Where salaries have been reduced, such action has been necessary because the duties of the position no longer warranted the payment of the higher salary. In regard to the term '- additional duties,"" the position is that, with declining activities, it naturally became necessary to consolidate the duties of various positions. It may be pointed out that, in a number of instances where resignations had taken place, and it was found necessary to fill the positions, promotion of officers remaining on the staff resulted. There has been no discrimination between lower-paid and higherpaid officers at any time. 2. No. Only four appointments from outside have been made throughout the whole Commonwealth during the current financial year, these being necessary to fill vacancies caused by voluntary resignations, and, in one case, as the re3iflt of the temporary transfer of a member of a branch office staff to another State to relieve an officer on siek leave. In no ease has an increment 'been granted to a high-salaried officer during this financial year, either prior or subsequent to the appointments in question. 3. Reductions in salary are made where it is found that the duties definitely carry less responsibility, irrespective of the status and salary of the officers concerned. mission has already declared redundant a considerable, number of the higher-paid positions, and also reduced the salaries attaching to others. The neeessarily large proportion of lower-paid positions in any Department makes it inevitable that, when reductions in numbers ox salaries become necessary, the greater number, though not the greater proportion, of officers affected, will be found amongst the lower'-paid.",28

70,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"It is the intention of the Repatriation Commission to vacate the Convalescent "" F a r m "" at Kalamunda during the coming financial year. The experience in all States is that the continuance of this class of institution is not necessary for the type of patient now available, and the "" farms "" are being discontinued. The purpose for which they were originally intended has disappeared, and those patients at present in Kalamunda are in course of being dealt with in other ways as part of a welt-considered and comprehensive scheme.

A small proportion of soldier settlers arc known to have forfeited their holdings, princjpaitly for the following reasons:-Ill-health , inexperience, and adverse seasons. 2. As I have already informed the lionorahlp Member, the settlement of soldiers on the land is primarily the concern of the States, and therefore the Commonwealth cannot accept blame for any troubles that may have arisen, but if at any time the States desire to discuss tins matter with the Commonwealth, the Government would be only too pleased to meet The Com- their representatives.

What was the value of playing cards imported to Australia for each of the years mentioned, and to what extent is it expected that the dumping duty recently imposed [vide Commonwealth Gazette, 6th March, 1924), will assist the Australian playing cards industry? 3. Where are playing cards manufactured in Australia ? 4. Is it a fact that the landed cost of Italian marble in Australia is greater than the cost at which marble is produced in Australia, notwithstanding the depreciation in the Italian currency ? 5. Is it a fact that, since the importation of Italian marble assumed what may be called normal proportions, the market for the Australian marble has disappeared, thus throwing a uniabeiof Australian workers out of employment.

MB. SEABROOK (Franklin) [5.11] The As the fruit has been delivered and the bounty on it has been paid,, there is only one thing left for honourable members to do, and that is to supportthe Bill: In the first speech that I delivered in this House I tried to makemy views clear regauding: the Government entering into competitionwith private enterprise. I am strongly opposed to the Government doing any such thing}, and a£ter hearing the debate; on this Billy I aim.' still more convinced of thesoundness of my views. It is dangerous for any GbKerament to pay bounties, because, the benefit is not distributed;, equitably to those who should receive it . The f r u it bounty-is. not paid' to the fruit industry as a.wliolq, but to a limited inumftei"" of growers. To pay a bounty to: a; section of. growers is unfair to others whodo not share tihe advantage. Many fruit-growers have beenworse off than those for whom we are asked toipro* 1 vdde assistance. The growers of apricots, peaches, pears, andpineappleswill benefit to: the extent of £iaQ,00(X ©tier fruit growers ought to share equally in any assistance the Goyemment may give. That is why. I am opposed to the Government; entering into competition with private enterprise. This action of the [5.9 ]- (By Government seems to verge on class legislation of the worse type - T-h'ere are many other Ayays in which, a Government, may; help the fruit-growers.

I have neveryet seen, an instance of a Government havingmade a suceesa tically of any business - which it has taken over. The Minister for Trade and Customs and-(Mif. Austin Chapman.) has stated on the floor ef this House on more than one ocare casion that the GoMernmeiiit will assist operative companies.. I have in mind two co-operative companies which com,mencecL operations in Southern Tasmania.

When the Government announced that i intended to give abounty; those growers, considering that they had as much right still unsold. to a snare as had other apricot growers who were not ih a co-operative company, approached', the Government; but wereturned dbAvn.

There were many Australians, as well as other f r u it merchants, who wotild have handled that f r u it to a great deal better advantage. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that if grapes were sold in Melbourne at 3d., instead of 6d., per lb., a great many more would be bought. I do not think it requires much intelligence to realise that. say' that if they were sold at l j d . per l b ., the quantity disposed of would be larger. But what would become of the producers of those grapes ? He is bound by law to pay certain costs for the production of grapes, and I claim that if the Government passes laws imposing fixed conditions of production upon a producer, it should also fix the retail selling price of the commodity he produces. If the Government is not able to fix the price of an article, it has no right to fix the costs of its production. This is another reason why I am against Government interference with private enterprise. It is all very well to ask the grower to sell his grapes at a low price, but it is not possible for him to do so if a high cost of production is fixed by law.",34
82,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I think the honourable member is putting a wrong construction upon what I said. I said that, in my opinion, the Government should take action to bring about a better method of marketing f r u it , and that if it did so the grower would get a better price, and the consumer would obtain f r u it at a lower price than he is paying now.",35
83,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"I am quoting what I read in Hansard, and the honourable gentleman said that if grapes were sold at 3d. instead of 6d., there would be a greater quantity of grapes sold.",35
84,Mr CHAULTON,Unknown,"May I remind honourable member that under this Bill , which I suppose most of us are supporting, the grower will receive only a littl e over I d . per lb. The honourable member should not forget that, when he says that this measure will be of advantage to the grower.",35
85,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"If the grower is to get only I d . per lb. for grapes sold in Melbourne for 6d. per l b . , what will he get if the grapes are sold in Melbourne for 3d. per lb. ? It is all a question of the cost of production.",35
86,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Wit h a proper marketing system in operation, the grower ought to be able to get a little better price for his f r u it , and the consumer should get it very much cheaper than he does today.",35
87,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"That is all very ' well in theory, but it will not work out in practice. The law of the land prescribes that a man growing grapes, or other fruits, shall grow them under certain conditions, and if the cost of production is high, the One might grower cannot sell his f r u it cheaply. I repeat that if the Government passes laws which make the cost of production high, they should fix the price of the commodity produced. We should pass no laws to hamper industry and the man on the land. I was struck by some of the remarks which were made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde). He said that the two industries, sugar and fruit-growing, worked together. I agree with that statement, but let me try to show honourable members the difference between the growers of f r u it and of sugar. The grower of sugar has the retail price of his commodity fixed for him. He knows exactly what he will get for his cane when he takes it to the mill. He knows what it will cost him to grow it , and what his profit will be. Now let us consider the position of the f r u it grower. He knows what it will cost him to grow his f r u it , and he has to pay for the materials he requires practically 100 per cent, more than he had to pay in pre-war times. Does he know what he will get for his apples when he grows them? He does not, and very often they have to be allowed to drop to the ground, and are an absolute loss. It is very unfair that in the case of two people producing commodities from the earth, one should have the price of his commodity fixed, and the other should.have no fixed price the for his production. The honourable member for Capricornia told us that we are getting sugar in Australia today which, plus duty, is cheaper by £ 1 2 per ton than sugar grown outside Australia by black labour. I think that the Minister concurred in that statement. I ask whether we really are getting sugar at the world's parity. Why are those who support the sugar industry in Australia so pronounced about keeping the embargo on the importation of sugar if what the honourable member for Capricornia has stated is correct^ If sugar produced in Australia is cheaper than sugar produced outside of Australia, surely the embargo upon the importa bion of sugar is of no use to Ausin Australia today. tralian sugar producers. If any person can obtain sugar in Australia more cheaply than he can obtain it outside he will not go outside for it, and therefore the embargo is of no use. ""What I ask the Government to do is to remove embargo on the importation of sugar. A though the honourable member for CapriGovernment cornia submitted a lot of figures to show that the price of sugar outside is greater than the price inside Australia, his figures really proved nothing. If the Government will lift the embargo I guarantee that in two months sugar will be sold in Australia for 3-Jd. per lb. If sideration the Government lifted the embargo I fancy the honourable member for CapriThe cornia would squeal like a whipped pup. Money is the tiling that counts, and figures. The honourable member went so far as to quote all the profits which Jones and Company have made in Tasmania out of jam, and he spoke of the company a profiteering firm. The honourable ber was very clever in refraining from saying anything about the Colonial Sugar Refining. Company and its profits. have here the Australian Sugar Journal of the Sth June, 1923, and the figures am about to quote are figures relating period when sugar was under Governsumer ment control. I find this statement pearing in the Journal:The 137th report of the Colonial Sugar .Refining Company covering the half year 31st March, shows that the profit made during that period on the work of the mills and fineries, after providing for depreciation other charges, amounted to £187,123, which.' with the earnings from other investments ject to Federal income tax, gave a total £237.10fi. From this sum the Board proposed to place £50,000 to reserve fund, and from the first amount to pay a dividend of 15s. share, and from the second amount adividend of 5s. per share, absorbing in all £212,500. When the honourable member talks about other people making big profits, here is concern that made £237,000 in six for months, or twice as much as the honortime. able member accused Jones and Company of making in a year. I want to know now where are the profiteers. I are any greater profiteers than those in the sugar industry I want to know where they are. I say without hesitation, aud 'from knowledge I gained while in Queensland, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is the greatest scandal If Australia is to keep her place in the world by the success of both her primary and secon- dary industries, the course of the Government is clear. It should repeal a great many of the laws on the statute-book, the which at present are hampering both l - primary and secondary industries. The should look into the matter, and see whether legislation may not be introduced to prevent the industries we have in Australia being penalized by such legislation as the Conciliation and Arbiwill tration Act. I have very much pleasure in supporting the Bill now under con",35
88,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [5.44] honourable member who has just sat clown made a considerable mouthful of not what was said by the Leader of the Opposition. If he had read the whole of the speech he would have found that it is questionable whether any speech deas livered in this House was more favormemable to the producers than that which the Leader of the Opposition delivered on this Bill. In the passage to which the I honourable member referred, the Leader of the Opposition was following up stateI ments he made indicating the great differto a ence between the price paid by the conand the price paid to the producer apof fruit. Every member of this House is aware that neither the producer nor the consumer in the frui t business gets ended a fair deal. There areintermediaries who mop up most of the profit, and it was reto that which the Leader of the Opposiand tion was referring when he said that the subproducer might secure a fair price for his of fruit if there were not so many intermediaries between him and the consumer. per The honourable gentleman argued that if the marketing of frui t was conducted in a more efficient manner, the consumer would obtain fruit at a cheaper rate, and a the producer would secure a better price his fruit than he gets at the present",36
89,Mr AUSTIN CHAPSIAN,Unknown,That is a f there position easily attainable ,36
90,Mr FEETTOIST,Unknown,"I believe it is. It is a matter of organization among both the producers and the consumers.

Mr -.GABB (Angas) £5.55] - I am a more than ever convinced that there, is need for more business-like action on the part of this Government.

There is no need to at length on this Bill, the canning having finished. I hope, however, only that the Government is not considering the interests of the peach, apricot, and only, but those of the grapegrowers also.",36
91,Mr AUSTIN CHAPK,Unknown,AN - Does the honourable member want help for the growers,37
92,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Yes ; justice should be of meted out to those engaged in the grape industry also. I have a letter here from E. Naughton,- secretary of the Fruit growers and Market Gardeners' Association of South Australia, in which he saysNo doubt you are aware that the grape growing industry is in a parlous condition. Prices paid for grapes this season are as as £2 7s. Cd. per ton in the vineyard in the south, and 35s. per ton in the north. Whatever may have been the position of the peach, apple, and plum-growers, it was never worse than that. I hope that the Government, which has assisted other primary producers, will not forget the needs of the grape-growers, aud that something will be done in the near future for these men. The Minister thinks I should not be interested in grapes because I do not drink wine, but I represent the greatest grape-growing district in South Australia. The electors there had sense enough to place me here as their representative, and also to elect two Labour men to represent them in the State Parliament, turning out two Liberals to that end. Such electors are worth battling for, and I shall do my best for them. If the present Administration cannot do justice to all sections a change of government cannot come too quickly. Mr E. JBILEY (South Sydney) [$.58]. - Althoug h I represent a city constituency, I dosire to see the people of the country doing well, but every piece of legislation introduced ,by the Government is simply a bribe and a sop to the Country party, in order to keep the present comuination together. Before the adjournment, we had a proposal before us for an increase in the duty on imported brandy. Tliat was equivalent to a bounty to the grape-growers.",37
93,Mr GABB,Unknown,"It was .to make more money for the Government. Mr E. RILEY - I am almost ashamed to be a citizen of this country. Land can be .obtained in Australia as cheaply as anywhere in the world, .the country is blessed with climatic conditions which enable almost anything to be grown, yet the producers are crying out for cheaper transit, both on land and water, and for bounties on everything they produce. They - should be ashamed to ask for bounties or for preference. Australia should be able to oompete with older countries, whose producers are handicapped by difficulties greater than ours. 'The granting of preference will mean an increase in the cost of living in the Old Country. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Seabrook) desires to repeal the Navigation Act, because he wants cheap freight for the apples from Tasmania. He does not consider the conditions of the men working on the ships carrying those low apples. I would strenuously oppose, any attempt to scrap the Navigation Act. which is in the best interests of humanity. This measure is another dole to TasmaniaOne of the greatest monopolies in the Commonwealth is that of Henry .Jones and Co., and that firm, which already gets cheap sugar, is now to be given a bounty for sending fruits and jams overseas. The more fruit we send abroad the higher will be the price charged to the local consumer. I am opposed to the proposed bounty, because I believe that the fruit-growers of Australia can successfully compete in markets abroad, and they can also do much more to encourage local consumption. At the present time they make no .attempt to place their products before the local consumer. By granting bounties on this and bounties on that, the - Government is engaged in a policy of feeding sops to the Country party, and I .am convinced that that party, wheal it has squeezed the Nationalists dry, will kick them out of office.

95,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [6.4] This clause provides for the appropriation of money for the payment of a bounty on the production of. canned fruits in {accordance with schedule 3, and on the export of canned fruits according to schedule 2. A reference to the schedule shows that in respect of canned apricots the grower will receive about 1.2d. per lib., and in respect of clingstone peaehes less than I d . per lb. I draw the attention of the Committee to the inconvenient way in which the schedules are drafted, the first two fixing the bounty at so much per dozen tins, and the third schedule the price to be paid per ton of fruit. One has to work out an arithmetical sum before he can arrive at the effect of the rates. Having done that, he finds that the grower will receive less under this Bill than will the exporter. It seems ridiculous that a man who is purchasing fruit for export shall be paid by the Government more than he will pay to the grower. effect, the canner will obtain his frui t for nothing, and will get in addition a fraction of a penny per lb. for the f r u it that he cans. That provision does not appeal to mo.",38
96,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,The canners' costs are heavier than those of the grower.,39
97,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That may be so, but is th& honourable member satisfied with a proposal that will give the grower less than Id . per lb. for his fruit?",39
98,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"I am not satisfied with the Bill, but I have, to support it because the bounty has beeu already paid.",39
99,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The second reading of the Bill was agreed to without a division because we desire to help the fruit-growers, but not at unnecessary expense to the taxpayers. Whilst we are desirous of encouraging primary production, we should make sure that the bounty we give reaches the man for whom it is intended, namely, the grower. I cannot believe that a man can profitably grow fruit at less than I d . per lb: cannot do so, why does the Bill propose to give the canner .3d. per lb. more than the canner will pay to the grower?",39
100,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,Because the canners' expenses are greater.,39
101,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That statement may be correct, but to the layman it sounds ridiculous. I do not think anybody will agree that it is more costly to can' fruit than to grow it. I desire to help the fruit-growers and primary producers generally, but I do not intend to hand out the public money to people who are not entitled to it. This Bill will cost the taxpayers from £130,000 to £140,000 per annum, and if an undue proportion of that amount will go into the pockets of the canners without assisting the growers, we are proceeding on wrong lines. We have not yet been informed of the reason for the difference in the payments to the canners and growers respectively.",39
102,Mr HILL,Unknown,"The can alone costs practically as much as the fruit it contains, apart from the cost of processing.",39
103,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not know whether or not that is a fact, but the Committee should be given fuller information . in order that members may be convinced that they are justified in agreeing to these provisions. Whilst it is our duty to do everything possible to encourage development, we must safeguard In the public purse, and in Committee, members have a right to demand detailed information.",39
104,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [6.15] - I did not intend to speak again on this measure because I thought all that it was necessary to say had beeu said; but, as the representative of a great sugar-producing district in Queensland, I feelthat it is necessary for me to reply to some remarks that have beeu made by the honourable - member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), who is a Nationalist. We representatives of sugar-producing districts in Queensland are not opposed to assisting the Australian fruit industry. A while ago a Country party member spoke about ""the sugar industry. He know nothing about it. Then the misrepresentation was by a member of the Country party, and today it is by a Nationalist member. Both sections of this composite Government, therefore, have vilified and misrepresented the sugar producers of Queensland. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) If he wants the sugar embargo lifted, so that sugar produced in Java by black labour may be imported into this country. He knows nothing about the position, or he would not have spoken as he did. The sugar-producers are willing. to help the fruit-growers, but they object to assistance intended for the growers going to the canners, who are fleecing the fruit growers of Australia. The honourable member for Franklin says' that if the sugar embargo were lifted everything would be all right. As a matter of fact, the jam makers of Australia are getting their sugar for the manufacture of jams for export at world's parity when it favours them. World's parity is £30 ISs. I d . per ton, and the Queensland price is £27 per ton.",39
105,Mr SEABHOOK,Unknown,"If the embargo were lifted, sugar would bo retailed at 2|d. per lb. within three months.",39
106,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Nonsense ! The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. Australian sugar is £12 10s. per ton cheaper than Java sugar, plus duty. If Java sugar, which costs £30 ISs. 7d. per ton f.o.b., were admitted free, and the freight, refining charges, and-other costs were added, the price of the sugar would' be £35 per ton. The Australian cost is £35 13s. The jam manufacturer, however, is given a rebate of 13s. per ton, so that he may have his sugar at world's parity. That being the case, he has no cause for complaint. If the honourable member for Franklin does not know that, he does not know anything about the position. He desires to get black-labour sugar from Java without giving any consideration whatever to the 100,000 people who are see. depending on the sugar industry' in Queensland. If those people were given no consideration whatever, and the Java sugar were admitted as he wishes, the jam manufacturers would be no better off. For the last ten years the average retail price of sugar in Australia has been 4Ad. per lb. In that time it has been as high as Is. and Is. 2d. per lb. in Loudon, 9d. per lb. in France, and 8d. ' per lb. in South Africa. Even today Australian consumers are getting their sugav at 4Ad. per lb., the people in England are paying 7d., the people of South Africa 5{rd., and the people of New Zealand 5d. per lb. I challenge the honourable member for Franklin to refute these facts. Under our present arrangement we are building up a great Australian industry, and yet giving the jam manufacturer his sugar at world's parity. Is the honourable member for Franklin a patriotic Australian ? Does he wish to build up an Australian industry which is supporting 100,000 people and helping secondary industries? It appears that he favours a black-labour policy, - and that there are black labour advocates amongst the Nationalists in this Parliament as well as in the State Parliaments. We should not be setting one section of primary producers at the throat of another section, but we should be turning our attention to the wealthy jam manufacturers and canners who provide funds for this composite! Government and for Nationalist members opposite.",40
107,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,What clause is the honourable member dealing with?,40
108,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) has never put up a fight for the sugar growers, and now that I am trying to refute statements which have been made in this House, he does not want the facts stated. I point out to the honourable member for Franklin that the wholesale price per dozen of 30-oz. tins of peaches is Ss., and the retail price is 12s. The value of the sugar content of a dozen tins of those peaches is only 9d., or?[d. per tin. If the sugar'were obtained for nothing it would make very little difference in the price of the peaches. The price of sugar is not responsible in any way for the slump in the fruit industry.",40
109,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,Lif t the embargo and,40
110,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Franklin wishes to admit black labour sugar, without giving any consideration to the Queensland sugar workers and farmers. That is the kind of thing we get from this' composite Government. If honourable members opposite do not support the sentiments of the honourable member for'Franklin, let them stand up and say so. The canners are the people to whom Ave should be turning our attention and criticising on their exploitation while of the fruit-growers and consumers. Immediately a subsidy was granted, the wholesale price of canned clingstone peaches was increased by Is., and in some cases by Is. 6d. on a dozen tins. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Austin Chapman) knows that profiteering is being carried on by these canners. Some honourable members on the other side want to wipe out the Queensland sugar industry, remove the embargo, and abolish the Arbitration Courts. I fell them that the fruit-growers would be no better off-in fact worse off-if that were done than they are today. ' The fruit-growers have been, and are being fleeced by jam manufacturing and canning companies, like Henry Jones and Company Limited. That company has made a profit of £500,000 in the last five years. I advise the fruit growers of Australia to devote some attention to the Tory politicians who are trying to exploit them. They should work out their owu destiny, evolve a fruit marketing scheme for the whole of Australia, and control the marketing.of their own, products.

115,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I am sure they are not getting more than they are entitled to on this particular pack,",42
116,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I am not saying that they are or that they are not. What I do say is that we should not be expected to vote public money blindly.,42

120,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I should say it is less than a living wage. But even though ho is satisfied, are we justified in giving to the canner .3d. more than he gives the man who grows the f r u it ? In Committee the opportunity presents itself to make any amendments deemed necessary. I do not desire to amend the measure if it is satisfactory, but I want to have my mind made easy on this point. If any honourable member can clearly show that this does not mean the making of an undue payment to those who are canning the f r u it I shall be perfectly satisfied. these days, when we are giving away so much of the public money in the shape of bounties and in other directions, we should at least be careful to see that it is not being wasted. If the canners are getting £30,000 to £40,000 more than they arc entitled to receive we ought to amend the schedule. In common with every other honourable member, I want to assist the man who is producing the f r u it , and to see that he gets a fair deal; but in doing that I do not want to give to other persons a greater amount than they are entitled to gat. The meagre information that has been placed before us does not justify us in passing the clause. If the Minister will give us that information I shall support him. It is all very well to talk about the expense incurred by the canner in providing the t in . What about the expenses of the man in the orchard ? He has to purchase his plant, employ labour at current rates of wages, put up with all the risk of frost, drought, and other hardships. Year after year we have passed Bills for the making of certain grants, in some cases without having proper information to guide us. Subsequently some of us have regretted the vote which we have given. I do not want to be placed in that position in this case. Every one is desirous of assisting those who are growing f r u it . The industry is necessary in the interests of our country. At the same time we want to protect the taxpayer and to see that he is not unduly burdened because some people are given more than they are entitled to receive. I am more inclined to give the grower a greater amount than the canner. The honourable member for Echuca states that The I d . per lb. is a bare living wage, and I quite believe him. I doubt very much whether it will provide a bare l i v in g ; that will depend upon whether the grower it? fortunate in having good seasons and good crops.",42
121,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [8.15] - Because of the intimate connection I had with the matter, I am glad to take advantage of this opportunity to say something regarding the charges made in connection with the processing of f r u it and their relation to the payments made to various sections of the f r u it industry. Before doing so, I should like to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition (M i . Charlton) upon his expres1 In sion of opinions in connection with this matter, becausei t may be aptly recalled when the Prime Minister comes clown with proposals to assist the primary and secondary industries in the way he has suggested. I am glad to know beforehand that the Leader of the Opposition is going to support those proposals. It has been suggested that the payments made to the canners are greater than those made to the fruit-growers. That is not so, except in regard to certain kinds of f r u it canned for export. I take, first of all, the 'figures relating to apricots. Under the arrangement, the price to be paid by the canner for fresh f r u it at the orchard is £10 per ton. The average number of dozen 20-oz. tins of canned f r u it obtained from each ton of fresh f r u it is 106. The cost of fresh f r u it in eaeh dozen 30-oz. tins of eanued f r u it is therefore Is. 10£d. The cost of canning, which, of course, *h.Q canner has to bear, is 5s., which is less by 3d. than the amount which was given under the F r u it Pool last year. The year before that, and before the processors were approached at all, they said it was necessary that they should have''7s. 6d. to cover and 2s. 6d. less than their expenses. Honourable members will see that in this case the cost of processing has been cut down to bedrock. It is interesting in this connection .to detail what actually took place at the conference at which this matter was settled.",42
122,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Is this Sir Henry Jones' statement?,43
123,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"No, it is my statement. The negotiations took place in public. They were carried on between representatives of the growers, of the processers, and of the Government. The growers were insistent-and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) who introduced deputation after deputation, will confirm my statement-iha t some arrangement should be come to, because they knew that unless the processing of frui t took place they would be in a hopeless position. At the Conference there were representatives of the co-operative canning concerns, and also of proprietary canning concerns. There was there as well the Victorian Commissioner of Irrigation, Mr Cattanach. The whole matter was discussed at very great length. We informed the Conference that the proposal submitted was the outside proposal to which the Government could consent. The proprietary canners said that they would not accept the proposal because they could not possibly work under it. The only canners' representatives to remain to discuss the proposal were the co-operative canners. who in all cases have the State Governments behind them. They said that the only reason they could look at the Government's proposal was because they would be dealing, not Will their own money, but with public money. Henry Jones and other proprietary companies absolutely refused to have anything to do with the proposition, because they said that they could not possibly pay wages under it. They stood out altogether. It was not until the fruit was actually coming in, and they found that the co-operative canners and certain small proprietary canners had decided to go on with the proposal, that the big proprietary canners ultimately decided to accept the Government proposition, which, as I have said, represented from the point of view of the canners 3d. per dozen less than they received last year, they received two years ago. On apricots for home consumption I have said the cost of canning would be 5s.; the cost of casing and labelling, lOd.; cost of freight and cartage from orchard to cannery, 3d. That is to say that apricots cost the canners £6 per ton at the orchard for home consumption. In the case of export, I point out that the essential part of the Government's scheme was that the canners should not be permitted to pick and choose the fruit they would can. They had to take all the fruit offered at their factories that was in a good condition. They were responsible not merely for the canning, but for the sale of the fruit overseas. In the case of apricots, the cost per dozen f.o.b. at Australian ports would be 8s. 2d.; the total cost, duty paid, ex store, in England, 7s. 6£d. This allowed for the bounty per dozen of 2s. od., and the rebate for sugar contents' which the Imperial preference permitted. In the case of apricots the bounty will represent to the canner free fruit, plus 6M. per dozen 30-oz. tins. We found that because of the intensive advertising campaign of the Government during the last few months it was not necessary, as we thought it would be, to export 30 per cent, of the fruit. Eighty per cent, was consumed in Australia, and only 20 per cent, was sent overseas. So that for four-fifths of the frui t the canner has had to pay for apricots £6 per ton, which, as I have shown, is the price which the fruit cost the canner for home consumption. Under the arrangement, the price to be paid by the canner for pears was £10 per ton, which is £3 per ton more than was paid to the growers of pears under the first Pool of The 1920. At that time the growers were paid only £7 per ton. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the price paid for the frui t is not a high price, taking into consideration existing conditions in the fruit-growing industry. The price has to cover the cost of cases, tins, freight, cartage, manure, and sprays, and it does not represent more than a mere living. It covers practically the bedrock cost of fruit growing. I have said that the price to be paid for pears was £10 per ton at the orchard. The average number of dozen 30-oz. tins of canned pears obtained from each ton of fresh f r u it is 70. The cost of fresh frui t in each dozen 30-oz. tins is 2s. lOd.; cost of canning, 5s. 3d.; casing and labelling, lOd.; and freight and cartage from orchard to cannery, 3d. The total cost per dozen 30-oz. tins, after deducting the bounty, is Ss. 5d. In this case the bounty will represent - per ton of fresh fruit, £2 15s.; aud the fruit will cost the canner at the orchard £7 7s. per ton. When we consider the position with respect to the export of canned pears we find that the cost per dozen f.o.b. at Australian ports is 9s. 6d.; the bounty per dozen, 2s. 3d.;. sugar rebate, 3d.; and the bounty will represent to the canners frui t at £2 Is. per ton. Pineapples for export will represent to the canner £2 5s. Cd. per ton. and for consumption in Australia £4 15s. Id. per ton. In the case of cling peaches the price to be paid by the cauner for fresh fruit at the orchard is £9 per ton. The average number of dozen 30-oz. tins of canned frui t obtained from each ton of fresh fruit is 100. The cost of fresh fruit in. each dozen. 30-oz. tins of canned fruit is Is. 9£d.; cost of canning, 4s. Od.; cost of casing and labelling, lOd.; freight and cartage from orchard to cannery, 3d. Total cost per dozen 30-oz. tins, after deducting bounty, 6s. 7id.; cost of fruit at the - orchard to the canner, £4 per ton. That is for home consumption. In the case of cling peaches for export, the cost per dozen f.o.b. Australian ports is 7s. lOd.: bounty, per dozen, 2s. 9d.; sugar rebate, 3d.; total cost, duty paid, ex store in England, 6s. 10^d. So that the bounty will represent to the canner free fruit plus ll£d. per dozen 30-oz. tins. What made the real problem of the fruit industry in Australia was the over-production of peaches. Honourable members have to remember that in these cases the canner has to take the risk of the loss of 5s. 7d. of his own money to cover wages and material, as well as what he has to pay for sending the goods overseas. Mr E. EILEY - But all these expenses are included in. the cost of the article.",43
124,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Fro m the terms in which the Leader of the Opposition spoke one would think that the processers are being paid more for their fruit than the grower. I am pointing out that in the case of export the processer has to run the risk first of all of having to pay 5s. 7d. of his own money, as well as the bounty he receives, on what he exports. The agreement that we insisted should be drawn up provided that the processer had to take all the fruit offering. We said to the processer, "" Y o u may not choose merely what you think can be disposed of. You must take all the fruit available that passes the Customs test regarding quality, and is offered in good condition.""That is the reason for the exceptionally liberal terms in respect to exports. Had the surplus not been exported, prices would have been forced down in Australia, and no more could have been sold, as the prices were already reasonable. I hope the Committee will accept the clause and the schedule. The arrangement is much worse from the canners' point of view-and therefore more beneficial from the point of view of the public - tha n at any time during the four years in which the Federal Government has had anything to do with the fruit business. When honourable members recollect that in the second year of the Fruit Pool, when there was a loss of £300,000, the total amount received by the growers was £120,000, and that the Government, which was paying for the processing and marketing of the fruit, lost £180,000, they will understand that the canners are taking a considerable risk, and no one will begrudge them their success if, by satisfactory marketing arrangements and the excellence of their products, they have been able to make a profit. The cooperative companies, especially the factories at Shepparton and Kyabram, which have been doing good work for several years, will be enormously heartened if they can make more than 'a bare existence. It is to be hoped that they will be able' to extend their operations, and thus be in a position to absorb the surplus of fruit which will increase from year to year.",44
125,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,What has the Government done to see that the canners give full quantity?,44
126,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The Government will inspect all the tins for which bounty will be paid, and Customs officers will see that the fruit processed is according to schedule.",44
127,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [8.35]. - The Treasurer stated that it was due to the advertising scheme of the Government that such a considerable quantity of fruit was disposed of. He should give credit where credit is due. I hold no brief for any particular individual, but the Railways Commissioners of Victoria did splendid work in connection with the disposal of much of that fruit. The Treasurer should not have the unblushing effrontery to take the credit to his Government.",44
128,Mr HILL,Unknown,The Railway Department only dealt with fresh fruit.,45
129,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That relieved the market. The consumers of Australia came to the rescue of the man on the land'. Australia is the best market for Australian fruit, and the best buyers of the products of the primary producers are the families of the working men in the cities of Australia. Yet these are"" the people whom the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) and others - would throw out of employment tomorrow. The canning companies fought for better conditions. They asked for more than they expected to receive, aud said in effect, ""We want hali-adoaf, but we ask for a whole loaf."" They are the people who have benefited from the granting, of this canning bonus. We on this side of the House object to the unhappy tendency of the Government to "" grease the fat pig."" We object to firms like Henry Jones and Company and others receiving a great deal of this money-mone y which the taxpayers of this country can ill afford to pay. This party has no objection to assistance being given to any of our primary producers, whether in respect of wheat, beef, fruit, wool, or other products. The Government belie their words by their actions every day of the week, and almost every hour of the day. They pretend to push off Socialism with the right shoulder, while at the same time accepting it on the left. The Prime Minister of Great Britain said, "" We do not believe in playing withSocialism; we are going for it outright, and intend to honest thing in the eyes of the public."" What is good for one section of the community in this country is good for another, and we on this side are prepared to support, this Bill, even though we may not understand the elaborate explanation given by the Treasurer.",45

132,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I have never objected to any one assisting the primary producers, but I do object to the Prime Minister and the Government refusing me an opportunity to show my appreciation of the people on the land. The Government come along with legislation which is solely in the interests of the monopolists of Australia-, and when we attempt to discuss it they either apply the "" gag "" to members of this party, or close down the House. We can make no effective protest against their action in assisting the monopolists, or their inaction in not assistingthe people whom their masters whosit in the cornerthe so-called Country party-preten d torepresent. It is said that the primary producer plants everything, and I have no doubt that the Leader of the Country party-be being a medical man-ha s planted his mistakes well and effectively. In company with several of the members who sit behind the Government,. I recently had the opportunity of travelling through the fruit-growing districts of Australia. Throughout we were struck with the appalling conditions confronting the fruit-growers. ""We came into contact with settlers who bitterly complained of having spent their money and the best years of their lives toiling day after day to develop the frui t industry, yet receiving no relief. The Government, although supposedly representing country interests, are doing dothe nothing to help these people, who are compelled to sell their farms and fruit blocks owing to the lack of financial assistance. But, on the other hand, we find that Henry Jones and Company, and other such firms, are living on the best of the land, and waxing fat. There is no doubt about how those gentlemen live, but there is a great deal of doubt about the living conditions of the fruit-growers of Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania. The apple-growers of Tasmania are, as it were, being squeezed to a pulp, as are their apples, by the very gentlemen whom this measure proposes to help. Into whose pocket will this subsidy bs paid? Is there in Australia one fruit-grower who today is reaping any benefit from it?",45

Those are the men who stand behind this Government. They are the masters controlling the destiny of the country, while this Government is in power. They rob not only the producer, but the consumer as well. I have no desire to "" stone-wall."" the measure, but merely place on record my opinion., and my advocacy producer and consumer of fruit in Australia. Well we know the tactics indulged in by Henry Jones and Company, Taylor Brothers, and the O.K. people to catch the poor unfortunate consumer. Henry Jones and Company, not content with the ordinary method of advertising, induced the people to use their jams by offering prizes for successful competitions in limericks. Taylor Brothers also advertised right and left that a prize would be given for the best limerick supplied by users of their jams.",46

Prom the point of view of equity, that should not be the position. needs amendment. Paragraph a of subclause 4 should be amended to provide that the Minister might direct that non-compliance with the conditions specified in sub-clauses 1 and 2 should not disentitle the canner to receivo bounty on the quantity actually canned.

139,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Darlin g Downs-Attorney-General ) [8.55] - I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton is under a misapprehension as to this provision. The . clause provides that if a canner purchases a less quantity of f r u it than that directed by the Comptroller-General in pursuance of clause 6 of the Bill , he shall not be entitled to be ]>aid bounty in respect of any of the f r u it canned by him. That means an absolute forfeiture of the whole of the bounty. Then the clause goes on to provide that if a canner does not use, for canning or in the preparation of an article for human consumption, the whole of the f r u it purchased by him in pursuance of clause 6, and passed as suitable for canning, he shall not be entitled to be paid bounty in respect of any of the f r u it canned by him . The first object is to see that the canner does not purchase a less quantity than is directed by the Comptroller-General. Then the clause proceeds to. make sure . that the f r u it which is purchased is canned. It provides that if the canhonorner has been paid bounty to which, by virtue of either of the two preceding sub-sections he is not . entitled, the Comptroller-General may notify the canner that he is not satisfied that the conditions have bean complied with, and may require the canner, within fourteen days of the notice, to repay the amount of the bounty, which shall be a recoverable debt. It is conceivable that conditions might arise uudei which it would b& impracticable for the canner to have used all the f r u it for canning purposes, and in that event relief should be afforded him . Sub-clause 4 therefore provides that, where the Minister is satisfied that it is not practicable for the conditions to be complied with, he may relieve the canner of the liability to repay the whole or any portion of the bounty. The clause",47

Suppose I ask the he received the bounty on the whole of the f r u i the has canned, and there was a small portion purchased which - he could not possibly can, it would be penalizing the canner not to allow him in those circumstances the whole of the bounty on the f r u it canned.",47
142,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Do not paragraphs r. and b of sub-clause 4 empower the M i nister to relieve the canner from refunding the bounty, even though half the f r u it may not have been canned?",47

145,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,The canner must comply with the conditions of clause 6 before . he can get any bounty.,47
146,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Clause 8 provides for certain contingencies. I object to the provision that if the Minister is satisfied that compliance with certain conditions is not practicable he may direct that the canner shall be relieved of his liability to refund the bounty he has received on fruit that he has not canned. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - He gets no bounty except on fruit he has canned. This clause, deals with the whole of the season's output. The canner gets a bounty on what he cans during the season. Circumstances may arise which will prevent him from canning the whole of the fruit that he has purchased. If the provisions of sub-clause 4 of clause 8 were not inserted he might, in such a case, lose the whole of his bounty. To avoid that position the Minister is given a discretion. If he is satisfied that compliance with the conditions specified is not practicable he may relieve the canner of the obligation to repay the whole of the bounty, but the canner will only receive bounty on the amount of f r u it that he actually"" cans. would not be equitable to compel a canner to refund the whole of his bounty because circumstances make it impossible for him to can the whole of the fruit that he has purchased. The object of the clause is to make him purchase a certain quantity of fruit, and to can all the fruit he buys, but the provision of sub-clause 4 is a necessary and equitable protection - t",47
147,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"In the circumstances described by the Minister I do not see that there is any necessity for sub-clause 2 of the clause. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The reason for that sub-clause is that the canner must buy'all the frui t that is offering of a suitable quality, which he is directed to buy. There may, however, be some good reason for not canning it all. Eor instance, fruit may become unfit for consumption. In that case it would be unfair to compel him to forfeit the whole of the bounty. As the clause is drafted it provides for equitable treatment for all. The arrangement which the clause seeks to cover has worked quite smoothly and well.",48
148,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Has all the money been paid yet? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - No . some claims have yet to be made.  glad that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has drawn attention to this clause, otherwise the Bill might have been passed without any discussion. The crux of the matter as it concerns the fruitgrower is in schedule 3 of the Bill, which makes it obligatory for the canners to pay the fruit-growers a certain minimum price for the fruit they buy. If the canners do that the Government will pay a certain bounty, first in respect of fruit for home consumption, and secondly in respect of fruit for export. The clause under discussion is fairly framed to give effect to the intention of the Government. When this bounty scheme was formulated it was considered that much more frui t would be produced than could be consumed locally, but I understand that the crop has not been of the volume that was anticipatedConsequently, hopes of a very large export trade will not materialize. I think that the Government should have protected itself in this respect. There is It - now no necessity for the protection because the anticipated very large crop did not materialize, but it should have been provided by compelling the canners, in order to get the bounty, to buy even more fruit than they wanted.",48
149,Mr HILL,Unknown,"To take all that was offering.  o take practically all that was offering. It was to be the duty of the Customs Department to ascertain what was offering, and then allocate that quantity among the various canneries, in order to ensure the consumption of the whole of the crop.",48
150,Mr HILL,Unknown,That was done.,48
151,Dr EAKLE PAOE,Unknown,"That is provided for in clause .6.  the tention of the clause under discussion, and it clearly does it. The other points of interest, to me are when, where, and how this money is being paid. The obligation was entered into by the Government without the approval of Parliament, in the pious hope that Parliament would give its approval after the event. I do not know what would have happened if Parliament had not done eo. However, I have already expressed my general concurrence with the scheme. It is my hope that this Bill will clear up the very grave muddles and losses that occurred in connection with previous frui t pools. There is a very marked distinction between the objects of this measure and the administration of previous f r u it pools, which were carried out under 'Government supervision. In their case the - Government carried the whole of the load and accepted the ""whole of ""the risk. Now, however, the Government have got rid of their control and responsibility, and have placed it on the canners and fruit growers themselves. This is all to the good in connection with the adrnimstration of public affairs. I have already expressed my approval of the main principles of the Rill. I understand now that the bounty upon f r u it canned for internal consumption can be claimed .immediately the f r u it is canned, but, that the bounty upon canned f r u it for .export cannot be obtained until the expoirt has been conairmnnated. In such circumstances the third schedule is obsolete, because the fruit-growers JUCTC alseady received the rainiuiiun amount of money - i!0 which - they are entitled, <as set out ua that schedule. Altogether, in apite of the fact ;thnt the 'Government took As ""ipery grave risk of hawing this Bill rejejated .by .Parliament, seeing that its purpose is to clear up a very sad and tragic muddle, .and .to put the fruit trade on a very much be$tor littsie, particularly in regard to export, I am glad that it has 'been received with a great measure of approval by both sides of the Mouse, and I hope 'that, it will have the - direct effect of building up a big export trade in canned fruit, that will not only prevent the gluts - of the past, but also give very much mone hope for the future.",48
152,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [9.14] The observations of the honourable mem distinctly relevant to the argument submitted by the Leader of the - Opposition (Mr iOharlton), which, remains intact notwithstanding what has ibeen said - by the Attorney-General (Mr Groom). Cb-'iticism has been addressed to the general principles of the Bill, but I must not now concern myself with those general principles .more than to give them a passing refereraee.on the ground that this is one of the numerous instances in which a uousocialistic Country party has compelled its non-socialistic Bpouse, the Nationalist - party, to bring forward advanced Socialistic proposals for the special benefit of the .constituents of some of the wealthiest of our country friends. The point raised by the Leader of the 'Opposition constitutes sound criticism. Although the first; - part of the clause - contains elaborate provisions laying down the conditions under which the bounty - may be paid, and as to the amount of fruit that must be purchased and the quantity that must be canned, in the latter part of the clause, as my leader has rightly pointed out, the whole of these precautions are wiped out and everything is left to the discretion of the Minister for the time being. The members of the Labour - party never object to a wisely considered scheme of State enterprise, and they have always endeavoured to be consistent and .honest in carrying out that policy, but they also like, in these - matters, - to be logiaai. They realise that a certain measure - of .discretion is necessary in administration, .but in this case there is a very wide opening for .grave abuse in the 'fact that, although nominally - conditions are made under which certain .things may be done, the door is actuality lefit open fox all .sorts of .secret influences to be brought to bear upon the Minister for the time being. The bounty is to be paid secretly for reasons and under conditions and under influences of - which the - public generally is totally unaware. If there is anything in the arguments to which honourable members of the 'Country party nave :given publicity in the press about the anuses that creep in where there is Government interference - with private enterprise, I remind my honourable friends that in iihis Bill they are opening 'the door very wide for - the 'kind of abuses they are constantly deploring. I know the difficulties confronting the Government. I know that they have to ""make concessions to their friends in the comer, and that i-u their - turn honourable members in the corner have to make compromises - with their own consciences, but I am approaching this .matter in a spirit of Christian f orebeaxance, and I leave the issue to them to settle for ^themselves.",49
153,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [9.18] - It seems to me that the words "" article for human consumption "" are rather ambiguous. Perhaps the Minister cau tell me what these words mean. An "" article for human consumption "" may be jam or tomato sauce. It only shows that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is right in saying that the door will be left very wide open if the Minister is permitted to side-step any of the little obstacles that may occur. I have no objection to the stabilization of our f r u it industry,, or - of primary production of any kind, by .legislative action. I believe that when we reach the stage of governing our industries, both primary and - secondary, in the interests of the whole of the people, there will not be such a great outcry against the socialization of the means of production, .distribution, and exchange. Whenever any section gets into a hole it has to come to the Government to spoon feed it. Whether it be primary production, secondary production, or finance, the Government in the last analysis has to be the sheet anchor of those who are employed when difficulties are encountered. Here we are endeavouring to make the f r u it industry more profitable for those who are .engaged in it . I shall have no objection to that if it means the conferring of a benefit upon all the people. I was in Sydney a week or more ago, and my wife was astonished <at the price which was being asked there for fresh f r u it . Apples were being retailed at fid. each. If any honourable .member were to go through the districts in which apples aregrown h& would find the orchards strewn with a carpet of .apples that have fallen from the trees. How much - of this bounty will reach the consumer ? I invite honourable members of the ""Country party - to say how this measure will affect the big body of consumers, who would furnish the best market for the producers if they could only be reached without the intervention of the big man. The honourable member  which I know was prompted by 'his practical knowledge of the canning industry. It is up to us to say a word for the hard worker, who has to buy the f r u it . In what way will the canning of this f r u it assure to the householder a cheaper or a better class of canned or fresh f r u it ? There is no assurance in the Bill . I hope that action similar to this will be taken in dealing with the workers, when the opportunity presents itself, in order that .the cost of commodities shall not be raised to such an extent as to make ineffective an increase of a few shillings a week in wages. The Bill lays it down that the producer is to be given a minimum wage. That is a principle which did not find favour when we first enunciated it .",49
154,Mr HILL,Unknown,"The canner is limited in regard to his charges, [21]",50
155,Mr YATES,Unknown,I am glad to learn that; the Bill does not say so. If the consumers cannot obtain apples more cheaply than 6d. each-and not very good ones at that - the y will not derive much advantage.,50

158,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.25] - I rise to assure the honourable 'member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) that .the Bill contains adequate - safeguards for the consumer and producer alike. The bounty on home consumption was devised specially to permit of t i e sale of the f r u it in Australia during this year at the reduced price of 10^d. per 2-lb. t in . The definite agreement was arrived at among the canners that they would continue to sell to the retailer at such a rate as would enable him to carry on at that price. I am pleased to see that the action of the canners - has led to arrangements being made for the con-sunaption of a greater quantity of f r u it in Australia than was expected. Apparently, 80 per cent, of this pack will be - consumed in Australia, and it was thought that only 70 per cent, would be so consumed.  to be paid under this measure will then be less than was anticipated?",50
159,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"That is so. The consumer in .Australia will be further protected in that only 30 per cent, of this pack will be allowed to be sent outside the country, except with the definite consent of the Minister for Trade and Customs, so as to insure that there .shall be an abundant supply in Australia. The consumer is also protected under clauses 6 and 8, which provide that, as a necessary condition to his receiving the bounty, .the canner shall accept and can practically all the f r u it presented at his cannery. There will not, therefore, be .any possibility of an artificial shortage being brought about, with a consequent raising of prices.",50
160,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Is that provided for i u the agreement?,51
161,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Yes . I u those three ways special provision has been made that the consumer shall benefit, because the Government felt that on this occasion it should use the money that is being spent to popularize Australian f r u it in Australia and make it as widely used as possible. This is no more a socialistic proposal than any other scheme for giving a bounty. Whateveitentained, dency towards socialism it may have, it is a long step from the socialism of previous Pools, which consisted of Government purchase and control from the time the f r u it came off the tree u n t i l it was placed in the various homes.",51

That is the result the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) while in England,.in disposing of where we stand. the big surplus that existed there. managed to insure that it would be dis-. tributed through 4,000 shops, in order to give us a good advertisement. Reference has been made to the amount that has been paid. At the present time by of bounty on home production £40,000 has been paid, and an additional £35,000 has been passed for payment. No money man). has been paid on f r u it exported, but understand that an account has been sent in for £6,000. It is anticipated that the total amount which will be payable will be between £115,000 aud £125,000.",51
166,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [9.31]. - I hope the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) will persist in his proposed amendment. I am not satisfied with the explanation giyen by the Attorneygood General (Sir Littleton Groom) of parabe graphs a and b of sub-clause 4. If the object of this Bill was to lay down ciple for a number of years, the cancellation of the more or less mandatory pro-, visions of sub-clauses 1 and 2 would perhaps be justifiable. On the Treasurer's figures f u l ly two-thirds of the bounty of £150,000 has been paid, or passed for payment. The Minister ought to know, and it would appear from the Treasurer's statement that he does know, what amount will be claimed for bounty. He should also know who will come under the provisions of sub-clause 4. The facts could be ascerand if that were done there would be no need for the sub-clause. The object desired could be achieved by some clearer and more definite method. Parliament ought to know to whom the sub-clause refers and what amounts are involved. The sub-clause is inserted, I submit, to meet specific cases, which must be known to the Minister. Practically all the bounty for home consumption has been paid, and a large part of the bounty for export has been submitted and passed for payment. We were told in the Minister's secoud-reading speech that this Bill would finalize the matter; that it did not seek to provide any further bounties, but dealt only with specific cases. I am inclined to at a look upon the sub-clause with a certain amount of suspicion. There is just a chance that it is inserted to meet special The present cases which the Minister or the Government does not wish to disclose to the House. I hope the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition of will be moved and carried, because it will . clarify the position, and show us exactly He",51
167,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [9.35] - In this debate there is evidently something wanting. I would like to know the Government's real intentions. I have never way heard a more lame reply to criticism than that which was given by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin ChapThe honourable member for I Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) suggested that - there was a hidden motive in this subclause 4, and it appears to me that something is being smothered, and that the real purpose of the Bill is not being disclosed. Everything necessary for human consumption can be produced in abundance in Australia, but we have not yet ascertained from the Government how the things provided by Providence can distributed. The Labour party's platform lays, down cardinal principles in that a princonnexion. Unfortunately, the abuse of that policy by followers of the Government, and the opposition of self-interested persons, prevent its realization, but until we can get the socialization of the means of production, Bills of this character will be brought regularly before us. Large bounties were passed during the last Parliament. All kinds of bounties have been proposed to meet circumstances as they arise. Thus an attempt is made to obscure the necessity for socializing the means of production. I am satisfied that until we take the step proposed by the Labour party we shall not get out of our difficulties. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) referred to the price of fruit in Sydney. In the last two years it has been very difficult to buy good fruit in Sydney. The best quality is very scarce. A lot of the best fruit is shipped from New South Wales, for it does not pay to export anything but the best. Even second rate fruit, however, is not readily obtainable. Good quality grapes, which are greatly enjoyed by women and children, have not been obtainable for two years. I am sorry that the Government has not tried to do something for the Australian consumer. The Bill gives me an opportunity to refer to a speech delivered by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) in a suburb of Melbourne a few weeks ago. He said that the handing out of bounties to the third party in this House would have to stop. The practice has become a disgrace to the Government of this country. I do not intend to vote against this Bill because T quite recognise that the speeches that have been, made by honourable members opposite were merely some of the electioneering speeches to which we shall continue to listen if this Parliament. lasts for another twelve months. speech which the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) made this afternoon, in moving the adjournment of the House, was nothing more nor less than an electioneering speech. Politicians quite understood that. This Bounty Bill is only an electioneering squib,, which has afforded honourable members opposite an opportunity to express their concern for the poor man on the land. It makes me very wrath to listen to the way in which some honourable members speak of our country people. The statements they make are sufficient to prevent any one going upon the land, and if read in the Old Country would, be sufficient to prevent persons coming to Australia in order to settle upon the land. We should put a stop to this kind of thing. If men on the land are faced with difficult conditions, they should come to honourable members on this side, who will find some relief for them. I hope that the explanation which has been given by the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) is correct, but I can scarcely believe it. The Bill is Ear too loosely drawn. Bills of this character should be drawn in such a way that ordinary individuals can understand them. I guarantee that not one-half of the members of the Committee know what is contained in the clause now under consideration. We should have much less trouble in passing measures in this House if they were clearly drawn. Honourable members opposite have reason to be grateful for the criticism of this measure by honourable members on this side. It has induced the Attorney-General to explain what the Bill really means. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) told us about an agreement, but has any honourable member seen the agreement? When we are asked to pass a Bill which covers an agreement, we should be told what is in that agreement. Whether it is in accordance with the Bill or not may depend on the person who drew it up. I still doubt whether the agreement in this case is consistent with the statements which have been made by the Treasurer and the Attorney General.  member seen the agreement? ' Mr WEST - I have not. Has the honourable member seen it? ",51
168,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Ye t the honourable member proposes to pass a Bill which covers the agreement, although it may be contrary to his opinion. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) will persist in securing information upon measures submitted in this Chamber, so that before a Bill is passed into law we shall know what it contains. I know what happens when one has' to make application to a Government Department. I know that if he has the ear of the Minister he will have no difficulty in securing what he desires. This makes me anxious to know what we. are passing in this Bill. We should be careful with the expenditure of publio funds because, airthough, we are receiving a greater revenue through the Customs than we should receive in that way, money is not as plentiful as it used to be in the old days when, in the State which I represent, if the Government was a little short of money, it sold land. In these times,., when we have to obtain revenue by taxation, we should be particularly caref u l to know what we are doing when Ave are called upon to pass measures of this character.",52
169,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [9.48-]. - I cannot understand why honourable memr bers opposite should object to the clause. I should like to see them a little more consistent - In connection with Customs legislation, they have passed measure after measure containing a similar provision enabling the Minister for Trade and Customs to give to one person what he will not give another. In the past, honourable membersopposite have supported, such provisions with great coitsistency. I u the circumstances,. I am greatly surprised that now, when we have before us a clause enabling the Minister for Trade and' Customs, to tell one man that he will receive the bonus and &nother that he will not receive it, honourable members opposite should be found opposing it.. They have often supported similar legislation before, amd I cannot understand their opposition in this case.",53
170,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [9'.4i9] - I wish to move an amendment, but I do not wish to take up time discussing it. The discussion which, has so far taken place has confirmed the view I put to the Committee. Even theAttomey-Geueral (Sir Littleton Groom) has admitted that the contention I put forward was correct. There is no escaping the interpretation, to beplaced on the clause as drafted. We are not, as the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has said, against the clause, but we do wish to protect the public puarse, and the honourable member should be with us in that. Sub-clause 2 of clause 8 provides thatIf a canner 'does not use, for canning or in the preparation of an article for human consumption, the whole of the fruit purchased by him, in pursuance of section 6 of this Act, and passed by an inspector as suitable for canning, the canner shall not be entitled to be paid bounty in respect of any of the fruit canned by him. That provides: that ou the inspector, being satisfied that the canner purchases the fruit-and it is admitted by the. honor and two Ministers that it is intended to r buy all the frui t grown.",53
171,Mr HILL,Unknown,"All "" the f r u it offered.",53
172,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"All the fruit offered has to be bought. The inspector then certifieSj. and the bounty is paid. It is paid before the f r u it is canned. I am asking that the public should be protected, and that the bounty should only be paid on the fruit canned. Sir LITTLETON; GEOOM"" - That is all we are paying.",53
173,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If all the fruit offered must be bought and. bounty paid on it,, whether or not that frui t is canned, dishonest practices may creep' in. There is absolutely no protection to the public purser Any tale can be told to thf* Minister,, and if he has a mind to accept it,, thecannermay be permitted to retain the bounty paid!. The canners are entitled only to bounty on the f r u it canned, and there should be no loophole for fruit to be disposed of in some other way after the bounty is paid.",53
174,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,Unknown,"They cannon do that. ' Mr Charlton - It is marvellous, what can be done-. I am only a layman, but two out of three legal men will agree with my contention:. The ckaft clause as it stands, makes it possible for dishonest practices to creep in. It is our duty to pass legislation which contains no loophole, by which any one can.take advantage of thei Commonwealth. I only want to do what isjust and equitable. There should be an amendment of sub-clause b. I move-That the words, "" the whole or any,"" paragraph b, be left out and that the words "" on the quantity canned,,"" be inserted after the. word,' ™ bounty."" The paragraph, would then readThat the canner be relieved of his liability to repay portion of the bounty on the quantity, canned. and the position would be that if a man canned thefrui the would get the bounty,, whereas if he bought, a lot of f r u it that was not canned, but disposed of in some' surreptitious manner, he would not get the bounty. Unless some good reason cart be given, to the contrary, the Minister should be prepared, to accept the amendment. I do not want to divide the Committee upon it , but merely desire to protect the public. The d r a f t in g of the clause is anything but satisfactory. is not sufficient to say that the Minister has, to decide the matter, for we all know how skilf-uisome people arewhen dealing with the Government,, and it ispossible for-the. Minister, even with, the best of intentions,, to give a wrongdecision. In connection, with meat, we-were-careful to pay only on. the quantity exported; and i u this Bill we should provide for the bounty to be paid only on the f r u it canned"".",53
175,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Clause 6, sub-clause c, provides for that.",54
176,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It does not; it only provides for the manner in which, the bounty shall be paid in accordance with the schedule.",54
177,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,Is it not paid on the certificate?.,54
178,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am not denying that, but the certificate is granted before the f r u it is canned. SirLITTLETON - GEOOM - The honourable member is wrong i h that contention. Mr Charlton"":-The Bill provides that the . money received need not be returned to-the Treasury. If the bounty is paid only after the f r u it is canned, what is the meaning, of that provision? The thing is s e l f - e v i d e n t it is. there in black and white, and in argument to-night it has been admitted that payment is made on the f r u it bought. If it is the inten^ tion of the Department to protect the public, and to pay' only on the f r u it canned, I can only say that that intention is badly expressed i u the draftin g of the clause.",54
179,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Paragraph a of subinspector clause 4 of clause 8 providestbat. non-compliance with those, conditions shall not disentitle the canner to receive bounty. Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON.*-The honourable member should look at sub-clause c of clause 6.",54
180,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That provides the bounty* shall be payable to the canner if hecans, to the satisfaction* of the' inspector; frui t in respect of which bountyis chased by, the canner in accordance with, this section and passed by the inspector as suitable for canning. That means that if the f r u it is passed, by the inspector as suitable for canning the It canner may be paid the bounty.. The whole thing is so clear that I am surprised that honourable members, cannot see that the wording does not convey what is in tended. The clause provides that, after the f r u it hasbeeninspected and passed, payment may be made, and that if certain thingsare not done inrespect of _ canning at a subsequent period, the cannersmay be called, upon to remit thebounty they have already received. I want to make quite sure that no loop-hole is left whereby the fund's of the Government can be obtained' improperly. Sin LITTLETON GROOM (Darling Downs - Attorney-General ) [TO. j - j - if : the Leader of the Opposition. (Mr Charlton) will follow me-for a moment, I shall show him that: he' is under a-, misapprehension. The object of sub-clause 1 is to insure that a canner shall purchase all suitable, f r u it offering, which he is directed to purchase. The object of sub-clause 2 is to insure thecanning of all suitable f r u it purchased' by himi for canning.",54
181,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is not the exact language used in the clause. Sir: LITTLETON GROOM - Sub clause 1 reads: "" If the canner purchases a less quantity of f r u it than that directed by the Comptroller-General. . . . "" That is to insure that the canner purchases the f r u it . Sub-clause 2 provides that if a canner does not use, for canning or in thepreparation of an article for human consumption,. the whole of: the f r u it purchased by him and passed by an as suitable for canning, then he is liable to a penalty, namely, the. forfeir ture of thebounty paidi in respect of any of the f r u it canned by him. No bounty is paid at all except for f r u it that is abr solutely canned, and no bounty is paid upon f r u it being canned; u n t i l the canner receives the certificate of an officer that the conditions have been complied with : that This is one of the claimsI hereby claim bounty in respect, of canned pineapples^-or . whateveri t may be-the manufactured by me at my factory on a claimed purcertain date. That claim is made in respect of canned fruit, for which the officer certifiesOFFICER'S CERTIFICATE. I certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief, after due inquiry, the particulars and statements declared to in the above claim for bounty are true and correct, and that the claimant is entitled to bounty on the goods' specified in the claim. The bounty is paid only on fruit absolutely canned. Sub-clause 4 provides that, notwithstanding the forfeiture, if the canner can satisfy the Minister that compliance with the conditions specified in sub-clauses 1 and 2 was not, in the circumstances, practicable, the Minister may remit the penalty of forfeiture of the whole of the bounty the canner is entitled to upon the fruit already canned, or any portion of the bounty. The Minister cannot remit, or allow a canner to claim, a bounty for fruit which he has never canned.",54
182,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"If the canner does not fulfil the conditions, will he be compelled to refund the bounty paid to him? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - If a feited. canner does not fulfil the conditions, and if he has already received part of the bounty, under sub-clause 3 the bounty paid is a Crown debt, and the canner is liable to refund the whole of it.",55
183,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"A penalty is vided in oai.e case, and taken off in another.",55
184,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort. The penalty is remitted under certain circumstances.,55
185,Mr HILL,Unknown,"The canner pays the grower. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The canner whether he gets the bounty or not has to pay the grower. Under these circumstances the Leader of the Opposition will see that his amendment is unnecessary. The Bill is clearly drafted, meting out just and equitable treatment to canners under all circumstances.",55
186,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman's explanation makes these later provisions all the more bewildering. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - Tho provisions are perfectly clear. the canner does not fulfil the conditions of the clause he forfeits the bounty upon fruit already canned. It would not be fair to compel a forfeiture - simply because, for justifiable reasons, a canner could not purchase the quantity of fruit directed by the. Comptroller-General.",55
187,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [10.8] - The Minister (Sir Littleton Groom) has made confusion worse confounded. He has told us that the bounty is not paid on any fruit until it is canned. Sub-clause 3 provides that if a canner has been paid bounty to which by virtue of either of the two preceding sub-clauses he is not entitled, the amount of bounty shall be a debt to the Crown. In the first place, how would the canner obtain the bounty?",55
188,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,Rea d the preceding sub-clauses.,55
189,Mr YATES,Unknown,The Minister has just told us that no canner is paid bounty until he has a certificate to the effect that he has canned the fruit for which he is asking a bounty.,55
190,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"The object of sub-clause 1 is to compel the . canner to buy the offering fruit, and if he fails to do so, although he may have canned a certain quantity, then the bounty upon the fruit which he has canned is for",55
191,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The Minister read for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition a certificate to show that no money is paid until the fruit has been canned and inspected. How is it that it is pospro- sible for a canner to be paid a bounty to which he is not entitled? The Minister has produced a certificate to prove that a canner cannot be paid the bounty until he has canned the quantity, of frui t certified by the inspector; yet the Bill provides for payment, which is not to be made until the f r u it is canned.",55
192,Mr HILL,Unknown,A man might have canned 50 tons and refused to take another 50 tons.,55
193,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Does the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) suggest that, if the canner was ordered to buy 100 tons, and only took 50, the inspector would give him a certificate for 100 tons, knowing full well that he had not carried out his contract?",55
194,Mr HILL,Unknown,This is a business that runs on from day to day.,55
195,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I fail to see why a m ai Where should have money paid to him until he has completed his contract - The Bil l is loosely drawn, since sub-clause (3) stipulates that the canner is, in certain circumstances, to return some qf the money that has been paid to him. I wish to know how a man can obtain money for the recovery of which there a claim at law. The Minister has not yet explained the position to my satisfacthe tion.",55
196,Mr HILL,Unknown,There are progress paycording ments.,56
197,Mr YATES,Unknown,Are progress certifition cates issued on quantities canned?,56
198,Mr HILL,Unknown,I think so.,56
199,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The Minister nods. I therefore take it that the suggestion' of the honourable member for Echuca is correct. How does the canner imburse himself? The grower's interests are well protected, because if half the fruit goes rotten, the grower will have already obtained the higher price paid by virtue of the bounty. I am in that clined to think that the Leader of the Opposition has placed his finger on the weak spot in the Bill. Apparently the Government money has been paid, and as the numbers arc up, the Minister is disinclined to listen to the words of wisdom falling the Opposition. Perhaps some of the money that has beeu paid by way of bounty has not been earned, and the are very glad to see them take. canners who have secured it are disinmust, clined to refund it. It may be that of the canners have not fulfilled their contracts. ' If so, this measure is typical of the actions of the Government in spending the taxpayers' money. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [10.18]. - I cannot understand why the Gothat vernment do not accept the amendment. If the intention is as the Minisfor ter (Sir Littleton Groom) has stated, there should be no hesitation in agreeing to the suggestion of the Leader of Opposition (Mr Charlton), who desires to have it definitely stated in the Bill the bounty shall be paid only on fruit that is canned.",56
200,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"The relief fig-leaf, given in this clause is in respect only bounty paid in accordance with subpineapple-leaf clauses (1) and (2). Mr F. MCDONALD - I can quite understand that some canners may able to comply entirely with the conditions of sub-clause (2), but the very fact that members of the Ministry are not prelieve pared to accept the amendment shows that they do contemplate paying the bounty on f r u it that has not been",56
201,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"No : that canorable. not be done. Mr F. MCDONALD - If that is the is intention of the Ministry, what is their objection to the amendment proposed by Leader of the Opposition? The clause finishes with the word ""bounty."" Acto the Minister's statement, I am sure that he has in his mind in associawith the word "" bounty "" the words "" paid in respect of the quantity of fruit canned."" If that is so, why does he object to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ? Do the Government contemplate paying the bounty reon fruit that has not been canned?",56
202,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"No . Mr F. MCDONALD - Then why not accept the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition, which states definitely no bounty shall be paid in respect of fruit that is not canned? I suppose the are not absolutely wedded to the verbiage of this Bill, though, on the other hand, they may think it is perfect. from In any case I compliment them upon bringing in the measure. It is a step in the direction of Socialism which we We however, commiserate with honorsome able members opposite upon the failure of private enterprise to stand alone. They admit now that private enterprise in conjunction with Government enterpriseis a good thing. In the early days of this Government many gibes were heard about fig-leaf Socialism. The only difference I can see in the Government now is that they propose to exchange the fig-leaf the apricot-leaf, or the peach-leaf. Even the pineapple-leaf is mentioned. I do not think that the Government are the showing much discretion. The first tailoress in the world selected the figthat leaf as the best form of armour against nakedness, and I do not think that the Government would be wise to discard the especially for a pineapple-leaf. I of am sure that they would not find the any more comfortable. However, we congratulate them upon recognising the principle that Government not be enterprise is not a bad thing.",56
203,Mr MARR,Unknown,"Parkes) [10.27] - I be that the intentions of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) and other honourable members opposite who canned. have spoken on this matter are honThey desire to safeguard the public purse. I consider, however, that iflae acceptance of the amendment moved' 'by the Leader of the Opposition Anstey, 3?. would defeat the - very purpose he has in Brennan, mind. Clause 6 of the Bill provides Maloney, Dr that if the canner purchases the fruit Mathews, J. offered by 'the grower, pays the foT the fruit, and cans it to the satisfaction of the inspector, he shall be paid a bounty. Clause 8 provides that if ne does not can iihe whole of the f r u it to the satisfaction off the .Minister he may be obliged to refund the 'bounty that has been paid in respect to the fruit that he has canned. He may be relieved of that port adopted. liability if he satisfies the Minister that compliance with the specified conditions is not practicable. Opposition, with ihe - best intentions in ihe world, wishes to relieve the all liability to repay 'that money. That, at any 'rate, wild the the effect of his amendrment if it ""is adopted.

206,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"W h i l e we go out and wave flags; and beat drums, and talk about our patriotic fervour,, the Government compels workmen who are upon the basic wage- a wage-which was fixed merely to cover the bare cost of living-to take a day off at the expense, not of: the patriTO otic Government, but of their wives and children. That was the experience of the G employees at Cockatoo Island, on the occasion of the visit of thefleet to Sydney. The Prime Minister fold me today that the Government had no power over the Commonwealth Shipping Board-, but I - say that the Government has every power: It cannot shelter, itself behind excuse. If it: wished to act fair l y it could: reimburse the Shipping-Board for payment of the money.. For years it the was the practice to pay these men for public holidays, but not since the acto i vent of the Shipping Board. I appeal to the Prime Minister to see that ; If. the will not pay the money, let the Government make a special grant for the in purpose. I believe' that Parliament would The readily acquiesce-. If the Government is as patriotic as it would, have us believe,, it will take steps to see that the workmen do not suffer by being compelled to lose a day's work to honour our visiting kinsmen. I wish to refer to another matter i nexion with the Shipbuilding Tribunal. That Tribunal has been in existence for many years. It was formerly under the chairmanship of Mr Connington, M.L.C. , of New South Wales. When he was chairman the decisions of the Tribunal were always made public, but recently Mr . Connington resigned, and Mr Sinclair, who is also a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, was appointed in his place. Since that change was made the awards have been kept secret, and officials of the unions concerned have not been able to obtain copieB. I ask the Primo Minister (Mr Bruce), whose Department controls this matter, to look into it , and have the awards of the Tribunal made available to the secretaries and officials of the unions directly concerned.",58
207,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [10.51] - I do not understand the anxiety that is felt at the present moment on the subject brought forward by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman). It will be within the honourable member's knowledge that the question of the relation of State instrumentalities to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has been constantly raised by the State Governments for a number of years. I also point out to him that the Government can hardly be expected to make a declaration of its policy in reply to a question raised on a motion for the adjournment of the House. I can only say to him that at the moment there is no statement. I can make, or that I desire to make, on the matter. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr: Mahony) addressed to me this afternoon a question regarding the holiday granted to certain workmen in connection with the visit of the Special Service Squadron. I pointed out to him then that this House deliberately took from the Government the control of the conditions of work in the.Cockatoo Dockyard and placed it in the hands of a Board, which is entirely responsible for the position in which the men find themselves. If it is desired to submit a special case, and representations are made, they will naturally be considered. It is entirely for the Board to determine the conditions under which the men are employed, since the. Government - by , I again remind the honourable member, the expressed determination of Parn conliament-ha s had removed from its con-, trol all questions relating to these men. Regarding the alteration in the practice relating to the publication ot awards of the Special Tribunalfor Cockatoo Dockyard, I will have the matter looked into, and will let the honourable member know the exact position.
