2,Mr ALBANESE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (9.01 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to support the government's policy that fibre to-the-premises infrastructure should be installed in new developments. When the government announced the NBN, it indicated it would also progress legislative changes to have fibre-to-thepremises infrastructure installed in new developments. The government considers it does not make sense to roll out a fibre network to up to 93 per cent of premises without preparing for the rollout of fibre in new developments. The government has undertaken an extensive consultation process in developing this legislation, including releasing discussion papers and draft legislation and forming a broadly based stakeholder reference group. In drafting this bill, the government has also considered the recommendations of the Senate Environment and Communications Committee report into the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2010. Details of the government's policy have been set out in policy statements on 20 June and 9 December 2010. Under the government's policy, from 1 January 2011, NBN Co. is the fibre provider of last resort in new developments within its fibre footprint. As a result, while developers are free to use other telecommunications providers, NBN Co. will provide fibre where developers do not wish to use another provider. Developers are required to meet the cost of trenching and passive infrastructure. The provision of passive infrastructure by developers recognises the considerable investment NBN Co. will make in providing fibre cabling and associated equipment. Telstra has a transitional role to provide services where NBN Co. does not yet have fibre. The bill reflects the government's decision that NBN Co. Ltd will be the fibre provider of last resort. The bill will add a new part 20A to the Telecommunications Act to support the rollout of the NBN. Proposed part 20A is intended to apply to all types of new developments, including broadacre estates, urban infill and urban renewal projects. The rules will generally apply to new developments in NBN Co's long-term fibre footprint. There are four key measures in proposed part 20A. First, the bill enables the minister to specify new developments or classes of new developments in which fixed lines that are installed must be optical fibre lines. While NBN Co's role as the fibre infrastructure provider of last resort means fibre will be provided in new developments, this provides a mechanism to ensure, if necessary, that new lines in future are fibre. Second, the bill provides that when fixedline facilities are being installed in a development, these facilities must be fibre-ready. This rule will apply to the person installing the facilities, and if that person is a developer, whether or not the developer is a constitutional corporation. A fixed-line facility is an item of passive infrastructure such as underground ducting or ‘pit and pipe' used in the deployment of fixed telecommunications lines to a premises. A ‘fibre-ready facility' is a fixed-line facility that is designed, manufactured and installed so that it allows the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling, noting such cabling has special deployment requirements. Third, the bill will have the effect of quiring constitutional corporations, particularly developers that are constitutional corporations, to install fibre-ready facilities in close proximity to their developments. Penalties will apply if a constitutional corporation sells or leases land or a building situated in a new development unless fibre-ready facilities have been installed. However, the sale or lease transaction will still be valid. The focus of this requirement on constitutional corporations reflects the application of the Australian government's constitutional powers over corporations. These fibre-ready requirements will not apply in new developments where other urban utilities are not being installed. The bill also provides for NBN Co. to provide a written statement advising that it will not be deploying fibre in an area, that is, the area is outside the long-term fibre footprint of the NBN. The effect of such a statement is that it will relieve a person such as a developer of the obligation to install fibre-ready facilities in that area. To provide flexibility, the bill also provides for the minister to exempt specified projects, individual lots or units, or conduct from requirements under the bill. The bill also exempts from these requirements developments where, before the bill comes into effect, contracts have been signed or work has commenced on the installation of fixed-line facilities or lines, or where civil works generally have been contracted or commenced. Fourth, proposed part 20A provides for a regime for carriers to secure access to fixedline facilities such as pit and pipe that are owned by non-carriers, to ensure fibre can be rolled out using these facilities. The regime is based on that applying to carrier facilities in part 5, schedule 1 of the Telecommunications Act. Access would be on terms that are re- commercially negotiated or, failing agreement, determined by an agreed arbitrator, or failing agreement on an arbitrator, by the on or Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The bill provides for a number of new definitions to support the operation of part 20A of the Telecommunications Act. Part 20A does not intend to exclude or limit the operation of state and territory laws that are capable of operating concurrently with the proposed new part 20A. As such, the legislation can be complemented by changes to state, territory and local planning arrangements, which would further support the deployment of fibre-ready facilities or fibre. The bill applies the civil penalties in the Telecommunications Act to breaches of obligations under the new part 20A. In addition to inserting the new part 20A, the bill also amends part 21 of the Telecommunications Act, which relates to technical regulation. The amendments enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make technical standards for customer premises equipment and cabling for use with the NBN and other superfast telecommunications networks. The ACMA will be able to exercise these powers on its own initiative or if directed by the minister. The amendments also enable the minister to give the ACMA directions in relation to cabling provider rules. The proposed amendments to the bill will commence at the start of the day after the day the bill receives royal assent, or 1 July 2011, whichever occurs later in time. While the government first flagged its intention to facilitate the deployment of optical fibre infrastructure in new developments in April 2009, this approach gives further advance notice and removes concerns about potential retrospective requirements. It has been the government's expectation since the 20 June 2010 announcement, however, that developers will have recognised the benefits of installing fibre-ready passive infrastructure to facilitate the rollout in their developments and will have proceeded on this basis. The bill will help residents and businesses in new developments access the most up-todate telecommunications services. It is a key complement to the government's historic National Broadband Network. It will play an important role in helping us prepare Australian homes, workplaces, schools and other premises for the high-speed online digital world of today and the future. I commend the bill to the House Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (AIR CARGO) BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Albanese. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (9.10 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The legislative framework of Australia's aviation security regime consists of a suite of measures designed to deter and prevent acts of unlawful interference with aviation. The framework is constantly reviewed to ensure it adapts to evolving threats to the security of the Australian aviation industry. The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011 (the bill) contains four key amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 (the act) to simplify and strengthen the existing security regulatory framework for supply chain security. These amendments are critical in terms of of fibre improving security outcomes. The bill: - improves Australia's capacity to respond to events of heightened transport security threat; - provides transitionary arrangements to ease the regulatory burden on air cargo industry members while Australia moves to implement the new air cargo security initiatives announced by the government on 9 February 2010; allows for training requirements of air cargo industry members to be prescribed by legislative instrument which will increase the transparency of training requirements and allow scrutiny by the parliament; and - simplifies the air cargo clearance process by removing terminology that is not relevant or that is inconsistent with operational procedures used in the air cargo industry. In late October 2010, terrorists operating from Yemen concealed improvised explosive devices inside printers and sent them as air cargo consignments to the United States of America. Intelligence information led to the successful disruption of this attempted terrorist targeting of the aviation sector. This event reinforced the need to be able to respond quickly to address emerging threats. The Australian government took immediate action to protect the travelling public and the Australian aviation sector, strengthening measures against inbound cargo originating from Yemen and Somalia. This was achieved through special security directions issued to regulated air cargo agents (RACAs) which initially required screening of inbound air cargo arriving directly from the Middle East and later banned carriage of air cargo from Yemen and Somalia. This bill continues to strengthen Australia's air cargo security through four measures. First, this bill will amend the definition of ‘aviation industry participant' to include accredited air cargo agents. Under the current legislative arrangements, accredited air cargo agents are not defined as a type of aviation industry participant and therefore are not subject to the full suite of regulatory obligations that apply to aviation industry participants. Adding accredited air cargo agents to the definition of aviation industry participants in the act will allow special security directions to be applied to accredited air cargo agents in times of heightened security threat and require them to comply with incident reporting requirements. This amendment will provide for consistent security obligations to be applied to all aviation industry participants. Second, the bill extends the validity of regulated air cargo agents' transport security programs to ease the burden on both industry and the department during the transition to a new air cargo security framework that aligns with world's best practice. The framework was announced by the government on 9 February 2010 and included the establishment of a regulated shipper scheme and funding to assist industry to procure appropriate examination technology such as x-ray and explosive trace detection equipment to secure air cargo. The proposed transitional provisions will enable the air cargo industry members to determine the most appropriate regulatory scheme for their business, reduce compliance costs and streamline regulatory requirements during the progressive implementation of the new framework. This amendment will extend the validity of existing transport security programs to 31 December 2012 unless the transport security program is revised prior to this date. Third, the bill will allow for a legislative instrument to clearly prescribe security training requirements for regulated air cargo agents and accredited air cargo agents. This will ensure consistency in training outcomes and increase the security of air cargo across the industry. A legislative instrument also increases the transparency and scrutiny by the parliament of the training prescribed. Finally, the bill includes some minor technical amendments which will simplify the air cargo clearance process by: - removing ‘certification' provisions to accurately reflect operational procedures applied by industry whilst maintaining the integrity of air cargo security measures; and - removing all references to the term ‘freight' and replacing them with the term ‘cargo'. Cargo is a term which is more relevant to industry practices and terminology, and is consistent with other existing provisions in the act. In summary, the bill will provide a more secure air cargo environment. The proposed amendments: - increase flexibility and responsiveness to situations of heightened security threat; - reduce the regulatory burden and cost to industry members during the progressive transition to the new air cargo security framework; - allow for greater scrutiny, consistency and transparency of training requirements for air cargo industry members; and - simplify terminology appropriate to industry practices and procedures. Such changes are necessary in the continual refinement and improvement of the security arrangements to ensure Australia is positioned to respond to emerging security threats and continue to meet world's best practice in our transport sector. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA NA BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCClelland. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
4,Mr MCCLELLAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 contains amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and the Criminal Code Act 1995. The proposed amendments in this bill have been identified through practical experience as measures that will improve the operation of key provisions in the legislation. I will briefly outline the key measures in the bill. Amendments to the ASIO Act The bill amends the definition of ‘foreign intelligence' in the ASIO Act to ensure consistency with the Intelligence Services Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. This follows on from a similar amendment to the Interception Act, which was made last year by the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Act 2010. The amendments ensure a consistent approach to the collection of foreign intelligence, and reflect that the modern national security context encompasses threats from both state and non-state actors. The bill also amends the ASIO Act to clarify that computer access warrants authorise ongoing access to the computer during the life of the warrant. This amendment is not intended to change the operation of the provision. Amendments are also included to exclude the communication of information relating to employment within the intelligence community from the operation of the security assessment provisions in part IV of the ASIO Act. This will put ASIO on the same footing as other intelligence agencies when it comes to communicating such information. Amendments to the Intelligence Services Act The bill also contains an amendment to the functions of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation. It will provide a specific function for DIGO, as it is called, to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Australian Defence Force. This is consistent with a similar function of the Defence Signals Directorate. The bill contains amendments to provide a new ground for granting ministerial authorisations for producing intelligence about Australian persons. The new ground covers intelligence regarding activities related to the contravention of United Nations sanctions. It will complement the existing ground that covers activities relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the movement of goods listed on the Defence and Strategic Goods List. Clarification of the immunity provisions in the Intelligence Services Act and the Criminal Code computer offence provisions are included. These amendments make it clear that the immunity provisions can only be overridden by express legislative intent. This will ensure that those provisions are not vulnerable to being inadvertently overridden by later in time legislation. Finally, the bill contains amendments relating to the status of certain instruments under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Consistent with the government's commitment to clearer laws, the bill moves existing exemptions from the Legislative Instruments Regulations to make these exemptions express on the face of the Intelligence Services Act. Oversight and accountability I would like to take this opportunity to remind members that Australia's intelligence and security agencies continue to be subject to a range of important oversight and accountability measures. These include the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The government is committed to ensuring that national security oversight bodies are well-equipped to undertake their vital roles. Members would recall that amendments to increase the size of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security were recently passed as part of the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The committee plays a vital role in providing parliamentary oversight of the administration and expenditure of the agencies. The mandate of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security was recently expanded in the National Security Legislation Amendment Act 2010, so that the Inspector General can extend inquiries outside the intelligence community in appropriate cases. Conclusion Ensuring our national security and law enforcement agencies have the ability to respond to threats to our national security is a key priority for this government. This bill, while relatively small, is an important step in the government's ongoing review of National Security legislation, and will improve the practical operation of a number of provisions. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. CHILD SUPPORT (REGISTRATION AND COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Plibersek. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
5,Ms PLIBERSEK,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Sydney-Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.23 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Amendment Bill 2011. The bill has two objectives. Firstly, the bill proposes to allow the Child Support Registrar to delegate certain powers and functions to individuals outside the Department of Human Services. Secondly, the bill amends several criminal penalty provisions to ensure the offences in those provisions can be prosecuted successfully. The government believes it is vital that the children of separated parents receive the emotional and financial support they need. While most parents do the right thing and pay their child support in full and on time, not all parents meet their child support obligations. The Child Support Program has identified that having the ability to outsource debt collection activity to external service providers on occasions should increase the successful collection of outstanding child support liabilities. The first amendment in the bill will enable the Child Support Registrar to delegate certain powers and functions to external service providers. This approach is currently utilised by Centrelink for collection of outstanding liabilities. This approach aims to improve the collection of child support by using the expertise of skilled external providers for specific lection activities. The outsourcing of collection activities is expected to lead to an increase in the successful identification and collection of outstanding child support debt. Additionally, the outsourcing of collection activities allows Child Support Program staff to concentrate on other compliance activities and better serve other Child Support customers. The amendments to the delegation provisions under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 are based on equivalent provisions under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010. As the Department of Human Services moves towards an integrated model between its various agencies, these amendments will enable the Child Support Program to ensure consistency of service delivery options across agencies. The second group of amendments are to certain criminal provisions under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. These provisions relate to the obligations of an employer when they are required to withhold money from an employee. Employer withholding is a process whereby an employer withholds amounts from a paying parent's wages or salary, only as required by the Child Support Program, to be paid to CSA in satisfaction of a child support liability. The current offences relating to employer withholdings in the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 are somewhat ambiguous. The offence provisions create an obligation and provide a penalty, but do not specify whether the offence is created by an act or omission. A literal reading of these provisions suggests that an employer could indeed be penalised for complying with the section. This col- makes it difficult for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute an employer who is doing the wrong thing. The proposed amendments will make it clear that an offence is committed when an employer fails to take a certain action. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has been consulted in the making of the proposed amendments. These amendments will improve the prospect of successful prosecution under the act. They make it clear that it is an offence when an employer fails to deduct or remit child support payments for the benefit of children. Improving the ability of the Child Support Program to successfully prosecute employers who fail to comply with requirements under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 will also help protect the integrity of the Child Support Program, and, at the end of the day, better support the children of separated parents. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (EXPORT CONTROLS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
6,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"GortonMinister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information) (9.27 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of the government's initiatives to increase the level of security in the export cargo environment by strengthening the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service controls over international export cargo. The bill will enhance Customs and Border Protection's ability to respond to specific security concerns and to detect and respond to high-risk export cargo. These measures implement the outcomes from a joint Customs and Border Protection and Department of Infrastructure and Transport review, which formed part of the Australian government's response to the Independent Review of Airport Security and Policing for the Government of Australia (the Wheeler Report). The measures are both balanced and proportionate to the risks in the export cargo environment; they will not needlessly affect the movement of legitimate export cargo. The bill also proposes changes that will more closely align the legislation with existing air and sea cargo industry export business processes. These changes address concerns raised by the Australian National Audit Office in its review of the ‘Cargo Management Re-engineering Project'. This bill will improve Customs and Border Protection's ability to deal with goods in licensed depots and warehouses as well as aligning the procedures and terminology that apply to the two schemes, providing clarity to licence holders. This includes new provisions for the suspension and cancellation of depot licences. The bill will also enable the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to specify conditions on depot and warehouse licences to ensure compliance with other laws of the Commonwealth or a state or territory, and it will introduce strict liability offences for breaches of licence conditions. These changes are designed to support the security improvement initiatives relating to export cargo. In response to industry suggestions, the bill will remove a requirement for reporting cargo on board lost or wrecked ships or aircraft where a report has already been made and it will remove some redundant provisions. Customs and Border Protection has consulted industry extensively on the changes in this bill through a principles paper in 2008 and the release of an exposure draft of the bill in February 2011. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA (2012 HARMONIZED SYSTEM CHANGES) BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
7,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"GortonMinister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information) (9.31 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011 contains approximately 800 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These amendments implement changes resulting from the World Customs Organization fourth review of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System. Australia is a signatory to the Harmonized System and since 1988, the Harmonized System has formed the basis of Australia's commodity classifications for traded goods, both imports and exports. The Harmonized System is a hierarchical system that uniquely identifies all traded goods and commodities. Over 200 countries use the Harmonized System. Australia has implemented the Harmonized System domestically through the Customs Tariff Act 1995 for imports and the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification for exports. As a signatory to the Harmonized System, Australia is required to implement the changes resulting from the fourth review on 1 January 2012. The amendments concentrate on environmental and social issues that are of global concern, including the use of the Harmonized System for identifying goods that are of importance to the food security program of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations such as certain fish species and products. The Harmonized System changes will create new subheadings for specific chemicals. These include pesticides such as tributyltin compounds and ozone-depleting substances such as halogenated derivatives of hydrocarbons. This will facilitate the monitoring and control of international trade in these products under the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The bill will clarify texts to ensure the uniform application of the Harmonized System. The Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes and Other Measures) Bill 2011 will also amend Schedules 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These schedules give effect to the application of customs duty on imported goods in accordance with Australia's bilateral free trade agreements with the United States, Thailand and Chile and Australia's regional agreement with ASEAN and New Zealand. The bill will also preserve existing levels of industry protection and margins of tariff preference that apply to imported goods, including goods imported under the free trade agreements. This bill will provide certainty for Australia's importers and exporters and ensures that Australia classifies its goods and commodities in accordance with the Harmonized System and in a manner that is consistent with its major trading partners. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA BILL (No. 2) 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
8,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"GortonMinister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information) (9.36 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011. This bill contains amendments that are integral to the government's efforts to tackle serious and organised crime, and to ensure the integrity of our law enforcement processes. Firstly, the bill contains amendments to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 to bring the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs) within the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (the commission). The commission was established in 2006 to investigate allegations of corruption and to enhance the integrity of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. It currently oversees all of the activities the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission and investigates allegations of corruption relating to the former National Crime Authority. From 1 January 2011, the commission has had oversight of the law enforcement functions of Customs, following the prescription of Customs in regulations made under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act. The bill being introduced today will amend the act to enable the commission to oversight all Customs' functions. It is important to ensure that the commission has oversight of all Customs' functions because of the close relationship between Customs' law enforcement functions and many of its non-law enforcement functions. For example, administrative staff and employees employed in other areas of Customs provide support or have access to the agency's law enforcement functions, information and systems. The government considers it is appropriate, therefore, that Customs be brought under the commission's purview on a whole-ofagency basis. And this can only be achieved by including Customs in the act. Placing Customs within the commission's jurisdiction will also give effect to a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity in its interim report on the inquiry into the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act. The government is committed to ensuring the integrity of federal law enforcement agencies in Australia, and equipping the commission with the powers necessary to oversight these agencies. Schedule 2 of the bill contains the other key element of the bill, and delivers an imof portant Gillard government election commitment to combat serious and organised crime. Organised crime is estimated to cost Australia anywhere between $10 billion and $15 billion each year. This is money that is created outside of the legal economy, is diverted from legitimate services, and often is the result of fraud or theft from Australian zens. The government has provided a comprehensive response to this threat; we established the Organised Crime Strategic Framework in 2009, and developed the Organised Crime Response Plan in 2010, both of which recognise the need for a multiagency approach to combating organised crime. This bill is the next step in this work. Schedule 2 of the bill will support the newly established Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce, led by the Australian Federal Police, which will strike at the very heart of organised crime, its financial motivation. The task force commenced operations in January of this year, bringing together expertise in intelligence, operations, forensic counting, litigation and specialist law enforcement to ensure a highly integrated approach to criminal asset confiscation. Its main objective is to enhance the identification of potential criminal asset confiscation matters and strengthen their pursuit. To support this work, schedule 2 of the bill will amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to enable the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to commence proceeds of crime litigation on behalf of the government's Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce. Currently, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is the only authority that is able to conduct proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The amendments contained in this bill will ensure that the AFP has that same power. Extending the act to include the AFP will enable the task force to become a specialised unit focused on proactively investigating and litigating proceeds of crime matters, which will lead to the more effective pursuit of criminal assets. And ultimately, the objective is to ensure that more proceeds of crime citi- money is returned to the community for crime prevention and diversion initiatives. Under these amendments, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Federal Police will also have the ability to transfer responsibility for proceeds of crime matters between the two agencies, allowing either authority to take over matters initiated by the other, where appropriate. In addition, the bill contains proceeds of crime related amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. The Family Law Act currently sets out procedures for the stay of proceedings when action is being taken at the same time under the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime Act. The amendments will make these same procedures available when action is being ac- taken under state or territory proceeds of crime legislation. This will allow family law proceedings relating to property and spousal maintenance to be stayed or set aside where there are Commonwealth, state or territory proceeds of crime proceedings on foot. These amendments are consistent with the government's commitment to ensuring that proceeds of crime are vigorously pursued. Schedule 2 also contains two amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act to extend the definition of ‘property-tracking document' to ensure a magistrate can issue a production order for documents relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings, and to improve the interaction between collection of tax-related liabilities and proceeds of crime proceedings. These measures are aimed at ensuring the full picture is before the court when orders are made. These elements of the bill show the government's clear commitment to addressing serious and organised crime in our community, by targeting the proceeds of their illicit activity. We know that organised crime crosses both state and national borders. We also know that organised crime groups rely on the profits from their crimes-money is the lifeblood of their organisations. The task force is aimed at attacking the architecture of organised crime groups by taking the profit out of crime. These changes are fundamental to achieving the proactive and dynamic approach to asset confiscation needed to detect and deter organised criminal activity in Australia, and I am confident the results will speak for themselves.

Second Reading",28
9,Ms KATE ELLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.44 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill implements the government's response to the review of the Comcare scheme, as well as introducing certain other associated amendments. The Comcare scheme provides workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements for employees of the Australian government and for some private sector corporations that self-insure their workers compensation liabilities under the scheme. In late 2007, federal Labor undertook to review the Comcare scheme-in particular, its self-insurance arrangements which provide for the entry of private-sector corporations into the scheme. The review was to ensure that the Comcare scheme has suitable occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements for self-insurers and their employees. On 25 September 2009, the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Minister Gillard, announced a number of improvements to the Comcare scheme arising out of the review. On 26 November 2009, the Occupational Health and Safety and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 was introduced into parliament to implement these improvements; however, the bill lapsed when the parliament was prorogued. The bill that I am introducing today will implement the improvements arising from the review of the Comcare scheme through amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the SRC Act). The bill also makes amendments to respond to policy issues unrelated to the review to address Comcare's access to the consolidated revenue fund and also workers compensation coverage for employees working in high risk environments overseas. To encourage timely determination of workers compensation claims, the bill amends the SRC Act to enable the setting of statutory time limits within which claims must be determined. Claims determined quickly tend to be shorter in duration and less costly. The bill also reinstates workers compensation coverage for off-site recess breaks. This will realign the Comcare scheme with most jurisdictions and remove the inequity in coverage for employees whose employers do not provide on-site facilities for meal breaks. This amendment will cost Comcare $1.7 million in 2010-11, indexed for the out years. However since these injuries are currently only claimable through Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, reinstating coverage will result in a net saving to the PBS of $136,000 in 2010-11, also indexed for the out years. Furthermore, the bill amends the SRC Act so that medical and related costs will continue to be paid where a worker's weekly compensation benefits are suspended for refusing to participate in the rehabilitation process. Suspending weekly compensation benefits can be a useful incentive to encourage claimants to comply with the requirement to undergo appropriate rehabilitation and return work programs. However, suspending medical and related payments can be counterproductive to early rehabilitation and return to work. This reform will have a negligible financial impact on Comcare's premiums pool of around $24,000 per annum in 2010-11, indexed for the out years. Also as part of the response to the review, in early 2010, the then Minister for Workplace Relations directed Comcare to strengthen its OHS prevention and enforcement approach, including through more proactive interventions and improving the expertise of its investigators. The minister also requested Comcare to develop guidance material for employers to improve consultation with all workers on occupational health and safety matters. This was intended to ensure that consultation arrangements reflect the modern workplace, and extend beyond the traditional employee/employer relationship. Separately, under federal Labor the lump sum and weekly death benefits for the Comcare scheme were increased substantially from May 2008 to align them more closely with death benefits payable under the majority of state and territory workers compensation schemes. These measures, as well as the measures proposed in the bill, are designed to improve the Comcare scheme by reducing injuries; strengthening the focus on rehabilitation and return to work; and increasing benefits for injured workers. The bill also seeks to make a number of additional reforms to address issues that have arisen separately to the Comcare review. In particular, the bill amends the SRC Act to provide workers' compensation coverage for injuries sustained while an employee is to working in a ‘declared place' outside Australia, or where the person is a member of a ‘declared category' of employees whose work requires deployment to places outside Australia. It does this by enabling the minister to declare certain high risk places, for example, Afghanistan or Iraq, to be places where the SRC Act will be deemed to provide continuous coverage for all Commonwealth employees. The bill will also allow the minister to declare certain classes of employees to be covered while outside Australia. The need for this flexibility arises specifically in relation to the establishment of the Australian Civilian Corps, who will assist in disaster relief, stabilisation and post-conflict resolution in developing countries and failed states. The effect of these changes will be to provide 24/7 coverage under the SRC Act for employees exposed to unusually high risk while working outside Australia. The fiscal impact of these amendments will be in the order of $2 million per annum. Other amendments to the SRC Act contained in the bill will restore Comcare's access to the consolidated revenue fund to pay for its workers' compensation liabilities and associated expenses arising from longlatency injury claims, such as those related to asbestos exposure. Comcare's access to the consolidated revenue fund was closed off as an indirect result of a Federal Court decision in 2006. However, the intention of the SRC Act has been-and still is-that the consolidated revenue fund should fund these claims because they relate to employment-related injuries not covered by Comcare's premium system. This bill also contains technical amendments to the SRC Act, the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993 and the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 to cater for new arrangements and terminology introduced by the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (JOB SEEKER COMPLIANCE) BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Kate Ellis.

10,Ms KATE ELLIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.52 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill introduced today delivers on our government's election commitment to modernise Australia's welfare system and introduce tougher measures to ensure more unemployed people are getting back into work. Our government believes that the task of managing the Australian economy is important in that it ensures that all Australians who are capable of work, have the opportunity to do so. The Prime Minister has said that a job provides far more than just a pay packet and she is correct. With it, a job brings dignity and purpose to a person's life; it provides economic security for a family now and into the future; and it connects people with their communities, building a more socially cohesive Australia. It is because we understand the value of having a job that when the global financial crisis threatened the jobs of so many Australians, it was this government that stood up and took action-saving hundreds of thousands of Australians from losing their job. Our stimulus strategy created work opportunities for small businesses, tradespeople and suppliers in communities, towns and cities right around the country. Australia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was five per cent in February 2010-around half that of the United States and of most European countries. But with our economy returning to strength and our mining sector booming, now is not a time for complacency. It is a time to turn our sights to what still needs to be done. There remain too many Australians who are without a job, some for a full year or more; too many Australians who are not engaging in mainstream economic and social life; too many Australians who are capable of work but have to rely on unemployment benefits. We know that most job seekers are genuine in their efforts to find work. For most, unemployment is temporary. But for some, unemployment has become long term. The government is willingly doing its part to ensure that those people are supported financially while they look for a job. The government has advanced major reforms to Australia's employment services that are providing much more effective assistance to job seekers. The greatest reform sociated with the introduction of the new disability employment service has been the uncapping of program places, resulting in an additional 72,000 job seekers with disability accessing this service now compared with the previous coalition government. Also, Job Services Australia is delivering more tailored and flexible employment services with a particular focus on disadvantaged job seekers. As a result, since Job Services Australia began operating, 36 per cent of more than 686,500 job placements were for the most disadvantaged job seekers. Engagement by job seekers with those services is vital and that is what this bill is about. For many years the rate at which job seekers attend appointments with employment service providers has been around 55 per cent. While some job seekers may unavoidably need to miss an appointment because they are genuinely sick, start a job at short notice or have other valid reasons, I believe that attendance at appointmentsappointments designed to help job seekers get into work-can and must improve. This is why we made an election commitment to strengthen the compliance system. This bill will introduce suspension of payment for job seekers following an initial failure to attend an appointment. As soon as Centrelink is advised seeker has missed an appointment with their employment services provider, or if the provider believes that the job seeker has become disengaged from an activity they are supposed to be participating in, Centrelink will suspend the job seeker's payment. Job seekers who have been identified by Centrelink as vulnerable, such as those who are homeless or who have a mental illness, will not have their payments suspended in the first instance. When Centrelink contacts the job seeker, as- another appointment will be booked for them. As part of this contact with Centrelink, if the job seeker agrees to attend the rescheduled appointment Centrelink will immediately release the job seeker's payment, and they will get back paid. At that contact job seekers will also be very clearly advised by Centrelink that not attending the next appointment may result in both a suspension and a penalty through loss of payment. All job seekers will be required to attend a rescheduled appointment-regardless of their reason for missing the first appointment. If the job seeker attends the rescheduled appointment, they will not be penalised. However, if the job seeker does not attend the rescheduled appointment, payment will again be suspended. This time-if they do not have a reasonable excuse-they will lose payment for each day from the second missed appointment until they do attend a rescheduled appointment. There will be no back payment for this period. This penalty will be deducted from their very next payment. This bill is not about punishing Australians who have a valid reason for missing an appointment. Suspension is not about punishing job seekers for punishment's sake. The job seeker is either paid back in full or payment resumes when they do what is rethat a job quired of them. But these changes will give the job seeker no choice but to agree to re-engage with employment services and be serious about finding work-if they want to receive income support. We want more job seekers actively engaging in work experience activities, in training, in participation programs so that they are getting the skills and experience that they need to find a sustainable job into the future. Under current legislation, penalties for failing to reconnect cannot be deducted from the job seeker's payment for the fortnight in which the penalty is applied-penalties must be deducted from a later payment. The effect of this delay has been to disconnect the penalty from the failure to attend an appointment. By making the penalty more immediate we can provide a more direct deterrent for job seekers who are not taking their appointment responsibilities seriously. This government is committed to lifting workforce participation and extending the benefits of work to more Australians of working age. We will continue to do all we can to provide income support recipients with opportunities to work and in return we expect them to take responsibility for making the most of those opportunities. We are proud of our efforts, striving for record levels of participaduce tion in the Australian workforce. The Australian economy is forecast to grow, with Treasury estimating real GDP growth of 3¼ per cent over 2010-11. Sound management of the Australian economy during this period has involved investment in infrastructure for our long-term benefit as well as job creation measures targeting our regions with high unemployment. All Australians on income support should have the opportunity of work-but with opportunity comes responsibility-and with this bill we are going to firmly expect that people meet those responsibilities. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Ley) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",32
11,Mr SHORTEN,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10.00 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce this bill which will amend the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 in two ways. Firstly, schedule 1 to the bill will modify and streamline the structure of the act and remove the majority of its existing schedules, which contain the texts of Australia's bilateral tax treaties. This will simplify the presentation of the operative provisions of the act and incorporate the treaty texts by reference to accessible online resources. This amendment is not intended to alter the entry into force or application of Australia's tax treaties but it will substantially rethe size of the act, which has become one of the largest acts on the Commonwealth's statute books. Secondly, schedule 2 to the bill will give the force of law in Australia to new bilateral taxation agreements with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey. Chile and Turkey The agreements with Chile and Turkey are comprehensive tax treaties that will promote closer economic cooperation between Australia and Chile and Australia and Turkey, by reducing taxation barriers to bilateral trade and investment, in particular by eliminating double taxation of income arising from overlapping tax jurisdictions. The Chilean and Turkish treaties will also improve the integrity of the tax system by providing the framework through which the Commissioner of Taxation can cooperate bilaterally with his Chilean and Turkish counterparts to prevent tax evasion. The internationally accepted approach to meeting the above policy objectives is to conclude a bilateral tax treaty. These two treaties are largely based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries, with some mutually agreed variations reflecting the economic, legal and cultural interests of Austrafered lia, Chile and Turkey. Malaysia The agreement with Malaysia is a protocol which will amend the current AustraliaMalaysia tax treaty to update the exchange of information article in that treaty to the rent international standard, as endorsed by the OECD, the G20 and the United Nations. The updated exchange of information provisions are an important tool in Australia's efforts to combat offshore tax evasion and will make it harder for taxpayers to evade Australian tax by increasing the probability of detection of abusive tax arrangements. Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa The agreements with Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa seek to eliminate double taxation on certain income derived by individuals, in particular government workers, students and business apprentices, and pensioners and retirees. Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa are required to provide reciprocal taxation treatment in relation to Australian government employees, students and business apprentices, retirees and pensioners. These four agreements will also provide a mutual agreement procedure for the resolution of taxpayer disputes involving transfer pricing adjustments. These agreements were prompted by Australia's desire to conclude tax information exchange agreementsTIEAs-with Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa. The TIEAs establish a legal basis for the exchange of taxpayer information between two countries and are an important tool in Australia's efforts to combat tax avoidance and evasion. The agreements contained in this bill are part of a package of additional benefits ofto Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa in order to secure the TIEAs signed in 2009 with each of those jurisdictions. Each of the new agreements with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, curSamoa and Turkey will enter into force after Australia exchanges diplomatic notes with each of the other countries advising of the completion of their respective domestic law requirements.

12,Ms KING,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport) (10.05 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will make changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to further enhance the regulatory framework for therapeutic goods and provide additional support for the new streamlined processes being implemented to bring improvements to the time within which prescription medicines are evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. A number of initiatives were identified in a review of the application and evaluation processes for prescription medicines that could help eliminate unnecessary delays, including those arising from the provision of incomplete or insufficient data. Implementation of these initiatives is expected to result in a reduction of the current 500 days for an application to be determined to approximately 300 days. The TGA has been working to streamline the submission process both for the registration of new prescription medicines and for making changes to the entries of prescription medicines in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. A 12-month implementation phase for the new streamlined submission and evaluation processes commenced on 1 November 2010. Changes to the act to support these processes were made by the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2010 Measures No.1) Act 2010. This bill includes further changes to add legislative support to the new processes. Prior to implementation of the streamlined procedures, prescription medicines application submissions were generally accepted for evaluation in the expectation that further documentation could be lodged and information provided during the evaluation process. This, coupled with often lengthy response times to the requests from the TGA for further information or documents, substantially added to the evaluation completion time. The amendment proposed in the bill will provide that, when an application is made to make changes to a prescription medicine's entry in the register which involves evaluation of clinical, preclinical or bioequivalence data, the applicant must provide adequate information in the required form and manner and pay any prescribed fee for the application to be effective and therefore accepted for evaluation. This requirement is designed to ensure that the necessary information will be supplied at the appropriate time to enable an evaluation to take place within agreed time frames. Applications that do not meet these requirements will not be accepted for evaluation. This reflects the rules already in place under the act in relation to applications for new entries in the register for prescription medicines. The new streamlined submission processes will provide greater clarity about TGA requirements for granting marketing approval for medicines and making changes to prescription medicine register entries, encourage a higher standard of application submissions, provide more predictable time lines, increase transparency in the management of evaluations and, importantly, remove unnecessary delays in the evaluation process. This bill will also make a change to the way evaluation fees are collected by the TGA. Completion of evaluations of prescription medicines is subject to prescribed time lines under the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. Where the TGA fails to meet these time lines, the evaluation fee payable by an applicant is reduced by 25 per cent. Currently, sponsors applying to register prescription medicines initially pay three-quarters of the evaluation fee, with the remaining one-quarter payable only if the TGA completes the evaluation within the time frames set out in the regulations. Since the implementation of time limits for completing evaluations for prescription medicines in 1992, the TGA has only failed to complete evaluations on time on about 15 occasions. The collection of 75 per cent of fees and the recovery of the remaining 25 per cent owing applies only to applications requiring the evaluation of clinical, preclinical and bioequivalence data associated with prescription medicines. The administrative burden in invoicing applicants twice to recover the full evaluation fees payable, and monitoring each application until completion in order to send the second invoice to recover the remaining 25 per cent of fees owing, is not warranted given TGA's track record of completing evaluations on time. Additional administrative costs are passed on to industry as the TGA operates on a full cost recovery basis. The amendment will mean the TGA collect the full evaluation fee when an application is accepted for evaluation and must refund 25 per cent of that fee if they do not complete the evaluation within the prescribed time limit. This is a more efficient way of recovering moneys owing to the Commonwealth. The final amendment included in the bill relates to the operation of a ministerial power to make determinations for the purpose of imposing standard conditions on the registration or listing of therapeutic goods. mainly prescription, over-the-counter or complementary medicines and therapeutic devices. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Act 2009 amended the Therapeutic Goods Act to enable a legislative instrument to be made by the minister that would set out the ‘standard' conditions to be imposed on the registration or listing of these goods. These conditions may relate to, for example, the manufacture, supply, use, custody or disposal of therapeutic goods included in the register. The legislation currently provides that once the minister makes such a determination, the new conditions will apply not only to the registration or listing of therapeutic goods after the instrument comes into effect but also to therapeutic goods already on the register. The removal of the old standard conditions is therefore necessary to ensure there will be no overlap or possible inconsistencies between the new conditions and those imposed as standard conditions on goods that have already been entered into the register. The bill includes amendments to ensure that the old standard conditions cease to apply when the first instrument takes effect. Any unique or special conditions applying to specific therapeutic goods entered in the register will continue to apply. The bill also contains an amendment enabling the instrument imposing the standard conditions to apply only to the registration or listing of therapeutic goods after the instrument comes into effect as there may be occasions when this is appropriate. The measures in this bill make important improvements to the operation of the regulatory framework for registered and listed therapeutic goods to the benefit of Australian These are consumers as well as industry. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Gambaro) adjourned. FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY NA NA AMENDMENT (FURTHER ELECTION NA MEASURES) BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Collins for Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",35
13,Ms COLLINS,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Franklin-Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services) (10.12 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill delivers on three important election commitments made by the government during the 2010 election campaign to improve support for Australian families and children. These will make the system of family tax benefit advances more flexible to better meet families' needs and make sure children have a health check before they start school. The bill also includes a measure from the 2010-11 budget on streamlining notification of compensation payments, along with some minor clarifications to family payments and technical amendments. An additional two election commitments for Australian families were included in an earlier bill. These were: - improved support for families with teenagers, which will provide substantial increases in family assistance for families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 in secondary school or vocational equivalent; and - better access to the baby bonus to assist families with the upfront costs of having a new baby. Together, these commitments will significantly improve the assistance available to Australian families to assist with the costs of raising children. More flexible family tax benefit advances The first election commitment in the bill being introduced today overhauls the advance payment rules for family tax benefit part A to better meet families' needs. This initiative is part of the government's Better Access to Family Payments package, which will give families improved and more flexible access to their family payments. One element of the Better Access to Family Payments package has already been introduced in a recent bill-a $500 upfront payment of the baby bonus for eligible parents. Managing the household budget can be a delicate balance, especially when something unexpected happens. The fridge or washing machine can break down, or a school uniform can get damaged and need replacing. The measure in this bill will ensure that advance payment rules for family tax benefit part A are more flexible, helping families deal with unexpected expenses. Under the new rules that will apply from 1 July 2011, families will have more choice over the size and timing of their advance payments. For some families, this new flexibility will mean avoiding higher credit card bills or small loans from high interest providers such as payday lenders. For others, it will make it easier to manage the family budget around one-off expenses like the car registration or a broken fridge. Currently the maximum advance amount is fixed at around $330 for six months for all families, and this full amount can only be advanced twice a year-on 1 July and 1 January. This means that families do not have the flexibility to request advances when they actually need them to meet unexpected costs. Under the new rules, families will be able to choose the value of their advance payment between minimum and maximum amounts. The minimum amount for all families will be 3.75 per cent of the maximum standard rate for a child aged under 13-this would give a minimum advance amount of around $160. The maximum amount will be linked to the family's usual annual rate of payment. Generally, a maximum of 7.5 per cent of that rate will be available for advance payment. For a family not receiving rent assistance, and with one child under 13, this would give a maximum advance amount of around $320. For a family not receiving rent assistance, and with two children under 13, the maximum advance would be around $640. The maximum advance would be higher for a family receiving rent assistance. An overall maximum will apply, set initially at $1,000 in 2011-12, and maintained at the same percentage of the maximum rate for one child under 13 as in the first year. Some families on the base rate of family tax benefit part A would have access to a smaller advance amount because of their smaller existing entitlements. Families will repay their advances through adjustments to their ongoing fortnightly family tax benefit part A entitlement in the lowing six months. From 1 July, families will be also able to request advances at any point in the year, and can have multiple advances up to their maximum advance amount. However, Centrelink will not approve advance payment requests if they would result in financial hardship. Families making repeated requests will also be assessed to see whether they may benefit from financial advice or financial counselling. There are currently around 1.5 million families that could benefit from this measure if they choose to take these more flexible family tax benefit advances. These reforms for families are similar to the improvements that this government has already implemented for age pensioners as part of its historic pension reforms. Healthy start for school The second election commitment delivered through this bill will set up a new requirement for income support recipient parents of four-year-olds, to make sure their children have a health check before they start school. The new arrangement will make payment of the family tax benefit part A supplement (which is paid to families at the end of a financial year) conditional for these families on the children undergoing a health assessment, such as the Healthy Kids Check. The new requirements apply to families where either member of a couple has received income support for any part of the year. The requirement will also apply to nonparent carers who have received family tax benefit for a child in their care for at least 26 fol- weeks, and who also received an income support payment at some time during the financial year. In addition, the new requirement will only apply to non-parent carers who still have the care of the child at the end of the financial year. Preschool health checks make sure children are healthy, fit and ready to learn when they start school. These important checks promote early detection of developmental issues and illnesses. Research indicates that disadvantaged children not only begin school less well prepared, but that early gaps persist and even widen as children progress through school. An early check is critical to help detect any developmental barriers, such as hearing or sight impairment. The health checks to be included will be set by ministerial determination. Many children receive health checks through child and maternal health clinics or through other health services. In 2008, the federal Labor government also introduced a Healthy Kids Check for four-year-olds so that families also have the option of receiving these services from a general practitioner or practice nurse Parents will need to confirm with Centrelink that the check has been done. There will be an exceptional circumstances provision to waive the new requirement, such as when the child has a severe disability or terminal illness. This requirement will apply from the entitlement year that begins on 1 July 2011 and it is estimated around 92,000 children aged four, whose families receive income support at some point in the year, will be affected by this measure each year. This important measure is another example of the government putting the health and well-being of children and families at the tre of our welfare reform agenda. The government's welfare reforms reflect the expectations of the broader Australian community-that people receiving welfare support should take personal responsibility for themselves and their families. People must participate in study, training or work and parents must care for their children. It builds on the new model of nondiscriminatory income management already rolled out in the Northern Territory, and the income management trials in Cape York and across metropolitan Perth and the Kimberley. Income management makes sure welfare payments are spent in the best interests of child. Income management is having positive results: - More welfare money is being spent on food, clothing and school related expenses and less on alcohol, gambling, cigarettes and drugs. - Over half of those who could have left the scheme in the Northern Territory have volunteered to stay on it-they find the BasicsCard is a helpful budgeting tool. And in Western Australia, two-thirds of people on compulsory income management and 82 per cent on voluntary income management said they recommended income management to othersa pretty good endorsement. Strengthening child support compliance In the third election commitment in this bill, the compliance regime on the use of default income in child support assessments will be strengthened. A new, more accurate, default income arrangement will be introduced that uses a parent's previous taxable income, increased by wages growth, instead of a lower default incen- come in cases where they have not lodged a tax return. Currently, when a parent has not lodged a tax return, their child support assessment is estimated at two-thirds of the male total average weekly earnings. However, this figure often understates the parent's actual income. Almost one in four child support cases have incorrect assessments due to late or non-lodgement of tax returns. Some parents have failed to lodge returns for over seven years. This non-compliance with tax obligations works against the policy objective of the Child Support Scheme that parents contribute towards the cost of raising their chilthe dren according to their capacity to pay. Under legislative changes made in 2006, and implemented during 2008, a new default income of two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings has applied in child support cases where a person does not lodge their tax return for more than two years. This default income is around $39,000 per annum. Since 1 July 2008, there has been a 570 per cent increase in the use of this default income where it is lower than the person's previous taxable income. To ensure a more accurate child support assessment and therefore better support for children in separated families, the new process will generally use the parent's last taxable income, indexed by the growth in average wages. However, if the current calculation of two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings would produce a higher income, that figure will be used instead. This measure will help ensure that child support assessments are fairer and more accurate and remove the unintended incentive for parents on higher incomes to benefit from a lower child support assessment if they do not lodge a tax return. Streamlining of compensation payments notification A measure from the 2010-11 budget will also be introduced in this bill. This measure will streamline the process trelink when payments are made by compensation payers and insurers. These compensation payers and insurers will now need to tell Centrelink before compensation payments (lump sum payments as well as ongoing periodic payments) are made to compensation recipients or their partners. The new requirement will help make sure people are paid their correct Centrelink tlements and avoid overpayments and unnecessary debts accruing. This measure will help simplify the process of Centrelink notification for recipients of compensation who also receive Centrelink payments. Minor amendments Lastly, some minor clarifications will be made to several family assistance and child support provisions. These clarifications do not change current policy. This bill delivers on three important election commitments and a measure from last year's budget. The measures in this bill will improve support for Australian families, improve child support assessments and help known prevent compensation recipients accruing unnecessary debts with Centrelink. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Gambaro) adjourned. NA Approval of Proposal",38

16,Mr FLETCHER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"When I was rudely interrupted last night, I was saying all of us in this place are united by our pride. That is the point at which I stopped-and obviously that sentence could admit of many possible ways in which it might be completed-but the particular aspect that I wish to point to, in which I say that all of us in this place are united our pride, is our pride in the fact that Austrawith lia is one of the world's great democracies. We are one of the world's oldest democracies and we are one of the world's most successful democracies. Clearly, at the base, at the foundation, of being a successful democracy is to have a voting system of integrity-a system in which the people can have confidence and a system which is beyond reproach in its operation in reflecting the people's will in selecting their parliamentary representatives. It follows from that that it is of the first importance to protect the integrity of the ing system by ensuring that persons who claim to be entitled to vote can demonstrate that entitlement and that there is no risk of persons who claim to be entitled to vote but are not in fact entitled to vote being able to lodge a vote and having that vote counted. It is of the first importance that there is no risk that such a scenario can come to pass. When you consider that it is often the case that there are results in particular divisions determined by very narrow counts, it adds weight to the conclusion that we must be scrupulous in protecting the integrity of the voting system and scrupulous in ensuring that not one person who is not entitled to do so under the law is able to cast a vote. Let me instance just one recent result which demonstrates that proposition. In the seat of Bowman in the 2007 election, if a mere 33 votes had changed direction, the result would have been different-and, I venture to suggest, this parliament would have been a vastly poorer place had the present member for Bowman not been returned, as he happily was, albeit only very narrowly. In the ordinary course of events, persons who are on the roll and can demonstrate that-because their name is there in front of the returning officer or AEC officer when by they turn up to vote-are permitted to vote no further formalities required. They have carried out the necessary formalities in the exercise of getting on the roll. But that is not the scenario we are talking about in this legislation. We are talking about people wishing to cast a provisional vote, and a provisional vote, if I may remind the House, is a vote cast in circumstances where an elector's name cannot be found on the roll or the name has already been marked off the roll. The law as it stands states that, in these exceptional circumstances, there is a requirement that the person who has turned up at the polling booth asserting a right to cast a vote but vot- whose name cannot be found on the roll or whose name is on the roll but is marked off as having already voted, is required to provide proof of identity. As I have already observed in the earlier proportion of these bifurcated remarks, it is not unusual in our society to be asked to produce identification. Frankly, it is slightly surprising to see the confected indignation from the other side of the chamber at the requirement that identification be produced in the circumstances I have just describedcircumstances I think we can all agree are exceptional and very much in the minority. The proposition that I put to the House is, first of all, that it is very important that we protect the integrity of our voting system. That is of the first importance, given the reputation that this nation has as one of the world's great democracies, a reputation that I am sure all of us in this place are united in our determination to protect. The second proposition I wish to put to the House is that the costs of requiring identification in these circumstances are modest and the benefits are significant. The report of the Joint ing Committee on Electoral Matters concludes that some 80 per cent of persons in this category-that is, seeking to cast a provisional vote-were able to provide identification. In other words, the claimed burden of this requirement is nowhere near as great as those on the other side of the chamber would have us believe. We also heard further confected indignation about the remarkably onerous nature of this obligation-again remembering that it is a relatively small proportion of people who face this obligation because either their name is not on the roll or it is on the roll but the official goes to cross out the name he or she finds it has already been crossed out. not, I would submit, an unusually onerous requirement of people in these circumstances to provide identification. As a requirement in terms of individual responsibility, I suggest is not an onerous one. The costs of the present arrangement in public policy terms and in terms of the imposition on individuals are modest indeed. The benefits are significant, because they go to preserving the confidence of all Australians in the integrity of our voting system and, in turn, in the integrity of our democracy. The third point I wish to make-and I do so with some reluctance, but the historical record commands me to make it-is that there are reasons, regrettably, to raise questions about the rationale of those on the other side of the chamber for putting forward this change in the first place. It gives me no pleasure to note that the Labor Party has form in bringing forward changes to the electoral system, the voting system and much of the regulatory apparatus dealing with our democracy which are supposedly motivated by a high-minded concern for the public good but which are in fact substantively driven by a desire to achieve partisan politiStand- cal advantage. You would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, that it gives me absolutely no pleasure to make this point, but unfortunately the historical record is simply impossible to ignore. We saw some years ago in Queensland the unedifying spectacle of a former state secretary of the Australian Labor Party, then a serving member of the Queensland parliament, appearing before the Shepherdson inquiry. When he appeared, he was asked about the address at which he had enrolled some years before as a younger man, when he was starting out in the pursuit of his powhen litical ambitions. He initially attempted to avoid the question, but after taking a break, It is presumably to receive legal advice, he returned to the box to advise that it was in fact correct that his name appeared on the roll at that address but it was also correct that he it had never actually lived at that address. It was apparently an unfortunate administrative error-such an unfortunate administrative error that the consequence was that he abruptly resigned as a member of the Queensland parliament. So there is very clear evidence of the Labor Party-including its most senior officials and, indeed, Labor parliamentariansseeking to play games with the electoral system in this country for partisan political vantage. It gives me no additional pleasure to note with some concern that this gentleman has now been appointed as a senior executive of the National Broadband Network company at a salary of well over $400,000 a year",42
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,I would ask the member for Bradfield to relate his remarks to this bill.,44
18,Mr FLETCHER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"his principal qualification apparently being that he was a good mate of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.",44
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The member for Bradfield will cease speaking while I make the observation to him that he needs to relate his remarks to the bill before the House, which is a bill concerning provisional voting.",44
20,Mr FLETCHER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right-it is a bill concerning provisional voting. And amongst the policy matters to consider as we assess whether the change which is proposed in this bill is good policy are the implications it will have for the integrity of our voting system, and that necessarily asks us to consider what might be the possible motives of the political party that has brought forward this amendment. In the state of New South Wales we have also seen the Labor government, after spending years enthusiastically hoovering up donations from certain categories of donors, now banning those donations from tobacco companies, from alcohol companies and from gaming and gambling companies. This is a remarkably late conversion to this new-found standard of virtue, and it could cause any objective observer to ask, ‘How could they be so shameless and transparent?' Yet this is the party which is putting forward the set of amendments in this bill. Our voting system is of the highest imporad- tance to the integrity of our democracy. The measures which this bill puts forward are not in the public interest. They undermine a well-established and important safeguard, and on this side of the House we say they should be rejected.",44
21,Ms BRODTMANN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise today to speak in favour of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. I do so because I fundamentally believe that what this bill will achieve is the correct and moral thing, despite the way that the former speaker was outrageously construing it. It is a fact that in the 2007 federal election over 27,000 votes were rejected at a preliminary scrutiny because of issues over the provision of identity. In 2010, more than 28,000 votes were eliminated-hardly the small number that was suggested by those opposite today. What concerns me about this figure is that, in a later examination of the votes, it was found that the name was in fact on the roll in over 12,000 cases. I was also shocked to hear that the current state of provisional voting has not always prevailed. In the 2004 election, almost 50 per cent of provisional votes were included in the final count. In the 2007 election, this figure plummeted to 14 per cent. Of the more than 168,000 provisional votes cast, just over 24,000 were counted. Why was this so? Was there a sudden and dramatic increase in potential voter fraud? No, there was not. What actually happened was that the then Howard government decided to change the electoral laws. Perhaps, in a similar fashion to which it was motivated to make changes to laws on the closure of the electoral roll, the Howard government was motivated by the realisation that provisional voters have a tendency not to vote for the coalition. For example, following the 2004 election, the national two-party preferred vote was 53 per cent to 47 per cent in favour of the coalition. This contrasts with the exact opposite which is seen when analysing the two-party preferred breakdown of provisional votes. Whether or not this was a conscious decision of the previous government to disenfranchise those voters who traditionally did not support them. I do not know. What I do know is that, as a result of these changes to both provisional voting and the electoral roll, people. thousands of Australians who should have been given the chance to choose their government and their representatives were denied their political rights. The kinds of changes that came in 2006 disproportionably affected vulnerable groups-groups we should be encouraging to participate in our electoral system. These include the young, those voting for the first time and people with particular vulnerabilities: the marginalised. While I understand that there is a need to strike a balance between the integrity of the electoral system and the enfranchisement of the people, I do not believe those changes in 2006 were motivated by concerns of integrity, despite what the previous speaker was saying, and nor did they achieve it. It was not a victory for democracy in this countryquite the contrary. It is a sad truth that in many countries various provisions have been used to disenfranchise voters at elections while still providing for universal suffrage in theory. I note in particular the various Jim Crow laws in the United States that were used so effectively in ensuring that African-Americans were prevented from enrolling and voting in elections. These kinds of laws create obstacle after obstacle that a potential voter must overcome in order to achieve what is a fundamental human right. Article 21.3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures. I believe it is our responsibility as members of this parliament to ensure that Australia lives up to this article. I believe we must, wherever we can, make such laws as enhance the enfranchisement of the Australian There are a number of legitimate reasons why a voter may have to cast a provisional vote. First is if their name cannot be found on the certified list. Others are if their name is marked as already having voted, if there is some question about identity or if the voter is on the silent elector list. As the law stands, a voter is required to provide proof of identity by the first Friday following the polling day. If it is not provided, the vote is removed from consideration. There are any number of reasons why a voter may not be able to provide appropriate identity-for example, if they do not have a drivers licence or a passport and so have difficulty in supplying appropriate documentation. There is also a stunning contradiction at the heart of the law as it presently stands. This requirement to provide proof of identity applies only to provisional votes and to no other form of declaration vote. That is right: no other method of voting is subject to this rule. This leads to an absurd situation. If the voter had instead decided to lodge an absentee ballot, their vote would in fact have been counted. This contradiction exposes the incoherence of the provision and possibly also the discrimination that I fear lies behind it. Significantly, the provision disproportionately affects more vulnerable groups compared to others in our society. There are those who for reasons of homelessness, disability or other vulnerability find it difficult to navigate the bureaucratic complexity of modern life. And it is not only the vulnerable who find this difficult; for many, the vicissitudes of life have placed burdens and responsibilities on them that consume all their energy. I have some sympathy for those labouring under the burdens of everyday life. Coming from the background that I do-being the daughter of a mother who single-handedly raised my sisters and me, I can readily understand that having the time to deal with bureaucratic niceties can be a bit of a luxury. For reasons that are sadly familiar, those who are in this situation are often, if not mostly, women. I can therefore understand why some people simply do not have the ability or time to provide the documentation required under the current legislation. This does not mean that they are any less deserving of a vote at our elections-any less entitled to that most fundamental of human rights: enfranchisement. A number of organisations, including the Australian Electoral Commission, support this legislation. It would indeed be a cause for celebration if those opposite could bring themselves to join in with their support and atone for their imposition of a discriminatory obstacle to the exercise of a political right. Sadly, this does not seem to be the case. This legislation will enhance and modernise our electoral system and our democracy, and I commend it to the House.",44
22,Mr BRIGGS,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 and follow the member for Canberra in doing so. I hate to disappoint the member opposite, but we will not be supporting the bill. We think it is a bad bill. We have thought it is a bad bill the couple of times it has been presented to the parliament, and that is because in 2006 the Howard government did the right thing and brought in provisions ensuring the integrity of the electoral roll-and that is ultimately the question that we are debating here. On this side of the House, the understanding is that you need to have an electoral roll that has the utmost integrity and that enfranchises as many people as it can but ensures there is no fraud. That is important because we are very fortunate to have the wonderful democracy that we do in Australia. We have arguably the best democracy in the world. We have free and open elections that are free from questions about corruption and legitimacy and that allow governments even in questionable circumstances like last year's, where we had the situation of this parliament-a hung parliament. There has been no question put in relation to the legitimacy of the government. Even in the great democracy of the United States we have seen presidential elections which have dragged on for weeks and months because of questions about their electoral system and their electoral rolls. And it is not just the events surrounding George W. Bush's election; well back even to the famous John F. Kennedy election in the early sixties there were questions about Lyndon Johnson's accession to the Senate. We do not suffer from those same problems because we have an electoral roll which is protected from question. It is held above accusations that it has been rorted in some way. The problem with lessening the protections in it is that you raise questions about the validity or integrity of the roll. It is interesting that at the 2010 election, of the provisional voters who voted in that fashion, 80 per cent of them provided evidence of their identity at the polling place on the election day and a following 16 per cent provided evidence of their identification in the required time frame afterwards. So we are talking about a very small percentage who did not meet those requirements. And I do not think the requirements as put by the members opposite are as onerous as they would like us to believe. We of course need identification for various things in our society: to access government payments, to drive a car or to travel, you need a form of identification-and rightly so. And rightly so we also should for our electoral roll. I think there is a reasonable discussion, which we have had in this place previously, about the requirements for voter identification when enrolling and voting on election day. I think we should do everything we can to ensure the roll is protected in that way. So the bill is based on a premise from the Labor Party that the voters they are supposedly trying to enfranchise are more likely to vote for the Labor Party than they are for the Liberal Party, and that is what this is about. This is not about improving our election system or improving our electoral roll. This is some sort of political view that by opening this up and making it easier you have more opportunity for the Labor Party to get more votes than this side of the House. This Saturday we have another election in Australia and I do not think there will be too many questions about the integrity of the result. I think it will be pretty clear-in fact, I think some betting agencies have already decided what the result will be, which does seem to be a little early. Again, it goes to the confidence that people have in our electoral system. At a time when we are talking about using the internet more often, the AEC is walking down the path-I think rightly-of looking at the way that people can enrol and keep their details updated. I am sure all members in this place would appreciate that the quicker we get updates the better it is for members of parliament, the better it is for people to have the most recent updates, particularly for young people who move around a bit. The easier we make it for people to keep the AEC updated with their movements the better. Again, it has to be done in a fashion that does not question the integrity of the roll and does not raise the risk of an election being brought into question at some time. We have very good processes for dealing with questionable elections, but we do not face them very often. We do not face them to the point where a government's or parliament's legitimacy is questioned, because of the strength of our electoral system. This is something that we on this side of the House have had a commitment to for a very long time. As I said earlier, in 2006 we decided this was important because it added to the strength of commitment to ensuring the integrity of the roll. I think members on the other side are ill advised to move down this path. This is a bad decision. It is a bad bill because it undoes good changes to a system which is working very well. We have seen that it is working very well from the field evidence. If we look at the results from provisional voting at the last election we can see it did not cause some great dislocation in people's ability to cast a provisional vote, as the previous member said. There are circumstances where provisional votes are required, and that should continue. But it should continue with the added protection that is in the system today. Overturning this protection, based on what I think are very questionable motives, is something that we should not support. On the side of the House, we do not support it. We have had a commitment to this issue and we continue to maintain that commitment. Personally I continue to maintain that commitment because there is no more important thing in our electoral system than the roll and making sure it is protected from questionable voting and questionable tactics. It must be above repudiation in all those ways, ensuring legitimacy for governments and for all of us who are elected to this place. That is why we stand for these protections. We stand for the protections that were put into this system in 2006. There is no great need for change. The Labor Party is taking an ideological position. This is an unfortunate bill and it should be opposed.",46
23,Mr MELHAM,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to support the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 and I do so in the knowledge that this bill is consistent with a principle under which this parliament should be operating when it comes to elections, and that is the principle of enfranchisement, not disenfranchisement. We have had two High Court decisions in recent times that have struck down legislation of the Howard government that went to the very heart of disenfranchising voters. The first decision was in the Roach case to do with prisoner voting. It was a 4-2 decision of the High Court reinstating the principles as they were before the former government had legislated and in effect disqualified a class of prisoners from the vote. The second decision, and the most recent one to do with this election, was the 4-3 decision of the High Court in the case of Rowe, which was about the seven-day enrolment procedure. Talking about ideology, some of these people were appointed to the High Court by the former government. Justice Crennan could hardly be said to be a radical and she was in the majority of four. The joint judgment in that case of Justices Gummow and Bell went to the seven-day rule, which I think is a principle that we need to listen to. In paragraphs 166 to 167 they said: In particular, the requirement in Roach that any disqualification be for a substantial reason be answered simply by what may appear to have been legislative purpose. A legislative purpose of preventing such fraud before it is able to occur, where there has not been previous systemic fraud associated with the operation of the seven-day period before the changes made by the 2006 act, does not supply a substantial reason for the practical operation of the 2006 act in disqualifying large numbers of electors. That practical operation goes beyond any advantage in preserving the integrity of the electoral process from a hazard which so far has not materialised to any significant degree. So what they then did was reinstate the seven-day provisions. In relation to provisional voting the same is true. The paranoia of those opposite who say, ‘We require proof of identity, we require a drivers licence before we're going to let you have a vote or we'll give you seven days to bring it back,' has disqualified thousands of voters. What did the Electoral Commission do in their submission to my parliamentary committee, the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Electoral Matters? They nailed it. In paragraph 5.5.6 they said: Of the 28 065 provisional votes rejected on the basis that the elector did not provide EOI, 12 227 of these were cast by electors who were actually enrolled. Those voters took a provisional vote because their name could not be found on the day and that is the provision they were bound under. They were subsequently found to be on the rolls. But because the clerk did not pick that up on the day, maybe because of a misspelling or a wrong pronunciation-because a lot of this is non-English-speaking background-they were all knocked off the roll. What was the criterion before, which we are reinstating? We are reinstating the old provision that says that you sign when you get a provisional vote, it gets scrutinised, and there are scrutineers present, and if there is doubt as to the signature you get knocked out. Your cannot signature becomes the proof of identity. Today we heard from the National Party; they made a submission before our committee. Now, the signature provision still applies to declaration votes other than provisional votes; that is the nonsense here. And cop this, Mr Deputy Speaker: this is what they said, on page 5 of their submission, in relation to the signature provision: The AEC has subsequently advised The Nationals that there were 5,549 PVCs rejected nationally due to signature mismatch. What I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the member opposite is that there is a proof of identity provision that has always been there. It is the signature. These votes do not go into the ballot box on their own. They go into a packet, which is signed and lodged, and the details are checked. That is all that required. What we have now is evidence before our committee from the independent Australian Electoral Commission, who, I might add, support what the government is doing on this provision. The party opposite that proclaims it hates red tape is using red tape to knock out legitimate voters. These are not people who do not want to vote; these are people who are showing up and want their vote to count. And in 12,000 cases they were actually on the roll and their votes did not count because of this provision, which really was a knockout provision put in for political purposes because provisional votes supposedly traditionally favour the Labor Party. That is not the way you operate the electoral system. I have always believed in enfranchising. I am not saying, and the government is not saying, that these votes should go in as a normal, ordinary vote on the day of the election. What happens is that if your name is not on the roll or if there is a misspelling you have a provisional vote and there are certain provisions. Under the old act, which I have with me, section 336 required the elector to sign a paper with his own signature so there could be a signature check where doubts existed. I have scrutineered in more than one election in other divisions along these lines, whereas many opposite and even many on my side have not done it; they have not had that experience. That is why I say that this argument some people are making, that you need a drivers licence to get a video card or other things and so the same should apply to the Electoral Act on election day, is nonsense. We have had a High Court case in relation to the seven days that basically says that if you want to knock out legitimate voters, if you want to assert electoral fraud and if you want to say there is a problem with the system, produce evidence. That is why the High Court reinstated the seven-day rule in is terms of the opportunity to enrol or change enrolment from when an election is called. Of course, the conservatives argue that the seven-day period allowed a massive opportunity for fraud to occur. Another letter that the Electoral Commission sent to us said that they did a survey of eight or nine electorates. We will have it tabled publicly; I am entitled to talk about it in general terms. What it showed was that there were about 33 people surveyed who changed addresses back to their old address within a short period of time after the election. It does happen, but it is not fraud that is occurring. What they discovered was the overwhelming number of the 33 were young people, and they were going to make some further inquiries. We have got a good system. If there is electoral fraud, if those opposite say a particular division has miscarried because there has been a stack on the roll and that was a fraud, then they can challenge that election in the Court of Disputed Returns. But what I find offensive is that the party that says it does not believe in red tape continually puts blockers into knock out tens of thousands of voters from having their vote counted. We all condemned the first Bush election and the Florida hanging chad. This is Australia's hanging chad. It was put in by the Howard government for a particular purpose, and, if anything, the fraud that was being perpetrated on the electorate was the basis upon which that provision was changed by the former government. It has been exposed for what it is-lacking in substance. And safeguards are there so that those provisional votes are properly checked and scrutineers from any particular party can question the identity of the person. It only goes back to whether they were inadvertently taken off the roll, and there are other things that are occurtoral ring in that regard. A whole lot of people who get a letter from the Electoral Commission and do not reply or whatever are being taken off the roll. In the old days they were reinstated, but under the former government this notion that you bear the responsibility, you bear the onus, has led to another 90,000 people not getting back on the roll and not getting their vote. We support an incursion on the no-fly zone in Libya, we support what is happening in Afghanistan, to give people the right to elect their governments, the right to participate. What we have here is provision after provision put in by ideologues who in effect say that there is a presumption of guilt upon you before your vote will count. It is designed to attack the less advantaged in our community: Indigenous people; people who are not literate; the people of non-English-speaking backgrounds in south-west Sydney, where the top 12 electorates of informal votes are-and we will be looking at addressing that in our report. I cannot understand how those opposite can get up here with a straight face and say they want to maintain a provision when there is a submission before the electoral committee that says that this pernicious section resulted in 12,000 people at the last election who were legitimately on the roll not being able to have their vote exercised. That was as a result of polling-official error-not as a result of fraud-and the commission, to their credit, have admitted that and said that that is what this provision does. The commission have consistently said that this provision should not be there. The next argument will probably be that the AEC are under the control of the government and the Labor Party and they are our mouthpiece. They are not. During the 21 years I have been in this place I have had nothing but the highest regard for the ElecCommission and their officials. Occasionally they make mistakes. Mr Husic-Who doesn't?",48
24,Mr MELHAM,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"But, as my colleague says, who doesn't? In this instance they gave evidence before the committee. It was not the first time; they did it before the last election, but the nature of the Senate was such that this would not get through. It is about time that members of this House started to argue for enfranchising people, not disenfranchising them. At the federal level the Liberal-National parties have not done too badly out of compulsory voting and the provisions of the Electoral Act, because they have been in government for more than two-thirds of the time. This is not a situation where they could have argued, as they did in 2006, that it stopped them from getting elected in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004. No, they were spurious arguments and we now know, as a result of proper investigation, what those amendments mean. That was why I was surprised by the High Court decisions in Roach and Rowe. The High Court basically put a limit on the parliament's power to legislate because of the precious nature of the right to vote. The right to limit prisoners and the right to limit people getting on the roll in the seven-day period after an election was called were quite historic decisions by the High Court, but they were right. They were underpinned by enfranchisement, not disenfranchisement, which is what this current provision on provisional voting does. It is separate to what happens with postal votes and other declaration votes. The signature is used to verify postal votes. As the National Party point out in their submission, for over 5,000 people there was a question over their signature. Signatures are used in the postal vote provision to determine identity. It might be a relative or someone else who has signed but, if there is a doubt, it is out. not have to listen to the garbage from the other side that this is going to be doom and gloom for our electoral system. They say there is going to be doom and gloom because they think there is a disadvantage to them because this class of people are not necessarily their supporters. As I said, my principle has always beenand it has been on the record for 21 years; and I have been on the electoral committee for about 12 or 13 years-for enfranchising. Yes, we have to have safety nets. I support the reinstatement of the signature as the basis for provisional votes. If someone is not on the roll for two elections before the election they wish to vote in, they do not get a vote, so not every one of these votes gets put back into the count-don't believe that either. Many get excluded for good reasons. I commend the legislation to the House.",50
25,Mr NEVILLE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am a great friend of the member for Banks, but that was a very florid presentation that was full of emotion and not much logic. He is trying to make us believe that somehow these poor migrant people who struggle with English have been deprived of their democratic rights. In asking for identification, the rules lay down that you bring in your drivers licence, a passport, a birth certificate, a citizenship certificate, a Medicare card for God's sake and various bank credit cards. If you are fair dinkum, is that an onerous provision for any long-term Australian or migrant? It is not a greatly onerous provision. It is a sensible thing that happens everywhere. If you want to open an account at the bank, you have to rack up 90 points, which is all tied up with your identification and your past business. If you want to travel by air, you have to be able to show one of those items to get on the plane. No long standing Australian or migrant argues with that. If you We do want to undertake hire-purchase or credit arrangements, it is required. Young people wanting to go in a nightclub have to have some form of identification. Even video stores, the most fundamental of all things, require you to have some form of identification. But for the most important thing we probably do every three years-voting for the government of our country-we want to water it down a bit. I do not think that is good enough. What is provisional voting when you boil it down to the essentials? If you have been left off the roll unfairly or unjustly or by some form of bureaucratic error, you can claim a vote. That is essentially what it is. When you rock up to the polling booth on election day and find your name is not on the roll and say, ‘There is no reason for me not being on the roll. I have been in my house for many years. I have been unwittingly removed from the roll,' if you present some form of identification away you can go. This Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 proposes to remove all of that identity stuff and replace it purely with a signature. I do not know about that. I am putting my hand up and declaring a degree of self-interest because for many years I had the toughest seat in Australia and I watched everything in the way of voting. The one thing that stood out to me as not being as well regulated as the rest of the electoral system was provisional voting. I will give you a few examples of that shortly. The member for Banks made a big song and dance about how many people had been excluded from their democratic right. I question that. Let us look at the figures across Australia as provided by the AEC-and it is good that the minister is at the table; I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong. Eighty per cent of people did provide identification on election day at the polling booths, with another 16 per cent providing it by the following Friday. So 96 per cent of all people who applied for a provisional vote had no trouble in coming up with the goods. The four per cent that for whatever reason missed out-it might have been just bone laziness; it might have been that they were in bed with the flu; it might have been that they had gone off to a job somewhere, who knows whatin my electorate was less than the informal voting rate. So it is hardly a disenfranchisedifferently ment of a large section of the Australian population. Fiddling with the rolls and the processes around the rolls is really a direct attack on the fundamentals of democracy, though you can dress it up any way you like. I am not having a crack at my political opponents, the government, in this. I have a lot of respect for the members in the House at present including the Special Minister of State, who is at the table, and my good colleague from western Sydney. I have great respect for them. But, hey, listen fellas, in your party, even over recent years, there have been some wicked examples of fiddling with the rolls. In the Queensland parliament, you have had to tip members out of the parliament. Not just members but senior cabinet ministers were tipped out of the parliament for prostituting the rolls in one form or another. In fact, one party official in Townsville went to jail over it. It is not a very savoury record. The new member for Brisbane, then member for Petrie, told me of the time where, after one of the elections, she went out and checked some of the addresses from which votes had been claimed in her electorate and found they were vacant blocks of land. So there are people out there who use the processes around the electoral rolls to rort the system. I think anything you put in place that makes it harder for that to happen is an enhancement of democracy. It is not a denial of basic democracy if 96 per cent of people did not have any trouble providing identification. More to the point, it was a deterrent to those who would sneak in, claim a vote, sneak out and say: ‘We've got a fifty-fifty chance of pulling this off. They're not going to check them all that thoroughly.' The Special Minister of State, in his second reading speech, said there was no reason that provisional votes should be treated any from other forms of postal and absentee voting. I query that on the ground that with the other ones, especially the prepolls and the absentees, voters are marked against the roll whereas with provisional voting the poll officer has to accept the voter's word that they have been left off the roll. There was a great case in Bundaberg where someone walked up to one of the polling booths and, let us say, used the name of ‘John Smith of Brown Street'. As luck would have it, the person standing behind him was the real John Smith of Brown Street, who said, ‘Hey, wait a minute, mate; that's my name.' That was a million to one chance but it actually happened that somebody using his name was the person in front of him in the polling booth. So it goes on; make no mistake about that. As I have said, 96 per cent did not seem to have any trouble with it. I would like to take you to my electorate. Mine has been, as I said, a pretty tough electorate over the years. It is not so bad at sent. In one election I was down to 69 votes, 64 on recount. I know what a close election is like, so I take a particular interest in postals, pre-polls, absentees, provisionals and the like. It used to amaze me that I would poll somewhere between 55 per cent and 60 per cent for pre-poll, absentees and so on but, when it came to the provisionals, suddenly the vote dropped down to about 33 to 37 per cent. Why would that be? If these people, as the minister at the table says, are of similar character, why is it that three of those subgroups voted decidedly one way and the fourth group, over which the scrutiny at that time was probably less rigorous, voted another way? I have got some figures here. In 2004 the figures for absentee, postal and pre-poll votes were 55 per cent, 62 per cent and 56 per cent. When we go to 2001, the figures for absentee, postal and pre-poll votes were 51 per cent, 54 per cent and 54 per cent, but suddenly provisionals were 37 per cent. That was for two-party preferred; when you took them down to the raw votes it was ALP 46 per cent, coalition 26 per cent. It was totally out of character with the rest of the voting the election and in the other sectional voting. In 1998 the figures for absentee, postal and pre-poll votes were 50.6 per cent, 53.5 per cent and 52.8 per cent but-oh surprise!provisional votes were 38 per cent for twoparty preferred. Take them down again to the raw voting and it was ALP 47 per cent, coalition 27 per cent. Why did the result of 60-40 all of a sudden go 66-33 the other way? You would just have to say that there was something rather suspicious about it. I am sure people would proffer all sorts of different reasons for that, but this is the teresting thing: when the new rule was brought in in 2007-in other words, the rorters were put on notice that they were going to be asked to identify themselves at the pollpreing booth-that made a profound difference. More so in 2010 than in 2007, because in 2007 the ones who had been doing this over the years were probably were not quite ready for it. Again, suddenly, where I would poll in that 55 to 60 per cent of most of the sectional votes my vote came up from the low 30stwo-party preferred-to 44. That is extraordinary. Why did that just suddenly happen in the 2007 election when it had not happened in the previous four or five elections? When you come to 2010, where this new system was well entrenched, my vote went not just to 44 but up to 47. It was getting up towards where all the other sectional votes were. I will be very interested to see, if the House and the Senate approve this bill, whether that vote slips back again. If it does, I think that is a fair indication that there has been some rorting going on. I repeat: it is not an onerous burden to identify yourself, and it takes place now-as I outlined before-in many walks of life. You would not put on a tantrum at an airport and say, ‘I don't want to show you my drivers licence.' You show them the drivers licence, you get your ticket and you get on in board. But suddenly this most important thing-the thing that we all cherish on both sides of the House, the role of democracyis watered down. ‘Yes,' we say, ‘We will do it by way of signature.' I suppose that will be better than having no provision at all, but when my scrutineers went into scrutinise the prepolls I used to get them to take a list of returned mail addresses. The number of votes that were claimed-we do not know what their votes were-before the envelope was opened that were from addresses from which we had had mail returned regularly inwas interesting. There was a bit of a suspicion in my mind that there was some undercurrent of rorting in those provisional votes. I would prefer to see the system that was brought in towards the end of the Howard government retained. The government's plan may work, but not to the same extent. (Time expired)",51
26,Mr STEPHEN JONES,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It is an interesting debate that we are engaged in here today, because it really does lay bare the lie at the heart of the name party which those opposite purport to represent. It is a truly interesting debate when the party of liberty stands here and seeks to defend rorts which would deny citizens their votes. The party of liberty seeks to remove the rights of citizens. Mr Robert- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Seriously, impugning the rights of a political party in the House is clearly not appropriate under the standing orders.",54
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The shadow minister was not here for the earlier debate. I can assure him that members on my left made exactly the same allegation, but of a different political party.",54
28,Mr STEPHEN JONES,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I seek to make the point, plain and simple, that if those opposite who represent the party of liberty had the courage of their convictions then they would vote in favour of these proposed amendments to the electoral laws in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. They would vote in favour of it because a party of liberty which truly stood for the principle that the people should choose those who represent them in this august body would want to extend the franchise and ensure that everybody has the right to exercise their citizenship rights as Australians to cast a vote in their electorate for their representatives in this place. Of course, those opposite have form on this matter. Prior to the last election they had so distorted the electoral rolls as to ensure that many hundreds of thousands of Australians could not even enrol to vote because of the early cut-off of the electoral rolls on the day that the election was called. This rortand it was a rort-has been overturned by the High Court, and for the first time in four years we saw at the 21 August 2010 election of the over 100,000 mostly young people enjoy their right to vote in a way that the High Court found was true and proper. This reform which has been brought to the House by the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity is a continuation of our intent to ensure that we correct many of the wrongs that have been visited upon our electoral system by those opposite, and it should enjoy the support of all members of this House. For a country which was founded in relatively modern times, and as a nation of convicts, Australia has nevertheless had a proud history of democracy, and has played its part in exporting democracy to the countries of our region. We are rightly proud of the conduct of our elections, which are done with integrity and a level of scrutiny and transparency that puts even the closest of election results to the test. Indeed there are some of us who even enjoy and look forward to the festive atmosphere of polling day, with the community out together enjoying a sausage sizzle, the sharing of our democratic values and the real contest of ideas that surrounds an election. In Australia, we do not change governments frequently, but, when we do change governments, it is without the mayhem or bloodshed that accompanies the change of regimes or governments in many other countries. That is something that we on all sides of the House are rightly proud of. When you hear that the recently deposed President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was in power for 30 years, you really do know that something is not working in the democratic system of that country. Our system of compulsory voting means that everyone gets a say. It is a system that continually needs refining and sometimes we need to wind back the egregious limitations that are placed on that system by representatives of those opposite. It is a system which enables everyone to cast their vote and it is system that is the envy of the world. These are all good features of Australia's voting system. Even on a bitterly cold winter's day, as was the case in August last year, we are able to get out with the customary enthusiasm and cast our vote in favour of the representatives of our choice. The bill before the House today will remove the requirement for provisional voters to show proof of identity within a week of voting to allow their vote to be counted. These so-called provisional votes are declaration type votes cast at a polling place on polling day. There are four main reasons a person will be asked to cast to a provisional vote. The first is where a person's name cannot be found on the electoral roll by the pollwho ing official; the second is where a mark appears on the certified list, which indicates that the person has already voted; the third where the polling official doubts the person's true identity; and the fourth is where the son is a silent elector and their address does not appear on the publicly available edition of the roll. The Australian Electoral Commission has stated that over 200,000 provisional votes were cast in the 2010 election. Of these, 28,065 provisional votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following the polling day. Importantly, further examination by the AEC of these 28,000 votes found that in over 12,000 instances-nearly half of these instances-the name of the voter was found on the certified electoral roll. So here was a person who was fully entitled to cast a vote but because, for one reason or another-their busy life or many other reasons-they were unable to subsequently provide proper proof of their identity to the AEC their vote was not counted. These are the people that the member for a Hinkler recently chose to blithely disregard as rorters. I prefer to call them ‘citizens' in my electorate, but he chooses to call them rorters. He really did bell the cat-and this goes to the heart of the opposition's objection to these provisions-when he said that the real reason that he did not want to vote in favour of these proposals is that he thought the people who would cast a provisional vote in accordance with these proposed amendments would not vote for him; and this was coming from a representative of the party of liberty, the party of free speech, the party of democratic rights. The member for Hinkler could not have stated his case more clearly. The reason that he does not support these amendments is that he fears that the people will use them will not vote for him. The over 12,000 people in the 2010 election who were precluded because of the Howard govis ernment rorts will be able to eligibly cast a vote in an election and have their vote percounted-have their democratic say counted. The member for Hinkler and many others on the other side of the House choose to call these people rorters. We call them citizens and eligible enrolled voters. They will once again be enfranchised by this provision. Indeed, it was a similar story in the 2007 federal election, where there were 167,500 provisional votes and 27,000 votes that were rejected at preliminary scrutiny because an elector did not provide proof of identity. This is a situation that was created by the coalition-and it is a sad state of affairs. It means a significant number of people turned up at polling booths on polling days in both 2007 and 2010, keen to have their say and cast their ballot, found that they were not on the electoral roll and then cast a declaration vote only to have it rejected because of unnecessary red tape and an onerous process. Those opposite choose to laugh, but the reason that it is unfair is that these voters would have had their vote counted if they had instead stayed home and voted absentee. If they had cast a postal vote, a pre-poll laration vote-their vote would have counted, with no need for proof of identity. There is simply no reason that otherwise valid provisional votes should be treated differently to other forms of declaration votes. The real reason-which was made crystal clear by the member for Hinkler-that they do not require proof of identity for pre-poll postal votes is that those opposite believe that the majority of those people are going to vote for the opposition. Those opposite fear that if we redress this rort, this discriminatory treatment of declaration votes on polling days, those people will not vote for them. That is a shameful exposition of your political philosophy. The party of liberty is the party of electoral rorts. It is interesting to look back at how this disenfranchisement affected the outcome of the 2007 federal election. Some interesting  lian National University contained in his paper on provisional voting rejections in the 2007 election claims that the ‘missing provisional votes' might have affected the outcomes in two electorates, MCEwen and Bowman, and added ‘0.1 per cent to Labor's national vote' in that election and probably would have turned the election the other way in those two electorates-two of Australia's most marginal electorates. There is no high principle here. The only principle that is in evidence here is that those opposite are afraid that people will not vote for them. They are afraid of this because, quite clearly, they do not have confidence in their ideas, so they are attempting to rort the system. They do not have confidence in their own ideas or in their own capacity to get out there and campaign. As we know, it is a relatively uncommon outcome of our electoral system for one political party to hold the balance of power in dec- both houses of parliament. It occurred in 2005 and that was the first time it had happened since 1981. We know that the first thing the Howard government did when it was presented with a blank cheque from the electorate was to get to work on an ambitious rewriting of Australian industrial relations laws-the odious Work Choices laws. Fortunately, the machinations of democracy saw off both those laws and the government that introduced them in 2007. But that was not the only piece of legislation that the Howard government rammed through the parliament during those unfortunate years. The Howard government's agenda was driven by the coalition's conservative ideology as it sought to gain political and electoral advantage over its opponents on this side of the House. It is well known to many in this place that in December 2005 the coalition introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill. Like so much of the Orwellian doublespeak that characterised the Howard government's term in office, it had nothing to do with electoral integrity and everything to do with rorting the electoral system. This bill had absolutely nothing to do with electoral integrity. The measures in the bill included raising the threshold for anonymous political donations to $10,000, which eroded an important transparency measure. It closed the electoral rolls early, as I have already stated; it disenfranchised some votes by prisoners; it made it harder to enrol to vote; and it disenfranchised provisional voters. It was all done for political advantage. It was all done for partisan politics. It was empty of ideology except the ideology which drives those opposite to cling to power at all costs. They junk their co-called liberal ideology in favour of an anti-liberal proposition to disenfranchise voters. We in this House have the opportunity today to fix this historical anomaly to ensure that those who truly do believe in liberty, in democratic values and in the right to vote will be able to exercise their right to vote-as is every Australian's birth right. I call upon the House to support the bill.",54
29,Mr TEHAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It gives me no joy to be speaking on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 today, because all this bill will do is affect the integrity of voting system. The honourable member who just spoke mentioned the 2007 election and the seat of MCEwen. I had some experiences with the voting and the vote counting in the seat of MCEwen. There were multiple votes cast in that election and there was nothing that the AEC could do about it. I will give one example which I think illustrates why we have to be so careful to maintain the integrity of our electoral system. There was a parish priest who received a note from the AEC inquiring as to why he had voted three times in the electorate of MCEwen. It turned out that someone had voted under his name in New South Wales and then twice within the electorate of MCEwen at different polling booths. There was nothing that the AEC could do about it, apart from giving him a ‘Please explain'. When he explained that he had voted only once and had voted within the local community where he works, that was the end of the story, and those other two votes were counted. The interesting thing about the MCEwen electorate during the election of 2007 was that there were multiple cases of people casting more than one ballot, and it was the first time that the union movement en masse had been up to scrutineer and to also hand out how-to-vote cards at polling booths in that electorate. During the Work Choices campaign they bussed union officials into the electorate so that they could hand out howto-vote cards and do the scrutineering. And-surprise, surprise!-we also saw an increase in multiple voting. Mr Craig Thomson-That is drawing a long bow.",57
30,Mr TEHAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It is not a long bow. If you look at the historical facts you will see that that is what occurred. First the coalition candidate was declared the winner, then the Labor Party candidate was declared the winner, and eventually the coalition was. It was that our close, and that multiple voting could easily have been the thing that decided who won that seat. It goes to the heart of why we need to protect the integrity of our electoral roll, and the changes in this legislation will do nothing to do that. We are heading for a system whereby anyone will be able to turn up and vote and be able to vote on multiple occasions. We are not moving to protect the integrity of the electoral roll. In fact, we are looking to weaken it and, by weakening it, we will harm our democratic processes here in Australia. People will begin to wonder whether we truly do have a democratic system when it is possible for people to be able to vote on more than one occasion. The honourable member who spoke previously talked about the 200,000 provisional votes which were cast at the last election: 28,000 of those were rejected under the changes introduced by the coalition in 2006, and 12,000 of those would have been eligible. What about the other 16,000? What was the situation with those votes? They were not found to be legitimate voters on the roll. Those 16,000 votes remain a mystery. How can we have a system whereby we allow people to cast their votes provisionally and not ask them to provide some identification? They do not have to do it on polling day. This change was a reasonable change; it just required them to provide some proof of who they are within seven days, to make sure there was not fraud and to protect the integrity of our system. If you cannot provide identification in seven days, then you are not taking your vote seriously-the importance of that vote, the importance of our democratic system and the importance of providing integrity within that system. Sadly, in Third World countries, we see continual rorting of the democratic system and we have all seen what that leads to and the types of governments that we get from that. That is not what we want to see here in Australia. We want people to know that when they cast their vote every other citizen is casting their vote in exactly the same way. We want people to be confident that there are not some citizens voting maybe one, two or three times when others are doing the right thing. We need to have some safeguards, because, unfortunately, if you do not have the safeguards in the system, people will rort it. We as the coalition in 2006 did not make an onerous requirement. All we said was that people needed to provide some identification within seven days. It is important to note that, at the 2010 general election, 80 per cent of provisional voters provided evidence of their identity at the polling place on election day and another 16 per cent provided evidence of their identification in the required time frame, the following Friday. So only four per cent of voters did not provide identification. We need to ask the question: why? Was it because they were frightened that it would be found out that they had voted earlier? If that is the then surely we should keep this requirement within our electoral system. When people cast their votes in polling booths on polling day, we continually get attempts to rort the system. Sadly, some attempts to rort the system are bound to work. Why shouldn't there be, especially when it comes to provisional voting, some measure to make sure that the person casting the vote is casting a legitimate vote? We need to remind people what provisional voters are. These are the people who turn up and their name is not on the roll or there is a query on the roll about their identification. Why shouldn't we be able to ask them a simple thing before we allow their vote to count: ‘Prove to us who you are. There is a query about who you are; therefore, we need you to do this.' We do not do it to people who turn up on polling day or to people who cast a postal vote or to people who do a pre-poll vote. We only do it to these provisional voters. The reason we do it is that there is already some unease about whether this person has the right to cast that vote. So there is nothing wrong with asking them to provide some identification within seven days. Our voting system is integral to our whole democratic system. We have seen, sadly, in other places-for instance in Florida-the unease and doubt caused by voting systems which were seen to be potentially able to be manipulated. We have seen what that can lead to and the distrust and general outrage from the community that a proper system is not in place. We do not want to see that occur here in Australia. In the seat of MCEwen in 2007, in an extremely close vote, we saw that there was the potential for rorting in our system. We have to make sure that we take steps to stop that from happening. We do not want it to lead to the situation where we disenfranchise peocase ple. This is not about disenfranchising people. This is about requiring people-if there is uncertainty and unease about whether they are qualified to vote-to prove that they are qualified to vote. This is not disenfranchising people; this is protecting the very integrity of our democratic system.",57
31,Mr MELHAM,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,What evidence?,59
32,Mr TEHAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,What evidence? The evidence the honourable member missed earlier on was just one example-but we saw numerous-of a parish priest being asked to explain why he had voted three times in the 2007 election in the seat of MCEwen.,59
33,Mr MELHAM,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Was he charged?,59
34,Mr TEHAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"No, he was not charged because he was able to demonstrate that he had only voted once, but the other two votes where people used his name to cast their ballot remained legitimate votes. They were not withdrawn because no-one knew who or what those ballots were or where the voters were. Two votes were counted, and no-one knows who cast them. By making this amendment, we are saying: if you want to potentially rort the system, do it by turning up and casting a provisional vote, because no-one is going to check your identification as to whether you are legitimately able to cast that vote or not. This is not the type of electoral system that we need here in this country. People have confidence in our electoral system. The integrity of our electoral system is seen as world class; yet, this is an area that has been identified as having some risk of fraudulent behaviour. The government is saying, ‘We're going to open it up and make it easier for fraud to take place. We're not going to put in one little small requirement that you need to show identification after seven days.' What this government needs to say is, ‘There seems to be some risk here of fraudulent behaviour.' Instead it is going to make that risk greater and put that system at further risk of losing its world-class reputation. Sadly, the fact that this change is coming from the Gillard government should make the Australian people very worried. Everything that the government do turns into a mess and the fact that they are meddling in our voting system, which is seen to be world class, sends shivers up my spine. Are we going to see a pink batts fiasco? Are we going to see a BER fiasco? Look at the record of the government: everything they touch turns into disaster. I am worried that we are going to see another disaster with this change to something that is absolutely vital to the very fabric of Australian society-our democratic processes. These changes were brought about in 2006 because they were required to protect the integrity of our voting system The only reason the government want to change these laws is that they know that any rorting that will take place is more likely to benefit them than anyone else. This change is a sham.",59
35,Mr HUSIC,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate, and I will start by acknowledging the number of people in the public gallery joining us here today-witnesses to, in effect, the democratic process in operation right now. It is also worth pointing out that this debate on the bill that is being discussed is about enhancing people's participation in the democratic process in this country. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 looks at repealing the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity as a precondition to their votes being included in an election. As has been reflected upon earlier in the debate, there are four main reasons that a person wants to cast a provisional vote: firstly, their name cannot be found on a certified list; secondly, a mark already appears on the certified list, which indicates a person has voted; thirdly, the polling official doubts the person's identity; and, finally, voter is a silent elector. The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently require a person casting a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day, and if the voter cannot provide evidence of identity by the deadline the vote does not progress to preliminary scrutiny and is not counted. This requirement-again, this has been commented upon in the course of this debatewas put in place by the previous government in 2006. Mind you, a lot of those opposite had been elected to office in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004, but they decided in 2006 that this was such a significant issue that they needed to deal with it. This resulted in a situation where provisional votes were dealt with in a way inconsistent with the treatment of other types of declaration votes-namely, absentee votes, postal votes and pre-poll votes. At the 2010 election, over 28,000 votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the deadline. It is worth noting that about 14 million people in the 2010 election cast a vote, of which 28,000 were rejected under the system put in place in 2006 by the former government. Again, it is important to note: the requirement for a provisional voter to provide evidence of identity leads to an inconsistency in the treatment of different types of declaration votes. I want to emphasise the point and support the comment made by the member for Banks, where he indicated that the changes being put forward by the government are supported by the Australian Electoral Commission. The AEC are the independent authority that we all support in their ability oversee and operate the democratic process during elections. They do that not just during federal elections but in other elections where they are called upon by third partiesnamely in union ballots, I make the pointthe to ensure the integrity of the process. On that word ‘integrity': my ears always prick up when the opposition use that code word. They talk vigorously about the need to defend the integrity of the roll. Rather, I think it reflects paranoia about the processes, probably championing conspiracy theorists and their fascination with this issue of votes being counted or being excluded. We will often hear cited Dr Amy MCGRATH, who from time to time has made it her life's work to deal with the issue of why some votes have been counted and others excluded. Again, I think it is important that the AEC is scrupulous in its defence of process. Frankly, the use of and overreliance on this word ‘integrity' in relation to the roll is code for those opposite advancing mechanisms to prevent people from casting a vote and finding ways to exclude them from the roll-particularly young people, as has been evidenced in the past in terms of the conditions for ratifying their enrolment ahead of an electionincluding, as we have seen before, differentiating between declaration votes and putting forward these onerous issues in relation to identity. We need to be vigilant about hurdles that prevent participation and, as the member for Melbourne Ports observed in this place last night, our challenge is to find a way to get the 2.5 million people who did not cast a vote in the 2010 election to vote. Fourteen million people did; 2.5 million did not. That is a serious issue. Obviously, there are a whole host of reasons why people might not participate in the voting process, and we can canvass them. It may be, in some part, a reflection of disillusionment in the democratic to process that makes people opt not to cast a vote. But there are other reasons as well, and I would certainly advance the idea that we have placed before them hurdles that make the process more difficult. From my perspective, removing the ID hurdles is an important measure. In the electorate that I have the great honour of representing, Chifley, the proportion of people who have drivers licences is amongst the lowest in Western Sydney, and there is a reason for that: the state government has changed the way you get a drivers licence. Bear in mind that those opposite have said: ‘What's the problem? If you just present a drivers licence then your identity has been verified.' I would dispute that. To come back to the point, in New South Wales learners-unlike many of us in here who obtained our licences in years past-have to undertake 100 hours of driving to obtain a drivers licence. Again, some would say, ‘It's not that big a deal.' But, in fact, if there is no-one in the house who has a drivers licence and/or the learner is from a lowincome family-and in the electorate I represent there are a great deal of people from low-income families-there is no-one at home who can participate with them in the driving requirements that are mandatory for getting a licence. Their only alternative is to pay for driving lessons to obtain their licence, and that in itself is a problem because they will not have the funds for it. So they are the hurdles to getting your drivers licence in New South Wales. While those opposite are advancing the idea, ‘Merely present your drivers licence; that's okay,' the fact is that drivers licence requirements such as those in New South Wales present a big problem for us. I return to the fact that we need to find a mechanism to get the 2.5 million people who did not cast a vote in the last election to Australia does have complex systems of voting. There are the optional preferential differences between federal and state elections. For example, in the New South Wales election, you have optional preferencing; in the federal election, you are required to fill every box with a number. As an aside, I would say that our system is way better than the US system, where there are enormous complexities and differences between the states in the way that people cast their votes, and that does disenfranchise people. At this point, I am also mindful of comments made by former Prime Minister Whitlam, where he recommended-and I do not want to cause a collective heart attack in the chamber; wait for it-that federal, state and local government elections all be held on exactly the same dayMr Anthony Smith interjecting",59
36,Mr HUSIC,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It certainly caught my attention, Member for Casey! When Mr Whitlam made that point, he was looking at the US system, where people vote on the one day. Some of the reasons he made that point and the reason I make this point now is that there is an issue of voter education-that is, holding those elections all at the same time gives people the opportunity to be informed about and to better understand the processes in place, and what they need to do to cast a valid vote. From my perspective, the AEC needs to increase its focus on education. As the member for Banks said today, the top 12 electorates in the country-many of them with high levels of informal votingare located in Western Sydney, and the diversity within those seats is worth considering. There are different literacy rates. There are people for whom English is a second language. There are people who have come to Australia from backgrounds where democracy is not necessarily as strong a proposition as it is here. They may not know that, under vote. a compulsory voting system, you need to undertake certain things to be able to obtain a vote. These are serious issues. I do not think that advertising alone in the lead-up to a federal election is good enough-that is, using mass advertising mechanisms to educate people on how to cast a vote. While I understand it is considered an efficient way to get a message out, I think other ideas need to be considered to ensure that people understand the voting system and, thereby, that they cast valid votes. One idea I would put forward for consideration by the AEC is that they identify seats where informal voting is high and where demographic triggers would warrant escalated education processes. By that I mean that the AEC conduct face-to-face briefings with people in those electorates to ensure that they do understand the democratic process-that is, the way that they can cast valid votes. That type of work could be done by divisional officers. I understand that, as always, budgets and the level of support provided to the AEC for this function will be a worthy point of consideration, but I think that AEC officials conducting face-to-face briefings with large groups of community members to better explain the democratic process would be enormously valuable. I note the presence of the Special Minister of State in the chamber, and I would hope that this would be something that could be considered for future election campaigns as a measure to improve voter education. We also need to maintain close scrutiny of proposals to improve enrolment. I note that last night in the chamber the member for Mackellar made some points about this. I quote from Hansard, where the member for Mackellar said: I am concerned, for instance, with the proposition that has been put forward that for future eral elections we might go the way of, say, the New South Wales Labor government, which has changed enrolment provisions to encompass automatic enrolment whereby people's details will merely be taken from other agencies such as the Road Transport Authority, school rolls or whatever they decide can be dealt with. The member for Mackellar, judging by the way she referenced it in debate, believes that this issue is a problem. But, in actual fact, the number of databases that exist within government provide an easier mechanism to enrol people to vote. Given that the identity requirements-the provisions that are put in place to validate a person's identity through drivers licences or other forms of identification-sit in multiple databases, there is already an avenue for us to verify the person's bona fides, their address et cetera and to improve enrolment processes. I think this is something that is worthy of consideration in improving people's engagement in the process. I note that those opposite often refer to the fact that it is easier to vote than it is to get a video card. There is a good reason for that there are fewer video stores these days, because that mode of technology and people's reliance on DVDs and videos is fast disappearing. There is also a commercial imperative for video store operators to put in placeMr Anthony Smith-That's a killer point! Mr Hartsuyker-What a demon debating point!",61

38,Mr HUSIC,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Well, you refer to video cards, and you are referring to an outmoded form of technology and the fact that there is a commercial imperative to establish the fedbona fides of people seeking membership. Whatever can be done to harness existing technology and modern processes to improve the ability of people to participate and to tackle the challenge of 2.5 million people who are not casting a vote needs to continue, and I would certainly urge the government to consider this in the years ahead.",62
39,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"In speaking briefly on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011, the shadow special minister of state and other colleagues from this side of the House in defending the reforms that were put in place back in 2007. We are hearing the Labor Party state in the House today their long held view-a view which would lead to our electoral roll being left open to abuse. It is as simple as that. At present, if a voter attends polling booths on election day, and they not on the electoral roll and seek to cast a provisional vote, they are asked by virtue of the fact that their enrolment criteria and enrolment details are non-existent or unclear to provide simple evidence of identity-the sort of evidence of identity that Australian citizens are asked for every day in the modern economy. It was interesting how the previous speaker from the other side danced around that point with great awkwardness in his contribution. We are talking about electors who are not on the electoral roll or whose details are unclear turning up at polling booths and simply being asked to provide evidence of identity. If they are unable to provide that simple evidence of their identity at that time-and I say to the member opposite, who must have ignored the evidence or been oblivious to it, that we know from the statistics that that is absolutely not the case in majority of instances-they have until the next Friday to provide it. I am very familiar with these reforms. They were a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I chaired back in 2004 and 2005, and they were then embodied in the legislative reform introduced by the government at that time. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from those opposite about the right to vote. We all cherish the right to vote. But with rights come responsibilities. For every voter whose details, for whatever reason, are out of date or who is not on the electoral roll and must cast a provisional vote, which by its very nature and definition is provisional and requires further checking, to be asked to provide stipulated identification-namely, a drivers licence-is not too onerous. The member opposite would have you believe that this will be news to his electors and that a drivers licence is a new thing, but we know that most people have a drivers licence, and we know from the statistics that, as the shadow minister pointed out, most had no problem providing it on the spot. But of course the legislation as it exists at the moment makes provision for those without a licence. The absurd and incompetent notion from the member opposite that those without a licence would have to go and acquire a driver licence to vote is an unfortunate reflection on his lack of capacity to look at the detail of the act as it stands today. For those without a licence it is very clear they can provide alternative forms of identification if not on the spot then at some point within the next five working days. What those opposite are saying here in this House is that it is a fundamental belief of those in the Labor Party and those in the government that if someone casts a provisional vote, which by its very nature has an uncertainty about it at the time, it is too much to ask for the some identification on the spot and too much to ask that voter to provide that simple information sometime in the next five daysinformation that should be asked for on a daily basis. This reform was introduced in 2006. It has operated at two elections. The shadow minister made very clear that the statistics tell the story: the vast majority of electors in that situation had no problem providing the identification on the spot. Those who could not provide it on the spot had Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to provide that information. In a democracy, with the right to vote comes responsibility. It is very interesting: back in 2005, when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters reported on this and many other issues, the dissenting report from those opposite was quite long. It will not surprise you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, that the dissenting report dissented with most parts of the committee's deliberations to improve the integrity of the electoral system. I know my friend and colleague Shadow Minister Hartsuyker would have thought that, given the vehemence of the debate he has witnessed from those on the other side, there would be a long, comprehensive, analytical, absolutely academic piece from those opposite about why this reform introduced in 2006 should not go ahead. When you look at their dissenting report and cut through the volume of those opposite such as the member for Banks and the member for Melbourne Ports, who return on these issues with the regularity of Thunderbirds episodes on a Saturday morning, you see that their big, compelling point was that, when they had considered it, there had not been any evidence provided that there had actually been fraud. It was not that they were worried about fraud or the integrity of the electoral roll; was that there had not been any evidence presented. I quote from the report: ‘No evidence was presented to the inquiry of fraud in the casting of declaration votes.' This is very like saying, if you are working in a bank, ‘We've left the bank vault open, but nothing has happened up until now.' This reform introduced in 2006 was a sensible reform. The Australian public, I believe, would find it a very straightforward reform. As a member representing a seat in Victoria I can say I have had no feedback from a provisional voter finding the provisions unnecessary or intrusive. They would be understood by Australians as something to protect the integrity of the roll. Those honestly voting and casting provisional votes would want to know and would understand that there are integrity provisions in place. The arguments we have heard from those opposite, particularly from the previous speaker, whom I have had more time to listen to, really demonstrate the hollowness of their opposition to this measure. It is a measure that does them no service at all.",63
40,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Fisher) (12.20 pm)Looking through the Special Minister of State's second reading speech, the best explanation for the proposals in this bill appears to be that the current arrangement for there to be evidence of identity provided with respect to provisional voting is inconsistent with the rules that currently relate to other forms of declaration voting such as postal voting and absent voting. So what the minister is proposing, I gather, is that there should be consistency by removing the need for electors to provide evidence of identity with respect to provisional voting. I do believe that there is a sense of logic in wanting to have the same rules apply to provisional voting as to other forms of declaration voting, but I make the submission to this House that a better way of doing that would be to it require evidence of identity to be provided by basically everyone seeking to cast a vote pursuant to declaration voting. I think that would enhance the integrity of the electoral system and overcome the minister's reason for introducing the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. It is important that the electoral system of Australia has as much integrity as possible, and all honourable members would claim that they support an electoral system with integrity which would ensure that, following an election, the result as declared is in fact the result voted for by the Australian people. However, our side-that is, the Liberal National team-takes a very strong view that we ought to continually upgrade the integrity of the electoral system. The government, while supporting in principle that idea, does through their Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 seek to undermine the integrity of the electoral system. The minister may not have heard what I said a moment ago, but now that he is back at the table I will repeat that the reason for this bill appears to be the lack of consistency in treatment of different sorts of declaration voting. Minister, the best way to bring that consistency in would be to require all declaration voters to provide evidence of identity. Let us face it, anyone can go to an electoral office, a prepoll centre or a polling booth on or before polling day-whenever those offices are open-and claim to be a voter. I think that when we make an improvement with requirements that can be met by the overwhelming majority of voters, there seems to be little reason to take this step, if this bill were to become law, which makes the integrity of the electoral system less sound. I am advised that at the 2010 general election 80 per cent of provisional voters provided evidence of their identity at the polling place on election day-the honourable member for Casey indicated that most voters have a drivers licence-and another 16 per cent provided evidence of identification in the required time frame-that is, by the following Friday. It is my submission that the government has not sufficiently convinced the parliament that the proposal contained in this bill is thy of support. There are a number of situations where people are able to obtain a provisional vote. One might be where the person's name is not on the electoral roll. Other situations could be where the person's name has been marked off or where the polling official on the day has concerns about the identity of the would be voter. We know that currently the provisional vote is not counted until the elector's identity can be confirmed and a careful check made of the circumstances. Failure to provide the identification presently means that the vote is not counted and the integrity of the electoral process is not endangered by including dodgy votes in the count. It is a sensible and strict system that is really a common sense system. It is a system that was introduced by the former government in 2006. It has proven, during the two elections when it has operated, to be solid and sensible. It simply does not require changing. As I mentioned a moment ago, 96 per cent of those who cast provisional votes at the August 2010 federal election did provide identification either on the day or by the following Friday. That gives people plenty of time to dust off some form of identification and to front up to prove that the person actually exists and that he or she is not simply a nom de plume. The Liberal-National opposition opposes the retrograde measures of this bill. I think it is a pity that the minister, for whom I have the highest personal regard, is introducing legislation which seeks to undermine the integrity of the electoral system. The bill introduces loopholes that can compromise the integrity of our electoral system and I think it is important that the government reconsider this matter. The amendments which were made by the former government in 2006 were positive. They have not received any opposition from the community. There does not seem to be any compelling reason worto water down the integrity of the electoral system by removing the need for provisional voters to prove that they exist. I suggest that, instead, the minister should require other declaration voters to provide identity. While he is at it, it would not be a bad idea if before casting a vote on polling day everyone should produce evidence that he or she exists as well. We really ought to have a situation where people prove that they exist before they are able to cast a vote. That should apply to declaration voters of all sorts, including provisional voters. It should also, in my view, apply to people seeking to cast an ordinary vote on polling day. Regrettably, I must join my colleagues in opposing this retrograde legislation which has been introduced to the parliament by the minister and the government.",64
41,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (12.28 pm)-in reply-I thank all the members who have spoken on this bill. In particular, I thank the member for Fisher for his observations, which are interesting in many ways. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 will repeal the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity as a precondition to their votes being included in the count for an election. Provisional votes are a type of declaration vote cast at a polling place on polling day. There are four main reasons that a person will be asked to cast a provisional vote. First, the person's name cannot be found on the certified list; second, a mark appears on the certified list which indicates the person has already voted; third, the polling official doubts the person's identity; and, finally, the voter is a silent elector. When a provisional vote is cast, ballot papers are placed in an envelope and written on the outside of the envelope are the voter's details, including name, address, date of birth and signature. This allows the Australian Electoral Commission to examine the eligibility of the voter before including the vote in the count. This is known as the preliminary scrutiny. The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently require a person casting a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day. If a voter does not provide evidence of identity by this deadline the vote does not progress to the preliminary scrutiny and is not counted. This requirement was put in place by the previous government in 2006. It resulted in a situation where provisional votes were dealt with in a way that was inconsistent with the treatment of other kinds of declaration votes-namely, absent, postal and pre-poll votes. By repealing the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity, all declaration votes will be treated equally. The bill replaces the requirement to provide evidence of identity with a test which has been used in previous elections. The test provides for the divisional returning officer to compare the signature on the provisional vote envelope with the signature of the elector on previously lodged enrolment records if there is any doubt as to the bona fides of the elector. This amendment is supported by the Electoral Commission which, in its submission to the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election and matters related thereto, recommended that the requirement for production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed. The Electoral Commission supports the measure in this bill for two substantive reasons. First, the Electoral Commission believes that the details provided on the outside of the envelope including the voter's name, address, date of birth and a signature allow the Electoral Commission to examine the voter's eligibility to have the vote included without the requirement for additional evidence of identity. Second, at the most recent general election over 28,000 provisional votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the deadline. Out of the 28,000 rejected votes the Electoral Commission found that over 12,000 were instances where the name of the voter was subsequently found on the certified list, so they were eligible voters. Whatever the grounds were for issuing the provisional vote, the result is that otherwise eligible votes were being excluded from the preliminary scrutiny. So in effect, the 2006 amendments were simply unworkable. What we do by this amendment is restore the custom and practice in dealing with provisional votes through this bill. I would like to thank all members who have contributed to the debate on this bill and I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the motion (Mr Gray's) be agreed to. The House divided.

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 February, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",68
43,Mr TURNBULL,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"This Broadcasting Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005 and the Copyright Act 1968. The bill has two main elements: to introduce measures to effectively implement a reorganisation of digital television channels to realise the digital dividend-that is addressed in schedule 1-and to amend the regulatory framework for free-to-air digital television services provided on the VAST satellite service, and the switch-over to digital-only television, which is addressed in schedule 2. I will begin with schedule 1, dealing with the digital dividend. As a result of the switch to digital-only television, the government plans to release spectrum-known as the digital dividend-in the frequency range 694 to 820 megahertz inclusive. Digital television switch-over will be completed in Australia, it is intended, by 31 December 2013. The UHF spectrum currently used for broadcasting services is highly valued for delivering wireless communication services including super fast mobile broadband. The government has indicated that it aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012. In order to free up this highly valued spectrum, broadcasting services will need to be relocated out of the identified digital dividend spectrum and reorganised more efficiently within the remaining broadcasting spectrum. This process is known as restacking. To assist the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to plan and implement the restack of broadcasting services as efficiently as possible, the government proposes amendments to the BroadcastLegislation ing Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act to modify the existing planning process for television broadcasting services. While the coalition understands the need to provide ACMA with greater regulatory flexibility during the restack process, we do have some concerns around the realignment of the existing licence areas into new television licence area plans. The issue is with the extensive powers that the bill gives the minister to direct ACMA to make or vary a television licence area plan for a particular area. We note that it is not intended that every television licence area plan reflect all the characteristics of each of the existing licence plans and we are concerned that there is scope for rescuing of resources between the respective broadcasters. During the recent Senate inquiry the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy testified that this bill made ‘no express prohibition on ACMA allotting broadcasting spectrum in whatever way it sees fit'. We note with concern that this means ACMA could have the discretionary power to allocate greater than two channels per television licence area plan to a more powerful broadcaster to the detriment of smaller players in the market. Despite departmental reassurances that the intention ‘is not to advantage any broadcaster and for ACMA to assign channels of equivalent utility to all broadcasters in a particular area', the coalition remains concerned that, despite the best intentions, the provisions in the bill include broad and unchecked powers. I will now move to schedule 2, which deals with the switch from analog television to digital. Members will be aware that the switch to digital is occurring region basis with Mildura and regional South Australia completed and regional Victoria and regional Queensland scheduled for the first and second half of 2011. The coalition has registered, both in this place and elsewhere on a number of occasions, its real concern with the government's handling of the switchover, particularly in regional and remote Australia. In fact my colleague the member for Casey in May last year warned this House that the government's inadequate planning and preparation would have significant consequences for consumers particularly in regional and remote Australia. Those warnings seem to have fallen on deaf ears and here the coalition finds itself again urging the government to look at the problems with their implementation of the rollout of digital television. As an overall approach the government has decided to depart from the principle that wherever analog terrestrial television channels are transmitted a digital terrestrial transmission facility should be established. This means that many people will need to switch from terrestrial television reception to satellite reception. The government has decided to fund a satellite based service called VAST, at a cost of $375 million over 12 years, and has decided to discontinue funding support to local communities, typically local councils, to provide self-help retransmission services. In a paper provided to the consumer expert group meetdising held on 26 August 2010 it was stated: There are 680 self-help sites in Australia and broadcasters will convert a number of these to digital. However, about 570 sites will not be converted and will cease operation. This will affect around 127,000 households in over 700 communities. Households in these areas may need to install VAST satellite equipment in order to watch free-to-air television. In its submission to the exposure draft of this bill, the Local Government Association of on a region-by- Queensland stated: … converting many if not most existing analogue self-help retransmission sites to digital is a more convenient and cost effective way to approach a conversion to digital TV … In Queensland, 56 councils have retransmitted analog television services to rural and remote communities for over 20 years. This convenient and low-cost service provides the simplicity of the delivery of major city television services without the need for individual satellite dishes and related equipment. The government acknowledges that there is a cost for consumers to move from terrestrial coverage to satellite and to that end they have developed a satellite subsidy scheme that reimburses eligible households to assist them with the cost of converting. The coalition urges the government to use the same rationale for communities wishing to establish their own digital terrestrial self-help transmission. As put to the recent Senate inquiry by Mr Hoffman, the general manager of the Local Government Association of Queensland: It has been acknowledged by the department that it is technically possible to undertake the self-help terrestrial retransmission. In fact, the department has advised a cost potentially between $110,000 and $270,000. Allowing the subsidy to be pooled to create a lump sum would assist the local councils involved to upgrade their facilities to digital terrestrial service without requiring further government funding. This would represent a more flexible and constructive use of the satellite subsidy scheme amount already set aside as well as having the potential to substantially reduce the added household expenses associated with the conversion to satellite television. To date the government regrettably has refused the many sensible and practical requests to pool the existing satellite subsidy scheme, and the coalition urges the government to be flexible and allow councils the right to decide, in consultation with their communities, whether converting retransmission sites is a better option for them. Further practical requests with respect to the satellite subsidy scheme have been made and ignored by the government. The coalition urges the government to consider providing subsidies for small businesses to transition to terrestrial digital television in remote Australia. The VAST satellite subsidy scheme only applies to private residential households not to hospitals, nursing homes, hotels or caravan parks or indeed any other businesses which might provide television services to their customers or guests. The government does not seem to have considered the likely substantial, if not prohibitive, cost that may otherwise have to be incurred by small businesses to procure digital television transmission. The cost to these small businesses to install multiple VAST service units is open ended and this is particularly relevant to towns and communities that rely heavily on tourism as a source of income activity. When giving evidence to the recent Senate enquiry, Mr Arnold, the manager of the Remote Area Planning and Development Board in Queensland said: We are trying to assess on behalf of individual tourism businesses the likely cost. Some of them who have looked into it are estimating it is a substantial cost-$10,000 to $20,000. In a statement to the Senate committee examining the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated that broadcasters who have undertaken to convert a transmission site from analog to digital or to establish new digital transmission facilities, or gap fillers, are required to have the site active six months before the digital switchover date. As the department rightly pointed out, this six-month time frame is critical in providing residents and businesses with the necessary time to ensure they have adequate digital television reception and to properly convert their current equipment and free-to-air television aerials. The government did not observe the six-month rule in the case of the initial Sunraysia analog switchoff or the South Australian switch-off-nor did they make it for the Victorian switch-off, due on 5 May. The coalition will be watching closely to see that the disallowable instrument the minister needs to lodge to switch off regional Queensland ensures that there will be six months between the proposed switch-off date and when the last broadcaster owned and controlled digital terrestrial transmission facility is commissioned. Turning to the specifics of schedule 2 of the bill, the coalition acknowledges that there are measures related to the VAST service in the bill that are critical to the rollout of digital television in Western Australia. We support ensuring that commercial broadcasters in remote and regional Western Australia are given the same opportunity to build the necessary infrastructure to deliver the full suite of digital television channels via terrestrial broadcast before allowing viewers in those regions to access the satellite service, thereby protecting the local terrestrial broadcast market. However, we do wish to record our reservations with items 47, 50, 51 and 52 in the bill. These measures allow broadcasters to seek exemptions from existing obligations to roll out digital terrestrial facilities in circumstances and allow the minister to exempt applications from the ABC or SBS to roll out digital terrestrial facilities of their own in certain circumstances. Under these exemptions, any commercial broadcaster, the ABC or SBS could request exemption from providing digital terrestrial transmission facilities within their ACMA conversion scheme to communities of less than 500. Under the current provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, broadcasters have no choice but to convert their analog facilities in such a way that provides for the same terrestrial signal coverage. The minister's office has advised the coalition that, left unchanged, this may result in what they describe as ‘mixed reception outcomes', where viewers need to install both terrestrial and satellite digital reception equipment to access the full range of digital television services. If this is the intention of the proposed change, the coalition is concerned that the bill actually goes well beyond this and could result in broadcasters applying for exemptions from upgrading or installing digital terrestrial services, especially in remote areas. In conclusion, the coalition acknowledges that the passage of the legislation is necessary to continue to implement the government's digital switchover policy, especially in regional and remote Western Australia. However, the coalition strongly urges the government to consider amending the bill consistent with the concerns that I have expressed. While there are no direct measures contained in this bill that would have any impact on the rollout of the satellite subsidy scheme or the six-month rule, the coalition asks the government to consider the comments that I and my colleagues, and indeed local communities, particularly in Queensland, have made, and to adjust the scheme certain to ensure smooth implementation of the switch to digital television, particularly for regional and remote Australians. It surely must be evident to the government, as it is to communities in regional Australia, that, notwithstanding the technical functionality and capacity of satellite services, it is clearly preferable where it is at all possible for digital services to be retransmitted terrestrially. To support local communities in doing that-enabling the VAST satellite subsidy to be pooled so that they have the wherewithal to convert to digital retransmission-is manifestly good policy, is in the public interest and would both improve the technical reliability of the service and reduce the cost of receiving the new digital services for householders in those regions.",68
44,Mr HAYES,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to provide the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, with improved planning and enforcement powers to implant the reorganisation of digital television channels as required. The bill will also allow for the realisation of a digital dividend of spectrum by 31 December 2014. I will go into what that means in the broader context a little later. The bill will ensure the equalisation of television services for regional, rural and remote Australia, allowing all Australians the same degree of access to television channels. Allowing for regional Australians to have access to the same television channels as the rest of us is a key outcome of the government's switchover program. The bill will enable viewers in remote and regional areas to access the VAST satellite communications service to receive the full suite of digital television channels. Providing equal access to television services to all Australians, regardless of where they live, is extremely important, and its importance has been known for some time. Before I came down to make my contribution I looked up the report of a committee inquiry that I participated in back in 2006, the House Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts inquiry into the update of digital television in Australia. Belatedly, I got my highlighter out and flipped through that document. I want to draw your attention to a couple of things I have noted. The report noted: Not since the shift from black and white to colour has so radical a change in the nature of Australian television taken place. The ‘revolution' is the introduction of digital television … and the planned switch-off of current analogue services. DTV offers clearer, sharper pictures in widescreen format. As it requires less spectrum to broadcast, it also offers opportunities for many more channels, and additional features such as interactivity and datacasting. In terms of dealing with digital television, the report says: [Digital television] is a new television technology that is replacing existing analogue free-to-air television in Australia. [Digital television] delivers television signals substantially more efficient way than the current analogue system. With analogue broadcasting, the signal is in the form of a continuous wave, whereas digital broadcasting signals are in the form of discrete bits of information. Analogue television channels can transmit one continuous stream of programming … DTV is a broadcasting transmission system which uses digital modulation techniques to transmit television programs. Mr Hartsuyker-You don't sound convincing, Chris!",71
45,Mr HAYES,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"I am getting to that. I am going to win you over yet, Luke. The report says: Through compression technology, [digital television] broadcasting transmitters have the capacity to transmit an [high definition TV] picture, or to transmit multiple programs at the same time using the same amount of bandwidth as used for analogue television. It concludes that digital television will allow for making available residual transmission capacity. And that is what has occurred. I am glad the member for Cowper intervened. He was not on that particular committee, but I recall one of his colleagues who was on the committee and who sits on the opposition front-bench took the view that under no circumstances could she ever see analogue television been switched off. Obviously a lot of water has gone under the bridge since 1976, and we have certainly progressed a long way to deliver digital television in a meaningful way to the Australian public. But we are going further. This is where the member for Cowper would probably want to get up and support this piece of legislation. He represents a rural seatincluding my parents, who are in that seatand his constituents will all benefit from the application of digital television. They will see the vast array of new programming available and they will have the ability to see in a it in high definition. We are certainly moving with the rest of the world in being able to make these services available to the Australian people. The bill also provides for a very important aspect-that is, the freeing up of some of the residual spectrum. That is scheduled to be auctioned in 2014. That spectrum is obviously very valuable space. It is something that was previously used through the analog transmission. It is now capable of being used for other activities in servicing the community. In fact, there are 106 megahertz of trum which has been freed up in what is known as the 700 band. It is an extraordinarily interesting band. This particular spectrum can carry large amounts of information, of data, at high speeds over very long distances and can penetrate buildings. As I have had the opportunity to have a discussion on the odd occasion with the minister, I have indicated to him that this is the very sort of pacity that both the police and the emergency services need to safeguard public interest, particularly during critical instances when communications systems are often congested or break down. I would highlight the experiences that we endured during the Victorian bushfires, the recent floods in Queensland, Cyclone Yasi and what occurred to our colleagues in Christchurch, where their 000 services went down for a period of five hours. Police and emergency services need access to an appropriate spectrum. I am not saying how much, but I know each of the police commissioners has sought to articulate that particular position. I know they have written to the government seeking that 20 megahertz be quarantined in that 700 spectrum for the use of police and emergency services. At the moment our ambos, our firefighters and our police all communicate on the 400 megahertz spectrum. That is a spectrum limited to voice command, voice communication. It certainly is not an area of spectrum that is going to be capable of meeting the modern needs of law enforcement or emergency services. When you have to dispatch people to a particular scene or incident and, for instance, you have to provide them with data or provide them with maps, provide them with video streaming, the 400 megahertz spectrum will not do any more than what a police walkie-talkie does, quite frankly. As I said, I know each of the police commissioners has made this matter known to specgovernment. Indeed, only recently Commissioner Negus of the Australian Federal Police, when he spoke to parliamentary officers of the law enforcement committee, indicated the AFP's significant interest in having a measure of the 700 band reserved for discrete communications of police and emergency services. If this does not occur the telecommunication systems-presumably ca- operated by companies such as Optus, Telstra, Vodafone-would all be out there and vying for this valuable piece of digital real estate, if I can put it that way. I just do not see that the police and the various fire and emergency services would be in a position to compete against those particular power players for that valuable spectrum. That is why the position has been put that a certain part of that spectrum should be quarantined from sale or auction. I know this is not what occurs in this bill but, should the government eventually reserve part of the spectrum for police and emergency services, I suggest that it be done on the basis that requirements are made for national policing and that every state and territory police service, together with the AFP, and their respective emergency services counterparts, establish a fully functioning network within five years or that such spectrum should revert to the Commonwealth for commercial disposal-in other words, a provision of ‘use it or lose it'. Fast, reliable communication and data exchange is needed by our emergency services personnel in order to provide them with the tools to do a job which is often in very, very difficult circumstances. Our police and emergency services are duty bound to protect the community at times of threats, emergencies, natural disasters and crises, and we all pay tribute to them in this place and say what an extraordinary job they do. But one of the things we also have to have central in our minds is that it is okay to give accolades to the police and emergency services but we must also make sure that, when they go and do the job that we want them to do on behalf of our community, we equip them with the appropriate resources and technologies to do just that. It is in the interests of community safety and also the safety of the 350,000 ambulance, police and fire officers and state emergency service personnel, for them to be equipped with such technology. Relying on a commercial provider does not meet the need of our public safety agencies, particularly during times of high usage or high threat, when the services of these providers could be congested to the point of failure. Internationally, the switch to digital televiing sion has also resulted in a freeing up of additional spectrum. I think it is important for this place to note that both the European Union and the USA have targeted the 700megahertz band for public safety and police communications networks-what I understand is referred to in the US as the D Block communications system. The Obama administration in the US has recently lent its full support to a proposal to give a valuable chunk of their radio waves to the emergency services and to build a national wireless high-speed broadband network for public safety. I think this is indicative of the way we are going with the application of technology-not simply in our viewing technology and how we can use it to the benefit of our communities but also in how we apply it for the issues of police, emergency services, law enforcement, and rescue and disaster response. If we are going to be conscious of providing our police with the tools that they need for protecting society, we need to ensure that they have present technologies and emerging technologies capable of being used in their communication networks. It would a great shame, in my humble opinion, if we found that a young person with a smartphone has more advanced and better communications than the capability of police officers out there carrying their two-way radios and seeking to protect the Australian community. As I indicated, I have raised these matters with the minister and he is very alive to my concerns in those areas. What I have sought to do from the outset is to show that we took what was identified in 2006, when people opposite were saying that the analog system would never be turned off, and moved this forward. We have taken the nation into the digital age not only in digital television but more recently in digital radio. We are showthe leadership that is required, and we will continue to do that. So I suggest to my colleagues opposite, including the member for Cowper, that they get on board, support this piece of legislation, support the member for Cowper's community and, more importantly, support my parents.",72
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,Thank you for your contribution. The question is that the bill be now read a second time. I call the member for Cowperprobably in response as well.,74
47,Mr HARTSUYKER,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Yes, I would certainly hasten to add that the member for Fowler can sit in this place in the full knowledge that his parents are very well represented, and I will certainly work hard to ensure that they stay that way. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The bill is presented in two schedules, the first of which introduces measures to release the so-called digital dividend. The second is to amend the regulatory framework overseeing the services provided on the VAST satellite network as part of the switchover from analog to digital television. Schedule 1 amends the Broadcasting Services Act to implement a reorganisation of spectrum management in order to release spectrum within the frequency range of 694 to 820 megahertz, which is referred to as the ‘digital dividend.' Spectrum within the digital dividend is highly valued by the broadcasting and mobile telephony industries. According to the government's green paper on managing the digital dividend, the spectrum will allow the implementation of fourth-generation mobile wireless networks using Long Term Evolution technology and mobile WiMAX. These technologies will theoretically provide peak data speeds of 100 megabits per second and higher. By accessing the spectrum, telecommunications companies will be able to provide high-speed services to consumers and households whilst allowing those consumers the flexibility to stay mobile. This legislation gives the Australian Communications and Media Authority improved planning and enforcement powers to rearrange digital television channels, a ess known as restacking. The actual digital dividend will be released by restacking the current bands of spectrum allocated to analog television, which are being converted to digital television through the digital televications sion switchover. Currently the frequency band between 582 and 820 megahertz is dedicated to the Ultra High Frequency band V, which is used to broadcast analog television. Switching over from analog to digital television frees this band by converting the broadcast of television to lower bands of spectrum. The government aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012, and the actual spectrum will become available after all broadcasting centres are converted to digital television in December 2013. ACMA will be authorised to restack television services by realigning television licence area plans to new areas and within lower bands of the spectrum. The new license area plans will be defined by ACMA through legislative instrument and would specify the channels available in particular areas of Australia to provide television broadcasting services. However, the legislation also gives the minister the power to issue a written direction to ACMA about the exercise of its powers to make or vary television licence area plans and to impose an obligation on ACMA to comply with such a direction. Ministerial directions to ACMA will be legislative instruments and tabled in parliament, but the explanatory memorandum to this bill makes it clear that the instruments will not be disallowable. This means that parliament will be able to read the ministerial direction to ACMA but will not be able to debate and vote on its content. The coalition has some concerns with this approach. The legislation today is the very proclast chance this parliament will have to meaningfully debate the release of the digital dividend and restacking television broadcasts. At the moment, we are seeing one of the largest reorganisations of telecommuniservices in Australian history through the digital dividend release and the National Broadband Network. Yet the government is operating in the dark, whilst industry operates in an environment of regulatory uncertainty. The coalition is concerned that making ACMA's management of the digital dividend subject to a non-disallowable ministerial direction only increases the uncertainty that is preventing the Australian telecommunications sector from making confident investment decisions. The NBN rollout is an example. As Pat Tapper, CEO of Internode, Australia's largest privately-owned ISP, said in the Australian newspaper three weeks ago: “The NBN is in the paper every day, but when you try to nut down on it and figure out what's happening from what's being said, there's no path you can be confident in because it's being planned and rolled out incrementally. There are a lot of variables in that.” As is evident from submissions made to the Senate inquiry on this legislation, broadcasters have already been subject to uncertain ministerial directions concerning the digital dividend. The minister issued a direction to ACMA on 9 July 2010 for the purposes of providing policy guidance on the government's digital dividend objectives. The direction was rushed through just before parliament was dissolved last year for the election. There was no opportunity for parliament to consider the direction and its importance. As Broadcast Australia says in their submission to the Senate inquiry, the direction issued on 9 July 2010: … is shaping the future of all free-to-air broadcasting for decades to come. Broadcast Australia argues: … the Directions of 9 July should be inserted into the Broadcasting Services Act … and says: We still believe this would be the desirable way allow Parliament to oversight and consider such important planning principles before their implications become a “fait accomplis”. The Local Government Association of Queensland notes in their submission: … the major policy issues concerning this enormous change in broadcasting and mobile voice and data services across Australia have been enshrined in little publicised Ministerial Directions of 9 July 2010. These … Objectives which, among other things may determine whether most areas of regional Queensland ever get digital radio, or whether a 6th free-to-air TV terrestrial frequency will be rolled out anywhere in regional Queensland deserve some debate at the Australian Parliament level. Under this legislation, there is nothing to prevent the minister from issuing directions to ACMA that again shape the direction of broadcasting without any parliamentary oversight. The coalition is concerned that such an approach could add to the regulatory uncertainty already faced by the industry. Parliament would ideally be able to scrutinise future ministerial directions to ensure that any direction is in the best interests of consumers without placing unnecessary burdens on the industry. The coalition will certainly monitor any directions made by the current minister under this legislation and will revisit the issue of non-disallowable instruments as the need arises. Schedule 2 to this bill introduces amendments to the legislative framework which the new VAST satellite service operates under. In particular, the amendments will allow broadcasters to request an exemption from providing digital terrestrial transmission facilities within the schemes operated by ACMA for broadcasters to convert their services to digital. Broadcasters will be able to request an exemption for any communication area, regardless of its population, which is not currently serviced by an analog terrestrial to broadcast by local free-to-air entities. However, the minister is not authorised to grant an exemption unless the area contains fewer than 500 people in residence. The legislation provides that an exemption would need approval by the minister and would then be tabled as a legislative instrument in parliament. The coalition is concerned that these provisions will allow commercial stations to refuse to provide television coverage to areas considered unprofitable. However, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has advised that the legislation in practice will only affect those areas receiving a broadcast solely from the ABC. According to the department, the provisions will allow the minister, on a case-bycase basis, to decide which areas can be excluded where an ABC tower is providing the ABC as the sole channel for the area and where VAST replicates what is currently available. This can be potentially applied to the 98 areas across Australia that are only served by an ABC tower. The VAST service will provide a superior television broadcast to these areas because it will contain all 16 digital channels, including the ABC which the viewer would currently receive. Viewers will also be provided with rolling local news channels, providing local news content from each regional broadcasting centre in Australia. As such, viewers in areas that currently only receive the ABC will be provided with an improved service after connecting to VAST. The coalition will be watching closely to ensure that the legislation delivers an appropriate outcome for viewers. We believe that the government must do all it can to ensure that people are able to access terrestrial television regardless of where they live. The VAST satellite service should only be seen as a service of last resort. Regional groups and local councils across Australia have concerns about the quality of service provided by VAST and the fact that many of their communities will not receive a terrestrial digital signal. Broadcast Australia submitted to the Senate inquiry that there was a misconception that the VAST service provides a comparable level of service to terrestrial television. Broadcast Australia said that: … receiving free-to-air digital TV channels (DTH) from the VAST satellite is more costly and offers less utility and convenience to homes than local terrestrial reception of those same channels. Currently there are many regional and remote communities in Australia receiving television via self-help sites, which are retransmission sites operated by local councils or community groups. These sites receive a broadcast-either terrestrially from the nearest major centre or through the Aurora satellite service-and then rebroadcast the terrestrial signal in the local community. As television broadcasting is switched over to digital, these sites will require upgrading in order to receive and broadcast a new digital signal. According to the department, broadcasters have made a candidate list of 57 communities which will be provided with a terrestrial digital signal. A further 34 regional communities currently relying on self-help sites will receive a digital signal through gap fillers, which will consist of either a stronger digital signal from nearby centres or a signal provided by the installation of signal boosters. But, according to the department, there are 16 regional communities relying on self-help sites that will not be upgraded to digital or receive a gap filler. These communities will be forced onto the VAST service. There are also 374 communities, classed as remote and which receive limited terrestrial signals, that will be forced onto the VAST service. I attended a forum recently, with the member for Dawson, at Dingo Beach in the Whitsundays region of Queensland. Dingo Beach is a small community that receives terrestrial television through a self-help tower and is not a candidate for conversion to digital. It is proposed by the government that Dingo Beach will be provided with a VAST service. The community attending that forum unanimously wanted to receive reliable terrestrial television so that they could get the relevant local content; however, unfortunately to this point the government has been unwilling to accede to the request for the provision of a terrestrial service to Dingo Beach. There are common issues across regional areas that will not be upgraded to digital. For instance, the Remote Area Planning and Development Board of Queensland lists three main concerns with the VAST service. Firstly, satellite television does not allow portability of terrestrial television, which is preferred by tourists and travellers. Unless they have expensive satellite systems, caravan tourists in particular will not be able to receive a signal when travelling through areas where there is no terrestrial coverage. Secondly, households that install a VAST satellite will be forced to move the satellite when vacating the home if they want to ensure satellite coverage in a new home without purchasing new satellite equipment. Thirdly, the government's satellite subsidy scheme does not cover businesses important to regional areas such as hotels, motels, resorts and shops. Businesses struggling with tight margins and problems such as increasing electricity costs will find it difficult to pay the $10,000 to $20,000 that it will cost some businesses to convert. For these reasons, the coalition has asked the government to complete an analysis of the costs and benefits of pooling the subsidy scheme available for households within each community that is currently serviced by a self-help site. The opposition strongly urges the government to consider this because many communities would certainly prefer that option. It may in the end turn out cheaper, depending on the size of the community involved. Instead of providing the subsidy direct to households, the funding could be pooled and used to upgrade retransmission sites, allowing digital terrestrial broadcasts to the local community. The coalition recognises that in some sites an upgrade to digital simply would not be possible. These are the areas where VAST is an appropriate service to implement, when all other avenues have been exhausted. The bill provides a means for broadcasters to rely on VAST without necessarily exhausting all avenues. The legislation as drafted the provides much scope for broadcasters to refuse an upgrade, with little guidance on how this decision should be determined. The conversion to digital is a very important issue, and the coalition certainly is concerned about the prospect that some viewers in regional and remote areas may not get equity of access to high-quality digital television. It is a vitally important issue for regional and rural Australia that people be part of the digital switchover in the most efficient and most effective way. We are certainly concerned about the impact of costs on small business. The satellite subsidy scheme also only provides for the conversion of the first television, so each additional set-top box is 100 per cent at the cost of the household, which is a significant cost for some households. The coalition certainly is supportive of the move from analog to digital and will be watching the government's performance in this area very carefully.",74
48,Ms ROWLAND,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"I will address some of the issues raised by the member for Wentworth and the member for Cowper and the concerns they say they have with the operation of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. If you want to look at a party that addresses digital black spots, look at us on this side of the House. In fact, almost a year ago it was the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy who announced a landmark agreement about VAST-a landmark agreement that would provide digital TV services to viewers who could not receive terrestrial digital TV. What Senator Conroy said was very true-that is, that we are the party, the government, of equality of opportunity when it comes to the cities and the regions. He said: This is a significant breakthrough in the provision of digital TV services to all Australians, particugoing larly for those in remote and regional areas who for many years have had to put up with less choice than people in the cities. The new VAST service will make available to all parts of Australia, for the first time, the same number of channels as those in the capital cities. So if you want to talk about equality of opportunity, if you want to talk about what is being done to ensure that viewers in regional and remote areas of Australia have the same opportunities as everyone else in the digital environment, you need look no further than us. The member for Cowper comes in here and talks about this digital switchover, the digital dividend being conducted in Australia, as being rife with uncertainty. What absolute rubbish! I defy anyone in this place to find me a better strategy being executed anywhere else in the world. Where is the regulatory uncertainty? You will find that the fulfilment of this digital dividend has the support of all aspects of the communications sector, from broadcasters to telco operators, to carriage service providers-the list goes on. It was recognised as early as January 2008, more than three years ago, that there would be an issue with the switchover timetable regarding black spots in self-help retransmission sites. So what did the government do? This government convinced broadcasters to upgrade more than 100 self-help sites to digital capacity. So it is not the first time that we have addressed this issue for the benefit of rural and remote constituents. This proposed legislation forms part of one of the most significant developments in Australia's digital economy and it is an integral step in the process of planning and enforcing the restack of certain broadcasting services that currently occupy what we call the digital dividend spectrum-the analog television spectrum which, when liberated, is to enable all Australians to utilise the highest quality future communications services. As I said, when we look at developments in all aspects of this government's ICT agenda that have led to this point-including the digital dividend consultation, the switchover, the National Broadband Network, the upcoming convergence review and the work being done by ACMA in its role of regulating the process of radio communications management, the auction of the digital dividend spectrum and the renewal of existing spectrum licences, which we legislated for in this place late last year with amendments to the Radiocommunications Act-one quickly realises there is a guiding goal towards which every agency, department policy maker and, may I say, element of the telecommunications and broadcasting sector is working. That goal is to maximise the benefits of the digital economy for all Australians: for all individuals, irrespective of where they live or work; in the utilisation of ICT by all sectors in our economy, both government and private and both large enterprises and small businesses; and for all types of players, such as the carriers, carriage service providers, ISPs, broadcasters and other innovators. The spectrum path that is being pursued by this government is a fabulous opportunity for Australia to enjoy significant wireless broadband services, utilising the sweet spot of that liberated spectrum as a complement to the NBN. In fact, the two work hand in hand. You would think, given this, that it would be something that those opposite would be embracing, would be speaking on and would be welcoming. But, no, those opposite only have one strategic direction in relation to ICT, as we all know-that is, to destroy the NBN. On that point, I turn to the coalition's policy platform on the digital dividend, and I use the term ‘policy platform' loosely, because it is a bit hard to find any actual semblance of it. When you do look at their policy which they took to the last election, surprise! It is still their policy today. You look for some semblance of spectrum management, something that has to do with the digital dividend, and you actually do not find very much. You find statements such as: To assist in achieving the most rapid possible rollout of services, the Coalition active approach to spectrum allocation to support its broadband initiatives. You actually do not see anything in that policy about the concerns that members opposite have brought here today. You do not see a single thing in that policy about rural and remote Australia having quality of access to digital television channels. You do not see anything in that policy about a strategic direction when it comes to fulfilling the digital dividend. It was so important to them that it does not even rate a mention in what is still their policy. At this point I think it is very useful to look at the context of both this bill and the broader digital dividend framework, the fact that spectrum is a finite resource that is used but not consumed and the ways in which we regulate spectrum. We regulate spectrum to avoid interference. We want to ensure that appropriate rent is paid for a scare resource and we want to provide certainty for existing and future users of that valuable space. The objects of the Radiocommunications Act are very instructive on this point, and they include maximising, through the efficient allocation and use of the spectrum, the overall public benefit derived from using the radcomms spectrum. There are lots of public benefits at stake here and lots of public benefits in the decisions governments will make in fulfilling those statutory objects. We as a government-we as a legislature as a whole, in fact-bear those statutory obligations. Looking at the overall public benefit, I want to remind all of us here that one of the public benefits is to maximise the financial return on this spectrum. That is why we seek a return on this scare resource through a simultaneous multiple-round ascending auction process. In particular, I want to reiterate that we only get one opportunity to do this. We only get one bite at what is called the ‘sweet spot' of the spectrum-one opportunity to will take a proget it correct. Turning to the restack and the nature of this bill and its role in the realisation of the digital dividend, this government took the bold decision to put 126 megahertz of the 700 megahertz band into the digital dividend, using a process that is internationally harmonised with our neighbouring countries. The services that will be offered are significant and exciting, and we are already seeing Telstra trialling some of those services and looking to roll out wireless services of similar great potential. I want to turn to the process and the green paper that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy released and consulted on which gave rise to the current strategy that is being pursued. In June last year, when he announced the size and location of the digital dividend, the minister noted: Wireless broadband is an important complement to fixed line services, and the release of this spectrum will enhance and support the services that will be enabled by the Government's investment in the National Broadband Network. Extensive consultation was undertaken on the green paper, and what the minister announced reflects the importance of the decision that was made again-only having one chance to get this right when the liberated spectrum is reallocated. The release is in a contiguous block in the UHF band, and a contiguous dividend means substantial connectivity and productivity benefits will flow. It avoids what engineers will call the ‘swiss cheese' problem: irregular holes in the spectrum that are not suitable for advanced wireless broadband services. As the minister said in his announcement, this is indeed a historic microeconomic reform. The auction process will be conducted in the second half of next year, and the clearance of that space will be as soon as possible after the analog switchoff on 31 December 2013. This process has been one of certainty and sound strategyagain, consistent with the imperatives of spectrum management. I want to turn to the restack and the process of clearing out those broadcasting services currently occupying the sweet spot of the spectrum and how they are going to be organised more efficiently. ACMA has been working on these complex issues associated with the restack and the switch-off. There has been significant coordination with broadcasters. In terms of a digital dividend for television, there are essentially two ways of restacking in channels 52 to 69, commonly referred to the block approach versus the minimum move approach. Either everything above channel 52 gets moved or you have a block move-all six digital channels are moved next door to each other. You can see the good outcomes that could possibly flow from that option, such as all antennae being able to work. Amongst other things, ACMA is taking these things into account and is cognisant of the need to minimise viewer disruption. In fact, it is currently consulting on these two proposed planning approaches for the restack. ACMA has also made it clear that the broadcasting industry will need to coordinate its efforts to avoid disrupting services. This again reflects the very sound approach being taken by the regulator, working in conjunction with the industry, to ensure that all consumers benefit from the digital dividend. I want to say some other things about the ACMA process. I think Giles Tanner from ACMA summed it up very well when he described the digital dividend and how the advances in digital communications technology allow us to do more with less. ACMA's role in the digital dividend is threefold: the conversion process, moving from free-to-air analog to digital; the restack of those digital TV services into a smaller amount of the UHF spectrum band slots; and the reallocation of the liberated spectrum left vacant after the TV restack. As I said, that reallocation will take the form of spectrum licences. In Australia our approach is to have an auction process, consistent with the recognition of the value of this spectrum and the imperative of achieving an appropriate rent for such a valuable, scarce resource. Also, consistent with the statutory objects of the act, 15-year spectrum licences will be auctioned. This reflects intelligent planning. It will avoid having a period when there is spectrum lying unused between the analog shutdown and the start date for the new uses of the digital dividend spectrum. Reallocation will occur in parallel with the planning and implementation of the restack. I said earlier that I defy anyone to find a strategy that has been carried out in a more orderly and structured way. I want to turn to the overseas experience in this area and the importance of harmonisation. It is very useful to contrast the successful transition that is underway in Australia with the European experience. So much of the time European countries take action on certain policy issues only when they are directed to do so and are threatened with action under the European Union sanctions process. In contrast, Australia is actually helping with the harmonisation. We are reflecting the true nature of comms management as a global management issue of standardisation and interference management. In this radcomms area it is actually counterproductive to insist on a uniquely Australian solution. The result of the approach we have taken is that other countries actually are going to look to Australia as a model of how to do this task successfully. This is a very good news story for Australia. The spectrum auction process will deliver benefits for consumers, including economies of scale, achieved by harmonising our use of the 700 megahertz spectrum with the uses in major overseas markets. There are headlines in Europe, for example, that say that the digital dividend may not pay off as well as it should. There are risks in some countries where spectrum is being freed up that only uses a fraction of that required for analog transmission. From initial auctions, the trend is not encouraging for consumers. The Swedish auction has only confirmed the status quo, to preserve what some have analysed to be an oligopoly in the domestic mobile business. Australia has very sound spectrum management rules to overcome that. The bill confers on ACMA and indeed clarifies some aspects that have been interpreted as statutory impediments to carrying out its planning functions in this digital dend task. The broadcasting sector and the telcos are on board. The amendments that have been made through the Radiocommunications Act and the Broadcasting Services Act continue a very clear strategy that is being held up as world's best practice. All of us in this place should embrace the realisation of the digital dividend.",78
49,Mr TRUSS,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"As we have heard, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 seeks to take some further steps in the rad- government's program to convert Australia's television system to digital. The elements in the bill will make some improvements in that regard, but this debate gives us an opportunity to review the progress of the analog switch-off. There are widespread concerns in the community about the impact on households of the digital conversion. This is the first time in history that a Labor government has delivered something to the country areas before the cities. I suppose that should have set off alarms in the first place. Country areas are clearly being used as the experimental guinea pigs to see whether this conversion can be run smoothly before it is attempted in any of the large cities. The member for Greenway said that the digital television system will deliver equality of access to people in regional Australia. It is true to say that for most people who live in regional communities it will deliver equality of access to the range of channels that exist in the cities. There will also be a small number of people in remote areas who will be better off than they were, and that is certainly to the credit of this program. Unfortunately, there will also be some thousands who will be much worse off. Those people cause me the greatest concern. The government's decision to not convert over 400 of the self-help transmitters around divithe country means that over 400 communities will have their analog television signals switched off and there will be no digital transmission coming from the transmitters. Instead, the government is offering a satellite option, an option which is obviously inferior for most of these people. The government is going to make billions of dollars out of the sale of the spectrum that will be freed up as a result of the closure of the analog television network. Why can't it spend some of those dollars-$100 million or so would just about do it-to convert all of the self-help transmitters so that people living in small regional communities and in some cases urban communities are able to get their signal in the same way that they get it now? That is surely a reasonable request. About 100 or so of the transmitters will be converted, largely at the expense of the television stations themselves, but over 400 will not. That seems to me to be not treating people in regional areas as fairly as they should be treated. Debate interrupted NA Newman, Mr Campbell",82
50,Mrs PRENTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I stand today to support and endorse Campbell Newman as the next Premier of Queensland. We also need a Liberal National Party member to represent the people of Ashgrove, a state seat within my electorate of Ryan. We need a strong and effective Premier of Queensland, and I can think of no-one better than Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. You do not get a reputation around Brisbane and Queensland as ‘Can Do' Campbell without having a strong track record of action, commitment and delivery. There is no doubt that Campbell will deliver for the people of Ashgrove as their local member and for all Queenslanders as their Premier, just as he has for the people of Brisbane for the past seven years. Having worked closely with Campbell since 2002, I know he will make an outstanding contribution to state politics and state Liberal National Party team, both as a member and as leader. Campbell's energy, passion and commitment to Brisbane and Queensland are something I admire, and I know he will work tirelessly and faithfully for the people of Ashgrove and deliver the LNP to government in Queensland. Campbell's experience in senior management and in the military and his commitment to getting on with the job of delivering services and outcomes for Brisbane residents and Queenslanders will stand in stark contrast to the tired Bligh Labor spin machine. I have every confidence that Campbell Newman will be able to make this unique situation work and, furthermore, run an effective and powerful campaign to be both the leader of the LNP and the Premier of Queensland. (Time expired) Buckingham, Mr Don",83
51,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to say a few words in memory of Don Buckingham, a Fremantle constituent and a true friend. Don died on Labour Day, 7 March, which is appropriate for a man who gave such a great deal of his time and passion to the labour cause and to the Australian Labor Party. He was 70 years old, and is loved and missed by his wife, Alison, his three children, his two grandchildren, his wider family and many friends. I first met Don in 2007 during the course of my election campaign in Fremantle. Throughout that time with all its intensities, with all its highs and lows, Don Buckingham was a constant presence and a constant source of can-do energy and enthusiasm for the good fight that is politics in Australia. At the service to mark Don's passing, it was remarked time and again that here was a gentleman of generosity, social conscience, good humour and an irrepressible kind of larrikin spirit. He loved a bet. He loved a the good pair of shoes. He loved a cup of tea after helping to stuff a few thousand envelopes in the name of a Labor win. I was the beneficiary of Don's hard work-he walked a lot of miles for me. Don Buckingham is someone I will always associate with the best in politics: a person of strong principles; a person of indefatigable commitment; a person who took local political engagement seriously, but not too seriously. He was much loved by me, by my staff and by fellow Freo Labor members. And we will remember him. Mount Barker Community Resource Centre",83
52,Mr CROOK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I recently had the opportunity to visit the community of Mount Barker in my electorate of O'Connor and meet with a dedicated group of volunteers who have spent the last five years coordinating the establishment of the Mount Barker Community Resource Centre. The community resource centre is now nearing completion and it is a very impressive building indeed. When completed, the building will feature a library, a computer room, office space, a seminar room, a worship centre, a professional kitchen and seat auditorium for community functions, school events or private hire. The resource centre will also play host to a number of community services, including Centrelink, Foodbank, the YMCA, the Great Southern Aboriginal Corporation, counselling services and after-school homework classes. The centre has been funded with much support from Lotterywest and the Royalties for Regions program and a very strong contribution from the Baptist Church, who have also volunteered considerable man-hours towards the project, including installing the fencing and brickwork for the building. I understand many contractors have also contributed labour and materials in kind towards construction, and many community members have volunteered their time to provide Mount Barker and the surrounding areas with an amazing resource for many years to come. This level of community support is indicative of many regional communities and it is always a pleasure to see them in action. I was very pleased to take a tour of the facility and I look forward to visiting again when the building is officially opened later this year. The Mount Barker Community Resource Centre committee should be commended for the many hours they have contributed to establishing a facility that will be utilised and enjoyed by the whole community. Illawarra Floods",84
53,Mr STEPHEN JONES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Monday this week I advised the House of the terrible floods that have affected my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra of New South Wales. During Monday night and Tuesday morning over 290 millimetres of rain fell in a small area in just a few hours. There was devastation to property and, tragically, the loss of one man's life. I would like to take this opportunity to a 200once again praise the local SES who have taken, and responded to, over 800 calls for assistance. I would also like to heap praise on the local schools, particularly Albion Park Public School at Tongarra and other schools who looked after many kids because their parents simply could not get through flood affected areas to pick them up from school. A number of kids slept overnight in school gymnasiums. Thankfully, overnight the New South Wales Premier has declared the local government areas of Bega, Bombala, Kiama and Shellharbour as natural disaster affected. As a consequence, the Attorney-General has now announced that the Commonwealth government will provide financial assistance to these communities under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. This is very welcome indeed. I would encourage all local residents, particularly individuals, who have been affected by these floods to avail themselves of this assistance. Foetal Alcohol Syndrome",84
54,Dr STONE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"foetal alcohol spectrum disorder or foetal alcohol syndrome is the greatest cause of nongenetic permanent intellectual and physical disability in newborns in Australia. In fact, you drink while pregnant you are running an enormous risk with your baby. Nearly 60 percent of Australian women do drink alcohol during their pregnancy. Too many do not know the risks they take. Yesterday, in a bipartisan approach, members and senators formed a new group with the aim of eliminating FAS and FASD from Australia. We are one of the few developed nations still not taking this problem seriously; a problem which affects young Australians right through their lives in very ous and debilitating ways. This group aims to ensure that in the future there are warnings on alcohol product labelling. We need a national diagnostic tool for this condition, and this is under development. We need better education for practising medical professionals, service providers and particularly police and those who work in the judiciary. We need to assist and support pregnant women who have alcohol dependency and we need to learn from best practice overseas. Of course, we need to give FAS and FASD the status of recognised disabilities in Australia to facilitate better funding for the delivery of services, and to help families who are dealing with the victims of FAS or FASD and who struggle every day to make sure that their children have a decent life. Tasmanian Institute of Sport Awards",85
55,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It would be remiss of me not to mention the Sheffield Shield. I congratulate Tim Coyle, the coach of the Tassie Tigers, and George Bailey, the captain, on a wonderful victory for the best state in Australia-Tasmania. I was at the TIS awards the other night and I came across some wonderful young people. There was Amy Cure, who won world titles in cycling in Europe; Belinda Goss, who won legs of the Netherlands Cyif cling Tour; and Eddie Ockenden, who captained the Australian hockey team during the year. These are great individuals who really represent Tasmania well. I would like to mention Marjory Kerslake. Marjory is not an outstanding athlete, but for the last 37 years she has supported the Devon Netball Association and is a life member of Netball Australia. She is a fantastic and dedicated woman, and you would not find anyone more dedicated in any sporting arena. I would also like to mention Joshua seriBowring, who is an umpire in netball. There is little recognition for these wonderful servants of the game, but he umpired in the Australian Netball League and did a semifinal in Launceston as well as the grand final in Melbourne. I also mention Ray Denton of the Paringa Archery Club, who gave wonderful and outstanding service to our community. Proston Show Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (1.54 pm)-On Saturday, 12 March, I had the pleasure of opening the Proston show in the south of my electorate of Flynn. The Proston show is the first of the regional shows, and is a credit to their community. It is the first opportunity for exhibitors to prepare their stock for showing on the regional circuit and, of course, at the Brisbane Ekka. The Proston region has suffered from the recent constant rain, and I would like to congratulate all exhibitors for their mighty effort to present such magnificent animals. The cattle, horses and poultry were in great condition, and it was a pleasure to present the winning ribbons to the proud owners. And the contributions in the baking competition, cake decoration, needlework and floral arranging were outstanding. I was delighted to see so many children participating in the various events, the horse jumping being my favourite. The whip cracking and wood chopping also drew good crowds. Congratulations to the President, Anthony Rosser, who actually manages a cattle property consisting of 20,000 head not so far away from Proston, and to the Secretary, Glenda MCArdle, and their committee for a wonderful day. I also thank the Proston community for supporting such a wonderful event. Cane, Ms Maureen",85
56,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to acknowledge the outstanding contribution to the Canberra community by Maureen Cane, who recently retired after 10 years as chief executive officer of Communities@Work. Over the decade Maureen Cane has harnessed what she describes as ‘that wonderful Tuggeranong community spirit' and has built an extremely successful community enterprise. Under her stewardship, Communities@Work has grown into an organisation with over 400 staff, more than 200 volunteers and 150 home based, family day carers. It provides services and facilities in children's services, before and after school care, respite care, disability services and services for families and youth at risk. It offers serernment: vices for school aged children and seniors, well as training through its NuSkills Learning and Development. It initiated Business Tuggeranong, which brings businesses and employers together to promote the region as a great place to do business. I am a member of that group. It also presents many public events, such as the Celebration of Families and the Weston Creek Spring Festival. Communities@Work also runs OzHarvest Canberra, rescuing food so that charities and refuges across the ACT can better assist people in need. It does everything. It was a fitting tribute earlier this month when Maureen Cane was named Canberra Citizen of the Year. I congratulate her on her enormous achievements which have had a major impact on the greater good of the Canberra community. (Time expired) Hughes Electorate: Coptic Community",86
57,Mr CRAIG KELLY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Coptic people make up a valued and active part of the community in my electorate of Hughes. Three Coptic parishes surround the boundaries of the Hughes electorate, and we are privileged to have St Marks Coptic College in the suburb of Wattle Grove. On their own initiative, the Coptic people in and around Sydney have worked hard to put together a petition, and have gathered over 1,300 signatures. Unfortunately, the petition does not meet the criteria necessary for it to be tabled as a petition, but I am advised I can seek leave to table it as a document. Their petition seeks to draw attention to the serious human rights violations against the Coptic people-a recent example being the New Year bombing at Alexandria's ‘Saints' church which claimed at least 24 Christian lives-and to request the Australian government to ask the Egyptian gov(1) to set up an independent inquiry as to investigate the atrocities committed against the Coptic people, and the perpetrators of these atrocities; (2) to implement laws to prevent violence against Copts; (3) to implement laws that afford equal rights for Egypt's Coptic people to those of Egypt's Muslim community; and (4) to abolish any existing laws that discriminate against Christians in Egypt. I therefore seek leave to table this document. Leave granted. Surf Life Saving Tasmania",86
58,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to offer a bouquet to Surf Life Saving Tasmania for their wonderful work in organising schools and school-age children with disabilities, taking them to surf beaches during last summer. They were awarded recognition at the Tasmanian Institute of Sport awards. I would also like to congratulate the port Surf Lifesaving Club, which last Sunday took a group of Nepalese people to the beach. Some of these people had never been to a beach before. It was wonderful to see them being thrown under waves and getting up with great and gracious smiles on their faces. This was a fantastic effort by Surf Saving and the Bridport Surf Lifesaving Club.",87
59,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Carbon Pricing",87
60,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister, and I ask this question on behalf of the thousands of people gathered outside Parliament House today who the Prime Minister would not talk to. I ask the Prime Minister: will she seek a mandate for her carbon tax before she introduces legislation into this House? Will she seek to make the next election a referendum on her unnecessary new tax?",87
61,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the question of attending the rally outside Parliament House today, I am not aware that I was invited. But, as I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition did not lack for red-headed company at that rally. He had a red-headed friend out at that rally, so I am sure he would not have missed me. Let me turn to the substantive question that he has asked me about talking to the Australian people and campaigning for climate change action. The Leader of the Opposition seems to have forgotten that he sat in the Howard cabinet for years-a truly remarkable feat-and that he used to claim the Prime Minister as his political mentor. He sat in that cabinet day after day making decisions for the Howard government. Let me Brid- remind the Leader of the Opposition that amongst the decisions the Howard government made was their decision to go to the 2007 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme. The Labor Party also went to the 2007 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme and we went to the 2010 election Life arguing for an emissions trading scheme. Mr Christensen interjecting",87
62,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We understand that the Leader of the Opposition wants to continue his scare campaigns. He only knows one thing, which is to scare people, to try to make them afraid, and to deny the future. He has no positive policies and plans. What is remarkable is not his hollowness, because that is well-known; what is remarkable is that he would march away from the legacy of the Howard government at such a speedmarch away from Prime Minister Howard's commitments to an emissions trading scheme and march away from the Liberal Party philosophy about the power of the markets. The Leader of the Opposition may be stuck in this denial and in his inability to make up a policy for the nation's future, but we are not. We will get on with the job of leading this nation to a clean energy future. If you care about the jobs of the future, you want to price carbon. If you care about the environment, you want to price carbon. That is precisely what we will do. Carbon Pricing Mrs D'ATH (2.03 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is it important to the government that facts, not fear, be the basis for tackling climate change? How has pricing carbon and believing in climate change been an issue for the government",87

65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Wakefield! The member for Petrie has the call. Mrs D'ATH-Why is it important to the government that facts, not fear, be the basis for tackling climate change? How has pricing carbon and believing in climate change been an issue for the government of Australia over the last two decades?",88
66,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her wonderfully perceptive question, because her question actually captures the major issue before this parliament today. I know the member for Petrie is someone who is in touch with her community and is out there having the real discussions with community about this nation's ing the need to tackle climate change and to price carbon. As she does that, I know that she says to people in her community, in the wonderful state of Queensland, that we are a nation blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy.",88

69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House will come to order! The Prime Minister has the call. She should be heard in relative silence.,88
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was pointing to the fact that our nation is blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy-wind, geothermal and solar. We have abundant sources. If we look at solar energy, we have more solar radiation per square metre than any other continent in the world. In fact, we could power our country 500 times over if we were able to capture all of the solar energy in places where we could reasonably install solar panels. And if we used just one per cent of our estimated geothermal energy, we could supply roughly 25,000 times our energy consumption. These are great possibilities for our nation and great possibilities for its future. But, in order to realise those great possibilities, we need to get on with the job of pricing carbon. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",88
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar!,88
72,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked about a naher tional debate-a national debate between future, includ- fear and factsMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",88
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar is warned!,88
74,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"a national debate about pricing carbon and ensuring we do the right thing by our environment. I would like to remind people of some moments in that national debate. I have here the Liberal Party climate change policy from 1990. It has got Andrew Peacock on it, as of course it would, as he was the leader at the time. We all know that a souffle does not rise twice, but Mr Peacock did want to do something about rising greenhouse gases. And here we have his policy: a target to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 20 per cent by the year 2000-a more progressive man in 1990 than the Leader of the Opposition is today. When you look at the election policy, you see that he was arguing for a tax review to promote sound environmental practices in industry and he said that he would never resile from a willingness to act in the genuine national interest wherever that is required. The history of Liberal engagement with this question goes on. Here is the environment policy from the days of John Hewson and Fightback. As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition wrote Fightback. Maybe he wrote this as well: ‘a better environment and jobs'-their policy. This says: ‘Where possible, the coalition will look for market solutions to environmental problems. We will use market forces and realistic pricing mechanisms as the primary means of regulation.' That is something the Liberal Party no longer believes in. Then, from the 2007 election, we have all of these documents, with Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello committing the Liberal Party to action on climate change and an emissions trading scheme. Those were the days when the Liberal Party bothered to deal with facts. Now they have succumbed to this low point under the Leader of the Opposition, where all they deal in is fear. Does the Leader of the Opposition remember those days? (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",88
75,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister, and I refer her the statement of Greens party leader Bob Brown last night on 7.30 when he said that he did not force the Prime Minister to introduce a carbon tax. How does she reconcile his admission with her claim on 24 February that she broke her promise to not introduce a carbon tax because of the changed circumstances of this parliament? If Bob Brown did not make her break this promise, who did?",89
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and let me advise him: I make my own decisions. I make my own decisions based on my convictions. When I work through policies for the government, I rely on facts. So how have I formed my view about climate change? Let me be very clear. I looked to the scientific community for what the scientific consensus was. I dealt with facts, not fear. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is in a flirtation with climate change denial. I have looked at the facts and at the science. I formed the view that we need to act. I have accepted economic advice from around the worldthe same economic advice the member for Flinders accepted when he wrote his thesis and the same advice former Prime Minister Howard accepted when he released these documents and when the current Leader of the Opposition was in his cabinet. That advice was that the best way of acting on carbon pollution was to harness the power of the market and to have an emissions trading scheme. I remind the House that in 2007 Prime Minister Howard actually went to the election promising ‘the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world'. Post the 2010 election, we work in the parliament the Australian people voted for. In this parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, we work with others to secure reforms in the national interest. I formed the view, working with the Multito Party Climate Change Committee and understanding the views of members who are represented on that committee, including the Australian Greens, Mr Windsor and Mr Oakshott, that the best way of securing reform in this parliament, the way forward, was to bring a carbon pricing mechanism to the parliament, and I announced that carbon pricing mechanism. I had a choice between acting and not acting. I had a choice between acting in the national interest and failing to do so. I had a choice between accepting the science and engaging in denial. I had a choice between accepting quality economic advice and rejecting that advice. On every occasion, I made a choice to act-to accept the science, to accept the economic advice, and to work with this parliament to bring carbon pricing to this parliament. Unfortunately, at every point the Leader of the Opposition has made a different choice: to flirt with climate change denial, to reject economic advice and the power of the markets, to turn his back on 20 years of Liberal engagement with reducing carbon pollution-most recently Prime Minister Howard's promise to enact the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world. In making that choice, the Leader of the Opposition was guided every step of the way by his political interest. He thinks it is in his political interest to be out there raising fear and scaring the community. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on every judgment call he has needed to make in the nation's interest on the question of climate change, he has called wrong. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition too that the Australian community will hold him to account for that.",89
77,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a supplementary question. In the light of the evasions that we have just heard from her, I ask the Prime Minister: does she honestly believe that she would be in the Lodge today if, six days before the last election, she had been straight with the Australian people and said upfront to them, ‘Yes, there will be a carbon tax under the government I lead'?",90
78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will answer the Leader of the Opposition first using these words: No great challenge has ever yielded to fear or guilt. Nor will this one. Human ingenuity, directed towards clean technology and wise institutional design, remain our best weapon. Who said that? John Howard said that. In respect of those who decried measures like carbon pricing, using markets or denying the science, he, former Prime Minister John Howard, said: They are the real climate change deniers because they deny … rational, realistic and sustainable policy solutions. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: how does he parade himself before the Australian people claiming to be dressed in the clothes of a Liberal leader? Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was about the Prime Minister's pre-election deceit, and she should be directly relevant to the question.

80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Kingston who is now within earshot and out of her place, should be very careful. The Prime Minister understands the need under the standing orders to be directly relevant to the question. She will relate her material to the supplementary question.",90
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question the Leader of the Opposition has asked me, I say this first: how does he go before the Australian people dressed in the clothes of a Liberal leader and deny more than 20 years of Liberal engagement with the science of climate change and deny the tradition of the Liberal Party in engaging with markets? What I said to the Australian people before the last election is that climate change is real. I accept the science. It is caused by human activity. We need to act. The way to act is to introduce an emissions trading scheme, and we will get there. We will get to an emissions trading scheme, working with the parliament that the Australian people elected. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, reluctantly: she is defying your instruction to be directly relevant to the question. Mr Hunt interjecting Mr Dreyfus interjecting",90

84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that I understand his frustration, that he believes that he is (a) not getting the answer he is trying to elicit and (b) not being answered in the way he would wish. I have said to this House that, if members want to improve the exchange in questions and answers, the simplest way of doing that is to apply the same rules to both, which would remove the argument. I regret to say that we confront a decision that I have to make on whether the response be argument or the placing of facts before the chamber and whether it is directly relevant or not. Whilst I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition believes he has asked a specific question for which he wants a direct answer, as I have stated throughout the year, that is not the standing order. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order: the question was about the Lodge, not the dodge. She should be directly relevant.",91
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition is now advised that the latitude extended to leaders for this question time has been used. The Prime Minister has the call.,91
86,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying: I said to the Australian people before the 2010 election that I believed climate change was real. I said to the Australian people before that election that climate change was induced by human activity. It is induced by carbon pollution and we need to act on carbon pollution. I said to the Australian people the best way of addressing carbon pollution was to price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. And we will get there. Of course I campaigned for majority government. I work now in the parliament the Australian people voted for, and in this parliament we will price carbon through the carbon mechanism that I announced, despite the fear campaign of the Leader of the Opposition, despite the campaign of denial and fear that he is raising. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to debate political honesty in this place, then bring it on",91
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will return to the question.,91
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"because did he go to the Australian people before the last election telling them about his $11 billion black hole? Did he go to the Australian people before the last election saying One Nation would write his economic policy? Did he go to the Australian people before the last election saying senior members of his front-bench, like the shadow Treasurer, would agitate for the return of Work Choices? No, he did not. So if we want to have a debate about political honesty, bring it on because we have the most hollow man with the least conviction sitting in the opposition's leaders chair we have ever seen in this parliament.

92,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why is putting a price on carbon an important economic reform for Australia's future; and what is the government's response to recent expressions of opinion on the economics of a carbon price?",92
93,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for this very important question because putting a price on carbon is the right thing to do for Australia. It is not an easy thing to do. There are no soft options and of course there are no cost-free options, but it is the right thing to do not just for the future of our country but also for the future of our economy. There are diverse views in the community, and we welcome a full debate about global warming and what must be done about it. We welcome a frank debate, but that debate must be based on facts, not on fear. The behaviour that we have seen from the opposition, and particularly the opposition leader, today is that he is moving over to the fringe. He is moving over to the fear side of the argument and he does not want to confront the facts. Yesterday he took offence in this House at being called a climate change denier. But out there today he was addressing a climate sceptics rally. Yesterday he was claiming he was somehow a believer in action on global warming but today he is out there addressing a rally of climate change sceptics. I would like to quote from the website used by the group that was out the front of parliament today. Fair enough: they should be out expressing their opinions. I do not contest that for a moment. This is a debate about ideas. It should be a debate about ideas. It should be a debate about fact. But this is what the website that is used by those who were outside parliament today saysand everybody should listen very carefully: CO2 is not pollution and does not need to be reduced in the first place … It then goes on to say: Any warming from CO2 is likely to be harmless. He was out there today addressing a rally of climate change sceptics. Yesterday he took offence about being called a climate change denier. How can he have any credibility in here when he says he believes in dealing with global warming and goes out and addresses a rally of people who do not believe in dealing with global warming? How can he have any crediblity at all? He comes into this House and says he is a believer in markets and then he puts forward some Russian-style scheme to deal with changes in the environment. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question is out of order in that in contravention of standing order 100 it invites inferences, imputations and insults about the people who are in the rally today who are defenceless to defend themselves. Quite properly, the answer is in fact showing that the question is out of order in the first place, and indeed the member for Isaacs earlier in the chamber said across the chamber to me, ‘How could you associate with those people?' The implications and the insults that are coming from that side of the House and the scare campaign means that the minister should be sat down.",92
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Having allowed the question and having it responded to for two minutes and 47 seconds, it is a bit late be raising a point of order about the question. I would invite the Treasurer to conclude his answer and remind him of the requirement to be directly relevant to the question.",93
95,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am being directly relevant to the question. I was asked about views which have been expressed, because views have been expressed in this House by the Leader of the Opposition that they are concerned about the cost of living. Now we hear they want to rip that cost of living out, and we have had the most extraordinary article today in the Sydney Morning Herald by Lenore Taylor and Phillip Coorey where they get the yarn where they were in fact instructed in the shadow cabinet not to tell anybody they had taken a decision to rip out household assistance, should it be provided. These double standards are absolutely extraordinary. But poor old Joe let the cat out of the bag. The coffee was barely warm in the shadow cabinet before he got on the agenda and told the truth.

98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is one thing to be a climate change denier, if you are not wise or do not understand the science; it is entirely other thing to know the science and then go out and deny it.

I refer the Prime Minister to comments of the Chairman of BlueScope Steel at the Press Club yesterday that China has a coal fired power system equal to more than 13 times Australia's entire electricity generation and that between now and 2020 it is planning to add a further 60 per cent to its existing coal fired power generation.

102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. What I said yesterday to the parliament was accurate, and let me add to it today. Let me inform the member who asked the question that in 2009, for the second year in a row, both the US and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, than from conventional sources. Let me also advise the an- member that renewables account for 60 per cent of newly installed capacity in Europe and more than 50 per cent in the US. At the same time, let me inform the member that China surpassed the US as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy. Mrs Mirabella interjecting",93
103,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let's just go through that sentence again because the member was yelling instead of listening. She pretends an interest in this question, but she is really on the fear campaign. Let's just go through that very slowly for her again. China surpassed the US as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy. Let's just have a think about what that means for the future of the global economy and the economy of our region. We have the giant economy of China investing at that rate in clean energy, more than the United States. What should that imply to the member for Indi if she really stopped and thought about it? It should imply that China is making those investments for a purpose. It is making those investments because it too wants to tackle climate change. It should imply to the member for Indi that there will be huge economic possibilities for our nation as China invests. If we research and develop and are at the forefront, the cutting edge of this technology, imagine the wealth that could be generated. If we are there as a clean energy nation ourselves, able to export technologies and knowledge to a giant like China, imagine the wealth. Of course, the member for Indi sits there and shakes her head because she is not interested in the facts and she is not interested in imagining the possibilities of the future. Let me say to the member for Indi: our future as a nation will be made by being a cleaner energy economy. We cannot afford to be left behind as giants like China and the US and the countries of Europe change and move. We cannot afford to be left behind. Prime Minister Howard understood this; Treasurer Peter Costello understood this. The member who asked the question campaigned in the 2007 election on the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. She was re-elected in this parliament in 2007 on the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. I say to the members of the Liberal Party just who are truly ashamed of this fear campaign, who are truly ashamed of how low the Liberal Party has fallen under this Leader of the Opposition: it is time for them to assert themselves and say unambiguously that they believe in the climate change scienceMr Simpkins-Let's have an election and decide it.",94

106,Mr CROOK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Health. The implementation of low-aromatic fuels in remote communities of Australia as a tool to combat the petrol sniffing epidemic is vitally important. A report from the Department of Health and Ageing in 2008 found a 70 per cent drop in the occurrence of petrol sniffing when low-aromatic fuel was made available. Whilst I acknowledge that implementation of low-aromatic fuels is only part of the solution, could the minister please advise the House of the progress that has been made in relation to the rollout of Opal fuel to the northern goldfields of Western Australia, the Central Desert and the Ngaanyatjarra Lands in an effort to curb the alarming occurrence of petrol sniffing?",94
107,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I know he shares the concern with many members in this chamber of the scourge of petrol sniffing on Aboriginal communities across this country and the dramatic impact it has on young people in particular. My own involvement with this terrible issue goes back three decades, when I was involved in helping to set up a petrolsniffing program in the Central Desert lands of Pitjantjatjara country in 1980 and 1981. So I share his concern and understand the dramatic implications of petrol sniffing. I informed the House when the member last asked me a question that the Commonwealth had committed $84 million to the rollout of Opal over the next four years. I indicated then that we had problems in rolling it out in the goldfields region because of infrastructure issues. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, after consultation with BP Australia, those infrastructure issues have been overcome and that, as of 21 March, a communication strategy was entered into in the goldfields region to inform people about the arrival of Opal and that Opal would start to be delivered in the goldfields as at 31 March. It will be rolled out progressively over two months, and I expect that we will see many of the petrol stations the region delivering Opal to consumers over that period. I say to the member that, since we last spoke about this, BP has had Opal independently tested and evaluated by, I think, Orbital in Western Australia. Their conclusion is that this fuel is as good if not better than other unleaded fuels. There will be no harm to small boat motors, to lawnmowers or to cars as a result of the use of this fuel, and those people in the community who are concerned about its impact upon their vehicles ought to understand that this is a very good fuel that will not harm their vehicles. I know that the member is aware that there are some sceptics and deniers in his own community around the issue of Opal. They exist in the Northern Territory as well. I say to them: get your head out of the sand, get with the game and buy Opal. Mr Abbott-on indulgence-As the minister originally responsible for the introduction of Opal, I would like to associate myself with the excellent question from the member for O'Connor and with the answer from the minister and to suggest to the Prime Minister that I am very happy to offer bipartisanship in increasing Aboriginal dysfunction",95
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Renewable Energy,95
109,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is it important that Australia not be left behind in the international race to create clean energy? How will the government secure jobs and investment in the future?,95
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know that he wants to see the people of his electorate live in a prosperous country with the jobs of the future. Ultimately, when you strip it all down and look at the debate about carbon pricing in and climate change, where does it lead you? It leads you to whether you believe in facts or whether you believe in scaremongering; to whether you believe in hope or whether you believe in peddling fear. It also comes down to whether or not you are optimistic about the talents and capacities of the Australian people to adapt and to change and to lead that change or whether you are a pessimist, as the Leader of the Opposition is. The Leader of the Opposition believes the Australian people are not up to change. He actually must believe that the Australian people are not up to much. But the history of economic transformation in our country tells us to be optimistic about the Australian people and their talents and capacities. We have innovated before and we will innovate again. I am an optimist about this nation's future. The best days lie in front of us, not behind us. I know that on that side of the parliament they are mired in pessimism. They do not have faith in the Australian people-they do not have faith in their capacity for change. I have seen two things in the last week which have reinforced my hope and optimism in the creativity of the Australian people. I visited the Australian Solar Institute laboratories at the Australian National University. They are there at the cutting edge of research and development into solar technology. It is the kind of place that will lead to new technology, new innovations and great wealth for this country as the world moves to a cleaner energy future. This morning I went to the Capital wind farm at Bungendore, where I saw renewable energy technology operating and providing electricity and energy for our nation. I saw that happening. I met with two young people-two apprentices who are the first to do their apprenticeship at a wind farm. They are at the cutting edge themselves. Their names were Mark and Louie. Mark is from my electorate-he is from Diggers Rest-but he is there in Bungendore learning his trade on the energy of the future. The opposition would have you believe that these innovations do not exist. They would have you believe that our researchers are not up to it. They would have you believe that our young people cannot adapt. These pessimistic beliefs are untrue. I have seen it with my own eyes this week, and we will see it every day in the future. What we will see with pricing carbon is that we will create an incentive for Australian businesses, Australian companies, Australian researchers and Australian designers to be there generating the clean energy of the future. This is a remarkable possibility for a creative, clever country. It is a remarkable possibility for a country with so many sources of clean energy. I am optimistic about that future, and I say to the Australian people: we should all be optimistic about the future and not give way to the denial, the fear and the pessimism about the future that the Leader of the Opposition peddles every day. We can do this. We will price carbon, and we will get those great clean energy opportunities in the days to come. An opposition member-Hallelujah!",95
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whilst there are a couple of helpful dobbers on my right, I am just a little unsure. But I remind members that there are two people here who have been warned. I think I am reminding one in particular that the warning is a first step to naming and with the naming I will test whether I can get the support of the House in the punishment, so he should be very careful. Given that the other is a female we now know who I am talking about, and he should be very careful. Carbon Pricing",96
112,Mr RAMSEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that BlueScope Steel is one of the most environmentally responsible steelmakers in the world and that, if a carbon tax pushes more steel manufacturing overseas to China-where they will emit more carbon dioxide for every tonne of steel-it will mean that total global emissions will increase, not decrease. I ask the Prime Minister: why is the government threatening thousands of manufacturing jobs in Australia with a carbon tax that will have the effect of increasing emissions as industry and jobs migrate overseas?",96
113,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I would want firstly to go specifically to BlueScope and then talk more broadly about protecting Australian jobs. Let me say specifically on BlueScope: inevitably, as we work out way through this carbon pricing debate, we will see claims and counterclaims in the media. I say to the member and to the Australian public generally that when they see those claims it would pay to run the fine-tooth comb over them so people have the accurate facts. I believe in people having the facts. So on BlueScope Steel let's go through those facts for the member. There was a report that BlueScope was planning to abandon building a $1billion cogeneration plant at its Port Kembla steelworks. That was reported in the newspaper. The fact is they cancelled that project prior to the carbon price announcement that was reported on 26 February. It is very important that people get the facts. And then, of course, on BlueScope Steel, because the member specifically asked me about BlueScope Steel, we did at an earlier time during debates about carbon pricing have BlueScope Steel saying that it was shelving a cogeneration plant because at that stage the carbon price had been deferred by a year. So, actually, they wanted the carbon price in order to understand the financial",96
114,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
115,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am putting that from the point of view of investment certainty. They wanted the certainty to feed into their investment decisions. In that regard I refer people to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 May 2009, which says: BLUESCOPE Steel's plan to build a $1 billionplus co-generation plant to lower greenhouse emissions from its blast furnaces at Port has emerged as the first major casualty of the Federal Government's decision to delay the start of the proposed emissions trading scheme by at least a year. So what I would say to the member is that it does pay to run a fine-tooth comb over the series of claims which will inevitably be made publicly during the course of this debate. What I would then say to the member, broadly, on manufacturing jobs of order regarding relevance. The Prime Minister was not asked a question about any claim that BlueScope Steel has made. She was asked a question about migrating jobs overseas and increasing emissions globally because of the introduction of her carbon tax. It would be nice if she could answer the question she would like to have been asked, but she was asked a question and she should answer that one.",97
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will resume his seat. I invite him to read, in the copy of the question that he has, the preamble. The Prime Minister has the call.",97
117,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much. The last few words I said before I was interrupted were on the question of manufacturing jobs, about which the member asked me. Let me address that for the member. I understand and the government understands that we will need to take steps to assist industry to adjust. That is why when we announced the carbon price we said all of the revenue raised by putting a price on the 1,000 biggest polluters will be used to assist householdsthat is the assistance that the member is committed to ripping away-will be used to assist industry to adjust and will be used for programs to tackle climate change. I want to protect Australian jobs. I want us to have the clean energy jobs of the future. In order to gas ensure as we design the scheme that we hear Kembla the voice of business, we are working through a business round-table as well as through direct consultations so that we can get the design right. We want to protect Australian jobs. That is what the industry assistance is about as part of this package to price carbon. If the member seriously wants to contribute to this debate then of course he would have to get his party to abandon climate change denial, price carbon and work with us on the details. Climate Change",97
118,Mr HUSIC,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on the government's action to tackle climate change and how this has been received, including the response of the so called ‘people's revolt' to the government's plan?",98
119,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the member for Chifley for his question. Since the government announced the carbon price framework several weeks ago there has of course been significant debate in relation to it. Today, for example, I was happy to receive a petition from the ACTU and the World Wildlife Fund on the need to take action on climate change. The petition was signed by over 12,000 people and called for the parliament to reduce carbon pollution and move to a clean energy future. Of course, there are those with opposing views, including those who are part of the so-called ‘people's revolt' organised by the Leader of the Opposition. It is perfectly legitimate in a democracy for people to freely express their views and to engage in rallies such as that conducted today. I have been involved in some rallies myself over a period of time. It is appropriate, though, to consider just what organisations are becoming involved in the Leader of the Opposition's campaign against a carbon price and why they might oppose the government's climate change plans. The revolt is in fact led by the Menzies House website, which was founded with the help of Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi, who is notorious for his climate change science denial. But there is also a range of other groups involved that do not like the government's climate change policy. The Consumers and Taxpayers Association, who organised today's rally, AAP noted a few weeks ago is an association with just three members. You have also got climate sceptics groups, the anti-Semitic Australian League of Rights, and One Nation. No surprise that they do like the government's policies.  of order.",98

128,Mr COMBET,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, those opposite raised the participation of the member for Robertson in the rally. I just wish to alert the House that in fact the member for Robertson issued a press release prior to question time commencing today which said, in part, the following: Even though I disagree with today's protest, I wanted Central Coast residents who have taken the trouble to come down and express their views to know that I value their contribution mocracy. In the debate over the implementation of a carbon price, we must not allow ourselves to be swept up in fear and misinformation campaigns. On that point, one of the other organisations involved in protesting the government's policies is the Coalition of Law Abiding Sporting Shooters. What do they want, as well as no carbon tax? They want to repeal former Prime Minister John Howard's gun laws. They were there today. We also had the , a group which, as one commentator pointed out, warned that the Kyoto protocol was part of a new imperial structure that would relocate Australian sovereignty to Germany. Clearly these are not people who would support action on climate change. The decision by the Leader of the Opposition to associate himself with the placards we saw today, the messages that have been provided and the groups that have participated is unbefitting a leader of a major political party in this country-and you should disassociate yourself.

When is he going to answer that question?",100
133,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,The minister will respond to the question.,100
134,Mr BOWEN,PAIRS,"The warnings are the two that I have referred to. Clearly, as I have said continuously, I have recognised for some time, since last September, that we needed to reduce pressure on the detention centre at Christmas Island. One of the reasons we needed to reduce the pressure on the detention centre at Christmas Island was the pressure that that created in relation to the management of the detention centre. I have made that clear. That is why I announced the mainland detention centres to relieve the pressure on Christmas Island. I did that in response to advice from my department that the pressure on Christmas Island should be reduced. I have done that, against the opposition of those members opposite, who said that those detention centres were not necessary. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer to page 551 of the Practice where, under the heading ‘Answers to questions without notice', it says: When a Minister is occasionally unable to provide an immediate substantive answer, he or she may either undertake to supply the Member with the requested information in writing at a later date … As the minister is unable to provide the answer, perhaps he could follow that.",100

136,Mr BOWEN,PAIRS,"As I said, I have responded very clearly to the situation on Christmas Island and have taken steps to reduce the pressure on the Christmas Island detention centre. I have done so in conjunction with the advice from my department that the numbers on Christmas Island would benefit from being reduced in relation to the opening of detention centres on the mainland, which the opposition opposed at every step. I have established an independent, arms-length inquiry, which I invite the honourable member for Cook to make a submission to. Climate Change",101
137,Ms OWENS,PAIRS,"My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister outline the impacts of climate change on Australia's environment? What action is the government taking to reduce this impact and are there any impediments?",101
138,Mr BURKE,PAIRS,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. While a lot of the focus of the debate has gone on preparing Australia's economy for the future through a lower emissions economy, we must not turn a blind eye to the environmental damage that is done through climate change itself. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projections of significant loss of biodiversity through to 2020. The impact of climate change is greatest on the most sensitive parts of our environment. Areas identified include the wet tropics, including the Daintree rainforest, our alpine regions and the Great Barrier Reef, which is our greatest environmental asset; a biodiversity asset which makes an extraordinary economic contribuposition, tion to the tourism industry. One thing that puts us in a different situation to many nations when we talk about the environmental impact of climate change is the extraordinary number of species that are found on our continent and nowhere else on earth. Around 90 per cent of the species found in Australia, whether they be plants, mammals or reptiles, do not exist anywhere else on the planet. The impact environmentally on Australia is quite a different challenge to what we find in many other countries. While many of the mammals, for example, would be able to survive technically with what climate change itself would bring, their habitat would not. When endangered species lose their habitat, in turn we lose these species. The Great Barrier Reef and the extent of its biodiversity can easily be lost upon us, but let us start with just how different it is to other reef systems around the world. So often when people talk about the great reefs of the world they talk about the Caribbean. The Caribbean has 60 species of coral and the Great Barrier Reef has 560 species of coral. We have a very different biodiversity challenge to what is found in many other countries of the world. The climate change challenges faced by the Great Barrier Reef come in a number of ways. We know about the increased occurrence of bleaching events, the increase in major weather events and the impact of the growth in carbonic acid. We often talk about forests as being the only carbon sinks. The ocean itself is an extraordinary carbon sink. In the process of transferring carbon dioxide in the ocean you get a growth of carbonic acid. The growth of carbonic acid has a very precise impact on the rate at which coral grows back. If you put these three events together-the impact of bleaching events, the coral damaged during major weather events that are happening more regularly and coral species, which take 30 to 50 years to regrow, being slower to regrow because of the growth in carbonic acid-we will end up with a situation where the Great Barrier Reef itself exists but its biodiversity, which we are proud of and which we come to expect in the Great Barrier Reef, is under significant pressure. That is one of the reasons why action is so important not only in taking the opportunity now to set up our economy for the future but also in recognising the biodiversity challenge faced by the environmental assets in Australia. It is critically important to our tourism industry and important to the environment of Australia. NA",101

146,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Is the minister aware of recent comments made by officials from BlueScope about the government's plans to tackle climate change? If so, what is the government's response?",102
147,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Of course, the government will welcome contributions by representatives of industry to the carbonpricing debate, including by BlueScope Steel. I am aware of comments made yesterday by the Chairman of BlueScope, Mr Graham Kraehe. In part he expressed dissatisfaction at the level of consultation with his an- company. I take this opportunity to put the record straight. BlueScope was extensively consulted on the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the last term of parliament and in this term of parliament, since I have been the minister, I have met with representatives of the company on five occasions, including twice through the govalso ernment's business round-table, of which the BlueScope CEO, Mr O'Malley, is a member. The evidence of the consultation does not match the assertions that Mr Kraehe has made on this point. Secondly, today the Australian Financial Review reported that BlueScope, as the Prime Minister made some observations about a moment ago, will now abandon plans to build a $1 billion cogeneration plant at Port Kembla steelworks. The implication of the story was that this is somehow related to the proposed carbon price. This is an example of the misinformation that has unfortunately entered this debate, because Illawarra Mercury reported that BlueScope's announcement not to proceed with the cogeneration plant was made on 21 February, three days before the government's carbon price framework was announced. That was not the only time that BlueScope's plans for that plant had been cancelled or deferred. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 May 2009 it was reported that BlueScope would cancel its plans for the cogeneration plant because, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, the argument was, at that time, that the emissions trading scheme planned by the government was not coming in soon enough. So the argument has shifted about a bit. The argument back then was that BlueScope had to defer or cancel the plans because there was no carbon price but now it is apparently, or at least inferred, that the cancellation is related to a carbon price announcement. Finally, Mr Kraehe yesterday made a number of comments about the potential impact of a carbon price on BlueScope Steel's operations. As the detailed features of the carbon price mechanism, including the assistance arrangements for BlueScope's operations, are in fact the subject of the consultation process involving the company and are yet to be settled, Mr Kraehe's observations are, at best, a bit premature.

I have also indicated that I will regard character test very seriously in the granting of visas on this matter. As the Prime Minister has indicated to the House, there is a process to be undertaken in relation to the character test. That test must be applied on a case-bycase basis. As the Prime Minister explained this the other day, the shadow minister for immigration interjected and said, ‘The minister's intervention power is not appellable.' I think he has been getting legal advice from George Brandis again because he is wrong. Ministers' intervention powers are not appellable in some instances. The minister's decision to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds can be appellable. I know he is getting advice from George Brandis. I do not think he is getting it from the member for Menzies because, if he were getting advice from the member for Menzies, the member for Menzies would be saying, ‘Scott, do not forget Haneef because I got it wrong.' I do not think the government wants to get it wrong in this instance because the minister for immigration is following the process, which the former minister, the member for Menzies, did not. Carbon Pricing",104
157,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. How is the government consulting with business and other important sections of the community on the implementation of a price on carbon?,104
158,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fremantle for that question because there is extensive consultation with the business community on this very important economic reform. There are only two certainties here: all nations will have to act and the longer we wait the much tougher the transition will be, which is why the government is determined to act and to work in a consultative way, parthe ticularly with the business community. It is why we have commissioned new, updated analysis from Ross Garnaut, it is why we have commissioned the Productivity Commission and it is why the Treasury is doing new modelling. We have a number of forums where we are consulting with the business community. I want to make this point because I say to all those in the business community, and there is a very broad coalition that is supporting this essential reform: do not be intimidated by some of the irresponsible elements of the community. This is too important a reform for the future of our economy for those that understand the importance of this to our future prosperity, to jobs for our kids and our grandkids. Stay involved with the process and do not be intimidated by some of the shouting and yelling that we are seeing from the Tea Party fringe elements that are out there in this debate. We do need a debate but we need a debate that is based on fact. One of the most important facts was outlined recently by Jac Nasser of BHP Billiton. He said: Economies that defer action are likely to face higher long-term costs, as global investment is redirected to early movers. As one of the most carbon-intense economies, if Australia acts strongly to reduce its carbon footprint, its emissions-intensive sectors are likely to maintain or improve their competitiveness in a low-emissions world. That sums up the economic case for this fundamental reform. It is one that is essential for the future of the nation; it is right for the country, it is right for the economy and we should not be deterred by extreme elements in the Liberal and National parties. Asylum Seekers",104
159,Mr IRONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to evidence provided in Senate estimates last October that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship took no steps to exercise his powers under the Migration Act that do not rely on any criminal proceedings to rescind the permanent protection visas provided to the three SIEV36 passengers who scuttled that boat, killing four people, wounding 40 and endangering the lives of Australian Navy personnel. Why should the Australian people have any confidence that this minister will act to deal with violent rioters on Christmas Island or anywhere else?",105
160,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Swan for his question. It raises a matter that was also raised with me yesterday by the member for Cook. I had intended at the conclusion of question time to table a letter that provided the member for Cook with earlier today. The matter the member for Swan raises relates to SIEV36. I can say to him that I am advised that one of the persons on SIEV36 was charged in November 2010 with two counts of resisting Commonwealth officers and the matter has been committed to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The relevant offences carry a maximum penalty of two years. As you would be aware, it is a matter of public record that has been confirmed previously in the House that this is one of three individuals about whom I believe the member is asking. As I advised the member for Cook in writing, a person's visa may be considered for cancellation if the person fails the character test under section 501 of the Migration Act. As is appropriate, the minister is awaiting the outcome of these criminal proceedings before considering any action in relation to this person. As the matter is still before the court, obviously it is inappropriate for me to comment further. I am advised that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, after consultation with the Northern Territory Director of Public Prosecutions and the Northern Territory Police, has determined that there is insufficient evidence to bring further charges. The letter goes on to clarify what would be well understood and well known, and that is that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions makes those decisions independent of government. That has been the case under governments of all persuasions; and so it should, because of the separation of powers that we have-the DPP acts independently. I would also indicate to the member, in case there is any further concern, that the issues relating to SIEV36 were extensively I canvassed in the parliament last year on 17 March and then more briefly, I think, on the day after. I am advised that around five questions were asked about this matter on 17 March last year. The topic the member raises is not new; I understand that he is concerned about it, and I refer him to the letter that I have provided to the member for Cook. I table that now. Australian Natural Disasters",105
161,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the progress of the government's efforts to fund the reconstruction of regions impacted by recent natural disasters?,105
162,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. Of course she was one of many members in this House who spent the weeks of summer assisting communities that were hit by natural disasters. In her case it was the city of Rockhampton being hit by flooding and being isolated for quite an extended period of time. Members on both sides of the House were called upon to assist their communities in that time of flooding. Members are still, in some parts of the country, being called upon to assist communities that have suffered flooding in recent days. During that period, as we emerged from that summer of natural disasters with the flooding and then the cyclone, I made a pledge on the nation's behalf-and that pledge was that we would not let go. We would assist the communities that had suffered so greatly during this period to rebuild. I said that all Australians would be with them during the rebuilding and recovery effort and that we would get on with it with good judgment and common purpose so that we could assist these communities to rebuild and to get on with their lives. Last night two bills passed the Senate, the 51st and 52nd bills to do so in this parliament. They were the legislation to fund the reconstruction and recovery effort. We know these disasters have come at a terrible human cost and a cost to the economy. Queensland, which suffered so badly, is over one-fifth of our economy, and early Treasury and RBA estimates suggest that GDP growth will be half a per cent lower than would otherwise have been the case. Crop production will be around $1.2 billion less, there will be $300 million less in tourism, and coal production could be 16 million tonnes less in the March quarter. As we go about this recovery and rebuilding we do know that, despite this economic setback from natural disasters, the underlying economy is strong. That is why it is appropriate to pay as we go. As the economy trends back to full capacity we will not take the soft option by deferring hard savings until four years from now. That is why the government took the decision to engage in savings. It was not easy, but it was the right thing to do. And we took the decision to defer infrastructure; once again, it was not easy, but it was the right thing to do. And we also took the decision to ask the Australian people-people of goodwill-to pay a flood levy, which was very fairly constructed so that 60 per cent of taxpayers are paying less than a dollar a week. Of course, we made these tough decisions; we found the tough saves, rather than claiming it was easy. In doing so we did not play the politics of fear. We did not cut programs to earn a cheap headline. We got on with the methodical decision making necessary to rebuild Queensland and to rebuild the nation. As we knowMr Tehan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. I was wondering whether the Prime Minister could outline, now that she has taxed the Victorian people, what the plan is for Victoria for the $500 million.",106
163,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is hard for me to decide whether the member for Wannon should know, on the basis of his predecessor's knowledge of the standing orders, that that was not a standing order. But I would indicate to him that the next time that he interrupts proceedings in that manner he will be dealt with. I think that I have been overly generous to a number of people-whose cries I hear, and one who has interjected since he returned. Being a Tasmanian does not give him any special privileges. I warn the member for Wannon to be careful.",106
164,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, of course, we will rebuild Victoria too. The House would recall that the government's plan was met by the politics of fear. The government's plan was met by a scare campaign led by the Leader of the Opposition. That scare campaign is silent now. What we should learn from that example is that, ultimately, the Leader of the Opposition's carbon pricing scare campaign will fall silent too-indeed, there is some evidence it has already fallen silent todaybecause fear cannot stand up against facts, and we will be there explaining the facts.

172,Mr ABBOTT,WALLACE BROWN AWARD,-on indulgence-I congratulate Sky News journalist Ashleigh Gillon for winning the 2011 Wally Brown Award for young journalists. The citation says: Ashleigh submitted broadcast highlights … The live coverage of the toppling of a Prime Minister. Much of the work was unscripted as she took television viewers into the halls of Parliament House and provided insights into the machinations going on behind the scenes in the Labor Party as caucus decided to replace a firstterm Prime Minister. I congratulate Ashleigh Gillon-and I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not refer to the citation in presenting the award to this fine young journalist. NA Question Time,107
173,Mr CRAIG KELLY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, today over six busloads of citizens from my electorate of Hughes joined with thousands of others in a protest out the front of Parliament House to protest against the Prime Minister's betrayal of her election promise. These constituents of mine wished to obtain tickets to question time; however, they were told that no tickets were available-yet at the start of question time today, more than half the gallery was empty. I would like you to inquire into how tickets could be made available",107
174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Order! This is a perennial problem. I would indicate to the member for Hughes that the member for North Sydney has some expertise in this matter, because he has raised it with me. The ticketed areas of the galleries were booked outabsolutely booked out. What I do not think is realised is that there are still walk-up tickets. He is quite right that there were plenty of spaces at the start of question time. But there are two distinct things in operation. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 33 of 2010-11",107

NA Immigration Detention,108
177,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cook proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The rolling crisis in the Government's gration detention network. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",108
178,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cook) (3.36 pm)Australia's immigration detention network is collapsing under the strain of Labor's failed border protection regime. Under Labor, our immigration detention network is in a rolling crisis. Last Sunday week, after a series of breakouts on Christmas Island, the Prime Minister said to reporters here in Canberra that ‘this is a situation that is well in hand'. Within 24 hours of the Prime Minister claiming that the situation was in hand on Christmas Island, tear gas was being dropped, beanbag rounds were being fired at protesters and Christmas Island had descended into a week of chaos. Yesterday morning the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, boldly assured the nation, with the same assurance that the Prime Minister sought to assure people around the country last Sunday week, that his advice was that all asylum seekers had been accounted for. Yet last night on Lateline he had to admit that there were still at least two missing-there may well have been more; he was not able to be exactly sure-after a face-to-file check failed to accord with a headcount. This is the status of the management of our immigration detention network. What concerns me about this is that the government is pretending that there is nothing here to see. I asked the minister whether he knew, when he went out yesterday morning and sought to assure Australians that everything was under control, that further checks had to be undertaken. I asked him immi- whether he knew that there is not just a headcount but that you have to do a face-tofile check, as he mentioned last night. If he did know that, why was he so quick out of the blocks to try to create the impression that everything was under control, just like the Prime Minister was? As is usual in this portfolio, the government protests as to certain facts but, as the facts become known, it is clear that the minister is in charge of absolute chaos. Yesterday on the ABC the member for Wannon nailed this pretty accurately. He knows, as I doparticularly as I come from New South Wales-that the minister is known in the New South Wales Right as a numbers man. But it is clear that he could not get his numbers right on Christmas Island yesterday. The numbers that he should be concerning himself with are the ones on Christmas Island, rather than the numbers within the New South Wales Right faction here in Canberra-where I understand he has been exceptionally busy of late. Perhaps I could suggest to the minister that to find those asylum seekers an all-points bulletin should be put out to the bowling alleys of the country, where they lost the last people who had broken out of the system. Or perhaps they are down at the Melbourne aquarium, where they found the last one. There is a whole series of places they could be. The minister may be advised that, next time, before he goes out and starts pretending that everything is okay, he might want to check that they have done all the checks, so that he can give proper assurance rather than giving false hope, as he continues to do on a daily basis about the status of our immigration program and about the status of our detention network that is in complete chaos. It is a ing crisis. I remind those in the House that on 21 November 2009 a bloody fight-as it was described-broke out on Christmas Island, involving 150 Afghans and Sri Lankans. They attacked each other with broom handles, pool cues and tree branches. Three detainees were medivac'd to Perth, 10 were admitted to hospital on Christmas Island and 27 others were injured. On 20 to 22 September 2010 there were rolling rooftop protests at Villawood. Literally, beds were burnt",108
179,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting-Beds were burning!,109
180,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Beds were burning at Villawood, as they were on Christmas Island last week. There were beds burnt at Villawood and people stayed on the roofs for a number of days in that fairly appalling scene. On 1 September 2010, 90 detainees broke out of the Northern Immigration Detention Centre in Darwin. That cost taxpayers $430,000 to fix the mess. And not just that, but it cost a further $790,000 to upgrade the centre because of the security problems at that place, because it was not developed to deal with this level of policy failure. Mind you, I note that we learned in estimates that no-one was charged over that incident either. On 15 November 2010, there was a violent brawl at Broadmeadows involving 50 children. One was hospitalised. On 17 November there was another rooftop protest at Villawood. At the Airport Lodge in Darwin there was a protest over several days, from 7 to 10 February, which ended with 11 people hospitalised and a further 11 taken to the watch house. On 27 and 28 February there was a riot at Christmas Island in the family compound, where 13 people were injured, windows were smashed, three asylum seekers were arrested and 15 young males had to be moved off the island. On 16 March 2011 rollthere was a mass breakout at the Asti Motel. They walked down Smith Street in Darwin at will. Hundreds of them walked down Smith Street in Darwin, while-not to be outdone-a rooftop protest was also underway at the Northern Immigration Detention Centre in Darwin. On 17 March there was, for once, a quieter protest, but a protest nonetheless, at Curtin. We should be watching Curtin carefully, because the minister knows that things are boiling up in Curtin as well. On 12 and 13 March there were mass breakouts at Christmas Island, and that was the same weekend the Prime Minister sought to tell everybody that everything was under control. Then, of course, from 14 to 17 March riots broke out on Christmas Island as hundreds engaged in violent protests. Buildings and beds were burned to the ground, staff were holed up and unable to escape, police were assaulted, tear gas was used and beanbag rounds were deployed. Such is the crisis that has occurred under this government and under this minister that Federal Police had to take by force a Commonwealth facility. That is a disgrace. absolutely a loss of control. Not only have they lost control of our borders; now they have lost control of the detention networkand the chaos continues. This is not the first time we have seen ots and other protests in our detention network, as those on this side of the House know. But there is a big difference now as opposed to when the coalition was in government. When this side of the House had to deal with the difficulties of people coming to this country, we acted. We took steps; we took action; we stopped the boats. We did that through a series of measures, not just one measure. The minister tries to make out that there was just one measure here and one measure there. There were a series of measures put in place and, as a result of those measures, the boats stopped. The number of boats reduced to an absolute trickle. I noticed that last night the minister said that his at Christmas Island is to get a detention population to 2,000. That is his goal! I see the Father of the House here today. The Father of the House put in place a series of measures that ensured that when the coalition left office in November 2007 there were not 2,000 people on Christmas Island, there were not 2,000 people in the detention network; there were four people who had arrived illegally by boat who were in our detention network. That is a goal the minister might want to take up. Rather than 2,000, he might want to think about trying to get the number to four. But to get it to four he has do some things which I do not think this minister has the resolve to do. Resolve, as the member for Berowra knows, as the former Prime Minister knows and as those who have served in that capacity know, requires you to take difficult decisions. Resolve requires you to send messages when there is chaos in our detention network and requires that you immediately sanction those who are That is involved in rioting. This is a minister who is happy to have a three-month review and not know who was involved in the riots last week. He is not happy to suspend those people immediately. ri- They are going to wait for about six months, and after that period of time, maybe even in 12 months time, when he does his general character test review case by case, he may well decide to deny them a visa. But you have to go on his form. It was revealed in this House yesterday and today that three people on SIEV36 were part of a plan, as the Northern Territory coroner said, to scuttle that boat. An independent assessment and review by the coroner found that they sank the boat. The minister knows that the general character test does not require a criminal conviction. He knows this absolutely. He knows that at any time, regardless of any other criminal proceedings, he could have goal revoked those visas. He could even change those visas. He could have given them a 449 safe-haven visa. But this is a minister who decided not to act. As long as this minister decides not to act, the boats will keep coming, the detention centre chaos will continue and we will continue to see the harm, the waste and the frustration of the Australian people who are angry about one thing: a government that cannot run an immigration system. They are sick to death of a government that simply refuses to listen to them and understand that what infuriates them is a government that has lost control of our deto tention network, our borders and our immigration system. Their only answer, as the Prime Minister did shamefully in this place a few weeks ago, is to say, ‘The Australian people feel this way because they have been victims of a race baiting campaign by the opposition.' That is a disgrace. Before the last election the Prime Minister said, ‘If are concerned about border protection, you are not a racist.' Commander Bradbury over there I am sure put this in there because he knew",109
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member will refer to the member for Lindsay by his correct title.,111
182,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will refer to the member for Lindsay by his appropriate title rather than what I referred to him as before. It was the member for Lindsay who-before he went on that great expedition to Darwin, the well-known port in Lindsay-went out there and encouraged Australians that he was all keen on border protection and so was the Prime Minister, and the people of Lindsay did not have to worry about the government thinking they were racist because they were concerned about the government's border protection failures. They did not have to worry about that, because that was all behind us. But in this place several weeks ago the Prime Minister restated her assault on the Australian people for having concerns about her border protection failures. They have no policy at all. This is their policy to stop the boats: East Timor. We can have a processing centre in East Timor-as a new millennium project, I suspect. It will not be this millennium; we will have to wait for the next one. It will be the millennium processing centre at East Timor in the next millennium, to go with the Millennium Dome, I suppose, from this millennium. The minister was saying last night: ‘It takes time and we have to wait and wait. We do not have an immediate plan; we have a long-term plan.' I think a millennium is a particularly long period of time. But this is the plan that the government has and it is a plan that is coming to nothing. This is a plan that worked: on 1 September 2001 Prime Minister Howard said, you ‘There will be third-country processing at Nauru'; 19 days later the centre opened. Eight months after the Prime Minister announced her processing centre in East Timor, it is no closer to coming into being. This is a processing centre that is a ‘never-never' solution. The only other proposals they put forward, apart from removing the Howard government's regime, was the asylum freeze. That worked well. It led to a tripling in the amount of time people spent in detention and a doubling in the detention population and it was such a great deterrent that over 50 boats turned up in the meantime and over 2,000 people. Every time this government touches this area, it completely turns to mush. The cost that is paid in humanitarian and financial terms and in the integrity of our immigration program is simply too high. I have a challenge for this minister. This minister has to decide this week whether he is going to be part of the solution or part of the problem. This minister has to decide whether he is going to walk out of this chamber today and walk into the Prime Minister's office and say: ‘We've got it wrong. We shouldn't have changed the policy of the Howard regime. It has absolutely turned to mush. I am sitting in a sea of disaster when it comes to our detention network and you will not let me take the decision.' That is a decision that I am sure the minister knows he has to take-he would know he has to take these decisions-and he can decide to do that today or he can roll over to the Prime Minister and continue to swim in this sea of absolute failure. I do not think the minister will do that. I think this minister is part of the problem not the solution. His only answer to date is to go out there and employ another six media officers to spin the boats away. You cannot spin them away; you have to act and you need to act now.",111
183,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At the outset I think it is appropriate, given that these issues have been raised, that I put on the record my appreciation and the government's appreciation and acknowledgement of the work of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Serco and the Australian Federal Police in managing the very serious incidents-riots and protests-at Christmas Island over the last week. I think it is appropriate that that is put on the record. Sometimes staff of departments are criticised, and there is a place for that, but it is also appropriate that we thank them. And I do thank them at the outset of this debate. There are legitimate issues for discussion in this very complex policy area, and it is right that they be raised. I will not take ture from members opposite on the issue of riots in detention centres. I will not take a lecture from members of the Liberal Party. The member for Cook in a short acknowledgment said, ‘We had issues too.' He quoted issues in detention centres about protests, escapes and fires over the last couple of years. He said in a dismissive note, ‘Of course there have been incidents before.' He did not talk about the riots and protests at Baxter. He did not talk about the riots and protests at Woomera, Curtin, Christmas Island and Nauru. He talked about some people walking down the street; he did not talk about the 480 people who left detention centres in one go under the previous government.",112
184,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We acted.,112
185,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says, ‘We acted,' and those protests, riots and fires started as early as 2000 or 1999. He says, ‘We acted.' I am not going to take a lecture from the member for Cook on those issues. The member of Cook raised a number of issues, and I am happy to deal with them one by one. Let me deal with the last: the matter he referred to as spin doctors. He says the government's answer is to hire more spin doctors, more media advisers, through the newspaper. He says we have just created six new positions.",112
186,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You've advertised them.,112
187,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says, ‘You've advertised them.' It is very important not to mislead the House. Let me explain to the member for Cook how the Public Service works. When somebody leaves a position, they tend to be replaced. When they are replaced, there tend to be advertisements, so not every advertisement in the newspaper is a new position. In fact, of the six positions advertised this week, four are existing positions. The member for Cook could have given me a a leccall. He could have put in an FOI. He could have asked. The member for Cook says there are six new positions, and it is wrong. I feel obliged to share with the House the budget of the national communications branch of my department: $2.98 million in the year 2010-11. Mr Christensen-That's all right.",112
188,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Dawson says, ‘That's all right.' It is a lot of money and it is exactly half the amount we inherited from the previous government-not exactly half but around half: in 2007-08 it was $4.23 million and in 2006-07 it was $3.8 million; more than the current budget of the national communications branch. If the honourable member for Cook wants to start this debate, I do not think this is essential to the debate. I do not think this is a key point, but if the honourable member for Cook wants to raise matters, he needs to be sure of his facts. He needs to make sure when he says things to the House that he is correct. The member for Cook also raises the matter of character and, again, he has been unsure of his facts. He has been wrong. The member for Cook said in the House the other day, as I mentioned during question time, that the minister's power to deal with character issues is not appellable; it cannot be appealed to the courts. All he had to do was lean across to the man sitting next to him, the former minister for immigration, who had his decisions on character matters appealed to the courts and had a particularly disastrous result because proper and due process is very important in these instances. I am very clear. I have said previously that I will take character into account in these processes. I am more than happy for the member for Cook when that has happened to then question me about how that occurred. I am more than happy for the member for Cook, if he is still in his current portfolio, to ask me how they were dealt with and what the result was. He can try and pre-empt the decisions all he likes. He makes the point that character issues should be taken into account, and I agree with him. He might ask the member for Berowra, the member for Menzies or Senator Vanstone how they took character into account when considering matters at Baxter, Woomera and previous riots, protests and fires, and the millions of dollars worth of damage caused in those incidents. He could ask them how they took character into account, but I would say each case is taken on a case-by-case basis, as is appropriate. The member for Cook raises the matter of the counts at Christmas Island and the faceto-file checks. As I made clear last night, the initial check indicated that everybody had been returned and the numbers were appropriate. Then there were some anomalies identified through the face-to-file check. They have been further checked, and I can advise the member for Cook and the House that I have been advised by the department of immigration, the Australian Federal Police and Serco that those matters have been resolved and everybody is in the detention centreMr Morrison interjecting",112
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Cook has had his opportunity.,113
190,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"who should be in the detention centre now those final checks have been done. I am more than happy to advise the House of that. The member for Cook, quite rightly and appropriately, raises the issue of the opposition's alternative approach. I think the member for Cook and I would agree on some things in this House. I think we would agree that the appropriate way of dealing with pressures on detention is to break the business model of the people smugglers. I think we would agree on that. I think the member for Cook would say, ‘Yes, that's right.' He has different terms for it, as he is entitled to. He says, ‘There's sugar on the table. You've got to remove the sugar.' That is a different way of saying the same thing. The member for Cook likes to say that. Let us go through the member for Cook's policy prescriptions. He raised it. Mr Morrison interjecting",113
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I remind the honourable member for Cook that he is still under warning.,113
192,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He said, ‘We have a suite of measures.' He is right about that: there are a number of measures on the table from the opposition. I have never said, as he alleged I had, that there is only one measure. Whenever you ask the member for Cook about the solution to any problem in the world, he says, ‘Nauru.' You could ask him the solution to global warming and he would probably say, ‘Nauru.' You could ask him the solution to famine in the world and he would probably say, ‘Nauru.' Nevertheless, I recognise that he has a number of measures on the table. Firstly, he has the detention centre, the offshore processing centre, at Nauru. He says that that would somehow reduce the incentive to come to Australia. He says that a detention centre at Nauru would create uncertainty as to the result of your claim for asylum in Australia. I thought: Okay, let's have a look How would that work when you take into account that, of those who were settled out of Nauru, 96 per cent were settled in Australia or New Zealand? The member for Cook says, ‘This would create uncertainty. This would stop people coming.' It was so uncertain that 47 got settled in other countries-that is true. Out of the thousands of people, 47 people were settled in other countries; 96 per cent were settled in Australia or New Zealand. A detention facility at Nauru, with all due respect, would be another Christmas Island-an offshore excised place, a different country, but with the same result of people being processed and settled in Australia. He says, ‘Take the sugar off the table. You'll have to spend some time in Nauru, maybe 12 months, and then you end up in Australia.' What is the difference between being processed in Nauru, Christmas Island or Curtin? I am not sure, but the honourable member for Cook seems to think it would make a difference. The member for Cook needs to answer some questions. Who would run the Nauru processing centre? Would it be the International Organisation for Migration? Has he been to Geneva and met with them and asked them if they would run it? Has he met with the UNHCR and asked them to run it? Or would it be run by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship? If, for example, the member for Cook tried to get an international organisation to run it and those international organisations said, ‘You've got to be kidding! We tried that last time. It was a disaster. We're not going to associate our name with that sort of project,' he would have to run it himself through the department of immigration, and we all know the legal implications of that, following the recent High Court case. With respect, the member for Cook then this. talked about temporary protection visas in point 2 of his suite of measures, as he likes to call them, and he is right. He says: ‘We would introduce temporary protection visas.' What is the impact of uncertainty there? How does that take the sugar off the table? Consider this: of the 9,043 people granted temporary protection visas, 8,600 were then granted permanent residency-95.1 per cent. So you have 96 per cent of the people at Nauru making it to Australia and 95 per cent of the people who got temporary protection visas were given permanent residency. Mr Morrison interjecting",113
193,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You are saying it is not true. You do not think that 95 per cent of the people who got temporary protection visas ended up with permanent residency in Australia? That is a very interesting approach. Mr Morrison interjecting,114
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Cook has had a fairly good go. He will now remain silent.,114
195,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am more than happy. He is making some fine interjections which I would like on the record, but I do respect your ruling and the office that you hold, Mr Deputy Speaker. What would be the impact of the temporary protection visas? We should check the history and see the impact. The member for Cook very proudly says, ‘Temporary protection visas, after they were introduced, reduced the number of boats arriving in Australia.' He says the number of boats fell. Mr Keenan-That is exactly what happened.",114
196,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly what happened. My old friend, the member for Stirling, comes in and says the number of boats fell. Well done. The number of asylum seekers went up. After the introduction of temporary protection visas, 8,000 people came over the next two years, but it is okay because they came on bigger boats! The number of boats went down, but the number of people went upMr Keenan interjecting",115
197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Stirling will also remain silent.,115
198,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and the proportion of women and children taking that dangerous journey on boats went up. Before the introduction of temporary protection visas, 13 per cent of people who arrived in Australia by boat were women and children. After their introduction, it was 48 per cent. So, if we concerned about women and children on boats, I am not sure temporary protection visas are the answer. So here we have a suite of measures. Measure No. 3: turn the boats back. That was a triumph in the election campaign. The ‘boat phone'-remember that?-Admiral Abbott, at Kirribilli House, on the phone saying, ‘Turn that one back'; ‘Don't turn that one back.' That is what we had. The member for Cook has to explain this: if his policy is to turn the boats back-he said it would be in limited circumstances, where it did not cause danger; I respect that-perhaps he could share with the House what those limited circumstances would be. What would be the circumstances when the lives of our naval personnel and the lives of the asylum seekers would not be put at risk? The other thing the member for Cook might like to explain is this: he says he is going to turn them back, but to where? The member for Cook might say, ‘Indonesia'-the logical place to turn them back to. The Indonesian government has said, ‘Not on your nelly. You're not turning them back to us.' When the member for Cook made his announcement and the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, made his announcement during the election campaign that we would turn the boats back to Indonesia, the Indonesian foreign ministry said, ‘We think not. Not to us.' Minister Natalegawa, the Indonesian foreign minister said: … simply pushing back boats to where they have come from would be a backward step. So I am not sure where he would return them. Then we have point 4 of the honourable member for Cook's suite of measures. I have to say, this one is probably my favourite. This is about the number of visas that would be made available to offshore entry and onshore entry. He says, ‘We would limit the are number of visas available to people who arrive in Australia by boat'-to, I think, 3,750. What would this create when you think about it? You would think, ‘Okay. Let's have a look at this idea. Maybe this has got some merit. We'll consider it.' The member for Cook would say, ‘If you are one of the first 3,750 people to arrive in Australia by boat, you get a visa. If you are the 3,751st, sorry, you stay in detention'-unless he would abolish mandatory detention. I am not sure that is his policy. That is a rolling detention crisis if I have ever heard one. The first 3,750 get a visa and the rest have to wait. Don't you think that would create quite an incentive to be one of the first 3,750? Don't you think we would have quite a rush to be part of that process? Don't you think we would have people saying, ‘Let's get on a boat and make sure it is in the first few months of the year to make sure we're one of the 3,750'? That is the suite of measures that the honourable member for Cook refers to. I refer to it as a suite of fraudulent policies which would have no impact and may have a negative impact.",115
199,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You've got 30 seconds to give us your policy.,116
200,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Cook remains under warning.,116
201,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Cook needs to be held to account and he needs to explain how these so-called policies would work, because we says, ‘We have the policies that work.' They do not work, because they do not match the people smugglers' business model. They do not remove the incentive for onward movement, or secondary movement, which the honourable member for Cook correctly refers to as the movement through the Asia-Pacific region. I will tell you the way to stop onward movement; I will tell you the way to reduce the people smugglers business model and eliminate it: you enter into a regional solution for a regional problem.",116
202,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We agree.,116
203,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Cook says, ‘We agree.' He thinks the region is Iran and that we should have a transfer agreement with Iran. We do not have that approach. We have the approach that we live in the Asia Pacific region and we will enter into an Asia Pacific regional partnership, because an international problem needs a regional solution and an international solution, not harsher punitive measures in the hope that they work and in the hope that they will make a difference, which they will not. (Time expired)",116
204,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must start with a confession, and that is that have a soft spot for the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Sometimes I feel that we need to save him from himself. To do that, I think we need to at least give him some facts in this debate. If that is the case, maybe he will stop coming in here verballing, misleading and telling the Australian people more untruths. I would like to do that for a few minutes today. Firstly, I want to rebut some of the things that he said about our policy regarding third-country processing on Nauru. Nauru, as we know, was used in the past in a suite of policies that did something that this minister could never claim to have done: they stopped the boats. It was not the only policy; it was part of a suite of policies to which the opposition would return to achieve the same result when the government changes. The minister, for some unknown reason, keeps referring to the fact that 95 per cent of the people who are on Nauru came to Australia with permanent visas. I want to give him some facts issued by none other than his predecessor as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans. On Friday 8 February 2008, in a press release from the government, Senator Evans stated: A total of 1637 people were detained in the Nauru and Manus facilities, of whom 1153 (or 70 per cent) were ultimately resettled fromthose facilitiesto Australia or other countries. Of those who were resettled, around 61 per cent (705 people) were resettled in Australia. The minister continually and wilfully misleads by saying that that figure is 95 per cent. If he had any integrity he would come back in here and correct the record, because that is a press release, which I am happy to table, from his predecessor as minister for immigration. The other thing the minister does, and I I think this is most unfortunate, is to continue to claim the fiction that when we introduced our suite of policies, including temporary protection visas, it somehow resulted in more people arriving in Australia illegally. That completely and utterly untrue, and I just want to go back and remind the minister of the statistics. From 2002 onwards, for five years prior to the government changing when the Labor Party won the election, we had on average three boat arrivals per year. That is the equivalent of one arrival every four months. Three boat arrivals a year is a weekend's work for this government. The statistics are completely and utterly irrefutable. The policies that we introduced, which were incredibly controversial at the time and cised up hill and down dale by the Labor Party as being inhumane and not what they would do, worked to drive the people smugglers from their evil trade and stopped the boats from coming down to Australia. I also want to address the issue, which the government raises, of the so-called ‘boat phone'. It worries me a lot, seeing that this minister clearly has no idea what is going on in his own portfolio, that they talk about the fact that, if a boat were to undertake an action on the high seas, a naval crew would not refer back to political authorities for permisminister sion to do anything. Anyone who has any understanding of how Customs and Border Protection works knows full well that a naval commander, before he took any such action, would of course go up the chain of command and that there would ultimately be a political decision about the sort of action to be taken. So this idea that somehow it is unusual for political authorities to control what their military forces do is ludicrous, and it does make me worry about what this minister actually understands about what is happening within his own portfolio. Yesterday we saw a classic example. The minister fronted up at a press conference and said, rather unfortunately, that all the people who had escaped from Christmas Island had been accounted for. Later on he was contradicted in that, first of all by his own officials is and then by officers of the Australian Federal Police. A great many events have occurred over the last week. We have seen extraordinary scenes within all our detention centres and particularly, of course, on the Christmas Island detention centre. As the shadow minister for immigration has said, we have seen the extraordinary and unprecedented sight of the Australian Federal Police being called upon to retake a Commonwealth facility by force because the Commonwealth had lost control of that facility. We saw detainees use critiviolence against other detainees. We saw detainees use violence against Commonwealth officers. We saw widespread breakouts and riots. We saw buildings being set on fire and weapons being used. How did we get to this situation? How is it that, when the government came into power in 2007, there were four people in our detention network who had arrived here in an unauthorised way by boat, yet now we have over 6½ thousand people in our detention network who have arrived in the same way? You have to laugh about the fact that the cannot manage to conduct a headcount within his own facilities. I wonder how hard it would be to conduct a headcount when you only needed to count four people. I suggest that it was a lot easier under the policies of the previous government, because the policies of the previous government had stopped the boats from coming in the first place. Ultimately, that has to be the goal of government policy, yet-sadly-this Labor Party just refuses to listen. As I said, I do have a soft spot for the minister for immigration, so it was impossible for me not to squirm when watching him on Lateline last night. It was impossible not to feel his embarrassment as he was peppered with questions by the presenter and was unable to answer even basic questions on the facts of what is going on in his own portfolio. You have to wonder why you would even bother being a minister in this Labor government. You have consecutive prime ministers, Rudd and Gillard, treating the cabinet with contempt and making policy on the run. Then you have the spectacle of ministers who do not seem to be in charge of what is happening in their departments. The minister last night could not answer any of the questions in a categorical way. Everything had to have a caveat of ‘I am advised' or ‘I have been told'. He does not give the impression of a minister who is in charge of events within his own portfolio. Correct me if I am wrong, but I always understood that the idea is that ministers to be in charge of and shape events within their portfolio. They should not just be hapless victims at the mercy of events. They should not just be talking heads for the department that go out and do press conferences and shrug their shoulders while explaining to the people the circumstances of the latest disaster that has happened within their portfolio as though everything is beyond their control because ultimately they are only the minister. If you were squirming when the presenter asked the minister to explain some basic facts about what had been going on within his own portfolio, then you really had to feel sorry for the minister when the presenter finished off the interview by asking him about the ‘never-never' solution in East Timor. That has become an international embarrassment. Australian diplomats are forced to run around the region pushing an idea that everybody in the room knows is never going to happen. I was lucky enough to visit East Timor in January, when I also visited Indonesia, and the East Timorese were quite forthright-as they have been whenever this issue has been raised-that they have absolutely no intention of hosting an international facility at Australia's behest. Quite frankly, it was very hard for them to hide their disgust at the way the Australian government had treated them. I also had the opportunity during that visit to visit Indonesia. I talked to some of the members of the committee that are looking into outlawing people-smuggling within Indonesia, something that is very important. They were very polite. They came and met me, and we had a very polite meeting. At the end of it they finally said to me: ‘You know, we are a little bit bemused about why we are always talking to Australians about peoplesmuggling. They come up here and ask us to do more when the Australian government is try pursuing a policy that encourages the people smugglers to continue to bring people to Australia in an unauthorised way.' That is a fair point. That is why Indonesian officials have said publicly that they would like Australia to take the sugar from the table. They would like Australia to clean up its own house and to stop encouraging people to come here in an unauthorised way and apparently doing everything we can to encourage people smugglers to be in charge of Australia's immigration system. The East Timor never-never solution is the ultimate embarrassment, and I urge the government to stop pretending that this is ever going to happen, stop damaging our relationships with our regional neighbours and admit that this is not going to happen. If they were serious about third-country processing they would pick up the phone, talk to the President or Prime Minister of Nauru and ask to reopen the facilities that the Australian taxpayer has already funded on that island. Words will not solve this problem. The people smugglers need to know that this government has some resolve to stop them from bringing people down here in an unauthorised way. Unless the government shows that resolve, more people will come and we will continue to have this rolling crisis within our detention network. (Time expired)",116
205,Ms SAFFIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In politics people often say that if you say something often enough, long enough and hard enough-if you repeat it over and overpeople will get to believing it. That is what I have heard from the coalition over the years. They keep saying: ‘Under the Howard government we had the solution and we stopped the boats. We stopped the people coming.' It is simply not true, and the evidence does not support it. I will turn to that later on in my contribution, but I wanted to state that at the outset. I am sure some of the honourable members opposite now believe it, because they have said it long enough that they have deluded themselves. It is a fact that it just not work. With this debate what causes me concern is to have to be debating such a critical humanitarian issue in an atmosphere of attack and demonisation. Both planks-attack and demonisation-are there for one reason only. The honourable member for Cook raises this MPI today, but he and his coalition colleagues are doing it simply to try to gain political support by pretending to have solutions and demonising the others. It is always easy to demonise people we consider to be the others-people who are different from us, who are boat people, who come here differently. Gone are the days when there was bipartisan support on this issue. I hope that one day we can return to that, because the people around the world who are refugees and who are seeking asylum in countries around the world, particularly the wealthy developed countries, deserve better. The honourable member for Cook talks about a crisis. There is a crisis, and it is an international crisis. It is a crisis for the of millions of refugees worldwide. A large percentage of those are women and children, so there is clearly a crisis, but it is in the international area. In talking about this issue there sometimes is also the charge that if you express some support for common decency you are a bleeding heart. I am happy to be accused and wear that badge. If talking about and acting on common decency means I am a bleeding heart, so be it. I want to turn to the issue of the honourable member for Cook and others saying that under the Howard government they stopped the boats and they have the solutions or the suite of measures that the honourable member for Cook refers to. There were 240 boats that arrived under the Howard government. They carried over 13,600 asylum seekers. It is all within the timing. We have to look at did the timing and at what is happening internationally and in our region. The boats stopped coming because global circumstances changed, and that is a fact. That happens because of what is happening in the international community with the conflicts in our region and the conflicts around the globe. The Taliban regime fell at the end of 2001, and millions of Afghans were able to return home. That is a fact. In 2003Mr Christensen interjecting Mr MCCormack interjecting",119
206,Ms SAFFIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot hear. The honourable members opposite are disturbing me.",119
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think the honourable member has raised a valid issue with me, and I would ask the honourable members for Dawson and Riverina to observe the standing orders.",119
208,Ms SAFFIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you. In 2003, the Howard government started to build a detention centre on Christmas Island that cost tens $400 million. They were planning for more boat arrivals; otherwise, why would you build a detention centre? They were anticipating that the people would come. The opposition, through the honourable member for Cook, say that their suite of measures will fix the problem of turning back boats ‘where circumstances permit'. That is a hollow promise too. Of the 240 boats that arrived under the Howard government, only seven were turned back. And that was given up, too, because they realised under the Howard government that that did not work. No boats were turned back after 2003. The practical reality is that there is nowhere to turn the boats back to. Who are you going to turn them back to? Send them back to where? To avoid being turned back, boats are sabotaged, putting Australian Customs and Border Protection and Defence personnel at risk. We have seen it and do not want to do that. Then temporary protection visas were introduced. We have heard that the temporary protection visas worked, that they stopped the people coming by boat. They were introduced, to the best of my memory, in 1999 and, after that, still about another 8½ thousand people came on boats, so I have not seen the evidence that temporary protection visas worked. Yet here we are being told that if we reintroduce them that will fix it again. The reality is there is no easy fix for this sue. Whether you are in government or in opposition, the position has to be that it is a work in progress, that we have to work through it and come to reasonable solutions to shared problems, because the issue of refugees is a shared problem. Of the people who did come here and were granted temporary protection visasabout 11,000 people-only three per cent ever left Australia. We said to about 11,000 people, ‘You'll have a temporary protection visa and, even though you've fled a country with conflict and you fear persecution, you can live here with this uncertainty under a temporary protection visa.' Yet only three per cent of them ever went back. It is cruel, apart from being a failed solution to that problem. The opposition also talk about going it alone on offshore processing. Mr Abbott has agreed with the government on the need for a regional processing centre-I have heard him say it. But the federal Labor government is committed to getting it right. What we are talking about is establishing a regional centre with the cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a country which is a signatory to the international Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. That is critical because if we are going to have a shared solution to a shared problem, to have it in the region with the cooperation of the appropriate body, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and, I would imagine, working with the International Organisation for Migration, then it has to be done within that framework. That is where the conversation is taking place at the moment. I have a couple of points about East Timor. The President of East Timor, His Excellency Jose Ramos-Horta, has been given carriage of this matter for Timor-Leste. He said that Timor-Leste accepts in principle to accommodate a regional assessment centre, isbut the opinions of all East Timorese sensibilities will be listened to before a final response is given on the Australian proposal. They are involved in those conversations about that issue. A meeting is coming up soon in Bali where I am sure that issue will be on the table. There is one person I think of who sets quite a moral barometer for this issue, the late Peter Andren. I remember that he was a very popular member in his own area. He spoke on this always from the point of a moral position. Yes, when you are in government you have to have practical solutions, sensible solutions, but we are looking at people-(Time expired)",119
209,Mrs GRIGGS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Solomon) (4.26 pm)The government's immigration network is indeed in crisis. The system is out of control. As a consequence of Labor's failure, our detention network is stretched beyond its capacity. When the coalition left government only four people who had arrived illegally by boat where in detention. Today that figure is more than 6,300, including more than 1,000 children. I call on the Gillard Labor government to assure Darwin residents and Northern Territorians that they will be safe, given recent events that have occurred on Christmas Island. If you want a more visible example of the depths of the crisis Labor have created with their failed border protection policies you need look no further than the Asti Motel in suburban Darwin. On 16 March this year, 100 detainees walked out of the hotel heading downtown to Darwin. This was not people rioting and escaping from a remote or secure facility. We have experienced riots and protests and breakouts from the Berrimah secure facility as recently as last week. Territorians are enduring riots beside residential houses. The Asti Motel is surrounded by houses and units right in the suburbs of Darwin. My office is inundated with calls from residents who no longer feel safe and secure in their own homes. This is outrageous. I cannot understand why my constituents should have to feel frightened and insecure in their own homes, experiencing riots on their front lawns as a direct result of the Gillard Labor government's failed border protection policy. Territorians are not watching riots on TV, they are watching riots outside their bedroom windows. The Northern Territory Police and the Royal Darwin Hospital, like many of the other services that are provided in the Northern Territory, are already stretched to capacity. How can this Labor government say that there is going to be no pressure on Territory services as a result of their failed border protection policy? In September 2010, when 90 detainees escaped from the Berrimah detention facility and staged an all-day protest on the road, there had to be a significant impact on NT Police resources. This is just one example. There have been a number of breakouts. As I said, there were people walking down the mall. It is just disgusting. There were also riots which resulted in hospitalisations at Royal Darwin Hospital. Territorians all know that Royal Darwin Hospital is stretched to capacity-but we are told this failed border protection policy will not impact on Northern Territory services at all. It gets worse. Asylum seekers are being housed in residential apartments in the suburbs. How can this be, when Darwin is experiencing its worse housing crisis? The government are trying to hide these people by renting the apartments under a veil of secrecy. This is typical of this governmentthey hide the facts from Australians. They have form. When the plans for another onshore detention facility were announced recently in Darwin, they said it would cost $9.2 million. But, as we know, it will cost $83 million, and that is just for starters. I am holding up the front page of the Northern Territory News, which outlines it all. The Labor government's failed border protection policies are costing Australians hundreds of millions of dollars each year-money that could be spent on vital services and infrastructure. The $83 million that has been identified as the cost to build the new detention facility in Darwin could be spent on building other things, such as three new schools or four new cancer centres, or for nearly a thousand nurses in our hospitals. What about 900 police officers on our streets? Maybe it could build five new suburbs. This money could even establish the eight new GP superclinics that the government have failed to deliver.",121
210,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That's a lot of money.,122
211,Mrs GRIGGS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a lot of money. It goes without saying that this $83 million could even have gone a long way towards replacing infrastructure damaged in the floods and the cyclones of the past summer. Further, I have received an email which is typical of concerns that I am hearing from constituents in my electorate, and I would like to share it: Dear Mrs Griggs, I just want to express my disgust about the government building yet another detention centre, especially in Darwin. I am so annoyed that we can find the money to support overseas illegal immigrants yet we cannot find the money to build a second hospital for Darwin. These people are costing the country a hell of a lot of money gets up my nose. Building this facility in Darwin will put a drain on our resources. Yes, it may create some jobs. However, try and organise a plumber or an electrician in Darwin. Some of these guys won't even go near normal households because they're too busy working on large-scale government projects. Every time an illegal immigrant gets sick they will be putting a drain on our health system. We as Territorians wait a long time at A&E. Now we'll be pushed even further down the queue because of these people. My daughter attends Durack School, and she quite often comes home with raffle tickets so that the school can fundraise to purchase the most basic of items for the school. Government schools should get this funding automatically. If we can afford to spend the money on decent accommodation for the illegal immigrants, along with all other privileges that they receive, why can't we afford to look after our schools? Natasha, please turn back the boats. Spend the money on Australians. There are a lot of them out there that need our money. Please have a look at this article I watched on A Current Affair, ‘Saving Vicky'. This lady needs our money and, as a taxpayer, I am more than happy to support this lady. I am not happy paying for illegal immigrants. There are also a number of reader messages from the Northern Territory News that I would like share. The first says: Why riot + protest? If they aren't happy, i would happily pay a one-off tax to send them home. Another one says: So … More beds for detainees & prisoners?? Why not more beds at the hospital? Yet another says: Tell these rioting asylum seekers they just failed the test and deport them. In Aust, non compliance has consequences. Territorians are not racist. We just want border protection policies that work. The Territory does not want to be the Commonwealth's social experiment, and we do not want our constitutional weakness used so and it that Labor can dump their problems and the outcomes of their bad policies on us. We want genuine economic opportunities, not those that come from bad Labor policy. The Territory has a strong multicultural background, and Territorians welcome people from all cultural backgrounds-but Labor are taking advantage of Territorians' goodwill. Accepting refugees does not mean we accept Labor policy. We have a housing crisis and, increasingly, our own economic refugees because of the cost of living rises under this terrible, terrible Labor government. We know that, if there is a carbon tax introduced, Territorians will pay more because the carbon tax is going to be a tax on remote and rural Australia, and it is going to the impact on the cost of living in the Territory when we are already experiencing very high pressures. Territorians want a guarantee from this secretive and deceptive government that Labor's failed border protection policies will not impact on the safety, the security and the economic welfare of Territorians. It is an interesting fact that this Labor government have built more detention beds in the Northern Territory than they have hospital beds. Palmerston people are waiting for a new hospital. What will they get? A new detention centre. Maybe the minister will turn the detention centre into a hospital when he fixes his border protection policy. My beef is not with the businessmen who are building the detention centre at Wickham Point. My beef is with this deceitful Labor government whose failed border protection policies have made it necessary and who clearly cannot be trusted.",122
212,Mr ZAPPIA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I suggest that the real rolling crisis is with respect to the position of the Leader of the Opposition and how much longer he will be in that position. This matter of public importance before the House today is all about diverting attention from the divisions within the coalition and onto other matters. When it comes to the opposition we can be certain that they will never allow the facts to get in the way of political opportunism and that they will distort the facts in order to create concern and fear and raise emotions amongst people. We just heard that in the contribution by the member for Solomon. Quite frankly, her contribution is not worth responding to, but I will respond to one critical factual matter. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration I visited Darwin and visited the detention facilities there. The practice of using a motel in Darwin to house refugees and asylum seekers was a practice that was begun by the Howard government. To suggest this practice was started by this government is quite clearly distorting the facts. As I said, the coalition never let the facts stand in the way of their political strategy. This matter of public importance debate today is just like the issue of climate change because time and time again we are seeing the coalition distort the facts. In fact, they doing it quite deliberately to create fear and concern amongst members of the broader Australian community. I wonder what the member for Pearce, the member for MCMillan and other coalition members in this place whom I know do not share the kinds of emotions and concerns that I have heard from other members of the coalition today feel when their colleagues bring into this place this kind of debate and use the kind of language that has been used as part of this debate. It is clear to me that when it comes to immigration, refugee policy and climate change the coalition is very clearly divided. To some extent it gives me some comfort to know that, even amongst their ranks, there are people who are level-headed and consider this matter in a measured way. We are dealing here with the lives of real people, people who in most cases have undergone trauma, persecution, danger, loss and serious suffering. This is a critical international humanitarian issue and we should not play politics with it. As a country that prides itself on freedom, equality, democracy and civil rights, this whole issue with all the complexities associated with it must, for the sake of the people we are dealing with, be handled in a considered and rational policy setting-not with the simplistic, distorted rhetoric that the opposition come into the House with. The opposition come into this House and criticise the government. I believe the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship quite adequately addressed this point, but I want to reiterate some home truths here. They come into the House and are very critical of the government but they do so without putting forward any rational, credible policy alternatives. You would think that, as the alternative government, they would at least do that. They have no position for which there is any credible level of support by any of the mainare stream agencies, government departments or overseas governments with which we have to work in managing this issue. If they are going to come into the House and criticise the government, they should at least offer a better proposal that has been endorsed by the very agencies, governments and countries we have to work with. Do not come in here and simply criticise. Let me go to some of the facts relating to asylum seekers. I heard members opposite being critical of the government. They claimed the government facts were incorrect. I will get back to some of those claims if time permits. I will go to the facts that were prepared by the Parliamentary Library-not by the Labor Party or by the minister, but by the Parliamentary Library. These are the facts. Fact 1: Australia has had a long history of accepting refugees for resettlement. Since 1945 some 700,000 refugees and displaced persons have found their new home in Australia. Fact 2: when the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established in 1951, there were approximately 1.5 million refugees internationally. So not long after World War II there were 1.5 million refugees internationally. As at the end of 2009 there were an estimated 43 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including 15.2 million refugees, 983,000 asylum seekers and 27 million internally displaced persons. So we went from 1.5 million not long after World War II to 43 million and that does not include the additional 25 million people who have been displaced due to natural disasters of the types we have seen in recent times. Fact 3: the majority of asylum seekers still arrive in Australia by air. Even with the recent surge, boat arrivals are still less than half of Australia's onshore asylum seekers. Fact 4: Australia is not being swamped by refugees. That is what the opposition would have people believe. They are doing their best to portray that myth. For over 10 years, and even during the time of the Howard government, about 13,000 refugees per annum resettled in this country and that includes all the boat arrivals. So the number of people who have resettled in this country in the last decade or so has been around 13,000 per annum in total. That has not changed and is not about to change. Around the globe right now there are 377,000 people seeking refuge in other countries a year. That is the number of applications that are processed to the knowledge of the UNHCR. In fact, Europe gets over a quarter of a million claims every year and has done so for the last three years, the USA gets about 50,000 claims a year and Canada gets about 33,000 claims. So that puts Australia's 6,500 claims into context. I want to make two quick points. One is to rebut what the member for Stirling said when he was critical of the minister's use of facts. He was referring to the rates of Manus Island and Nauru asylum seekers who were ultimately given asylum. He said the figure was about 70 per cent. My hearing of the minister's comment was that it was Australia and New Zealand he was referring to when he was referring to the 90 per cent plus. I want to make that point absolutely clear. I think most members of this House would agree that there is little difference between Australia and New Zealand. The second point I want to make is this: the same kind of fear campaign that I am hearing here today was run before Christmas in respect of the Inverbrackie detention centre that has been set up near Adelaide. Inverbrackie has been established and, contrary to all the fear that was being promoted by members of this House, people have settled into that community and settled in very well. I will quote from the Southern Cross, the online Catholic paper issued only recently. It said: … Mount Barker and Adelaide Hills parishes say they have been inundated with the generosity of parishioners and locals wanting to donate goods to Inverbrackie residents. The article goes on to say: Pam Ronan said that the Catholic R-12 College in Mount Barker was keen to welcome the refugee children into the school community. Patricia Brady said: People have responded so generously and it just from the Catholic community but from all of the community. That is the kind of reaction that people are getting in the Mount Barker area to the people coming into Inverbrackie, not the fear and concern that was being suggested before Christmas by people in this very House. The Sunday Mail report just before Christmas in Adelaide confirmed again the same kinds of feelings. This motion is all about diverting attention from the Leader of the Opposition.

213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion has now concluded. NA Recent Natural Disasters: Economic,125
214,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Over the past few months we have witnessed a series of truly tragic natural disasters-both here and abroad. At home, our country has been ravaged by floods, with Cyclone Yasi in the north and bushfires in the west. Overseas, we have seen earthquakes hit Christchurch and in the past 12 days we have watched the horrific images as one of the largest earthquakes on record hit Japan, followed by the devastating impact of the subsequent tsunami. These events have tested us, and they have tested our friends. It has been inspiring to see the way in which communities have come together-here at home and globally-to help those in need. Our focus has of course been on providing immediate relief and assistance and getting on with the difficult task of rebuilding our affected communities. But it is appropriate that just before parliament breaks prior to the budget that I update members on the likely impacts of these is not events on our economy and on our budget preparations. Japan Our thoughts in the past few weeks have rightly been with the Japanese people and we have been focused on providing assistance, particularly to those Australians in Japan. These events will leave behind a tragic loss of human life and a damage bill running into many billions of dollars. The economic consequences of these events will become clearer in the coming weeks and months. But we know that as the third largest global economy, this disaster will inevitably impact on the global economy and on our own. Japan accounts for around six per cent of global GDP and is also an important economy for Australia. Japan is our second biggest trading partner and our third largest source of foreign investment. Around oneImpact sixth of all our exports are to Japan-almost $40 billion. We are Japan's largest supplier of coal, and Japan is also an important destination for our iron ore exports. Treasury's initial assessment is that there is likely to be a short-term impact on some Australian exports to Japan in coming quarters. Japanese demand for steel-making inputs is likely to fall in the near term following the closure of several large steel-making plants and the disruption to Japanese manufacturing. Commodity markets have also generally weakened. Thermal coal prices are down around seven per cent since the earthquake and iron ore prices are down around four per cent. But there may be some rise in demand for other fuels such as LNG as other forms of energy production are more heavily utilised. In the medium term, reconstruction will support growth in Japan and add to demand for Australia's bulk commodity exports. But the risks surrounding this assessment are considerable and to the downside. Any escalation in the problems at the nuclear reactors would exacerbate the economic impact on Japan and the global economy, as would further disruption to closely integrated production networks in Japan. There are also considerable risks of dislocation in global energy markets, including rising coal, gas and oil prices. These events could adversely impact global confidence at a time when the world economy is already facing significant challenges, and there is new instability in parts the Middle East and North Africa. We will of course continue to monitor the situation closely, including the impact of these events on the global economy and also on our own. Natural disasters at home Australia has also taken a direct hit from natural disasters here at home. In economic terms, the January floods and Cyclone Yasi will likely be the largest natural disaster in our history. Together, they will likely reduce economic growth by around half a percentage point this financial year. The supply chains for our coal exports were severely hampered, and production at some of our big mines continues to be disrupted by the floodwaters. On top of this, fruit and vegetable crops have been damaged-the disasters wiped out a significant part of the country's food bowl. Between our coal and agricultural industries alone, we expect that production will be reduced by around $8 billion-which is slightly larger than our earlier estimates. Our tourism sector has suffered, and other industries-such as manufacturing, retail and transport-have been put under enormous pressure. This is a cruel blow for those sectors already struggling to cope with the high dollar. The loss of production has also translated into higher prices for families-especially for fruit and vegetables. The region affected by Yasi produces 90 per cent of Australia's bananas and around one-third of our sugar cane. We expect that the January floods and Cyclone Yasi will increase CPI inflation by half of a percentage point in the March quarter, perhaps more. While this will hurt families doing it tough, these price rises will be temporary, unwinding as crops regrow and production comes back on line. But just as we are now seeing in Japan and have witnessed in Christchurch as well, the way the community in Queensland and of Australia has pulled together has been inspiring. We have seen community groups, business and governments at all levels chip into help the rebuild. The Queensland Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal has raised more than $240 million. This is in addition to tens of millions of dollars of in-kind assistance. And the federal government is providing more than $6 billion for flood and cyclone affected regions across Australia, with the vast majority being invested in rebuilding damaged public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and schools. More than two-thirds of this will be funded through budget savings, with the remainder funded through a modest, temporary levy. And I am pleased to see that this levy passed the Senate yesterday, with the support of every single Labor MP and senator from Queensland. I do not want to get political here, but I do wonder how the Queensland MPs on that side of the House will look their constituents in the eye when they head home this Friday. Budget It is against the backdrop of these natural disasters that we will spend the coming weeks putting the final touches on our fourth budget. Recent events-both here and abroad-will make a difficult task even more difficult. The early years of the budget mates will bear the brunt of the rebuilding and recovery costs, and government revenue will also take a hit from weaker growth in the short term. But keeping our budget on track to return to surplus by 2012-13 is the right economic strategy for an economy which is expected to be pushing up against its capacity over the coming years. Just as it was the right thing step in and support demand during the global recession, it is the right thing to do to step back when private demand is strengthening. We have already put in place around $5½ billion in savings to meet the cost of rebuilding from the floods and cyclone. And we are sticking to our strict fiscal rules, including our cap on real spending of two per cent or less in above trend growth years. We understand that this will mean that we need to do a lot of things in this budget that will not be popular, but they will be the right thing to do. A position of strength While these events pose big challenges for our budget preparations, they will not knock our economy off its medium-term path. We were not beaten by the global financial crisis and we will not be beaten now. Because of the decisions we took during the global financial crisis and our strong damentals, we face these new challenges from a position of strength. The Australian economy is halfway through its 20th year of continuous economic growth, with low unemployment, a solid investment pipeline, strong public finances and a sturdy financial system. In resources alone, investment has gone from $35 billion last year to an estimated $56 billion for this financial year. Next year, it is expected to increase even further, to a record $76 billion. On top of this we have strong job creation-over 300,000 jobs have esti- been added in the past year, and over 700,000 since we came to government. And we are on track to return the budget to surplus faster than any major advanced economy. Our position of strength gives us the confidence to make the right policy choices, and our fourth budget will also keep the wheels of reform turning. We will not lose sight of to the important task of transforming our economy. We have an ambitious agenda to keep our economy strong and prepare it for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. We have a plan to build capacity through making critical investments in infrastructure, skills and education. We are doing the hard yards in tax reform and superannuation, to broaden the economy and boost national savings. This will be another responsible budget that helps manage an economy in transition. We are committed to preparing our economy for the future and making sure we are best placed to take advantage of the opportunities. On climate change we are putting in place the policies to transition our economy to the low-carbon future. It is important that we decouple our economic growth from growth in carbon pollution-we know the earlier we start the lower the cost and the better placed our economy will be. With the associated investment pipeline, funwe know that the mining boom will also continue to push our economy towards its capacity. That is why we are investing in the infrastructure and skills, while also putting in place the policies to support increased workforce participation and labour supply. It is also why it remains critical that we deliver on our fiscal commitments and stick to our strict fiscal rules in the upcoming budget. But we will approach this task knowing that by making the tough calls now, we are putting our economy in a position of strength. This was the approach we took to dealing with the worse global recession in 75 years. It is the approach that we have taken when putting together our previous budgets. And it is the approach we will take in finalising the budget I will deliver in this chamber in less than seven weeks. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for North Sydney to speak for 10 minutes. Leave granted.",125
215,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Hockey speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Question agreed to.,128
216,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Australians have watched on in despair at the devastation caused by the earthquakes that have recently struck Christchurch and northern Japan. The devastation which has impacted our friends in these countries has been difficult to watch, particularly when you see footage of people wandering the streets and cities, which have been reduced to rubble, knowing that they have lost nearly everything-and, in some cases, they have lost their loved ones. These events have truly tested the people of Japan and New Zealand, and our deepest sympathies go out to them in their hour of need. While we focus our attention on the tragedies that have fallen on our neighbours, we must not forget the natural disasters that our own nation has had to face in recent months. Disasters such as floods, cyclones and fires are a natural and, sadly, a regular part of living in Australia. First there were the floods across much of the eastern states, along with bushfires in the south-west of Western Australia, followed by the monster Cyclone Yasi in Far North Queensland. Cyclone Yasi left an unbelievable path of destruction that has left many North Queensland communities completely disadvantaged. Many are still struggling to pick up the pieces-over a month after the storm has passed. The Treasurer notes that the government is providing more than $6 billion for flood and cyclone affected regions across Australia, and the coalition welcomes that support. It believes the government should spend whatever it takes to get these shattered communities back on their feet as quickly as possible. What the coalition does oppose is how the government has chosen to fund that commitment with a $1.8 billion new tax. What the government should have done was fund all of the reconstruction through savings measures within the budget-and the coalition showed the way, identifying $2 billion of savings which could have been reallocated to the reconstruction effort. Imposing new taxes is, sadly, part of the Labor Party's DNA. Labor has announced 13 new or increased taxes in just two terms. These include the alcopops tax, the increase in the tobacco tax, the significant increase in luxury car taxes and, more recently, the mining tax, the flood levy and now the carbon tax. Enough is enough. Another tax will put already strained household budgets under more stress. Quite simply, Australian households cannot afford another Labor tax. This new flood tax will erode consumer sentiment and stifle consumer spending at a time when the retail industry is already doing it tough. There have been levies before, but the flood levy raises in a single year three times the amount of any levy introduced under the previous government. Besides the Medicare levy, this is the single largest annual levy ever introduced in Australia. The Prime Minister said it was the right thing to do. We in the coalition believe the additional tax is the wrong thing to do. The coalition also has grave concerns about the capacity of the government to administer such large funds. They have a poor history when it comes to management of programs, including a $1.2 billion blow-out in the computers in schools program; a $1.5 billion blow-out in the Building the Education Revolution school halls program; the Green Loans program, with $300 million wasted and the program finally cancelled; and the GP superclinics, with 36 promised and only eight currently in operation after four years. Preventing these and other program spending blow-outs would have paid the $1.8 billion to be raised through the new levy and much more. It is also worth noting that, for 2010-11, the interest paid on Labor created government net debt will be $4.38 billion this year alone. That is nearly 2½ times the amount to be raised by the new flood tax. That is a core reason that the coalition are so committed to paying back Labor's debt when we are next in government. The interest on the debt is a huge burden for the budget. The money can be much better spent on essential services such as health, education and income support. The government also has a much greater capacity to respond to natural disasters when the budget is in surplus and there is money in the bank. But it is not just the coalition that does trust the Treasurer with money. The Prime Minister could not trust her own Treasurer to oversee the reconstruction of Queensland. She found it necessary to appoint a Liberal to oversee the job. On 7 February this year, when the Prime Minister appointed former federal Liberal finance minister John Fahey as chair of the Reconstruction Inspectorate, I am sure Lindsay Tanner and a number of other people in the Labor Party who had served so well for so long would have been turning in their political graves. Part of the Reconstruction Inspectorate's remit is to: Scrutinise requests for reimbursement by local government for projects completed for the purposes of reconstructionandExamine high value or complex projects prior to execution Both these jobs should properly be done by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. But our Prime Minister has decided to appoint a Liberal to do all this because, as she knows from school halls, pink batts and the NBN, the Treasurer is not quite up to the job of dealing with taxpayers' money-yet the Treasurer is going to deliver a budget in May. The Treasurer wants us to believe that the budget strategy is back on track and he said: ‘Keeping our budget on track to return to surplus by 2012-13 is the right economic strategy.' And he went on to say: And we are sticking to our strict fiscal rules, including our cap on real spending of two per cent or less in above trend growth years. This is a key point. It is curious that the Treasurer has omitted to mention perhaps the most important of his fiscal rules. Let me remind the House of the three rules which underpin Labor's medium-term fiscal strategy. They are (1) maintain tax to GDP ratio well below the 2007-08 level on averagenot which is 23.5 per cent (2) achieve budget surpluses, on average, over the medium term and (3) real growth in spending to be kept below two per cent until the budget returns to surplus. This restraint is to be maintained, on average ‘while the economy is growing at or above trend until surpluses are at least one per cent of GDP'. They are the three rules. The Treasurer has not mentioned the first of these rules relating to tax restraint-the 23.5 per cent rule. I suspect he is now walking away from that commitment-to use the Prime Minister's words-because he knows that this big-taxing government will not be able to meet that promise. This is a further example of the disingenuousness of the government and it is a clear signal that the forthblack coming budget will be built on a lie. This budget is going to have a gaping black hole. Budgets are supposed to include the financial effects of all policy announcements of government. The government has announced that it will be introducing a carbon tax as early as 1 July 2012. It stands to reason that the funds to be raised through the carbon tax should be included in budget revenue and the spending associated with the so-called compensation measures should be included in expenditure. However, the government has decided, deliberately, not to announce any of the detail of the carbon tax, such as the rate, to whom it applies, which industries will be exempt and so on. It has also failed to announce the households and industries that will receive compensation. It is not even putting an in globo figure into the budget papers. This means that it is virtually impossible for Treasury to determine revenue and spending with any certainty. However, the ongoing speculation about the level of the mining tax suggests that, if the mining tax has a starting price of between $20 and $30 a tonne, the sums will be significant. On page 27 of Ross Garnaut's climate change review, update paper No. 6 states that a carbon price of $26 per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent would generate around $11.5 billion in 2012-13 alone-$11.5 billion on the revenue side; $11.5 billion on the expenditure side. A recent report by the Centre for International Economics suggests that the price on carbon will need to escalate rapidly following the end of a fixed-price period in order to achieve the required emissions reduction. Therefore, for a starting price of $20 per tonne, the price increases to $49 in 201617. That equates to an annual tax take in excess of $20 billion. For comparison, the GST collects $50 billion a year. So the carbon tax is equivalent to increasing the GST from 10 to about 14 per cent. This is a significant hole in this budget, and it clearly illustrates that the government is unable to meet the 23.5 per cent target, and that is why the Treasurer has stopped talking about it. It is one of the three major components for fiscal integrity and the Treasurer has dumped it. In order to ensure that he does not break another promise, he has decided to leave the carbon tax and the carbon expenditure out of the budget. That is why the budget in May will be a big lie. It is not telling the truth about the fiscal state of the nation. (Time expired) NA Afghanistan",128
217,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As I said during last year's parliamentary debate on Afghanistan, ‘There can be no more serious endeavour for any country or government than to send its military forces into conflict.' That is why it is appropriate that Australia's commitment to Afghanistan is the subject of ongoing parliamentary and public scrutiny. As part of this, the government and I are committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including to the parliament. My report on this occasion includes the recent NATO and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) defence ministers meeting in Brussels, which I attended earlier this month. Why we are there It is worth reminding ourselves why we are in Afghanistan and what our goal is. The government's strong view is that it is in our national interest to be in Afghanistan, not just with our alliance partner the United States but also with 46 other members of the international community acting under a United Nations mandate. Australia has a responsibility to help stare down international terrorism and ensure stability in Afghanistan. Our fundamental goal is to prevent Afghanistan from again being used by terrorists to plan and train for attacks on innocent civilians, including Australians in our own region and beyond. To achieve that goal we must help prepare the Afghan government to take lead responsibility for providing security for the Afghan people. We must stabilise the security situation and mentor and train the Afghan security forces. Progress There are signs that the international community's recent troop surge, combined now with a strong military and political strategy, has reversed the Taliban's momentum. This progress is incremental and hardwon, but it is apparent. As International Security Assistance Force Commander General Petraeus told the US Congress on 15 March, districts west of Kandahar city-the birthplace of the Taliban-have recently been cleared by ISAF and Afghan troops. In recent months, there has been a fourfold increase in the number of weapons and explosive caches turned in and found. Around 700 former Taliban have now officially reintegrated with Afghan authorities, with some 2,000 more in various stages of the reintegration process. But I do urge caution. United States Defense Intelligence Agency head, General Ron Burgess, has cautioned that ‘the security situation remains fragile and heavily dependent on ISAF support' and that the Taliban ‘remains resilient and will be able to threaten US and international goals in Afghanistan through 2011.' We must expect pushback from the Taliban, particularly in areas recently claimed by ISAF and Afghan troops, when this year's fighting season commences in April or May. We do need to steel ourselves for a tough fighting season. United States Secretary of Defense Gates was correct when he said in Afghanistan on 8 March that the coming spring and summer fighting seasons would present an ‘acid test' of whether our gains could hold. As well, the international community must continue to press President Karzai and his government to deliver on his undertakings at the London conference in January 2010 to improve governance, pursue electoral reform, take effective anticorruption and anti-narcotics measures and create social and economic opportunities for all the Afghan people, including Afghan women and girls. As United States National Intelligence Director Jim Clapper advised the United States Congress recently, which he repeated to me when I met him in Australia last week, there remains concern about the ability of the Afghan government to deliver on governance. Without progress on governance, security gains will remain fragile. International commitment Leaders of the 48 ISAF countries met at the Lisbon summit last November and resolved that a conditions based transition to Afghan led security begin this year, 2011, with the aspiration of completing transition by the end of 2014. NATO and ISAF members also made an important long-term commitment to support Afghanistan beyond the transition of security responsibility. Good progress has been made since the Lisbon summit, with the first Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board report on transition and the development of ISAF Transition Implementation Principles. Australia endorses the first Inteqal report and its recommendation to begin transition, as the Brussels NATO-ISAF defence ministers meeting also did, and as announced by President Karzai on 22 March, which I will refer to shortly. The Inteqal report's commitment to coordinate transition planning with both Afghan and ISAF stakeholders will ensure all partners are consulted throughout the transition process, including on future tranches for transition. It is essential to this right, to ensure the sustainability of transition process. As the Prime Minister said at the Lisbon summit, there is no point transitioning out only to have to transition back in later. The ISAF Transition Implementation Principles emphasise a shared, long-term commitment, a properly resourced mission, and investment and reinvestment in training. I attended the recent NATO-ISAF defence ministers' meeting in Brussels. Building upon the Lisbon summit, this meeting delivered the message that ISAF partners are committed to achieving a conditions based, irreversible and sustainable transition of security responsibility to Afghan National Security Forces. Working hand in hand with the Afghan government, ISAF intends to complete the handing over of security responsibility to Afghan authorities by the end of 2014. This is an achievable task, and it has already started. Transition We must remember that transition will be a process rather than a single event. It will take place at different times in districts and in provinces only as security circumstances permit. The pace of this transition will depend on conditions on the ground, in particular the operational readiness of the Afghan National Security Forces. On 22 March President Karzai announced the first provinces and districts to transition to Afghan authority. These include the provinces of Bamyan (all districts), Panjshir (all districts), and Kabul (all districts except Surobi) and the districts of Mazar-e-Sharif (Balkh province), Herat (Herat province), Lashkar Gah (Helmand province) and Mehtar Lam (Laghman province). This first tranche of provinces and districts identified for transition has been selected on the basis of an assessment that their get security, governance and development condithe tions are sufficient to commence transition. The decision to commence transition was made by the Afghan government based on the assessment and recommendation of the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board. In these areas the Afghan security forces have been assessed as capable of taking on additional security tasks with less assistance from ISAF. Progress in Oruzgan Transition is what Australia is working towards in Oruzgan province with the Afghan National Security Forces and our partners in Combined Team-Oruzgan, the United States, New Zealand, Singapore and Slovakia. There was never an expectation that Oruzgan would be in the first tranche of districts and provinces to begin transition. We believe the Oruzgan transition process can occur over the next three years, between 2012 and 2014. Over the past six months, the Afghan National Security Forces and Combined TeamOruzgan have expanded security over areas previously controlled by the Taliban. This has been made possible in part through the transfer of several patrol bases from ISAF or Afghan National Army control to the Afghan National Police, which has in turn allowed the Afghan National Army to move into contested areas. The increasingly competent Afghan National Security Forces, with the support of Combined Team-Oruzgan, are covering more and more ground, extending the reach of the Afghan government throughout the province. Australian mentored Afghan forces are expanding the security footprint from the Tarin Kowt bowl to the Mirabad Valley in the east, Deh Rawud in the west, and north through the Baluchi Valley into Chora. Our task now is to ensure that this progress in security, development and governance and the gains we have made are consolidated and not reversed. Progress in training the Afghan National Security Forces As part of the overarching transition stratployed egy in Afghanistan, Australia is committed to mentoring and training the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Oruzgan province to enable them to take on responsibility for security arrangements in the province between 2012 and 2014. Australia's assessment of the 4th Brigade's capacity is that it is effective with assistance and increasingly capable. A further infantry Kandak has now arrived in Oruzgan to bring the 4th Brigade to full strength. While this 6th infantry Kandak lacks experience, it is trained and equipped for initial tasks, has strong leadership a strong graduate of the Consolidated Fielding Centre in Kabul. The 6th Kandak is currently mentored by US forces. The next rotation of Australian forcesAustralian Task Force 9-will be deployed into Oruzgan province in June, and will take on the additional task of mentoring the newly formed 6th Infantry Kandak of the 4th Brigade. As we hand over patrol bases and establish new ones, and see ANA Kandaks conduct more unaccompanied activities, Australian forces can be released for additional training and mentoring tasks, including responsibility for additional ANA forces in Oruzgan. As the Kandaks become more capable and self-reliant, Australian forces can move into an enabling and overwatch role. Support for our troops Our troops and personnel in Afghanistan are performing extremely well in dangerous circumstances on a daily basis. Australians are proud of the fact that our troops have a well-deserved reputation for their effectiveness and their conduct. Afghan government ministers-including Defence Minister Wardak, whom I met again in Brussels-and ISAF Commander General Petraeus praise the work and reputation of Australians dein Afghanistan, including in their engagement with local Afghan communities. The support and protection of Australian personnel in Afghanistan is, rightly, our highest priority. The provision of new capability is part of the package of initiatives worth $1.6 billion that the government committed to, following the Force Protection Review effected by my predecessor Minister Faulkner, and underlines the commitment to provide our troops with the best available equipment. Of the 48 recommendations made by the review, 42 are now complete or on track. and is They include enhanced counter IED measures, better armour and heavier calibre weapons for our Bushmasters, the placement of medics with each platoon operating in Afghanistan and the introduction of 1,000 sets of lighter combat armour. US related allegations Recent media reports of allegations of premeditated murder of Afghan civilians by a small number of US soldiers are deeply disturbing. The allegations were first reported last year, at which time the United States launched a criminal investigation into the allegations. Criminal charges were laid following the investigation and are now the subject of United States court martial proceedings. The United States Army has apologised for the distress the terrible incident and the publicity has caused, saying they stand ‘in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterised our soldiers' performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations in Afghanistan'. In this context, the United States Army has restated its commitment to the ‘adherence to the law of war and the humane and respectful treatment of combatants, noncombatants, and the dead' and acknowledged that ‘when allegations of wrongdoing by soldiers surface, to include the inappropriate treatment of the dead, they are fully investigated; soldiers who commit offences will be held accountable as appropriate'. Australia very firmly believes that strict adherence to rules of engagement is essential on the battlefield. Rule of law and the protection of civilians The rule of law is an essential basis ternational relations and for national security policy. The force of international law, and the protection it offers the Afghan people, clearly distinguishes the international effort in Afghanistan from the actions of the Taliban and its associates. On the ground, international humanitarian law-including the principles of military necessity, proportionality, distinction and discrimination-provides the framework for Australia and ISAF's rules of engagement. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has built a reputation over the years for professionalism and compliance with such rules of engagement. Australian forces take all possible steps to ensure their operations do not endanger the lives of civilians. We have prided ourselves on our high standards and we have a well-regarded international reputation for doing so. When, for example, there are incidents involving civilians, they are always investigated. In that context, the Registrar of Military Justice has convened a general court martial to try charges against two of the three Australian Defence Force members relating to an incident in Afghanistan on 12 February 2009. Pretrial directions hearings for the court martial are scheduled to commence soon in Sydney and the trial has been set down for 11 July 2011. Casualties It has already been a difficult year for the Australian Defence Force. This year, Australia has lost two more brave soldiers. Corporal Richard Atkinson was killed in an improvised explosive device strike on 2 February. Sapper Jamie Larcombe died as a result of gunshot wounds sustained during an engagement with insurgents on 19 February. Our thoughts continue to be with the families, friends and colleagues of Corporal Atfor inkinson and Sapper Larcombe, as they too come to terms with their great loss. These soldiers served their country well and will always be remembered. We have lost 23 fine Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. As well, four Australian soldiers have been wounded in Afghanistan this year, with 168 ADF personnel wounded in action since 2002. Our thoughts are also with our wounded and their families. The sacrifice our men and women make is great, as is the appreciation of our nation and our people. Our forces face a resilient insurgency, who, in coming months, will seek to retake ground. In this environment, we must steel ourselves for the possibility of further casualties, of further fatalities. Despite these tragic losses and the challenges ahead, Australia remains resolute. Conclusion We are seeing progress in Afghanistan. This progress is fragile. The Taliban know they need to regain momentum, so we can expect them to fight back. The coming fighting season will be tough. As we prepare for it, we are also mindful of the civilian toll of the war. We can expect high-profile attacks by Afghan insurgents to continue and to increase, like the 21 February suicide attack in Kunduz province that killed around 30 Afghans and wounded 36 others. An increasing number of civilian casualties are caused by insurgent attacks and the deliberate targeting of civilians or tactics which result casualties. These attacks are aimed at undermining Afghan and international confidence in the progress that is being made on security, governance and development and on transition. Transition has commenced with President Karzai's announcement earlier this week of the first provinces and districts to transition to Afghan authority. Transition must be conditions based and irreversible. Transition can not be and must not be a signal to premature withdrawal. The international community must continue to provide a long-term commitment to Afghanistan. That is why Australia has made clear it expects to maintain a presence in Afghanistan after our current training mission in Oruzgan has concluded, either in further specialised training, overwatch or through civilian capacity building and development assistance. Australia is confident that the international community has the right strategy for putting Afghanistan in a position to take responsibility for security matters and prevent it from again becoming a haven for international terrorists. This military and political strategy and the required resources are now, at long last, in place and delivering hard-won progress. We see this in Oruzgan as we see it elsewhere in Afghanistan. Australia stands firm in its continuing commitment to Afghanistan.

220,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Fadden) (5.27 pm)Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Minister for Defence. The minister should know that he enjoys bipartisan support from the coalition as the government seeks to prosecute their agenda with our fighting men and women within Afghanistan. I thank the minister for his commitment to provide regular updates to the parliament as to what is happening in Afghanistan and I note the minister has indeed been true to his word in keeping his commitment to provide these updates. It is important, as we seek to understand where we are going in Afghanistan and what the future holds, that we also look back to truly understand how the fight started and why it is important that the government is indeed supported at a bipartisan level to continue the fight in Afghanistan. I think we all agree that the world changed on September 11. Australia invoked the ANZUS alliance, standing shoulder to shoulder with our friend and ally the United States of America as they launched Operation Enduring Freedom. On 20 December 2001, the UN approved resolution 1386, a resolution which has been approved annually since that date. There are 48 ISAF nations working within Afghanistan. It is a difficult but just and justified fight in response to an unmitigated act of barbarity. I do not need to remind the House or indeed the entire nation that over 100 Australians have perished at the hands of terrorists, whose support, whose training, whose financing and whose indoctrination can in one way or another be linked back to the insurgents, the Taliban and the other extremist groups operating within Afghanistan. The minister noted that recent progress in Afghanistan has for the most part been positive, especially following the US troop surge that commenced in mid-2009. There is no doubt that recent ISAF operations have made ground, particularly in southern Afghanistan. In Kandahar we currently have 14 or so artillerymen fighting with British artillery commanded by the CO of the 7th Parachute Battalion, the Royal Horse Artillery. There is a group fighting in Kandahar down in the south, where in previous battles they had trained their guns over open sights so close were the enemy, where now there is greater control over the area and greater engagement through shuras with local leaders, and our men are reporting that there is greater trade and commerce between disparate groups within the area. Indeed, the degree of fighting, in their experience, has lessened. A new patrol base has been put outside the main operating area in Kandahar, a testimony to the degree of stability that is being achieved in the southern province. But let us not lose focus. As the new fighting season approaches, the Taliban will look to reclaim ground it has lost. They are a resilient and hard-fighting foe. In the coming months, as the winter snow melts, the Taliban will push back. It is fair to assume that we are fighting a resilient enemy. The question the nation needs to ask is a simple one: can we or can we not hold our gains? I agree with the minister on the capacity, the capability and the courage of our fighting men and women to hold our gains and, more importantly, to gain even more. I note the recent report from Major General Mike Kraus, Deputy Chief of Staff Plans at ISAF's Joint Command Headquarters, where he said: We believe that we have momentum. We believe we now have the initiative. However Major General Kraus also noted the fragility of these gains. I know General Kraus. He is not a man loose with his words-a serious war-fighting general who understands the serious nature of our commitments in Afghanistan. The message here, I believe, is that progress is rarely easy and it is rarely quick. It is incremental. It comes at a cost. Enduring progress is dependent upon coalition forces holding their nerve and, as the minister quite rightly stated, standing firm on their commitment to Afghanistan. In short, if I can quote the previous commander of our deployed forces, Major General Cantwell, not only to the Prime Minister but also to the Leader of the Opposition, and indeed to the parliament, this is ‘not the time to get the wobbles'. Progress made by Australian forces should not be underestimated. Australian forces are doing an amazing job in incredibly difficult, dangerous and arduous circumstances. General Petraeus, the commander in Afghanistan, has consistently commended the work of Australia's fighting men and women. In terms of military progress, it is undeniable that the southern provinces, including Uruzgan where the bulk of Australia's fighting forces are based, is a comparatively safer place than it once was. In Uruzgan, Australia, along with other members of Combined Team-Uruzgan, have made significant progress both in training Afghan 4th Brigade soldiers and in the reconstruction work through the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. I recognise that the Afghan 4th Brigade's capacity to operate independently of assistance is increasing-slowly, but it is certainly increasing. Having been to Afghanistan twice last year and having seen for myself the progress they are making, I can provide testimony to that fact. I note that with the next rotation of Australian forces they will also be taking respondevelopment sibility for the 6th Khandaq of the 4th Afghan Brigade. Australia will therefore be responsible for training the entirety of the brigade. It was also pleasing to see the brigade's heavy weapon support Khandaq actually fire their D-30 artillery pieces, bringing on line another capability they have got to engage with to seek to destroy the insurgency within Afghanistan. I also note that we continue to supply a surface vessel operating in the Gulf and the Red Sea region, which does an excellent job in enforcing the restriction zones there, doing counterpiracy and other support activities. I note our substantial aviation assets are flying out of both Afghanistan and, indeed, the wider Middle East, continuing to provide a range of significant resources and platforms desperately needed for the fight to continue. We can as a nation be proud of our some 2,350 men and women currently deployed in the wider Gulf region. As I have said consistently in this place, and I say again to the minister: the only thing I would ask is that currently there is a cap of 1,550 men and women in Afghanistan and it is our contention that that cap would be better placed on the 2,350 in the wider Middle East area of operations to allow the force commander to surge men and women troops as he sees fit. I certainly reiterate that to the minister. In terms of transition, the minister has said consistently that a transition of Australian forces out of Afghanistan will take place over what is now three years, sometime between 2012 and 2014. This has the support of the coalition. The PM has also stated, during her address on this issue leading the debate in the parliament, that Australia will maintain a capability after the training role of the 4th Afghan Brigade has ceased with an overwatch capability, a training capability, and perhaps a civilian capacity-building and assistance capability. The coalition again supports this. We do, however, ask the minister to provide an update as soon as that would be available as to what the overwatch capability or that training role or civilian capability would look like in terms of personnel, equipment and the length of time it would be envisaged that they would be in Afghanistan beyond 2014. We appreciate that it may take some time for the minister to work through the details of what that overwatch or training capability may look like. In terms of the transition arrangements, we understand that progress has taken place since the London Conference on Afghanistan in January 2010, especially with respect to improving the governance within the Karzai regime. Whilst many steps have been made with respect to improvement within the regime, the world understands that there still needs to be improvement with respect to the legitimacy and the standards of governance and the fight on corruption that the Karzai government brings to its administration in Afghanistan. Certainly taking those issues of governance beyond the major cities and into the regional areas where the Taliban still have considerable influence remains a priority as the Karzai government moves through the London conference initiatives to seek to improve the governance within the area. In terms of endorsing the NATO report and the transition for wider Afghanistan and especially the ISAF Transition Implementation Principles, they are indeed welcome news and are supported as they emphasised a shared, long-term commitment. I note the minister said that the transition will be conditions based, irreversible and sustainable, with ISAF intending to complete the handover by the end of 2014. I also note the announcement by President Karzai on 22 March of the first provinces to transition. They are Bamian, all districts; Panjshir, all districts; Kabul, all districts except Surobi; and the districts of Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Laskargah in the Helmand province, and Mehterlam. In the transition section, though, it has constantly been said-and the minister has made these statements-that the transition would be one based on metrics, where data and commanders' judgments drive the transition. The coalition support that. We support the view that transition may well take place in Oruzgan district by district, valley by valley, village by village, re-entrant by re-entrant. As I said, the government has the support of the coalition for a metrics and commander judgment based transition that adequately ensures that the Afghan National Army's 4th Brigade has the training, resources and equipment to do the job, and that ensuring the transition occurs so that Australian soldiers' lives are not put at any greater risk than they normally are. As we move towards that transition, it is instructive to look at the toll in Afghanistan. In this year alone, two of our great soldiers have been killed in action: Corporal Richard Atkinson on 2 February, from an IED blast; and Sapper Jamie Larcombe on 19 February, from gunshot wounds he sustained. Our thoughts are with their families, and I join with the minister in thanking those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. I cannot begin to understand the pain that their families are going through. We have now lost 23 brave Australians in combat in Afghanistan. Four more have been wounded in action this year, bringing the total number of wounded, since 2002, to 168. The coalition join the government in their commitment to care for these soldiers and their families. We must, and we will, do everything possible to support them. I note with interest that the Army has recently embarked on a campaign to better educate and care for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder upon their return from the battlefield. I note the great DVD they have made, called Dents in the Soul, and I commend the Army, particularly the Chief of Army, General Gillespie, for their work in tackling this difficult issue and their efforts in embarking on what amounts to a significant cultural change program within the Army and, more widely, within the ADF. We on this side of the House continue to expect the government to continue to look after our troops' welfare, and their families' welfare, not only in the short term but also in the longer term. We expect them to deliver on their promise to support our returned troops, particularly those who have sustained physical injuries or mental conditions. I call on the wider nation to remember that our fighting men and women fight for us; they fight for you. They fight for the safety and freedom that we enjoy. I call on the nation to remember them and perhaps, if the opportunity arises, to show your appreciation in a tangible way by writing to them. Australia Post will send a two-kilogram parcel free of charge-send them some decent coffee, send them some Tim Tams, send them a letter. The joy your family will get from receiving a letter back from one of our fighting men and women is truly something to behold. Our soldiers have a great sense of humour. A digger from Cairns writes back and says he is used to the tropics but he is now in minus 15 degrees in the mountains at Chora and he is freezing. I encourage Australians to remember our fighting men and womensend them a care package-not just in Afghanistan but right across the theatres of influence where our men and women serve. The Minister for Defence also provided an update on the new C-RAM, the counterrocket artillery and mortar early warning system installed to help protect Australian soldiers from attacks in Afghanistan. It is a critical system. It was called for by the coaliing tion, and I thank the previous Minister for Defence for heeding that call and bringing the system forward. Certainly, it is better than never. It performs a vital role, providing precious seconds warning for our troops. I also thank the minister for providing an update on the court martial proceedings relating to three ADF personnel. It is no secret that the coalition remain concerned about the length of time it has taken to bring these charges, noting from the minister's comments that only two court martials have been arranged, with the third pending. We will continue to monitor closely the amount and quality of representation these soldiers are afforded. I note the minister and CDF have promised the finest advice and representation that can possibly be provided, and that is indeed welcome. I note the minister's comments with regard to detainee management. I am in lockstep with the minister insofar as we agree that the first priority of the detainee management framework must be to ensure insurgents are removed from the battlefield. Naturally, we will continue to monitor very closely the whole range of issues currently before the ADF regarding detainee management. I also note, though, that ADF troops, most notably our special forces, are becoming frustrated with Australia's limited current framework. My understanding is that ADF troops can still only hold suspected insurgents for a maximum of four days, whereas our ISAF partners can hold them for 14 days. I would argue that that length of time does not allow for the extraction of valuable information by Australian troops. It is difficult to assess the intelligence value of information extracted within just four days. I believe it is having an impact on troop morale, especially when insurgents are caught, released and then caught again. It is my understandthat the minister is reviewing these arrangements, to his credit. I therefore ask the minister in good faith: can he provide a firm late time line for that decision and update; and will any recommendations be made public? In conclusion, I thank the Minister for Defence for providing the House with this update. He has been true to his word and provided an update, as he said he would. I sincerely hope that he will consider the points that I have raised today on behalf of the coalition. We join the government in thanking our professional military commanders, who have assured the government and the opposition that our fighting men and women are doing everything they need to do to ensure success in the campaign in Afghanistan. We must steel ourselves against the future as we enter the fighting season. We remain in lockstep with the government, as there is bipartisan support for the mission and for our troops. INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF NA AMENDMENT BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",135
221,Mr GRAY,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (5.44 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2011 is to update and modernise the operation of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. The proposed amendments are primarily intended to ensure the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) is able to undertake the work of the Office of the IGIS more effectively and efficiently, including by addressing issues which have arisen or become evident since the legislation was enacted in 1986. The bill will also strengthen the accountability and oversight framework governing the activities of the agencies that make up the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC), and will provide greater assurance regarding the legality or propriety of their activities. The act was originally drafted in response to the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security conducted by the Honourable Justice Robert Hope in 1983, which raised, amongst various issues, concerns about the capacity of ministers to control effectively some AIC agencies. The government's expressed aim at the time in establishing the office was for assistance to be provided to ministers in undertaking their oversight and review responsibilities in relation to the five Australian intellishe gence and security agencies, particularly with regard to ensuring compliance with the law, propriety of their particular activities, and consistency with human rights. The work of the IGIS, particularly in assisting the government meet its responsibilities in relation to the intelligence agencies, is one of foundations of the accountability framework for the AIC, currently numbering six agencies. With a view to renewing assurance to the parliament and the public that agency use of special powers and capabilities is subject to scrutiny, the bill recognises expressly the IGIS's special role in assisting the government in relation to oversight of the intelligence agencies. In relation to the IGIS's inquiry and reporting functions, the bill enhances and expands the IGIS's capacity to undertake ownmotion inquiries and to provide copies of reports of inquiries to the Prime Minister. Currently, the act allows the IGIS to undertake preliminary inquiries, but only where a complaint is made to the office. The proposed amendment will widen the scope for such preliminary inquiries by the IGIS. The ability to undertake a preliminary inquiry in response to a complaint provides the IGIS with an efficient and cost-effective mechanism to ask an agency for information about a matter, without having to allocate resources to conduct a full investigation. In a significant number of instances, this allows for a sufficient examination of the matter while avoiding a full inquiry. There can be occasions when an allegation about one or more of the AIC agencies is made, for example in the media, but a formal complaint is not lodged with the IGIS. Currently, the only formal option open to the IGIS to examine a matter raised in this way, if he or is so minded, is to move straight to a full inquiry. It is preferable in such circumstances for the agency to have an early opportunity to present relevant facts to IGIS, prior to a decision about whether or not to commence a full own-motion inquiry. The bill allows for the the adoption of this two-stage process for deciding whether to commence an own-motion inquiry, which will help ensure the significant coercive powers provided under the act for use in a full inquiry are only available when an actual need is identified. Moreover, this will provide the IGIS with more flexibilfunctions. ity and a more cost-effective option for handling many issues. The bill also addresses an anomaly in the act in that for the Office of National Assessexercised ments (ONA), the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Defence Intelligence Organisation, inquiries can be conducted by the IGIS on his or her own motion into the effectiveness and appropriateness of the procedures of the agency relating to the legality or propriety of the activities of the agency, but for the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Australian Secret Intellifice gence Service there is currently no ownmotion capacity in this regard-the IGIS can only conduct an inquiry into these agencies in response to individual cases of concern. The bill ensures IGIS can adopt a common approach towards all six AIC agencies. The act currently allows the IGIS to provide to the Prime Minister, as the minister responsible for the ONA, a copy of any report covering ONA, but not the other five AIC agencies within the IGIS's jurisdiction. The bill will correct this anomaly and allow the IGIS to give the Prime Minister a copy of any final report prepared in relation to an inquiry conducted under the IGIS Act, either where the Prime Minister has requested that be done or where the IGIS otherwise considers such action appropriate. The bill will also provide the IGIS with the capacity to delegate his or her powers in certain circumstances, subject to ministerial approval. There is currently no power of delegation in the act, and hence the IGIS must personally exercise the significant powers of the office. Due to the small size of the office, there is a limit to how many inquiries can be effectively conducted at any one time on top of its inspection and complaints handling In addition, the strong coercive powers provided to the IGIS to compel persons to provide information and documents can be only by the IGIS personally. In practice, this means it would be difficult for IGIS to concurrently progress more than two full inquiries of a significant nature in a timely way. The bill allows for the engagement of a suitable person to conduct a major inquiry with access to the full range of powers under the act. This will ensure the IGIS has greater flexibility to expand the capacity of the ofat short notice if a person of suitable standing could be engaged and delegated the full powers of IGIS in respect of a particular inquiry. Coercive questioning, however, is an extraordinary power exercised by a very limited number of agencies. Accordingly, the scope for the IGIS to delegate the powers of the office, particularly coercive questioning powers, will be subject to limitations that ensure this mechanism is only resorted to when there is a strict need. The proposed amendments require the IGIS to seek approval from the relevant minister in each case where such powers are to be delegated for the purpose of a specific inquiry only. The amendments also specify that unless the responsible minister otherwise agrees in relation to a particular inquiry, the person proposed to be employed in relation to the inquiry must be able to obtain and maintain a security clearance to at least the same level as staff members of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. There would be a relatively limited number of suitable candidates for delegation. The key qualities required for a suitable person would include: a very good understanding of the policy, bureaucratic and legal environment within which the intelligence and security agencies work, as well as an ability to approach issues fairly and with an open mind in order to arrive at objective, credible and defensible outcomes from inquiries or other investigations. The person would have to have the seniority and wisdom required to engage effectively the highest levels of agencies, and where necessary to resist pressures to influence unreasonably the outcomes of an IGIS investigation. For reasons of credibility, a delegate should also not have worked for any significant period of their career in the intelof ligence community itself, and would have to be able to work with and be subject to direction from the IGIS. Finally, the amendments require that the responsible minister must be satisfied that the proposed delegate has appropriate expertise for the particular inquiry. The bill also provides the IGIS with the capacity to assist royal commissions at the discretion of the government of the day, while ensuring the effective operation of limitations on any unauthorised release of sensitive intelligence material by current or former IGIS officers to a court, coronial inquiry or royal commission. This would be in order to assist the work of relevant royal commissions. The secrecy provisions of the act are intended to avoid court proceedings becoming an indirect route for disclosure via the IGIS of documents and information from the intelligence and security agencies, to which the IGIS has complete and necessary access, and the bill ensures that no person can be required by a court or tribunal to disclose information in contravention of the secrecy provisions of the act. There are, however, likely to be cases where the IGIS could provide significant assistance to, and facilitate the work of, a royal commission. The bill therefore recognises the desirability of enabling the IGIS to release material to royal commissions in certain circumstances. The proposed provision that a commission must be expressly prescribed in regulations as authorised to seek evidence from, or cooperate with, the IGIS will avoid the IGIS being under an obligation to give evidence to all royal commissions at a commission's request. The bill will also simplify some of the existing provisions of section 8 which, although they are key to the IGIS's jurisdiction, complainants and interested members the public often find convoluted and difficult to read and comprehend. The operation of subsections 8(5), (6) and (7), which relate to the scope of the IGIS's authority to inquire into employment matters concerning intelligence agency employees, will be simplified, providing greater clarity regarding the IGIS's inquiry functions covered by these provisions. The substantive role, powers or functions of the IGIS in relation to the intelligence agencies will not be altered by these proposed amendments. Finally, the opportunity is taken with this bill to rectify drafting oversights and inconsistencies that have become apparent in the act. One oversight arose when a new requirement was introduced by the Freedom of Information (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other Measures) Act 2009 for the IGIS to give evidence in Information Commissioner reviews in certain circumstances, requiring a minor consequential amendment to paragraph 34(5)(a) proposed by this bill. The bill will also rectify an unintended inconsistency in subsection 34(5) regarding the treatment of ‘documents' as opposed to ‘information' that arose when the subsection was repealed and substituted by schedule 4 to the Freedom of Information (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other Measures) Act 2009, and then amended by schedule 6 to the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010. Currently, paragraphs 34(5)(c), (ca), (d) and (e) deal with circumstances in which a person can be required to divulge or communicate information, but there are no equivalent provisions relating to documents. The proposed new paragraphs 34(5)(ba), (bb), (bc) and (bd) correct this drafting oversight. As noted by the Prime Minister in announcing in December 2010 the Independent Review of the Intelligence Community, which is currently under way, intelligence plays a key role in preserving Australia's national security and supports a wide range of our national interests. With the significant expansion in the resources and capabilities of the intelligence community over the past decade, it is important for the accountability machinery for the intelligence agencies to be revisited and refined in order to keep pace. This bill will ensure the office of is well positioned for the future, and is one part of the government's broader agenda of ensuring accountability machinery across the Commonwealth is operating both efficiently and effectively. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Keenan) adjourned. NA (No. 1) 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",139
222,Mr GRAY,STATUTE STOCKTAKE BILL,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (5.57 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Statute Stocktake Bill (No. 1) 2011 seeks to reduce red tape in the government's internal administration by repealing redundant special appropriations and a statutory special account. This bill is an important part of government housekeeping in keeping the financial regulatory framework of the Commonwealth up to date. The bill, if enacted, will update legislation across a range of portfolios by abolishing 39 special appropriations, including a statutory special account, repealing redundant provisions in 11 acts and repealing 25 acts in their entirety. These redundant provisions have been identified through a stocktake of special appropriations. The government committed to regular stocktakes of this nature in response the IGIS to the report Operation Sunlightoverhauling budgetary transparency released with the government's response on 9 December 2008. The bill carries on from the efforts of five previous financial framework legislation amendment acts from 2005 until 2010 and the Statute Stocktake (Regulatory and Other Laws) Act 2009, and contributes to Commonwealth efforts to clean up the statute book. The bill also assists the government to maintain effective legislative housekeeping, which is consistent with the government's better regulation agenda. The bill contains no significant policy changes. Schedule 1 of the bill would, if enacted, repeal 13 special appropriations that have either been fully expended or would concern functions that are no longer being undertaken, such as the Loans (Australian Industry Development Corporation) Act 1974. Schedule 2 of the bill will repeal 26 redundant special appropriations, including 25 acts and a statutory special account that no longer have any effect, such as the Forestry and Timber Bureau Act 1930. The measures contained in the bill reflect the government's commitment to enhance transparency and accountability across the Commonwealth's financial framework. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Keenan) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Reference",143
223,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (6.00 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Australian Defence Force Academy Redevelopment, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Defence Force Academy provides a learning and living environment for officers and cadets of the Australian Defence Force undertaking military training and university studies. The scope and delivery of military training and education has changed since the academy opened in 1986. These changes have resulted in a gap between the current facilities provision and that required. The government proposes to invest $98.5 million plus GST into a range of facilities to meet the future academic and military training needs of the Australian Defence Force. The proposed works include a new 1,200seat auditorium; five new teaching spaces and the refurbishment of existing teaching facilities; a new indoor sports centre; refurbishment of the cadets' mess kitchen, military staff working accommodation, chaplain's office and staff living-in accommodation; upgrades of the existing site engineering services; and new secure storage for cadets' bicycles and for flammable goods. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project is scheduled to commence construction late this year and be completed by the end of 2014. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

224,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (6.01 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary the Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Robertson Barracks electrical reticulation system upgrade, Darwin, Northern Territory. Robertson Barracks is a key defence base in the Northern Territory and is located approximately 20 kilometres east of Darwin. It is the home of the 1st Brigade and the 1st Aviation Regiment and a number of lodger units. The base supports a working population of approximately 3,500 personnel. It was constructed in the 1990s under an initiative called Army Presence in the North Project. The original high-voltage system at Robertson Barracks has undergone an ad hoc extension over the past 13 years as the demand for power has grown. The existing high-voltage system is nearing its capacity and has insufficient redundancy to cope with disruptions to the power supply, such as outages during tropical storms. The emergency power station has inadequate capacity and cannot fully support the capability during power outages. It also lacks the controls necessary for effective power switching and load shedding, which is necessary to ensure that power is supplied to critical areas of the base. These shortcomings have a direct impact on the operation of the base and constrain future growth and development. There is a pressing need to upgrade the high-voltage power supply and distribution network to provide a reliable and flexible system which has sufficient capacity to meet future demands. To this end defence propose the following work: the extension of the high-voltage feeder, interconnection of switching stations, upgrade and extensions to ring mains, construction of essential emergency power station, and installation of power control and monitoring systems. Without a comprehensive upgrade, the high-voltage infrastructure will continue to be affected by power failures and will be further compromised by the need to undertake ad hoc and costly upgrades each time there is an increase in the demand for power. The proposed upgrades will provide a purpose-designed power distribution system that will resolve existing inadequacies and will provide for growth and development at the base for approximately 15 years. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $43.4 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in late 2011 and is expected to be completed by mid-2013. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",144
225,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (6.04 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Integrated fit out of new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office in Albury, New South Wales. The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of the new leased premises at the corner of Smollett Street and Amp and Volt lanes, Albury, New South Wales. The new premises will replace the existing ATO location in the Albury CBD. The lease for the existing property will expire in December 2012. It is expected that the relocation into the new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies, and long term viability through improvements in site infrastructure. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $19.17 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in September 2011 and be completed by October 2012. In its report, the PWC has recommended that these works proceed. Development will commence base building works on site in March 2011, with demolition and excavation of the basement areas being the first tasks. The ATO is expected to take up occupancy of the building in October 2012. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

226,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (6.06 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Facilities for the introduction into service of Land 121 vehicles at RAAF Base Amberley and Damascus Barracks, Meeandah, Queensland and Gaza Ridge Barracks, Victoria. The current military transport and logistics wheeled vehicle fleet has reached the end of its useful life. To support the future capacity needs of the Australian Defence Force, a new fleet of up to 7,500 vehicles will be acquired between the years 2011 and 2020. The new fleet will include self-contained loading systems allowing a single vehicle to perform several functions via interchangeable loading modules. This fleet will replace the current Land Rover 110, Unimog, Mack and S-Line vehicles with a mix of unprotected and protected vehicles. The protected vehicles will provide increased personnel protection to reduce vulnerability to improvised explosive devices. The introduction of a new vehicle fleet will have three distinct facilities requirements including: the receipt, inspection, fitout and dispatch of vehicles; the conversion training of military drivers to operate the new vehicles; and maintenance training to support the sustainability of the new fleet. This project will include the construction of training and administrative facilities at RAAF Base Amberley and the construction of administrative, parking and inspection facilities at gatehouse and entry at Damascus Barracks, Meeandah, Queensland. Training and administration facilities will also be constructed at Gaza Ridge Barracks, North Bandiana, Victoria. The estimated cost of the proposal is $50.291 million, plus GST, and includes all delivery costs: management and design fees; construction costs; furniture, fittings and equipment; contingencies; and an allowance for escalation. In its report, the PWC has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in mid-2011 and is expected to be completed by mid-2012. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Parliamentary Budget Office Committee Report",145
227,Ms ODWYER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office, I present the committee's report entitled Inquiry into the proposed Parliamentary Budget Office, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",146
228,Ms ODWYER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I have presented the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office entitled Inquiry into the proposed Parliamentary Budget Office. The committee was appointed by the parliament to consider the proposal to establish a parliamentary budget office, or PBO. The membership of the committee consists of senators and members of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Nationals, the Australian Greens and an Independent member. The committee considered matters raised in submissions and public hearings, and also represented the views of their party colleagues. In line with its terms of reference, the committee looked beyond the scope of the Agreement for a Better Parliament and examined various successful aspects of international PBO models. In so doing, the committee considered a broad range of services and possible structures for the PBO, with the aim of creating a PBO framework which could serve the Australian parliament effectively. Key values underpinning the committee's recommendations included incorporating mechanisms into the PBO which could enhance transparency of process, ensure equality of access to its services and maintain dependence. The committee found that the establishment of a PBO is warranted as the most practical way to provide high-quality research and analysis on fiscal policy and budget related matters to the parliament. The committee recommended that the mandate of the PBO be to inform the parliament by providing independent, non-partisan and policy-neutral analysis on the full budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial tions of proposals. In line with this mandate, the committee recommended that the main functions of the PBO should be: to respond to the requests of senators, members and parliamentary committees; to formally contribute to committee inquiries; to publish selfinitiated work; and to prepare costings of election commitments. The committee also found that the election-costing provisions of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act could be enhanced to enable the electorate to be better informed about the financial implications of election commitments. In this respect, the committee has recommended new measures to give parties additional costing-process options. This would serve to enhance transparency and accountability of policies and to better inform the wider community. These new measures include amending the Charter of Budget Honesty Act to enable minor parties with five or more members to access the existing election costings process while also providing an alternative source of costings through the PBO. In line with international best practice, the committee has recommended that the position of Parliamentary Budget Officer be created as an independent officer of the parliament. In this way, the Parliamentary Budget Officer and their office will more clearly serve the ongoing financial information and in- scrutiny needs of the parliament as a whole, therefore enhancing fiscal transparency and executive accountability in the longer term. Related recommendations in the report seek to further strengthen the ability of the PBO to provide independent and robust analysis. These include: provisions to assist the PBO to access information held by government departments; the appointment, dismissal and remuneration arrangements for implicathe Parliamentary Budget Officer; and mechanisms for the oversight of the PBO by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. On the committee's behalf, I thank all of those who assisted the committee with its inquiry. I commend the report to the House.

233,Mr TRUSS,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"When the debate was interrupted, I was expressing concern that the government has decided, in the context of the introduction of digital television, to close something over 400 local transmitters. These are often self-help transmitters in small locations and provide television services direct to nearby households. Instead, the government has decided that people who receive their television from these transmitters will in future have to switch from terrestrial TV reception to satellite reception. The government has put in place a satellite subsidy scheme that reimburses eligible households to assist them in the cost of making that change. However, I think that there are still issues associated with the change from receiving television reception from a local transmitter to the new television arrangement that need to be addressed. It is clear that receiving your television from a satellite is a second-best option. There is inconvenience involved and the technology is more complicated. Particularly elderly people or those who are not able to readily deal with some of the technology issues will face difficulties. I am aware that the government is proposing to offer people in-house assistance to help them understand the new technology, but I think we all know from dealing with parents and grandparents that they find these sorts of changes very difficult to manage. In addition, if you have multiple televisions in a house or you have televisions in different buildings, you are required to have much more expensive connections. The government is only offering to subsidise the initial set-top box. If that is lost or a tenant takes it to another place, the owner will be obliged to pay the future cost of those sorts of changeovers. In reality it would be far better to keep operating as many of these transmitters as possible. In fact, for a relatively small investment out of the billions of dollars the government expects to make from the sale of the spectrum, it would be fair to help those who would actually pay the price. Those people have to give up analog television reception, which most of them are quite happy with, so that the government can sell off the spectrum, so surely they are entitled to be treated fairly and the government should go the extra mile to make sure that they receive a reasonable signal. There are a number of other issues with getting your television reception from a satellite. Instead of getting local programs, you get programs that have been generically prepared in a faraway place to cover, in some cases, several states. So you no longer get local television advertisements, local information or programs that are particularly relevant to your needs, and there will be time change differences because of the inability of the satellite system to deal with various time zones. From those perspectives satellite reception is clearly inferior. The government has made an effort with its plans to develop a news channel so that regional news services can be transmitted in a local format. That is welcome, although there still seems to be quite some confusion about how that is actually going to happen. Even then, people will not get the news precisely at the right time; it will be replayed sometime later in the evening, either sequentially or simultaneously, so people will have to go through a somewhat more complicated system of programming to see their local news. Every effort should be made to have the maximum possible number of people receiving their television in the traditional way rather than having to transfer to satellite. There are already quite a number of Australians in rural and remote areas who do get their television by satellite. For those people the new satellite will be an improvement, and it will be welcome from that perspective. However, there are scores of country communities and councils, particularly in states such as Queensland, that operate these local retransmission facilities via the satellite service and would like to continue operating them. At this stage, the government has not been willing to accept that option. The local communities would like to pool the subsidies that are available so that they can retransmit. I appreciate, and I again acknowledge, that over recent times there has been some willingness on the part of the government to consider this option. I accept that there are technical issues, but, if the trial-which I understand is to be held quite soon-of the use of some technology that will enable this retransmission is successful, then I hope the government will see the good sense in allowing this retransmission to occur at the local levels so that we can retain the local transmitters which were to be closed down by the government under these new arrangements. There does need to be an acceptance that the conversion of the self-help transmitters should happen wherever possible. That is particularly important for business and motels and places like that where there are going to be multiple connections, and it is particularly important for the elderly or others in the community who battle with having to deal with the more complex technology. It is obvious that the digital signal offers some advantages. Where the signal is available clearly and soundly it offers more choice, better picture quality and better sound quality. But we all know that the digital signal also has some disadvantages. Its range is potentially smaller. There are going to be some people who now get perfectly good analog television reception who will not be able to receive digital. There may be some other people who, fortuitously, will receive a better signal-I acknowledge that-but I think that all of the technical perts say that more people will miss out than are likely to see new benefits. In reality, in examining these sorts of issues, we need to make sure that we do what we can to limit the obstacles to people's enjoyment of television. In addition, the digital signal is more likely to be affected by adverse weather conditions and, of course, it pixelates and breaks up whenever there are problems with the signal. Those are issues that I think are very important and that people want answers about. In my own electorate, the analog signal is scheduled to be turned off in half of the electorate in a few months time and in the rest of the electorate in 2013. I appreciate that that is a problem of the electoral boundaries more than it is for those choosing to turn off the signal, but in the city of Gympie, for example, a part of the city will be turned off in 2011 and the balance turned off in 2013. That is going to create some difficulties on the ground. It has been enormously difficult for me as a local member to get accurate and reliable information about what is actually happening in my own electorate. There have been advertisements in the newspapers, which I have read carefully. There are help numbers that you can call. I have called them, and the people have been helpful, but they have not been able to provide answers to most of the questions I have asked. So there was real concern that we are near to a close-down date-in fact, until a few weeks ago I thought that the closedown date might be as soon as 1 July; in other words, only two or three months away-and yet there was no information available to people to help them with the transfer. I am pleased to say that over the last few weeks the minister's office has been much more constructive in trying to provide us with the information we need. Previously, I wrote letters to him over many months and ex- got back replies that provided no useful information. I studied his answers to questions in the Senate estimates and found that his answers from various times seemed to conflict with each other. So I welcome the new and more cooperative approach that we are receiving from the minister's office and hope that thereby we can work through some of those local problems. I now know, for instance, that it seems that the close-down in the majority my electorate will not happen until December this year, so that give us a little bit more time to work through the issues. I have been struggling to find out what was going to be the source of the programming for the satellite service, which is actually up there and has been operating since December last year, but nobody could tell us which programs were coming from it. We are still battling to get some information about where these programs are going to be sourced from in the future. But if there can be a spirit of cooperation-and I particularly acknowledge the assistance that we are receiving from Emma Dawson, who seems to understand these issues and has been prepared to deal with them in a constructive way-we may well be able to work through them. From discussing these matters with my colleague the member for Forrest, I am aware that the changeover in western Victoria has gone better than expected. An enormous amount of effort went into it and not all the problems are resolved, but essentially, particularly towards the end, the changeover went reasonably smoothly. I hope that that same level of commitment can be provided in other areas, bearing in mind that western Victoria is comparatively flat countryside. When you move into parts of Queensland, like my own electorate, which are very hilly there are going to be many more complications. It is important that the government offer a fair deal to all those involved. This legislation will improve the access to the VAST satellite system for some people, and that is a step forward, but there will need to be a better information program available. There will need to be real help for those who are going to be disadvantaged. The public did not ask for this and did not want it. I think they are starting to enjoy the fact that there are extra channels, and they will appreciate the quality, but there is a lot to go through and there will need to be a strong spirit of cooperation if in fact this transition to digital is to smoothly and without further difficulties.",154
234,Mr FLETCHER,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (6.31 pm)I am pleased to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011, a bill which is critical to the future of broadcasting in Australia but also critical to the future of wireless broadband. The reason for that is that the bill essentially does two things. First of all, it amends the regulatory framework for free-to-air digital television services and the switchover to digital-only television. Secondly, it introduces measures which implement the restack of digital television channels so as to free up a block of continuous spectrum which can be auctioned for future use, most likely for the delivery of LTE-long-term evolution-or fourthgeneration wireless broadband services. So it is a bill which is of considerable importance. Unfortunately, this government has form in rushing through legislation in this area without allowing the proper opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. That was what was done with the predecessor to this bill in 2010: the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010. Key elements of the policy scheme in that bill were simply dropped and replaced with a direction from the minister to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and that was an unfortunate thing. I want to make three key points about this bill in the time available to me tonight. The first is to ask: what does this bill say about the attitudes of this government to wireless as a medium for the delivery of broadband services? Secondly, what assurances are there, I believe it is appropriate to ask, about the way in which the spectrum allocation process will be conducted in respect of this spectrum once the restack has occurred? Thirdly, what are the implications of policy in this area for the transition to digital broadhappen casting in rural and remote Australia? Let me turn to the first area that I wish to address. What does this government believe about the importance of wireless as a medium for delivering broadband services? The premise underlying this bill-and it is a premise that on this side of the House we acknowledge and support-is that to realise a material block of spectrum here for reallocation for the purposes of delivering wireless broadband in the future is of very high importance. At the moment the problem is that the blocks of spectrum that will be freed up once analog television ceases operating are not contiguous. They are spread in quite a disparate way. So what will need to happen is that those blocks will be restacked-that is, all of the frequencies used for digital television broadcasting will be brought together, and that will free up a large block of spectrum in the 700-megahertz band. That is a necessary step to take if the utility and value of the spectrum for other purposes, particularly wireless broadband, are to be maximised. Most commentators in this area sayagain, it is a proposition that those of us on this side of the House accept-that wireless and fibre or wireless and fixed have important complementary roles when it comes to the provision of broadband services. But what is puzzling is the conflicted attitude of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, to the use of wireless for the delivery of broadband services. Consider, for example, what Senator Conroy had to say about OPEL, the network which was going to deliver wireless broadband services under the Howard government's Broadband Connect program in a contract announced in mid2007. Senator Conroy described OPEL as a ‘dog of a product'. This is using, I might say, the same technology at the same speed-12 megabits per second-as is now part of the National Broadband Network between the 93rd and the 97th percentiles. Senator Conroy in an interview on the 7.30 Report in 2007 had this to say about the OPEL network: If you pick up your cordless phone while you're using your Internet, your line can drop out. If you use your microwave, your line will drop out. It was a fear campaign about the use of wireless to deliver broadband. I reiterate that it is the same wireless, the same technology and the same speed as is now embodied within the National Broadband Network proposal to deliver broadband using wireless between the 93rd and 97th percentiles. But if we go to what the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, had to say in 2007, it is even more interesting. On 19 June 2007 Mr Rudd said: ‘People in regional and rural areas deserve every bit as good a service as those in the big cities. Our fibreoptic-to-the-node plan will offer high-speed broadband to 98 per cent of Australians regardless of where they live. When you look at some of the technical deficiencies in wireless and problems in terms of being able to access speeds of 12 megabits per second using wireless then we believe we have hit upon the right technology.' It is a technology which they have subsequently abandoned. There is a real contradiction here. On the one hand we have these criticisms of wireless made for political purposes by the current minister, Senator Conroy, and the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, and yet at the same time we have a bill which is proposing complex arrangements to restack the spectrum in the 700 megahertz band so as to free it up for an auction of spectrum which is very likely to be used for the delivery of wireless broadband technologies. Senator Conroy has continued to run this line, even quite recently, about the deficiencies of wireless. What did he say on 10 August 2010 in relation to the coalition's policy on the use of wireless as a component for the delivery of broadband? He said that this ignored the advice of industry experts and that: It will consign Australia to the digital dark ages. Apparently in the eyes of Senator Conroy wireless is a deficient technology for the delivery of broadband. Indeed, in an interview on 18 August 2010 he described the coalition's policy as one that would ‘condemn Australians to a wireless network'. We have a deeply conflicted minister and a deeply conflicted government who on the one hand, with this bill, are going through a complex process to restack the spectrum so that it can be auctioned in the expectation of earning several billion dollars because the spectrum will be acquired by mobile telephony operators and others who will use it to deliver fourth-generation, or long-term evolution, wireless broadband while on the other hand they, especially Senator Conroy, are relentlessly criticising wireless as a technology. Senator Conroy just keeps doing it; he just cannot stop himself. It is like some kind of Pavlovian response-mention wireless and there is Conroy jumping up with a criticism. What did he say in Senate estimates on 19 October 2010? Let me be really clear about this; you cannot monitor somebody 24/7, every second, on an existing fixed wireless network … In other words, on one hand there is nothing but criticism of wireless as a technology from Senator Conroy but on the other hand there is a bill which is premised on the importance of wireless. Let us be clear and erate that the truth is: wireless is a very portant component of the delivery of broadband in the future, as is fixed technology including, in an appropriate way, fibre. There is no contention about the importance of fibre. I need hardly remind the House the contention is about the appropriate ownership structure, the appropriate reach of fibre and whether you need to spend $5,000 per premises to deliver fibre to the home, as is the policy of this government. Let me turn to my second point I want to highlight, which again relates to the National Broadband Network and its implications for the legislative scheme we are considering. We have seen that the tail has wagged the dog when it comes to broadband policy in this country. The tail of trying to make National Broadband Network Company's business plan as credible as possible has wagged the dog of good telecommunications policy. Already this government has fallen prey to temptation. It has fallen prey to temptation impose legislative restrictions on the capacities of companies other than NBN Co. to compete in the delivery of broadband. We have seen this in the so-called cherrypicking provisions. Let us be clear: cherry picking is a notorious code phrase regularly used by monopolists as really meaning ‘we want a free kick'. It is the phrase that Telstra, as this country's dominant incumbent monopoly in telecommunications, used for many years, and now we have NBN Co. using exactly the same language. There is a real danger that this government will fall prey to temptation when it comes to auctioning off the spectrum which is being rationalised and restacked under this legislation. There is a real danger that this government's desire to protect the National Broadband Network Co. to maximise that company's business prospects will affect the way this government thinks about the auction of this reitspectrum. I simply highlight here the risk imthat this government may fall prey to the temptation of trying, in whatever ways it can, to nobble the capacity of competitors using the auctioned spectrum to be effective competitors with the National Broadband Network Company. A way in which this government could do that is by rigging the rules of the auction. I simply highlight that risk. My third point in the brief time that remains available to me is that there are serious concerns about the way in which this government has dealt with the transition to digital as a means of providing continued service in television to people in rural and regional Australia. Of course the transition to digital is inevitable and indeed it is desirable, but it is important that it be managed in an appropriate way to provide continuity of service. For example, it is important that the VAST satellite service should be seen as a safety net rather than as a standard means of delivery of service to hundreds of thousands to of households. That is an import concern that those of us on this side of the House have about this bill. This is a bill which reveals a sharp contradiction in the attitudes of this government about wireless broadband spectrum. I highlight the concern that there is a risk that government will fall prey to the temptation to rig this auction in a way that will undermine competition to the National Broadband Network Company. I also highlight the importance of maximising the delivery of continued service to rural and regional Australia.",157
235,Mr MATHESON,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 covers many details and measures. However, I would like to focus my attention on the proposed auction of the 694through to 820-megahertz frequencies of the radio spectrum, known as the digital dividend, when our nation switches from analog to digital television. The auctioning of this 126 megahertz will deliver a revenue windfall to the Treasury. This spectrum will no doubt be highly sought after by mobile telecommunications and internet corporations, as this particular spectrum is ideal for carrying large amounts of data at very high speed over long distances and has the ability to penetrate buildings and other structures. Because of these unique features, this part of the radio spectrum would also be invaluable to the police and emergency services to safeguard public safety, particularly during emergencies and critical incidents when other communications systems are congested or break down. I strongly believe it is necessary for measures to be included in this bill to ensure that part of the spectrum will be made available to police and emergency services in times of emergency. The peak bodies of Australia's police, firefighting, ambulance and other emergency services have requested 20 megahertz of the spectrum to be reserved for these disaster situations. The use of this spectrum represents some amazing opportunities for frontline emergency services and could revolutionise the way these services operate. this Mr Deputy Speaker, I bring to your attention a fact sheet that was sent to all MPs and senators by the Police Federation of Australia. In this fact sheet they have raised a number of concerns and made comments in relation to reserving part of this spectrum for emergency services personnel. This updates our February alert that the police and emergency services need the spectrum in the 700megahertz band for digital dividend for public safety. I will read some quotes from the fact sheet: All of Australia's Police Commissioners met on 11 March to reaffirm the need for 20 MHz of the available 126 MHzwhich equates to about 16 per cent. The fact sheet continues: They are supporting the Attorney-General's proposal to reserve spectrum for these ‘mission critical' purposes. Australia's fire authorities and ambulance services are also united behind this proposal. COAG has agreed that all these emergency services must have seamless, secure and robust communication systems. It's called interoperability. The major telcos, like Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, will be bidding for the spectrum at auction. On behalf of these big three telcos, a misinformation campaign is being run by the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA). To set the record straight, Motorola-a company with the technical expertise to know what's what-agrees that our public safety organisations need part of the 700 MHz band ‘for dealing with crisis situations'. Motorola said ‘Australia risked mortgaging its future if emergency services were unable to obtain some of this spectrum'; it ‘is critical to the future of emergency services users'. Motorola also refutes the claim that other bands like 400 MHz or 800 MHz would do the job for police and emergency services. And they debunk the argument that Australia would be out of step with the Asia Pacific regional plan. Congestion on telco networks is a serious problem during emergencies. Their communications systems are not designed and built to ‘importance level 1' which public safety agencies build to. And if any telco forced to provide a service to police, was foreign owned, national security could be compromised. Finally, police and emergency services have never said they should get spectrum for $0. State and Territory police spend millions of dollars now their stand alone communications networks. Any charge applying to public safety agencies should take into account their non-commercial use of spectrum for public safety purposes as per the Radiocommunications Act 1992. We also understand an Access Economics report for A-G's says that if 20 MHz is reserved, the revenue raised at auction may not fall. The trum is rare and valuable and may become more so. The Police Federation of Australia are surely an agency that we should all be listening to. This is an issue of national significance, and I hope the minister is listening. We can only assume that the sale of the digital dividend is being used for promotional purposes, probably to try to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13.",160
236,Mr TEHAN,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"In rising to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011, I raise serious concerns about the digital switch-over in south-west Victoria which is due to take place in early May. Like many other government programs that we are bearing witness to in south-west Victoria, this one looks as if it is going to be another rolled-gold disaster. It seems quite clear that the people are not ready and the groundwork has not been done. The shadow minister for communications has written to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy on this, and his reply makes no sense. So tonight I am calling for the digital switch-over in south-west Victoria to be postponed so more work can be done with local communities and residents to get them ready for the so-called digital switch-over, which-let us be honest and call a spade a spade-is the analog switch-off. That is what it is. It is people having their analog TVs turned off. Those people need to be prepared so that they can move to digital-and they are not. on Let me read an email that I have received: Dear Mr Tehan, I am writing to you for some assistance in the matter of such poor reception in the Cobden area. We feel disadvantaged in this, as most towns seem to have better reception than us. We are seeing texts to the editor in the local papers about problems with pixilation. Many TV viewers bespectween Terang and the southern coast have been experiencing pixilation on TV signals. We also have issues regarding upgrading of antenna systems. It seems that when you switch to digital, if you need to upgrade your antenna system and you are a pensioner or a gold card holder, you will not get assistance. These problems and many more need to be addressed before the so-called digital switchover or-let us call a spade a spade-the analog switch-off takes place. This is going to impact people in my electorate. They already have poor mobile telecommunications reception and now they are going to have poor TV reception. They are going to be left with a double-whammy. This government is failing to listen and is failing to take account of this extremely serious problem. The digital switch-over in south-west Victoria needs to be postponed. More effort needs to be made to make sure that people, especially those who are less well off, are in a position to be able to deal with the digital transfer, with the analog TV being turned off.",161
237,Mr ALBANESE,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (6.52 pm)in reply-I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. After its introduction on 24 February the bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry. The committee tabled their report in the Senate on 22 March and recommended that the bill be passed. The bill introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 that are crucial to effectively implement the restack of digital television channels needed to realise the digital dividend. On 24 June the government announced that 126 megahertz of broadcasting spectrum would be released as a digital dividend, resulting from the switch-off of analog television services. The switch to digital-only television will be completed in Australia by 31 December 2013, releasing the channels used for analog television. The digital dividend will be released as a contiguous block of spectrum in the ultra high frequency, or UHF, band. The UHF spectrum currently used for broadcasting services is highly valued for delivering wireless communication services, including superfast mobile broadband. The government aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012. In order to release this highly valued spectrum, digital broadcasting services will need to be relocated or restacked out of the digital dividend spectrum and organised more efficiently within the remaining spectrum. The government intends that the digital dividend spectrum be cleared by 31 December 2014. While ACMA has some scope under its existing powers to commence digital channel restack planning, the bill will give it more flexible planning powers and allow the restack of digital television channels to occur in a timely and efficient manner. The proposed amendments will also improve the regulatory framework for digital switch-over and the delivery of both terrestrial and satellite free-to-air digital television services. During the Senate committee's inquiry into the bill some submitters raised concerns that the bill favoured satellite conversion over terrestrial conversion. The government recognises that both terrestrial infrastructure and a satellite service are required to provide all Australians with access to the full range of digital television services. Government policy does not advocate a preferred method of digital television reception. The bill will amend the conditional access scheme to provide commercial broadcasters in remote Western Australia with the opportunity to roll out their terrestrial digital television services before viewers they intend to serve can access the VAST service. This will protect the integrity of the larger terrestrial television markets in remote Western Australia and avoid the need for viewers to purchase satellite reception equipment unnecessarily. The bill will also allow viewers access to the VAST service after a specified time following switch-over in their licence area where VAST provides a superior number of commercial digital television services, including digital multichannels, than are otherwise available terrestrially in their area. These provisions will provide the commercial broadcasters with the incentive to roll out all of their terrestrial digital television services before viewers in the area receive automatic access to VAST. Although commercial and national broadcasters can apply to the minister for exemption from converting terrestrial digital transmission sites under very limited circumstances, it is important to note that this exemption is not automatic. It is within the minister's discretion, having regard to the statutory criteria outlined in the bill, a broadcaster an exemption. An exemption cannot be granted where a service has already commenced transmitting in digital. These provisions are intended to, amongst other things, minimise situations where consumers need to purchase both satellite and terrestrial reception equipment to receive the full suite of digital television channels. This bill will progress the government's digital television switch-over program and will help realise the digital dividend, bringing significant social and economic benefits to all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",162
238,Mr ALBANESE,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (6.57 pm)by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. I thank the opposition for their cooperation. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA,163
239,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (6.58 pm)I move: That the House do now adjourn. SS Yongala,163
240,Mr EWEN JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening, on 23 March 2011, to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the passenger ship SS Yongala. Its name means ‘good water' in the Nadjuri language of South Australia. It is named after the town in South Australia. It was on the ship's 99th voyage from Melbourne to Cairns and all ports in between on 23 March 1911 when the Yongala steamed out of Mackay. By 26 March it still had not arrived in Townsville. to grant It was reported missing on 26 March. The SS Yongala sank off Cape Bowling Green, about 85 kilometres south-east of Townsville, on 23 March 1911. She sailed into a cyclone and was sunk. All 122 people on board perished in what is still considered to be one of the most tragic incidences in Australian maritime history. The only body ever found was that of the racehorse Moonshine, which was washed up not far from Townsville. In 1958, two skindivers from Townsville located the wreck and brought to the surface a steel safe which was found in the cabin. It was upon researching the safe's serial number that it was confirmed that the wreck was indeed the Yongala. In 1980 the wreck was declared an historic shipwreck and is now afforded some legal protection against looting and illicit salvage of any items still on board the wreck. Australia's leading underwater filmmakers, Ron and Valerie Taylor, say that they have dived on wrecks all over the world but the Yongala is ‘by far the best'. The SS Yongala is today a major tourist attraction for the scuba diving industry in Townsville and is widely recognised as one of the top 10 dives in the world. More than 10,000 divers every year travel to Townsville to dive this wreck. It is on the bucket list of every serious diver in the world. At over 100 metres long, she is one of the largest, most intact historic shipwrecks. That shipwreck now has established an artificial reef that provides a structural complex habitat for a diverse range of marine life. At 10 am today in Townsville there was a memorial service at the Maritime Museum of Townsville. On Saturday night in Townsville there will be a tribute dinner at the historic Yongala Lodge in Fryer Street in North Ward, which will be attended by 14 members of the Rooney family. The Yongala Lodge was built in 1884 as a private residence whose original owner was Mr Matthew Rooney. There will be lots of things going on that dinner including a charity auction at which I will be the auctioneer. Tragically, Matthew Rooney, his wife and daughter perished when then SS Yongala sank in 1911, thereby forever linking the lodge with this historic maritime disaster. As with all disasters, there is always that funny or quirky little story. The Earl family from Cairns, who sent their family south to Brisbane to escape as the wet season, could not find accommodation in Brisbane and were booked to come home on the Yongala. They would have died on the wreck if it had not been for that last-minute finding of a home to rent in Brisbane. They stayed in Brisbane and survived. Today in Cairns there is a suburb called Earlville, named after the family. If they had been able to get on that boat, future generations of the Earl, Harris, Fallon, Howey, Nelson, White and Curtis families would never have known life. In another lovely little story, in the Harris family someone was sick and unable to get on the boat. We do not know how true that one is but, as with all stories, the further you away from the original incident the truer they become-look at my rugby career! It is a very special day in Townsville. The Yongala is a very special place. We need to back the North Queensland tourism industry, and I would urge anyone out there who is a serious diver and has a current ticket to get to to fix it Townsville, dive the Yongala and spend a tonne of money in my city. Organ Donation",163
241,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise on this occasion to speak about the importance of organ donation. Recently, Australians celebrated DonateLife week, which aims to highlight the importance of organ donation and speaking to your family about your wishes. It should not only be during DonateLife week that we discuss organ donation. This is something that we should continually be thinking about. Forty per cent of Australians do not know the wishes of their loved ones when it comes to organ donation. I feel it is a discussion all families should be having. As part of the national reform package for organ and tissue donation, the family of every potential donor will be asked to give their consent to donation if the situation arises. The request will be made by trained health professionals. Even if you have registered your wish to be a donor, your family will still be asked to give consent. The most important thing people want to know in order to make a decision about a family member becoming a donor is the wishes of the deceased. Organ donation can be a sensitive subject, but I urge you to speak up. In 2010, 309 organ donors gave 931 Australians a new chance at life. One organ and tissue donor can save the lives of up to 10 people and significantly improve the lives of dozens more. Australia has a world-class reputation for successful transplant outcomes get but has one of the lowest donation rates in the developed world. As a nation, we can do better. Around 1,700 people are on Australian organ transplant waiting lists at any one time. On average, people on the transplant list must wait between six months and four years. This year, we should make it a priority If you are struggling with making the decision of whether or not to be an organ donor, I suggest you take some time to read some of the stories from the DonateLife Book of Life, available on the website. A story that I was particularly struck by was the story of Michael. Michael died when he was 32 and his organs helped six people with life-saving transplants. I quote from the Book of Life: Michael was very healthy and active in the Surf Lifesaving movement and a member of the Palm Beach Surf Club since he left school. He loved to surf. He enjoyed country music, writing songs and he played in a band that was gaining recognition, winning a Tiara Country Music Award. At the time of his death Michael was nominated for a Golden Guitar Award. He made frequent visits to Tamworth, and one night he crashed into a tree on his way to Tamworth to visit his girlfriend giving a performance nearby. We were told that with the head injuries he sustained meant that he wasn't going to make it. He had discussed organ donation as a family and Michael knew he wanted to be an organ donor. Michael's loving and generous spirit spread with a generous legacy of organ donation helped save and transform the lives of six people. As you can see, one donor can save the lives of many. I am sure the families of those six recipients are eternally grateful for Michael's sacrifice. The book is filled with stories such as this. One organ donor was a mere 15-month-old. It takes great courage for a family to make a decision like this but they can and they can rest assured there are real, life-changing benefits from their decision. I am pleased to say that in my home state of Tasmania we had the highest rate of organ donation last year. This was a dramatic improvement from the previous year. I urge all of you and all Australians to register, and one day, hopefully, to save the lives of many through your decision. I want to make this very public request to my family that my organs be donated. I trust that will not be soon. Dawson Electorate: Digital Television",164
242,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to highlight issues relating to the digital television switch-over in my electorate of Dawson. The residents of Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay in the Whitsundays are justifiably upset at the fact that they feel they have been effectively left out of the switch-over. These residents need access to the same local television broadcast that exists in other communities within Mackay and the Whitsundays-a service that could perhaps have been provided with the funds wasted on television advertising to before promote digital television. I have been told by the office of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy that it may be beyond the laws of physics for a local transmission to be made available to Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay. However, locals involved in the television antenna industry believe differently. I have put a question on notice to the minister representing the communications minister in this chamber, asking them to detail why it is not physically possible. I suppose that only then will I be satisfied that it is not just an excuse to avoid spending dollars to get equality in television reception for these residents. Access to local television goes far beyond watching Neighbours of an evening or watching question time on the ABC. Queenslanders are very aware of what an emergency information broadcast for a cyclone sounds like, and particularly North Queenslanders. We now have satellite, radar and a world of weather monitoring technology, but it is of no consequence if the local television emergency broadcast-that last link in the chain-is missing. It is appropriate that I have the opportunity to address the House today because, as the member for Herbert outlined so eloquently before, exactly 100 years ago on this very day a similar scenario cost the lives of 122 people off the North Queensland coast. On 23 March 1911 the SS Yongala steamed out of Mackay, bound for Townsville. As the Yongala headed into the Coral Sea, a telegram to warn of a cyclone between Mackay and Townsville was received at the Flat Top Island signal station, just off Mackay. It was a fraction too late; when wireless technology was uncommon, the final link in the cyclone warning chain failed. The Yongala steamed on to its demise and, as was outlined before, there were no survivors. We have come a long way in 100 years, but if we fail to keep that last link in the chain the consequences can be as drastic as they were for the Yongala. The switch-over to digital television will also send business to an early demise. In my electorate, Hydeaway Bay Caravan Park owner, Roz Willcocks, knows that when analog television closes shop she will probably have to do the same thing. The cheapest of the two options that have been put to her in the switch-over will cost the business $25,000 plus a large labour bill. The other option put to her had a starting cost of $100,000, and Mrs Wilcox told me that she stopped reading at that point. For loss of television signal to close down this business is a sad reflection on how this government does not care for small business. For Roz Willcocks and her husband, both in their 50s, this is more than the loss of a business. It is the loss of a livelihood and a lifestyle. Offering a part subsidy for residenwalls tial premises is an insult, but to snub small business altogether is offensive. When I appeared on the local television news in Mackay seeking community feedback on digital reception, the staff in my electorate office were ready to string me up and beat me like a pinata. There was an avalanche of complaints that range from very poor signals with constant interruptions to no signal at all. I hope that when Regional Broadcasting Australia appoints a local coordinator for the Mackay region and the Dawson area they will address each and every one of those concerns, because unless I am satisfied that all that can be done is going to be done to ensure there is a reliable local digital television transmission that is going to get to all of the residents in the Dawson electorate who can physically receive such a transmission, then I am afraid I cannot support the switch-over to digital this year. Queensland Floods  is now around three months since the tragic floods ripped through my electorate, damaging or destroying 4,200 homes and, unfortunately, more than 1,000 businesses. Some of those were quite significant businesses, employing up to 3,000 people. Whilst I have seen the devastation of Japan and Christchurch-and I am thankful I do not represent an electorate in those areas-nevertheless it is still quite devastating to go around my electorate and see the damage that occurred. Three months on, most people are still waiting for their houses to dry out and for the rebuilding to begin. You can still drive down the streets and see straight through houses where things have been ripped out and where they are just waiting for the insurance to kick in or not. For many of these people the novelty of staying at another family's house or in a friend's garage or living in a house without and floor coverings or in a caravan out the back or parked out the front is wearing very thin. Many are still waiting for insurers to finalise their assessments, and many of my constituents are dealing with the news that they have received from their insurer that they are on their own. Insurance companies like NRMA, Alliance and CGU, to name but three that have been particularly brought to my attention by my constituents, have left too many of their loyal long-time policyholders out to dry. Imagine what it is like after you have been paying insurance premiums religiously-for many people for decades, especially since the 1974 floods when people took out flood insurance-to be told by your insurer that you have been abandoned just when you needed help the most. Most of us do not have much left over after we pay the mortgage, the utilities and other household expenses, so imagine what it is like if you have been flooded. You still have to pay your mortgage, and some people, unfortunately, still have to pay their rent. You also have to find money to rebuild your house and somehow find money to pay rent for your family if you are living in alternative accommodation rather than at a friend's house. This is next to impossible; impossible for these people who have been devastated to get ahead or to get their head above water, so to speak-a horrible metaphor. Insurance companies must get on with the assessments and support the rebuilding as quickly as possible. I want to particularly single out NRMA, which was very, very quick to engage its expert hydrologists and issue the reports to claimants accompanied by the rejection letter that many of my constituents received. It was little comfort for the flood victims to find that they would not be covered because of the hydrologists' assessment of the type of water that occurred. If you live in Queensland you would see the NRMA as. They often have a couple of Broncos-which is a Brisbane rugby league side. NRMA is a New South Wales company that is trying to make inroads into Queensland and uses the Broncos in its advertisements. You need to do a little more than just put on a couple of Broncos jerseys to show loyalty to Queensland, I would suggest. It is no wonder that many of my constituents who are flood victims are fed up and furious with these insurers. For those people who had no expectation of insurance, thankfully there is the Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal to assist them, and often the kindness of strangers. I have mentioned previously in the House some of the wonderful organisations that have actually given to cash people-like Buddhist and tai chi organisations and quite a few others. But for those who were bedazzled by the fine print in their insurance document and have found themselves without cover, it is time for these insurers like NRMA, Allianz and CGU to show some heart and pay up. To be fair, there are some insurance companies that have not deserted their policy holders. I will mention two companies, Suncorp and Westpac, which, it has been reported back to me by my constituents, have done the right thing. In fact, I spoke to a bloke today who was flooded who described Westpac as ‘absolutely brilliant'. So I will give some praise where it is due. We have seen great examples of cooperation and goodwill from some insurers, but we have also seen some disgraceful behaviour. As a lawyer, I understand that they have to look at the contract. But there are certainly some pretty sharp practices going on out there, especially when I see the heartache of people who were flooded in 1974 and flooded again out in 2011. Many of them are absolutely heartbroken. I welcome the support we have received from Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten. He is doing some great work. I think he will be in Ipswich early in April-and I look forward to the insurance companies turning up. I welcome the review that he has announced into the insurance industry and look forward to a standard definition of ‘flood' so that people do not get caught out in the future. (Time expired) Rural Medical Workforce",165
243,Mr CHESTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to urge the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister to listen to the concerns of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, which continues to highlight the very real crisis in the rural medical workforce. This week I, along with other members in this place, met with representatives from the Rural Doctors Association and discussed a range of policy initiatives that are required to provide regional communities with a fairer and more equitable health service. I believe the discussions that we had today at the breakfast hosted by the RDAA were very useful and allowed for a good exchange of ideas between the medical professionals who are at the coalface in terms of the delivery of health services in our rural and regional communities and members of this place who took the opportunity to talk with the doctors-many of whom have many decades of experience. In fact, one of the big problems is that we have an ageing medical workforce in regional communities and there is a need for a succession plan to encourage younger health professionals to set up practice in our regional communities. It is a chalthose lenge not only faced by this government but also faced by previous governments. It is a very significant issue right across regional Australia. The Nationals believe that regional health deserves a higher profile in the overall health policy of government. When health policies are being made, we believe there should there be a dedicated regional health minister in the cabinet to stand up and fight for country communities. We also believe there needs to be an overhaul of the regional incentive programs to attract and retain health professionals in rural and regional communities. The current system of using the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Area simply does not work for many of our regional towns. The system has created some quite unusual anomalies where small regional towns like Sale and Yarram in my electorate are placed in the same category as some of the outer suburban areas for the purpose of calculating any financial compensation or incentives for doctors. I believe there needs to be a better targeted system of payments which rewards doctors and other health professionals who move to some of the more difficult to service areas and then choose to stay there. If we are serious about attracting and then retaining doctors in these communities, particularly Australian trained doctors, in rural practice, we need to provide better incentives among a range of other measures which add to their whole experience of living and working in a regional community. We also need to make sure that we are providing opportunities for students from regional communities to actually achieve the marks to go on to study medicine. It has been proven over many, many studies that students who have some origins in a regional community are more likely to come back and practise in communities in the future. It is a very important issue, and I am sure other regional members on both sides of the House are well and truly aware of the fact that we do have a crisis in the rural medical workforce. These views are consistent with the Rural Doctors Association of Australia and its plans to improve access to health services in regional Australia. I refer to the RDAA budget submission to the Treasurer, where the organisation highlights the concerns it has with current policies and emphasises the need for decisive action to overcome the current crisis. In his letter to the Treasurer, the president of the RDAA, Dr Paul Mara, referred to areas where ‘the current policy framework is failing to meet the needs of rural and remote communities', and he says: This need is reflected in the health status of people in these communities, the considerable underspend in Medicare in comparison to metropolitan areas, ongoing difficulty in attracting doctors and other health workers to these communities. In his submission, Dr Mara says: If we are to improve the much poorer health outcomes in rural and remote communities, we must build a sustainable rural medical workforce and viable practices that can support better access to primary health care/ general practice and local secondary (hospital) services. The key elements of sustainability are: (i) Professional issues including training, skills and qualifications of doctors and local professional supports to enable doctors and their families to have adequate leave for study and recreation; That is a key issue in making sure that the experience for a doctor in a regional and rural location is a positive one-that they are not forced to work ridiculous hours and always be on call but that they actually have a quality of life in our regional communities. The other key elements of sustainability for our regional workforce were: (ii) Structural issues including practice infrastructure and business structures that support private investment in health to complement public investment; and (iii) Ensuring that the higher level skills, commitment and responsibility of rural practice is adequately reflected in the economics of practiceso that they can get a good return from their business. I agree with Dr Mara. Regional Australia makes an enormous contribution to the wealth and prosperity of our nation, and regional people deserve a better deal with it comes to health services. Investment in rural health is not just an investment in doctors or even the health of individuals; it really is an investment in the health of our entire economy. Holi Festival",168
244,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about a very noteworthy event that I attended in the vicinity of my electorate of Holt. It was my great honour to participate in the annual the Holi festival last Saturday at the Shri Shiva Vishnu Temple in Carrum Downs. I celebrated this event with many members of parliament, including the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian parliament, Daniel Andrews. All of us were struck by the beauty of the temple, which is surely one of the most beautiful and ornate places of worship in Australia. The Holi festival is an ancient festival which celebrates the victory of good over evil with the help of the divine. It also celebrates the triumph of devotion. These are universal ideals that are especially relevant in light of the many natural disasters the world has suffered over the past few months. I think it is useful for all of us, regardless of our religious background, to strengthen our faith and renew our commitment to each other. What I experienced everywhere around me on that day was the faith and commitment of the Hindu community and the rich traditions on display: the burning of sandlewood and the bright colours on people's faces and clothing, placed there with laughter and with love, are just some of the traditions that were celebrated and revered. I believe that celebrations like this enhance us all. One of the great triumphs of the Australian experience is to allow people from every corner of the earth to make this place their home, to share their cultures with their fellow Australians and to do so in an atmosphere of mutual respect and shared understanding. That belief was reinforced for me by many from the non-Hindu community who also attended the event and revelled in it, sharing the experience in a spirit of happiand ness, understanding, mutual respect and shared commitment-values which make this country the best place on earth to establish and build a future, regardless of race, colour or creed. The Shri Shiva Vishnu Temple in Carrum Downs, where the Holi festival took place last Saturday, is one of the biggest traditional Hindu temples in the southern hemisphere and it has existed since 1994. The temple runs Hinduism classes, encourages the use of the HSV library, organises religious and spiritual lectures and workshops, and, importantly for the community, hosts events that recognise significant important Hindu festivals such as the Holi festival. The temple has its place among major temples all over the world. The vision, the dedication, the courage and the spirit of the Hindu community of Victoria gave the people of Victoria a priceless and everlasting legacy in the form of this truly magnificent temple. It is shared with the rest of the community and is accessible to the rest of the community, and it is meant to be so. This unique temple transcends time barriers to remain an icon symbolising the contribution of the Hindu community to the Australian community as a whole. Mention of the temple would be imperfect without the mention of hundreds of volunteers who sacrificed their time and worked with missionary zeal to create and construct this edifice. I am always pleased to be asked to attend events of this nature, because to me they emphasise what makes Australia a great community. I am proud of and wish to recognise the role played by the Indian, Sri Lankan and other Hindu communities who came to Australia and made it their home. It is often said that when the Catholics came to Australia they built their churches; in building the churches they sunk their roots into the community and made the community their home. This is exactly what is happening with the Hindu community as well as more recently arrived communities. When you look at the temple and you see the spirit of the people who were sharing in that particular festivity, and you see how other people can share their experiences at the same time-and thousands of people attended this event-I think it says a lot about our very unique place in the world and the fact that we can attract people from other parts of the world and make them feel part of our community but also share in our community. I wish to congratulate the committee of management that were involved in organising this event: Mr Vijeyakumar, Dr Anavekar, Mr Thanikasalam, Mr Mahendran, Mr Wickiramasingham and many others involved in organising the Holi festival. We are aware that there have been pushand-pull factors involved in these people coming to this country. But the fact is that everyone that I saw at that event who was sharing their history and their culture was proud to be Australian and proud that the event was making Australia the rich and dynamic culture and country that it is. Suicide Prevention",169
245,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise again tonight to make an urgent plea to the government for the lives of young people in the Dawson electorate. The Mackay region is generally regarded as financially advantaged, and in some ways that is true. The average wage in the Mackay region is above average as a result of good employment prospects in the mining industry. However, those good jobs are enjoyed by only a small section of the community. The region is socially disadvantaged as a result of shift work and fathers, husbands and mothers being away from home-four days on and four days off, or worse. These disadvantages compound other problems to create an unacceptably high suicide rate in Mackay. When researcher Leda Barnett began work on a project in Mackay, the city was in the midst of a suicide cluster. Suicide has a powerful effect on people, and it is not uncommon for family and friends to take their own lives in response. Seven years ago, a group of young people in Mackay were devastated when two of their friends committed suicide only weeks apart. Debbie Guzlowski sat in her living room with grieving friends and decided that enough was enough. They formed the Grapevine Group and have been working on suicide prevention ever since. The group plans to make Mackay the most suicide-safe region in Australia. But they have an uphill battle. According to the National Mental Health Survey, more Australians die from suicide than from motor vehicle accidents-mostly young people, and a high proportion are young Indigenous people. The ‘Reducing youth suicide in Queensland' discussion paper reported that Queensland children and young people suicide at a rate well above the national average. It found that 48 per cent of youth suicides were contagious or imitative, and 28 per cent of children and young people who suicided in Queensland were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders-mostly between the ages of 10 and 14. People who work in the mental health industry tell me that suicide is a bigger issue regional centres than in capital cities, and Mackay has the second-highest suicide rate in the state. But suicide statistics are woefully underreported because single-vehicle accidents, overdoses and other accidents are reported as just that-accidents rather than suicides. The shame of suicide leaves the real facts, the harsh facts, hidden from view. When you consider how much money is spent on awareness and prevention of traffic accidents, you have to ask why we are not taking mental health, which is a much bigger problem, more seriously. This is a problem of life and death, and it is a plague on our modern society. Mackay youth workers are dealing with children as young as seven years old attempting to take their own lives. One example: a 16-year-old Mackay girl was making an attempt on her life on a monthly basis, using measures as drastic as swallowing battery acid. On one such occasion her parents feared for their own safety as well as for their daughter's, and they called the police. The girl was taken in handcuffs to the Mackay Base Hospital and was admitted to the psychiatric ward. The psych ward only has 18 beds and they were all full. She was released just one hour later. There are better solutions out there. Suicide prevention education and early intervention save lives. This has been proved with 30 headspace mental health centres around the nation. But there is no headspace centre in Mackay, where one is so desperately needed. The cost of funding one of these centres is not much in the grand scheme of things and the alternative is simply not acceptable. Tonight I implore the government to allocate the $4 million needed to build a headspace youth mental health centre in Mackay as a matter of urgency. We are here to make decisions and somein times these are indirectly decisions of life and death. This is one of those times, and it is time to get our priorities right. That is what we as elected leaders are here to do. We are not here to legislate for a better life for ourselves; we are here to create a better life for the next generation and for generations to come. A headspace centre in Mackay is not a luxury; it is a necessity. It will save lives and it must be included in the next federal budget. Thank you. Lyons Electorate: Local Festivals",170
246,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak tonight about the communities that I represent and the great festivals that are a great part of the Tasmanian scene, especially at this time of year-the celebration of individuals and activities that go on within different regions of my electorate. Last week I was at the 110th Bream Creek Show. They have a great competition there for the biggest pumpkin; some of them are nearly as big as your chair, Mr Speaker. They certainly celebrate pumpkins in a big way at Bream Creek. Brian Fish was there with his bullock team-I once outpulled his bullock team, which was a great part of history for that show. The week before that, I was at the Fingal Valley festival, where they celebrate coal shovelling, wood chopping and sheep shearing. The world roof bolting championships were also on. This is where miners drill into large blocks of concrete which have been set up with a huge crane. They practice their art and miners come from all over to compete in that competition. It is a great celebration of Australian working people. They also do yard dog trials. There is the veterans bike race, from Fingal to Mathinna and back. That was won by my mate John Watkins this year, and he was a great winner and really appreciated his win. SteamFest at Sheffield, which is overseen by Chris Martin, is a celebration of all things steam-people's involvement with and love of steam-the history of steam engines and things of steam. This year they were to open their new shed with money from the Tasmanian community fund, which will give them great opportunity to do a lot more work on steam engines and on their train. The Longford harvest festival celebrates the harvest of the land, from the farms to the vegie and fruit patches of backyards. It is a wonderful festival and it has a great pet parade. I always travel on the fire engine with my dog Peggy, and we take in the sights of our local town together; it has become a bit of a thing for us to celebrate. The Kempton festival celebrates horses, coaches, gigs and everything else that is horse-drawn. This year I had the honour of opening their new coach shed. It is a great shed, and it is well organised. If you travel down the highway between Hobart and Launceston you can see the shadows of horses and coaches on each end of that great little town. The autumn festival at New Norfolk includes the celebration of hops and the history of hop growing in that region. It is held at Bushy Park, where hops is still grown. That is a terrific opportunity. This year maybe they will get some boats coming up the great Derwent River and through the rising bridge. We might even get a passenger train up this year as well. At the Oatlands festival the Carrington Mill is driven by wind grinding wheat into flour. Organic flour is grown in the electorate. They are producing some great stuff. Oatlands has more sandstone cottages, houses and other buildings than any other village in Tasmania. Swansea has the Freycinet Peninsula festival. They are celebrating with a French theme; they have a mayor that was born in France. There is also: St Patrick's Day at Westbury; the penny-farthing fair at Evandale with everything to do with pennyfarthings, including the world championship; Poatina Fun Day; and of course the Brighton School Fair. It is a great way to celebrate in Tasmania. (Time expired) Australian Service Clubs HMAS Sydney II Memorial",172
247,Mr HAASE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to remind this House of the very hard and important work done by service clubs around Australia and, specifically, I wish to bring to the House's attention the work done by the Geraldton Rotary Club. It is 70 years ago this year that, on 19 November, 645 officers and crew of the HMAS Sydney II perished. Therefore it is 70 years this year that we will recognise that occurrence. This year we will celebrate and reflect upon that incident at the magnificent memorial on high ground overlooking the city of Geraldton-Greenough. We can do that because of the hard work of the Rotary Club of Geraldton. Its members today number just 35, and they, as we like to say, punch well above their weight. Back in 1988, there was a monument created on top of the same hill, recognising the commitment of the crew of Sydney II, but the Rotary Club of Geraldton decided they would go one step further: being the last Australian port of call for the officers and crew of the HMAS Sydney II, they decided that there ought to be a national monument to the officers and crew in the city of Geraldton-Greenough. A lot of hard work, a lot of dedicated fundraising, a lot of assistance from the then Howard government and funds under the Regional Partnerships Program created with the assistance of sculptors Mr and Mrs Smith what is truly a magnificent monument. Every member of this House ought keep in mind the fact that we truly have around this nation some incredibly empathetic and reflective monuments. This 70-year anniversary will be more significant because this is a year that we create the last element, the fifth element, of this commemorative monument. It will be a reflective pool with some 644 seagulls engraved in black granite in a circle around the pool and one stainless steel threedimensional seagull rising from the reflective pool and the eternal flame. It is well worth seeing. I would like to think that many Australians will take the opportunity on 19 November 2011 to be part of the respectful celebrations of the sinking of the Sydney II. I would like to share with you just one point: back in 1988, when the original site memorial was being dedicated, the crowd assembled on quite a bright GeraldtonGreenough day and a very large mob of seagulls hovered over the crowd. They remained motionless in the onshore wind. It was a hair-raising moment. No-one counted the 645 seagulls, but it was hair-raising. So much so that this was remarked to the sculptors of the final memorial, which led them to create a dome of remembrance on the top of this hill featuring 645 seagulls. It is a terribly emotional moment when anyone visits this site and realises the significance of the monument and the empathy it has with the occasion. Of course, it is all down to the hard work, the vision, the foresight and continued dedication of the members of the Rotary Club of Geraldton. We all should applaud their work because it is the work of such regional service clubs that creates so much of the goodwill and infrastructure of remembrance in our regional centres right around this nation. I applaud their continued work and trust that everyone will return to Geraldton-Greenough on 19 November this year. (Time expired) US-Australia Retail Price Differences",173
248,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT,"Back in January, we witnessed the launch of a campaign by major retailers to start adding the will GST to the purchase of products sourced overseas via the net. It was a short-lived campaign for a host of reasons, not the least of which was that consumer backlash swamped the campaign before it got off the ground. Many consumers know that the moment they get online they can see for themselves the major price differentials that exist between products obtained here and the same ones that can be purchased overseas. It is certainly something that has not escaped constituents whom I represent in this place. Last month I received an email from Mount Druitt resident Anastassia Watson, who wrote on behalf of Andrew Luke and herself. Ms Watson and Mr Luke wrote to me because they had ‘concerns with the cost of products in Australia which in our opinion are overpriced compared to the United States'. They then listed a range of products such as food, clothing and electronic gear that could be purchased here, then compared them to the cost levied in the US. For example, Ms Watson highlighted-and I quote: A good pair of TN Nike Shoes in Australia is $239 and in the United States it's $100. An NBA jersey in Australia is $139.95 and in the United States the jersey is $50. An Xbox game is priced at an average of $110 on its release date in the United States its $60. On this point, it has been pointed out that Sony's gaming platform has almost a $200 price differential between here and the US. Ms Watson wrote: Seriously, if I was an American coming to Australia and realised that Australian prices are more than double, I would put myself on the first back to the US! She also asked me to pass on her concerns to the Treasurer, and I will be doing just that. The issue of price differentials frustrates many consumers, particularly when they seek to purchase electronic items. I think it is well known I do not mind Apple products. Their sleek, smartly designed products are leading edge, innovative, and help shape the way technology caters to consumers. Besides their terrific MACBook, I have also been impressed with the iPad, which I am using tonight. It was a great platform from which I read my inaugural speech. I am led to believe I was the first member in this place to do so. It is not unusual for users of Apple products to become fervent devotees of the brand, but in the rush to embrace the products the users sometimes find themselves checking out the cost of the products here versus what they would pay for them in the US. It is also front of mind for people weighing up whether they will purchase the iPad2, which will be released in Australia on Friday. I raised the issue of price differences on the social media platform Twitter the other day and got quite a strong response from the general public, and I want to thank them for taking the time to share their views with me. I had some of the price differences brought to my attention. In very broad terms, for example, and taking into account taxes and currency variations, it turned out that the 13inch MACBook Pro costs $1,399 here and $1,218 in the US, the 17-inch MACBook Pro costs $2,899 here and $2,700 in the US, and the 8 gigabyte iPod Touch costs $289 here PS3 and $247 in the US. Going through the Australian Apple website, to buy certain brands of headphones might set you back up to $200 more than buying the same product on Apple's US website. To Apple's credit the 16gigabyte iPad2 with wi-fi will cost $579 here flight but $543 in the US-a lot tighter in price. These amounts are in Australian dollars. For details on the calculations, people will be able to visit my website in the next day to see the breakdown for themselves. For many people these differences are not small. As someone remarked to me via Twitter: ‘iPads take into account 10 per cent GST. Mark-ups over that are hard to justify.' It is important to bear in mind that Apple products are generally priced at a higher range to begin with. On top of that, do not forget that Apple is overwhelmingly the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer, and, from what I understand, they give resellers little, if any, control over pricing. One more noteworthy point is that their products are largely manufactured in China and shipped out from there to both Australia and the US. Consumers are struggling to work out why they are charged way more for these products and they would like some answers. Given the enormous brand loyalty Apple no doubt enjoys, I think there is a valuable opportunity for the company to explain why the same products in the United States cost significantly more here. To help get some answers quickly, overnight I will be writing to Apple Australia's managing director to put some of these differences to him. The worn-out observation about the internet is that it has made the world a much smaller place. Clearly, it has brought before people's eyes the fact that others are getting a better retail deal. Besides shrinking distance, let's hope it has a similar effect on price differences too. Mental Health",173
249,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight in this adjournment debate to address the important issue of mental health, particularly as it affects young Australians. What we all know in this House is that mental health impacts so many Australians. We know that in every community mental illness among young Australians is a major issue that demands practical and tangible support. We know that there is a critical need for early treatment. We know that delay in accessing appropriate treatment or, indeed, the failure to access treatment is particularly damaging for young people in adolescence. Maturity can be delayed, social and family relationships can be strained and employment prospects can be derailed, and secondary problems such as substance abuse, unemployment and behavioural problems may develop and intensify. We outlined these issues very much in our election policy just a few months ago. The Howard government recognised the critical need in this area. In 2006, the Howard government and the Minister for Health and Ageing at the time, now the Leader of the Opposition, massively boosted funding for mental health and established headspace units for the first time. This policy was backed up and added to in a major way by the coalition prior to the last election. The $1.9 billion boost in the final years of the Howard government was backed with another $1.5 billion policy promise that would, if implemented, have a major positive impact in mental health. There are a number of aspects to it. One aspect in particular was to provide $225 million towards an additional 60 headspace sites, as recommended by leading mental health clinicians. The policy as a whole was recognised and praised by mental health experts as a breakthrough. It was called a ‘game-changer' at the time. Indeed, Professor John Mendoza in the Australian on 1 July declared it ‘the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence based investment in mental health'. I focus particularly on headspace. Many members of the House are well aware of the success of this new program that is only a few years old. It provides, as we know, mental health support but particularly a youthfriendly and a youth focused environment in which to do so. A speaker just a few minutes ago spoke about the critical need in his electorate. There is a critical need for an extension of this program. In the Yarra Valley on the outer-east of Melbourne, in the electorate of Casey, the area that I represent, as well as in adjoining electorates, there is a critical need for a headspace unit. As we know, there are 30 operating nationally. The member for Dawson mentioned some of the background. The nearest facilities for the Yarra Valley, in the electorate of Casey, are in St Kilda and Frankston. It is vital that this program is rolled out further. It is a practical program that will have an immediate beneficial effect for youth who need to access it. We know that 35,000 young people have accessed the existing services to date, but we need a service in the outer-east and the Yarra Valley. All of us know that there are young people who need this service. We need to put that service where they are. It is vital that the outer-eastern suburbs are given the opportunity to complete an expression of interest for a site in the outer-east and the Yarra Valley. (Time expired) Fisher Electorate: National Ride2School Day Fisher Seniors Forum and Expo Dance for Daniel",175
250,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I speak today about an event held on 16 March: the fifth annual Ride2School Day. National Ride2School Day promotes health and physical activity for children. Teachers, parents and students are encouraged to leave their cars at home and to either walk or ride their bikes to school. Prior to this event, I sent letters schools in my electorate, which is on the Sunshine Coast, encouraging them to participate in Ride2School Day. Back in the seventies, more than 80 per cent of students walked or rode to school; however, now only 20 per cent of children do so, even though the majority of them live within five kilometres of their school. Many of these children are driven relatively short distances to school and so miss out on a great chance for some exercise. Inactive lifestyles expose one to preventable diseases such as obesity and diabetes. It is also known that children who have an active childhood are more likely to maintain this healthy lifestyle throughout their lives, and this limits the likelihood of obesity in later life. I congratulate the organisation of Ride2School Day for their initiative in implementing an event that is directed towards improving the health and fitness of our youth. Ride2School Day started in Victoria in 2006 and has grown increasingly popular over the past five years. This year 140,000 children from more than 1,050 Australian schools participated in this physical activity. Many of them were riding to school for the first time. I also thank and congratulate all schools that participated this year by encouraging their student communities to take part in this event by walking, riding, scooting or skating to school. I give special mention to Kawana Waters State College for its early involvement in Ride2School Day and congratulate all students, parents and teachers for their participation. I also speak today about the 11th annual Fisher Seniors Forum and Expo, which will National be hosted by me later this year. The Fisher Seniors' Forum and Expo was first hosted by the Fisher Seniors Council and me in 2001 and has grown in popularity substantially since then. The purpose of the forum and expo is to provide senior residents of the to the Sunshine Coast with friendly and informal access to free information about issues that affect them. This year we will be honoured by the presence of the shadow minister for seniors, the honourable member for Mackellar, at the forum as a special guest. The honourable member attended the forum last year. She also attended it in 2001 as Minister for Aged Care. I take this opportunity to thank the shadow minister for her presence at occasions of such importance to the Fisher seniors community. Each year the seniors expo that accompanies the forum features a large number of exhibitors who are ready to give helpful free advice on a range of products and services of interest to seniors. Last year's forum attracted 30 different exhibitors from a wide variety of services such as healthy eating, hearing specialists and sun care. I now turn to an issue which is close to our hearts-that is, the safety and protection of our children. Last weekend I attended with my wife, Inge, the sixth annual Dance for Daniel, the main annual fundraiser for the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, which works to provide child safety education and support for young victims of crime across Australia. The Dance for Daniel is a night where the dress code is ‘red tie' or ‘red outfit' to com- work. memorate the life of Daniel Morcombe, who went missing on 7 December 2003. His case has become the biggest investigation in Queensland police history and resulted in the formation of the Daniel Morcombe Foundation. An auction is held to raise money for the foundation so that they can continue to inform children and parents of the dangers of child predators. There is also a silent auction and, Mr Speaker, you will be pleased to know that I purchased the Kevin 07 framed T-shirt at a cost of more than $300, but that money is of course going to a very worthy cause. There is a need to set boundaries in order to keep our children safe. Up for grabs on the evening was a range of items. In addition to the Kevin 07 T-shirt, there was a scarf signed by the Prime Minister. It also raised a substantial amount of money, and I would like to thank both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their donations to such a worthy cause. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also spoke in the Main Committee on the disappearance of Daniel Morcombe. Daniel was just 13 and wearing a red Tshirt when he disappeared from under the Kiel Mountain Road overpass on the Nambour Connection Road. Through this tragedy, which no parent and no family should suffer, Denise and Bruce Morcombe have become magnificent advocates for child safety and risen to take on an important role in the community that is both invaluable and priceless. Over the seven-plus years since the disappearance of Daniel Morcombe, the case has generated publicity and media coverage across the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia and even internationally. Denise and Bruce are true heroes of our community and I commend them for their ongoing good I once again urge all of us in the Australian parliament to wear red this year for the Day for Daniel, as so many people from the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition and your good self, Mr SPEAKER - as well as so many other members-have done in order to highlight the importance of child safety in Australia.

251,Mr OAKESHOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"In the short time. I have I would like to congratulate the many in the local community of Port Macquarie who have lobbied and advocated so hard for the expansion of Port Macquarie Base Hospital. There has been a successful campaign over many years both to see the $80 million in 2005 spent on the buyback of a privately funded public hospital resulting in a unique 10-year experiment in health care in New South Wales and to have the expansion take place, which has been approved through the independent health and hospital board on the back of the $1.8 billion regional round of the Health and Hospitals Fund. This is a significant Commonwealth commitment generally and, specifically for Port Macquarie Base Hospital, the largest commitment ever from the Commonwealth to a hospital in the history of the electorate of Lyne as well as the largest funding amount ever committed to Port Macquarie Base Hospital in any form. This is a $96 million commitment from the Commonwealth matched by $14 million commitment from the state including, at the state's end, ongoing operational and recurrent funding. This is a significant expansion of more than 50 per cent of the size of the existing footprint. So the scale of it is large. There twelve additional surgical beds, an expanded hot floor critical care unit, a new 30-bed medical in-patient unit, an expanded emergency department and a cardiac cath lab for heart support patients. At the same time, we are seeing this weekend the arrival of the second linear accelerator-the $4.8 million program to see over 400 cancer patients treated locally-which will take its place alongside the first accelerator, which arrived two years ago. I am pleased also that tenders will be going out in the coming month for the 12-bed geriatric unit. That will be a new capital build between the second and third pods at the hospital and will link in nicely with the dementia plan for the mid-North Coast and the dementia day care unit that will be opened on 7 April. So there is a lot happening in the health space on the mid-North Coast, in and around Port Macquarie Base Hospital in particular. This work is welcome, and I thank all of those who have participated in this long campaign.",177
