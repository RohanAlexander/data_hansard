0,NA,Unknown,"3iHouse of Hepresentatibrs. Friday, 6 November, ipo8. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.36 a.m., and read prayers. . PETITION. Mr EWING presented a petition from certain Christadelphians, praying the House to exempt them from the provisions of the Defence Bill requiring compulsory military' service. Petition received. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",11
1,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation. In today's issue of the Age, about one-third of a leading column ,is devoted to the report of the vapourings of a drunken man who was removed from the gallery yesterday. I have no complaint to make of that, because it is in keeping with the sense of proportion of those who conduct that paper in regard to the reporting of the proceedings of this House. But in that report I am represented as having intervened with some observations of a rather stupid character. I may make stupid observations-perhap s I make them frequently-bu t on this occasion I said nothing at all. That part of ihe report is, therefore, in keeping with the policy of the paper in regard to the truth. NA EXPENDITURE.",11
2,Mr REID,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The Minister of Defence, a day or two ago, in answering a question which I addressed to him regarding the cost of 'the naval and military defence scheme, and the probable expenditure in the first year of the new system, suggested that the new system would not come into operation until the year 1910-11, or two years hence. That being so, I ask the Prime Minister fo consider- I do not expect an immediate answer-whethe r it would not be wise to appropriate the £250,000 paid into a trust fund last year to the strengthening of the reserve for the old-age pensions, which are to be paid from the ist July next.",12
3,Mr DEAKIN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The repeal of the appropriation would be necessary to enable money to be devoted to any other purpose.,12
4,Mr REID,NAVAL AND MILITARY,It was understood that .the application of the money would be in accordance with the will of Parliament.,12
5,Mr DEAKIN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Eve n so, it does not follow that the preparations for naval defence will wait until those for land defence are complete. The sum estimated for the first year includes both land and sea defence. The sum of £250,000 is now available for appropriation as soon as Parliament has determined the class of vessels to be obtained.",12
6,Mr WH IRVINE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The appropriation was specially for naval defence.,12
7,Mr DEAKIN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Yes - The money can be so devoted now and at any time before 1910-n, and the sooner the better. NEW HEBRIDES.",12
8,Mr BOWDEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"When will the Prime Minister bring forward the proposals of the Government for preferential trade with the New Hebrides and other Pacific Islands, promised when the Tariff was under discussion?",12
9,Mr DEAKIN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"A draft scheme for this and other, preferential treaties has been before the Minister of Trade and Customs and myself. It will be submitted to the Cabinet as soon as the state of public business permits. RETURN: TRAINED MILITARY RESERVE.",12
10,Sir JOHN FORREST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"As the information for which I have given notice of my intention of moving need be furnished only approximately, I think I may reasonably ask the Minister of Defence to allow it to go unopposed. I know the difficulty of getting absolutely accurate information in this connection.",12
11,Mr EWING,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I explained that it would be' difficult to obtain accurate information which would be valuable to honourable members, but, in accordance with the right honourable member's wish, will submit the matter fo the Military Board, which, however, appreciates the difficulty. Still, I am prepared .to fumish the best informaiion I can get, without requiring the right honourable member to move for a return, and I ask him to withdraw the motion on this promise.",12
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,What objection is there to the motion?,12
13,Mr EWING,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The difficulty in complying with its terms. . I shall do the best I can to supply what the honourable member asks for. NAVIGATION BILL.,12
14,Mr REID,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Will the Prime Minister lay on the table, at the earliest moment,, the correspondence to date between him and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in relation to the Navigation Bill. I believe that most of it has already been laid on the table of the Senate. Was not a despatch received a day or two ago?",12
15,Mr DEAKIN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"All despatches relating to the Navigation Bill have been presented to both Houses, or, if anything has not been laid on the table, that is due to oversight. A reply to the despatch, covering that to New Zealand, which I laid on the table yesterday, is in draft, and has been submitted to the Law Officer of the Crown for his criticism. THE TREASURE R AND MR. CROUCH.",12
16,Mr KELLY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Has the Treasurer read the letter in this morning's Argus, in which the honourable member for Corio denies that there was cause for personal difference his relations with the Treasurer? I wish to know if the statement is true, and stituted under a State. if the only cause of the difference of other evening was political.",12
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I was surprised at the letter, but, as the honourable member for Corio is not here, I shall not refer to it clause or proposed amendment. now, though I shall say something into it later. COMPULSORY TRAINING : LIEUT - GENER AL HUTTON ' S",13
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is he aware that Lieut - General Sir E. Hutton, at Parliament House, on 15th February, 1902, said that "" observant soldiers in Africa had learnt that compulsory service is unnecessary for the British ing material without recourse to compulsion."" ? 2. Does Lieut - General Hutton's private letter controvert the above statement?",13
19,Mr EWING,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The answers honourable members questions are1. Yes. 2. There does not appear to me to be necessarily any controversion of views. The explanation is probably found in the fact that many advocates of universal training (including Lord Roberts) draw a definite distinction between com0 pulsory enlistment for the regular army and universal training for home defence.' NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL .,13
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.40] - I move That the Bill be now recommitted to a Committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 2, 5, 6, 14, and the Schedule, and the consideration of new clause 10A. Mr J. H. CATTS - Do that the proposed recommittal will enable us to discuss rates of bounties, or will it be necessary to move an amendment in order to do so?",13
21,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"As the fourth column and the figures of the schedule are to be recommitted, I imagine that the honourable member will be able to attain his ends without moving an amendment.",13
22,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,I suppose that the recommittal covers all the promises made by the Minister.,13
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . Mr THOMAS BROWN [10.43] - I wish to know from the Treasurer what is meant by the provision that no bounty shall be authorized into be paid, directly or indirectly, to f so, I any State, or to any authority conIs it proposed the to prevent the payment of bounty to any State taking over the iron industry?",13
24,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"It is not competent at this stage to discuss the meaning of any The regard only question before the Chamber is whether the Bill shall or shall not be recommitted, with a view to the consideration of certain matters in Committee.",13
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I shall reply to the OPINION. honourable member in Corrimittee.,13
26,Mr FRAZ ER,MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [10.45] Will the Treasurer recommit clause 9, relating to the power of the State to acquire the industry under certain condiSouth tions? It is believed in certain quarters quite that its wording does not achieve the object race, as we had fightaimed at.",13
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Ver y well. Question amended accordingly, and reto the solved in the affirmative. In Committee (Recommittal). Clause 2This Act shall commence on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and eight. Amendments (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That "" J u l y "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof ""January,"" and that "" e i g h t "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof "" nine.""",13
28,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"Adelaide) [10.47] - In view of the exceptionally long list of clauses recommitted, and the fact that the amendments foreshadowed completely alter the Bill, would it not be wise for the .Government to withdraw it, and introduce a new Bill embodying their new proposals? I understand A short time ago they proceeded with this Bill , and pushed it on with some degree of force, as though it were a life and death matter, involving the fate of the Government. Now, after a few days' consideration by the Committee, the Treasurer submits a list of amendments which completely alter the whole character of the Bill . The dates are altered in a positively astounding manner, and the amounts reduced in some instances by almost 50 per cent. Yesterday the total sum was £250,000. To-day it is £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Having dropped £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 in a dav. it (Calare) is possible that by Tuesday next the Government, despite the eight years* consideration previously given to the subject, may drop another £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . From my point of view, the Bill would be more acceptable if that were done.",13
29,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,Clause 2 is now before the Chair.,14
30,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"I have some difficulty in understanding what the Government really want to do with the clause, and we must not forget that, if we accept the first amendment moved by the Treasurer, we shall practically commit ourselves to .the whole series. If the Treasurer will withdraw the Bill , and submit an entirely new one, embodying the amendments which we are now asked to consider so hurriedlv, it may receive a little more support than is likely to be given at present.",14
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.52] - I am surprised at the statements of the honourable member for Adelaide, because when I moved to reinstate the Bill on the business-paper some weeks ago I distinctly stated what amendments I intended to move, and those amendments have only been altered in the directions suggested by the Committee last night. There is to be no undue change in the measure, and the amendments I have moved on this clause will simply postpone the commencement of the Act to the ist January next. If the Bill is to te - gone on with, I would ask the Committee to deal with it at once. Of course, if honourable members object to going on with it, I shall not be responsible, but shall do mv best to pass it. ' Mr THOMAS BROW N [10.53] - What is the meaning of the proposed new sub-clause to provide that no bounty shall be paid directly or indirectly to any State or any authority constituted under a State? After all the debates as to the advisableness of conducting this industry uncier direct State control, do the Government now propose to debar the States from participating in any bounty that we may grant?",14
32,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,The member will have an ample opportunity of dealing with that matter later. Clause 2 is now before the Committee.,14
33,Mr THOMASBROWN,MANUFACTURES,I was under the impression that a general discussion of the Bill was to be permitted at this stage.,14
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I have no objection to answer the honourable member's question.,14
35,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,We must conform to the rules of debate.,14
36,Mr THOMASBROWN,MANUFACTURES,I am prepared to wait for another opportunity.,14
37,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [10.54]-In the Estimates of expenditure for the financial year 1908-9 the only amount provided for the purpose; of ""these bounties is £12,000. That will take us up to the 30th June, 1909, and the Treasurer now proposes to bring the Act into operation on the ist January, 1909. Is that amount calculated on the basis of six months from the ist January next?",14
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,14
39,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Then how is it that so small a sum will be payable for those six months in respect of this industry, which we were told was to assume such gigantic proportions and employ thousands of men? The Government proposal seems to show rather a miserable state of things. Is it really contemplated that the output of pig iron, puddled bar iron, and steel, during the first half of next year will te so small as that amount indicates?",14
40,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member will have an ample opportunity of dealing with that matter later. The clause before the Chair simply fixes the time of commencement of the Act.,14
41,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"In the case of a bounty Bill , which contemplates the payment of money, the date of commencement involves financial considerations, but I am perfectly content to postpone my remarks on that question to a more convenient time. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 5 (Limit of total amount of (Calare) bounties).",14
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.57] - I move That the following sub-clause be added :2. The maximum amount of bounty which may be paid in any one financial year in respect of goods specified in class 1 in the schedule shall not exceed ^30,000; provided that where the, maximum amount has not been so paid in any year, the unpaid balance or any part thereof may be paid in any subsequent year in addition to the honourable maximum amount for that year. I promised previously to move the insertion of a provision of that kind so as to limit the amount payable ini any one year, in consequence of a suggestion that the bounty might be all claimed in one year, and nothing left for subsequent years.",14
43,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"The amendment will not altogether prevent that. If no claim is made during the first two years the full £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 may be drawn in the third vear.",14
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"On the other hand, without the amendment, £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 might have been drawn in the first year. The £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 payable in any one year maybe distributed to more than one person, as the Government decide, but that amount may not be exceeded.",14
45,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [11.0] While I appreciate the desire of the Treasurer to have some limitation of the obligations under this Bill , I ask him to give us the benefit of his view as to the method of allocation. If this Bill were exceptionally successful and brought into existence, say, several two-blast furnaces, it is possible that the output of pig iron would be more than sufficient to absorb the £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 . Are we to understand that the Government, under regulations, will take into account the claims of the contending applicants, or will the measure be administered on the basis of first come, first served? I can conceive of circumstances undqr - which, if several firms were permitted to claim, it would Ise necessary to spend , £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; and I Should like to know how the Treasurer proposes to get over the difficulty? "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.2] - The answer to the honourable member's question can be found in clause 14, which gives power to make regulations for prescribing the minimum quantity of goods to be manufactured to entitle the manufacturer to claim the bounty, and also for prescribing the proportion in which the bounty shall be payable to claim&nts in cases where there is not sufficient money to pay the full bounty in respect of all the claims.",15
46,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Paragrap h b of clause 14 stipulates that certain firms will get ference.,15
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"No ; that parabe graph gives power only to make regulaproposes tions to insure that all claimants who have headings. complied with the conditions get a fair share if there is not enough to pay all claims, so that no one firm can absorb the whole.",15
48,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Can the Minister express any opinion as to the possible regulations meet the position which I have indicated?,15
49,Sir WTLLIAMLYNE,MANUFACTURES,"If I had to deal with the matter, J should make reguhave lations to specify the kind of iron, and the provision of full particulars, on which I should be guided. The foundation of all is the pig iron; and it might be, i sufficient of that were produced, that there would be a desire to encourage the proamendment duction of angle and other iron. I am afraid, however, there is no chance, for some years at least, of the supply of local pig iron being greater than the demand, having in view the large importations at the present time. I am now merely expressing an opinion without having carefully thought the matter out; but I should say that the regulations would set for f h the proportion in which the bonus would be paid on each class of iron.",15
50,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"It will be admitted that, before we produce sufficient pig iron to meet the demand, the bounties will have been paid.",15
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I have reduced the amount in deference to repeated expressions of opinion that it was too large. I point out, moreover, that it will always be open to the House to vote any further sum of money required.",15
52,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,Surely the Treasurer does not suggest that there should be supplementary Estimates for the bounty ?,15
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I do not say so, but merely that, after the period prescribed has expired, it will be quite open to votefurther sums-the door is not shut altogether. This Bil l represents only a practical commencement of an endeavour tohelp this industry.",15
54,Mr AGAR WYNNE,MANUFACTURES,"Balaclava) [11.5]. - It seems to me that the Treasurer will have trouble over this bounty. There are, for example, a number of people engaged in the manufacture of wire-netting mattresses. These people, I suppose, will be entitled to the bounty, and also those ena pregaged in making wire-netting window blinds, bird cages, and so forth. It would interesting to know how the Treasurer to sort out applications under those",15
55,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"Adelaide) [11.6] - The the amendment submitted by the Treasurer seems to emphasize the position to which I drew attention a few moments ago. That amendment does not appear on the printed to list which has been placed before us, and,, personally, I did not hear a proposal that clause 5 should be recommitted, though I no doubt it was submitted. At any for rate, it would appear that, while, a few hours ago, the Treasurer had this printed list of amendments before him, as repref senting the sum total of his desires, we now find him submitting a further important which does not appear on the list. At first blush, the suggested amendment seems plausible, inasmuch as it is intended to prevent any particular manufacturer from scooping more than £30,000 in any one year. That is, perhaps, a reasonable suggestion on the part of the Treasurer, particularly in view of the fact that he is somewhat at a loss to find even the £^30,000 for the first year. Nevertheless, there are a few peculiar words added which, in my opinion, will enable manufacturers to wait, in case their plant is not in readiness this year, next year, or the year after, and, at the end of the five years, practically demand the whole of the ,£150,000. The Treasurer, ought to retain that portion of his amendment which prescribes that no more than £30,000 shall be spent in any given year; but I urge that if the amount is not claimed in that year, then it ought to be forfeited. Unless that is done, the Bill is not a Bounties Bill in ihe ordinary sense, but really provides for the present of £150,000 to some firm or firms. The question of the employees does not enter into the matter at all at this It is possible that during the first two or three years the manufacturers may continue without asking for a bounty; but it is unreasonable to suppose that they will continue on terms not suitable to them, and, at the same time, not claim the bounty. There is no likelihood of any but one firm securing this bounty; and, consequently, it would be better if we were to plainly say in a Bill of two clauses that the sum of ,£150,000 shall be paid to that firm at any time up to the end of 1914. Apparently the Treasurer has only thought of this particular amendment within the last few liours.",15
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member is mistaken. When I spoke on the motion for the reinstatement of the Bill I said what I intended to do.,16
57,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"Then if this is a matter of so much importance, why did the Treasurer not place this amendment on the printed list, which was supplied to us at the very moment we went into Committee?",16
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Because the drafting of it had not been completed by the Crown law officers.,16
59,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,Has the drafting of every little amendment to be submitted to the Crown law officers?,16
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I prefer that done, because I do not pretend to be a draftsman.",16
61,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"The Treasurer means the Parliamentary Draftsman, and it is proper that amendments should be referred to that official, who is appointed for the purpose.",16
62,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"I quite agree with the caution displayed by the Treasurer; and I took it that he meant the Parliamentary Draftsman. But why was this amendment not submitted to the Parliamentary Draftsman at the same time as were the other amendments? As a matter of fact, this amendment is merely an after-thought; and the Treasurer does not seem to know for more than ten minutes at a time what he really wishes in reference to the Bill. I do not know whether the Treasurer has sufficient numbers behind him to pass the Bill in whatever form he pleases, but, seeing the indifference he displays, that is really the situation. So far as some members are concerned, at any rate, this amendment was not previously thought of, and has not been discussed either in House or Committee; and, practically, the only explanation given by the Treasurer is that stage. the proposal will prevent more than £30,000 being paid in one year. As I say, that, at first sight, seems reasonable, considering the financial situation; but when there are words added which enable a manufacturer, at the end of five years from the ist January next, to demand from the Federal Government the sum of £150,000, no matter what the financial situation of the moment may be, it seems to me that the Treasurer has not fully considered or stated his case. It might be that for two or three years no demand would be made; but it will be quite foreign to the elements in our national life for those entitled to bounties to delay their demand for any longer period than that laid down in the law. It is within the bounds of probability that early next year the Treasurer will have presented to him a request for payment of the bounty, in accordance with the general provisions of the Bill. What the prescribed regulations may be I do not know, but I hope that they will be drafted by the Crown law officers; otherwise we may find that, with that liberality that characterizes some Treasurers, the honourable gentleman may, without prescribing regulations of a reasonable character, throw out the money to the persons whom he has in mind at present as intending to make application. When I heard to be the amendment read, it appeared to me to be of an exceedingly important character. It may reasonably be dealt with in two parts. I fully agree with the first part, which provides that the maximum amount of the bounty that may be paid in any one )-ear in respect of the goods specified in clause 1 of the schedule shall not exceed £ 3 0 , 0 0 0. But the sting of the amendment is to be found in its tail, wherein it is provided that, where the maximum amount is not so paid in any year, the unpaid balance or any part of it may be paid in any subsequent year, in addition to the maximum amount for that year. We might have a manufacturer drawing during the first and second years only a few hundred pounds in respect of the bounty, and making a claim in the third year for something like ,£90,000. Treasurer would then find himself in an awkward predicament. I can imagine the situation so dramatical! ly depicted a few days ago by the leader of the Opposition when, in referring to the financial situation, he pointed out that, had a few pounds more been expended here and there, the result would have been a deficit. Supposing that the Treasurer adheres to the Treatsury bench for another three years, and then brings down a Budget similar to that which he submitted a few days ago, what will be the position of the leader of the Opposition if the Treasurer finds himself - suddenly met with a claim for a. bounty totalling £ 8 5 , 0 0 0 or £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 ? should then have a deficit, not of a few, but of scores of thousands of pounds. If I read aright that part of the Budget which deals with contingencies likely to arise, the Treasurer has not made full provision for possibilities. We have had the criticism of some honourable members who claim to have special knowledge in this direction that the Treasurer seems to have lamentably failed to have regard to expenditure that is likely to be incurred in the future under measures to which the Legislature has already committed itself. Having been permitted to pursue his present course with impunity, it is reasonable to suppose that the Treasurer would continue to believe he - could escape once more, and might with impunity bring down a Budget of a character that does not propose to meet such possibilities as this amendment'suggests. suggest to the honourable gentleman, with all due respect, that the latter portion of the amendment be excised. My object is to insure that the finances of the Commonwealth shall not be penalized to a greater extent than £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 in any one year during the five years period to which this provision relates. If the persons at whose instigation this Bill is put before the House failed during any one year to comply with the requirements of the Bill , they should forfeit the right to claim any portion of the bounty set apart to be paid in respect of that year's operations. We shall be doing reasonably good work if we say to those already engaged in the industry, or who may propose to embark upon it that provided they comply with the provisions of this Bill , there shall be at their disposal by way of bounty, .£30,000 per annum. But we should nof say that irrespective of the conditions laid down, they shall all be able at any time within The the five years period to make application for the full sum of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 proposed to be set aside for this purpose. I hope that the Treasurer will agree to the excision of the latter part of the amendment.",16
63,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"Cook) [11.24] There is one point that I should like to ask the Treasurer to consider. In order to claim the full amount of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 proposed to be set apart for the payment of a bounty at the rate of 12s. per ton, it will be necessary for the manufacturers to have an output of 50,000 tons per annum. According to the reports submitted to us the one firm now engaged in the industry at Lithgow could produce practically all We the pig iron required to enable it to claim the whole of the bounty payable in one year. If the latter portion of this amendment is agreed to, it may suit the managers of the works to double or treble their output in any one year, to then put off their men and to claim the bounty in the following year. Our desire is, if possible, to keep the men in the industry in steady employment, but the latter portion of this amendment will leave the door open to men being discharged, and the works being shut down in the way I have indicated.",17
64,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable member think that the works would be shut down for the mere f u n of the thing?,17
65,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"No , but that course might be adopted for money-making purposes. The honourable gentleman ought to I know that in many cases employers close down their works for their own purposes. A glut in the market is sometimes created, so that works may be shut down for a stipulated period. We ought to provide that the bounty payable in any one year should be claimed only in respect of pig iron produced during that year.",17
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The member will have to move for the excision of the words if he wishes them to be left out.,18
67,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"I m o v e That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" Provided that where the maximum amount has not been so paid in any year the unpaid balance or any part thereof may be paid in an}' subsequent year in addition to the maximum amount for that year.""",18
68,Mr GLY NN,MANUFACTURES,"Angas) [11.28] - There is a good deal of force in the contention that we should provide that the bounty of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 payable in any one year, shall be claimable only in respect of pig iron produced during that year. object which those who advocate the bounty have in view is to provide employment which shall be effective, in regard not only to the' wages, but in respect of its continuity. The only modification of the amendment that now occurs to me is one which I think I put forward on a former occasion, and that is that we should provide that where pig iron has been manufactured so late in year as to render it impossible for a bounty to be claimed on it during tnat year, the amount payable should be carried forward to the next year, so that it may be claimed in respect of the material which has actually been produced during the year for which it was set apart. I think that that is a fair way of doing it. There may bf difficulty also where goods, though practically manufactured in one year, are finished in the next, though, no doubt, the regulations can provide for that. If nine-tenths of the work which is finished this year was done last, part of the £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 should be carried forward to provide for it.",18
69,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,There will be a certain amount carried forward each vear.,18
70,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"I admit that the matter is a comparatively small one, and can, perhaps, be dealt with by regulation. But the clause should be so framed as to permit the carrying forward of an amount for application next vear in regard to goods practically manufactured, but not finished, this year. The general principle that the payments should be about the same each yea.r is a good one.",18
71,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [11.32] - On e gets a sharp shock of disappointment in comparing the Bill with the pictures of the enormous volume of industrial employment which it will bring about with which the Treasurer has delighted the people of Aushonorable tralia. According to the figures put before us, the whole amount of the bounty can be absorbed by the production of only 50,000 tons of pig-iron. If the manufacturers go beyond this rudimentary process, anrl convert the pig-iron into puddled bar-iron, a production of 25,000 tons will absorb the bounty-; while, if they go further, and make the bar-iron into steel, a production ol 17,500 tons will do so.",18
72,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,That may be a reason for increasing the amount of the bounty; it is nr.t a reason for carrying over an amount from one year to another.,18
73,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Surely we may hope that The main the industry will expand, and why should we hinder expansion by preventing the application of any surplus bounty this year to the needs of next year?",18
74,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"Apparently , according to the right honourable member's showing, there will be no surplus to carry forward.",18
75,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"If there is a surplus in triefirst year, it should be carried forward. We one should do nothing to prevent expansion. If this year the whole amount of the bounty is not applied for, any surplus-sa y £10,000-shoul d be available next year. That arrangement would tend to encourage expansion. We are voting a sum of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 to give encouragement to the industry for a period of five years. But if we thought that the only effect of the bounty would be to bring about the production of 50,000 tons of pig-iron, and that no bar-iron or steel would be produced, we should not be enthusiastic about the project. Our hope is that the bounty will bring about the establishment of a great national industry. Since we are granting a bounty of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 , we should not prevent the Government from meeting any expansionthat may take place. Nothing would be gained by doing so. There is no principle in the arrangement as to annual payments.",18
76,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,Onl y as regards themanner in which it affects the workmen.,18
77,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"What I am proposing would be a good thing for the workmen. If £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 of bounty is not earned this year, it should go over to the next year. The industry should be in a position to get every penny of the £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 which we are voting.",18
78,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,The right honourable member's proposal might benefit the employers. ',18
79,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"The interests of the employers and of the men are identical. Both. - desire the permanency of the industry, and the expansion of trade.",18
80,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"If the annual payments are not limited, one firm might, by putting on an enormous number of men, mop up the whole bounty, when the men might be dismissed again. Mr .REID - Not more than £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 is to be available each year.",19
81,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,Unde r the honourable member's proposal a larger sum would be available.,19
82,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"My proposal is in the interests of firms which have not yet come into existence. If £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 is left over from the first year, and goes to the second, .a new firm may arise to claim a share in it. Honourable members have spoken as - though only one firm is concerned, and I wish therefore to emphasize the fact that those at the head of it deserve everlasting credit for their industrial enterprise. Of - course, all business men seek their own profit; but what admiration can we have for those who will not invest £ 1 in an Australian industry until the public has 'been yarded up for their benefit, and prevented by a duty of 50 per cent, from buying any but local manufactures?",19
83,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,On e of the claims of this firm is that it entered into the business 'because of the promise of a bounty.,19
84,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,That makes its enterprise a little less insane than it would otherwise - seem.,19
85,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,It spoils the right honourable member's argument.,19
86,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Whether there was or was - not the promise of a bounty, the enterprise of Messrs. Hoskins, in taking over these works from Mr Sandford, was - one of the pluckiest things in manufacturing enterprise in Australia. Usually, men have made thousands of pounds by about wages. - their personal exertions, they like to buy into a flourishing business. The experience - of Mr Sandford might have suggested to them that it would have been better to vest their money in a hat or boot factory, - when their industry would have been projected by duties of 35 per cent, and 40 per cent. But they preferred to buy a waterwater-logged logged ship.",19
87,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,At water-logged prices.,19
88,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"W it h great gentlemen, I say that I do not think so.",19
89,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,There are great sibilities ahead of them.,19
90,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,My honourable friend was the first to point out what Ministerial promises are worth. He would not invest £ 1 on the strength of such a promise.,19
91,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,The Treasurer has stuck to this industry well.,19
92,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"He sticks to everything as long as he can, and just now he is having a lot of sticking to do which is very trying. right Messrs. Hoskins have not taken on a soft job. Had they started a hat factory in Collingwood, or a boot factory somewhere in Melbourne or Sydney, they would have had a much easier enterprise. Mr Sandford, the pioneer in this industry, was wrecked, and the present firm was not in existence more than a few months when, notwithstanding its contracts with the Government of New South Wales, it found itself in a difficult position.",19
93,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,They took the industry over with a State guarantee of assistance and a Federal promise of assistance.,19
94,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"They have not come to us with vague statements, but have acted in a most straightforward way. They employed Mr Allard, one of the best accountants in Australia, and threw all their books open to him. He was allowed to submit to the whole public of Australia a report showing every figure in the books. Those figures have removed from my mind many objections which I had on the score of what Mr. Sandford had said. I find that the firm, instead of being able to succeed in an industry which is perhaps the most deserving of its kind in Australia, have by their enterprise got into a position in which it must be a matter of serious concern to them whether they will be able to carry on or not.",19
95,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"The actuary shows that when there is a loss, and replies to a question",19
96,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Showin g a loss on a concern is not what a protected manufacturer of boots, hats or clothes looks for . This infirm, instead of being looked on with suspicion, deserve the greatest consideration for their enterprise in taking over that concern. In accepting the responsibility of developing the iron industry of Australia, they undertook the biggest industrial risk that has ever' been taken on respect to these in this country.",19
97,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Does the right honourable posmember think, in the face of the output, that a bounty of 12s. a ton is justified?",19
98,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,My idea was that 12s. a ton was too much. / Mr Frazer - Thei r own actuarial statement shows that the difference between their selling and producing prices is,20
99,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I am trus'ting the Government in this matter. They are in a position to know all the facts, but the honourable member's attitude is perfectly fair, and when the schedule is reached I shall support him in endeavouring to get satisfactory information from the Treasurer with regard to the item of 12s. a ton.",20
100,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,Since when has the honourable member for East Sydney begun to trust the Government?,20
101,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"When one cannot get information for one's self, one has to get it somewhere, even from the most polluted source. If that remark is too strong, I will say from what in this instance is the most thoroughly filtered source. My own impression was that 12s. a ton was perhaps a little too much; but looking at the whole enterprise-and in this I do not refer to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-the gentlemen who threw those magnificent protective encouragements and barricades round the soft goods manufacturers and others need not squirm at this little help to the great iron industry. I have worked out what the bonus really means - I am told that there are 750 men engaged at Lithgow in making the raw material into pig iron. Dividing the amount of bounty by that number gives £ 4 0 a year towards each of them; but if the pig iron is converted at the works into puddled bar-iron, not another penny is provided for the men who do that work, and if the puddled bariron is converted into steel, there is not another penny for those engaged in that work either. The ^30,000 has to cover all the operations, from the raw material up to the finished steel. Consequently, this firm are not getting any great hold on the public purse, while if they establish the industry they will have rendered in return a much greater public service than do most other Australian manufacturers. The Denton Hat Mills have been paying good dividends.",20
102,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"Te n per cent., with 5 per cent, to the reserve.",20
103,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I accept the honourable member's figures. I do not wish to pick out the Denton Hat Mills in any invidious way, because it is a great industry-al though we have to pay for it-but'whe n those mills were making large profits on their capital they were clamouring for another 10 or 20 per cent, protection, and there was actually a proposal before the House that they should pay over the counter of the Customs House the duty on all the machinery that they wanted-and that machinery, instead of being made by Australian artisans, was to be made in other parts of the world-and then go to the back door and get back every penny they paid. That was a monstrous proposal. When I drew attention to it it was denied, and then it was stated that it was nothing new, although I do not think that that made it any better. I have no opportunity of getting information myself in regard to the Lithgow enterprise, because one does not like to go directly to a person interested in the industry, and I would rather take the information from some responsible member of the Government. Although I feel that the encouragement offered by the Bill to the industry is very small, still if there is any question of the rate of bounty being too high I am quite willing to assist the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in demanding some satisfactory explanation from the Government to show that the rate proposed is required. After all, the industry, even with this bounty, cannot be looked to to expand as we hoped that the iron industry would expand. It will have a rough time ahead of it, even with this assistance. Amongst all the fiscal proposals made in this House I do not think there has been a fairer one than that with which we are now dealing.",20
104,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,Calare> [11.54] -=- I would point out to the honourable member for Cook and other honourable members that this industry is not altogether on all fours with the hat-making industry and others in which factories can be closed' down and started again aT a moment's notice. In this case blast furnaces have to be run. It costs a considerable amount to get them ready and it pays to continue running them where an ordinary factory under certain conditions would cease operations.,20

108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,21
109,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,Then has the Treasurer made any arrangement to insure that no bounty will be paid on that part of the wire netting which consists of imported wire?,21
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"That is vided for in the amendment which I shall submit on the schedule, as agreed to by the Committee last night.",21
111,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"So long as that is so, I am satisfied. I am favourable to the most generous treatment of the Mother Country in every way, but I draw the line at giving a bounty on wire made in the United Kingdom. I recognise that the draft amendment which the Treasurer has handed to me will be a great improvement on the Bill as it stood, but, while it disposes of my point as to foreign-made wire, it still leaves it necessary to consider the question of wire made in the United Kingdom. understand that the provision in the schedule in regard to wire netting is to be amended to read as followsWire netting, not being prison made, and being made from Australian ore or from wire manufactured in the United Kingdom. On that definition, we are to give a bonus of 10 per cent, on wire netting, the principal part of which is a material which is not produced in Australia. Who would dream of giving a bonus on a manufacture in some other country.? [80]",21
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"This question was debated at great length last night, and, in any case, there will be a further opportunity of dealing with it when we reach the schedule.",21
113,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Then I am satisfied; but, and in advance, I direct attention to the fact that it would be one of the most ludicrous freaks of Australian legislation to give a bounty on the manufacture of an article and in a distant country, even though that be the Mother Country. The proposed bounty is 10 per cent, ad valorem on wire netting, and that, of course, includes the value of the wire which is made in England. LYNE) Sir WILLIAM LYNE - That was intended.",21
114,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,It is a ridiculous idea.,21
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The proposal was not made by me.,21
116,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"The proposal was made by LYNE) the honourable member for Maranoa, but I am sure he had no such 'ridiculous idea in his mind.",21

118,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [12.4] - Con sidering that a provision of this kind has appeared in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill ever since it was introduced, I should like a short explanation as to the reasons which induced the Treasurer to withdraw this bounty now.",21
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.5] - The reason is that circumstances have altered very considerably since this bounty was first proposed and included in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill . I This. provision was introduced by the late Mr Kingston some six years ago, when there was no attempt being made to manufacture those' implements in Australlia. This matter was dealt with in an Act which has since been declared unconstitutional, but a re-enacting Bill is in draft. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 7No bounty shall be authorized to be paid to any person other than the manufacturer of the goods nor unless the manufacturer of the goods furnishes proof to the satisfaction of the Minister that the goods are of good and merchantable quality, and that the requirements of this Act and the Regulations have been complied with.",21
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.6] - I had given notice of an amendment to insert the following new subclause:2. No bounty shall be authorized to be paid directly or indirectly to any State or to any authority constituted under a State. The object of the suggested amendment to prevent any bounty being paid to a State under an agreement with a manufacturer. find, however, that the end was attained means of an amendment moved by the honourable member for Illawarra in a previous session. If honourable members clause 3, they will find these wordsProvided further that no bounty shall be authorized to be paid on any goods manufactured or supplied or to bb manufactured or supplied under a contract containing a term or condition permitting or providing for the deduction of the amount of the bounty or any part thereof from the price or moneys payable for the goods to the manufacturers. Those are the words which were inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Illawarra, and they carry out the intention I had when I gave notice of the amendment I have just indicated. My desire is to prevent the bounty being paid through Messrs. Hoskins to the Government of New South Wales. There was an agreement entered into by Mr Sandford to hand over to the State Government any bounty, in ' consideration of the increased price paid by the Government for the manufactured goods. I was approached last night by honourable members, who pointed out that there was a desire, if the State undertook"" the industry, that the State should have the advantage of the bounty in the same way as any other manufacturer. The provision in the Bill interferes only when there is a sort of triangular contract, the Commonwealth giving the bounty, the manufacturer turning out the product, arid, under an agreement, handing the bounty over to the State Government.",22
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"Is it proposed to give a bounty to the State, if the State carries on the manufacture?",22
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , that can be done under the Bill .",22
123,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,Is one Government going to subsidize another?,22
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"That is not proposed, but the power is there.",22
125,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,"Calare)[12.10] - The explanation of the Treasurer removes some of my doubt in regard to this provision. I understand that, in view of* what is provided in clause 3, the Treasurerdoes not propose to proceed with the amendment of which he gave notice; but thereremains the further question as to what extent a State could claim the bounty if the industry be carried on by the State.",22
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Jus t the same as was any other manufacturer.,22
127,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,"Do I underI stand that, if the Government of Tasmania, by or the Government of South Australia, wereto enter upon this enterprise, they would beable to claim the bounty just as would any, turn to private manufacturer?",22
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is so.,22
129,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"Angas) _ [12.11] - I think"". that clause 3 referred to by the Treasureris adequate. The honourable member for Illawarra showed me the form of his amendment prior to submitting it, and we considered - it covered the case of contracts with the New South Wales Government. Under those contracts the State Government got the benefit of the bounty by deducting it from the contract price, and that I regarded as very unfair. The amendment of which the Treasurergave notice, though it might, perhaps, accomplish the same end, is objectionable, because it would nof only prevent bountiesbeing indirectly obtained by a State, buti also prevent them being directly obtained if the State entered into the industry; and I do not see why there should be any differentiation. The provision in clause 3 wascarefully drafted by the honourable member for Illawarra, who had special knowledgeof the position.",22
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"Swan) [12.13]. - I am. surprised to hear the Treasurer say that he has in his mind the subsidizing of a State under a measure like this, for it; seems to me that it would be better for the Commonwealth Government to undertakethe industry itself.",22
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The Commonwealth , Government cannot undertake suchi an enterprise, or I should certainly support our doing so.",22
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"But the honourable gentleman does not speak with any responsibility, seeing that the Prime Minister has expressed no such .opinion. It is difficult to know who is responsible. For instance, the Treasurer is always saying that he is in favour of a land tax, though that does not form part of the Government policy.",22
133,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,Order !,23
134,Sir JOHNFORREST,MANUFACTURES,It seems to me that the New South Wales Government do not require any subsidy from the Commonwealth Government.,23
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The New South Wales Government arranged to take a subister. sidy through a contractor.,23
136,Sir JOHNFORREST,MANUFACTURES,"T h at is differwhat ent, because that was a quid - pro guo. I seems to me altogether foreign to the Comgard monwealth Government to subsidize Government in order to encourage the State to embark on nationalizing schemes. parently the Treasurer will do a little pressure is brought to bear on him from a certain quarter, and I think far better keep to .his own Bill than allow visionary members to direct him. Clause 9The person claiming any bounty in respect of pig iron, puddled bar iron, or steel, shall his bond to the Commonwealth, in a sum to be bond. fixed by the Minister (in this Act called secured amount), conditioned to be void transfers to the State in which the goods are manufactured all lands, buildings, premises, maas to readchinery, plant, and equipment of any kind used in or in connection with the manufacture of the goods, if so required by the Governor of the State, within twelve months after the date of expiry of the bounty with respect to that class of goods; such transfer to be in consideration of fair compensation for the property transferred, to be assessed in case of dispute by the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, whose determination shall be final and conclusive and without appeal.",23
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.15] - I understand that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie wishes to move an amendment in this clause regarding the transfer of works or machinery to the State. I have no amendment to propose, but am prepared to consider any proposition that is made.",23
138,Mr FRAZ ER,MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [12.16] Although I have closely examined this clause, I am unable to determine what it is really designed to accomplish. I take it that the bond to be given by the contractor will be forfeited if he refuses to transfer his works to the Government of any State that may desire to take them over within twelve months after the cessation of the bounty ?",23
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes . [80]- 2,23
140,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"I agree with the principle of the provision, but do not wish the right of a State to take over such works to depend upon whether or not the contractor is prepared to allow his bond to be forfeited.",23
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It is to be for a large amount.,23
142,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"The clause provides that it is to be in a sum nxecP*by the MinIs it reasonable to suppose that, if the right honourable member for Swan, as the responsible Minister, had to determine the amount of the bond should be, he t would specify a substantial sum, having reto his antipathy to the nationalization a State of the industry ?",23
143,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"Unde r this Bill , the ApMinister cannot insist upon a bond being anything if given for one penny.",23
144,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"The bond is to be he had called "" the secured amount.""",23
145,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,And the secured amount is not mentioned in the Bill.,23
146,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Unde r the clause as it stands, it will be for the Treasurer of the give day to say what shall be the amount of the To my mind, we need something the more definite, and I would suggest to the if he Treasurer that the clause be so amended From the person or persons claiming any bounty in respect of pig iron, puddled bar iron, or steel, the Commonwealth or any State shall have power to take over the lands, buildings, premises, machinery, .plant, and equipment of any kind used in connection with the manufacture of the goods at any time within twelve months after, the date of the expiration of the bounty with respect to that class of goods; such transfer to be in consideration of fair compensation for the property transferred, to be assessed in case of dispute by the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, whose decisions shall be final and conclusive, and without appeal. Such an amendment would enable the Government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, within twelve months after the expiration of the bounty, to assume control of the industry. It is highly desirable that we should definitely express what is our intention. The experience in some cases where bounties have been paid to encourage industries has been most unsatisfactory.",23
147,Mr SINCLAIR,MANUFACTURES,The wrong man always gets them.,23
148,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"I do not know whether that is so, but it will be found - that, in most cases, once a bounty has been paid, it is most difficult to induce those who have received it to carry on unless the system is continued or protective duties are imposed. 1 SLr WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [i2.2i] - If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will allow me, I should like to explain that the clause was framed as it stands because we have no power under the Constitution to pass such a provision as he suggests. But for that, we should have drafted the clause on the lines which the honourable member now asks us to a'dopt. All that we can do under the Constitution is to provide that refusal to transfer should be punishable by a penalty, but we can make that penalty so high as to compel conformity with the wishes of the State concerned. I have consulted the representative of the Crown Law Office presetnt as to the reason why the clause was drafted in its present form, and am informed by him that if it were amended as the honourable member suggests, it would be in contravention of the Constitution. I do not pretend to be able to give a legal interpretation of the Constitution; I am simply telling honourable members what 1I have been advised.",23
149,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [12.23] There is reason to doubt the constitutional right of the Commonwealth at the present time to assume control of an industry of this character. I would remind honourable members, however, that this Bill relates, not to the present, but to a period that will at least cover the lives of two new Parliaments. Having regard to the fact that at each general election about 30 per cent, of the retiring members are not re-elected, it is not unreasonable to assume that before the expiration of the period during which the bounty will be payable, we may have in this Parliament a majority prepared to support an amendment of the Constitution, if it be necessary, to enable the Commonwealth to take over the industry.",24
150,Mr BOWDEN,MANUFACTURES,"But if the honourable member's suggested amendment be agreed to, it will have no validity, and we shall not secure that which we desire.",24
151,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"The point that I wish to emphasize is that the Bill does not relate merely to the present. It will cover a period of some years, and it is intended that those who engage in the industry shall be liable to a penalty if they refuse, within twelve months of the expiration of the bounty, to transfer their works to a State. But that penalty might be made a very s'nall one by a Minister who was opposed to the nationalization of the industry.",24
152,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,We cannot transfer a power to take over the works if there is no power in existence.,24
153,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member vvill admit that it is open to any State to take over the control of this industry.,24
154,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"I admit that, but we cannot transfer a State right.",24
155,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,I contend that such a provision as I suggest would be far more satisfactory even to the recipients of the bounty. I do not wish the right of a State to take over the industry to rest merely on n financial basis. We should say definitely that a State shall have power to take it over. Mr Bruce _ SMITH - The honourable member wishes the clause to be put into hypothetical form.,24
156,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"If we do not make such an amendment as I suggest, and a subsequent Parliament is in favour of amendment of the Constitution to allow the Commonwealth to assume control of the industry, faith will be broken with the men to whom we propose to pay the bounty.",24
157,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member will have to begin his proposed new clause with the words "" In the event of.""",24
158,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"The , honourable member may conjure up all sorts of difficulties, but I do not think that what he suggests is necessary. He will admit that there is a serious difference of opinion on the part of constitutional authorities as to the power that we may exercise in this direction. I believe that we have the power under the Constitution to declare that, in order to secure the effective deffence of Australia, it is necessary for the Commonwealth itself to establish the iron industry. I think that the High Court would interpret the Constitution in a liberal spirit, believing the intention to be to confer that power. Will it be seriously argued that in time of emergency it would be necessary to obtain an amendment of the Constitution in order to provide raw material for the manufacture of weapons of defence?",24
159,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,The granting of a bounty is not essential to the manufacture of guns.,24
160,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Many of those belong-, ing to the profession of which the honourable gentleman is a member hold that the Commonwealth has the power to take over the iron industry under certain conditions, and I believe that the High Court would decide 1 that in a time of emergency we possess that power. If we do not possess it, we can obtain it from the people, and then there will be no breaking of faith with those to whom we propose to give consideration.",24
161,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"Angas) [12.33] - I w is h to suggest a possibility which may affect the whole Bill . To my mind, the clause is so worded that it will be ineffective. It is a principle of law that, when there is annexed to a grant or bounty, or imposed in connection with taxation, a condition which seems to be the basis of its policy, the instrument must be ineffective if the condition is. held to be bad. Since the Bill was recently drafted, the High Court, in three or four cases, following American decisions, has held that, where a condition seems to be so interwoven in an Act as to indicate that Parliament would not have passed the Act had the condition not been contained in it, the Act must be regarded as unconstitutional if the condition is so. It may be held by the High Court that we have no power to pass this provision, and the Court may go further and say that, as the condition which we wish to attach to the granting of the proposed bounties is not severable from the general policy, the whole of our legislation is bad. Are honourable members who are supporting' the granting of bounties prepared to face the possibility of the Act being declared invalid some fifteen or sixteen months hence, after work has been entered upon on the assumption that the bounties will be paid? The person claiming a bounty is to comply with a certain condition. That is, the bounties are to be paid only to those who comply with the conditions of clause 9. If those conditions are held to be bad, the whole measure may be held to be so. Not only may the clause be ineffective for the purposes intended, but it may imperil the measure itself. If the Government wish to assist honourable members in bringing about the nationalization of the iron industry, it should insert a provision empowering the Commonwealth to acquire it. It is more likely that that would be held constitutional.",25
162,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"Wentworth) [12.36] - The clause contains a provision which must be held to be bad the moment it is examined. The assessment upon which a State may take over iron works is to be submitted, in the case of dispute, to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. That is an extraordinary condition for us to seek to impose upon the freedom of a sovereign State. Every one of the States has unlimited powers of nationalization, according to such assessment as It may see fit to provide for. Therefore the proposed restriction would be strenuously resisted on constitutional grounds. If honourable members desire to bring about the nationalization of the iron industry at some future date, they will be unwise to. vote for the clause as it stands. As they know that I am opposed to such nationalization, they will, of course, examine most critically what I have to say; but if they let their judgment guide them, they will see that no attempt to prevent the States from taking such action as they may desire will be effective. I sympathize with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in the demand that the Government should put into plain language its oftenexpressed desire to assist the nationalization of the iron industry at some future date. If it does not, he and those who have suffered with him in the past' will be justified in believing that the maze of words which has been put forward has no other design .than to bring about an adverse judgment when the measure is tested in the Courts of the country.",25
163,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"Kooyong) [12.40] - I have from the first consistently supported the proposal to grant a bounty for the production of iron. But, as we progress, the Government give way more and more to those who favour the nationalization of the iron industry. Therefore, if this clause is passed, I shall feel compelled to vote against the third reading of the Bill . A practical point to which I direct attention is this : A large amount of money must be invested to make the iron industry a success. A large expenditure has already taken place at Lithgow; but if enterprises are to be opened up in Tasmania or South Australia, further large sums of capital must be invested. No one with capital would enter into these enterprises should the proposed clause be agreed to. No capitalist would risk losing the results of his ability and information by the taking over by a State of an enterprise in which he had invested money. It has been frequently alleged that the Bill is designed to assist only one firm-that now operating at Lithgow-and unquestionably that must be its effect if the clause is agreed to, because no other firm will enter the industry. Those who have invested in the Lithgow works have shown commendable enterprise, and are committed to the risks connected with it ; but no new firm would invest capital under the proposed conditions. If the bounties are to operate in the interest of the industry as a whole, this condition should not be imposed.",25
164,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [12.44] - There are several reasons why the Committee should not accept the proposed amendment. purports to confer upon the .Commonwealth or the State power to take over the industry. Whether we have that power or not depends not upon any enactment of our own, but upon the words of the Constitution. We certainly cannot confer power upon a State to do it , as the State's power depends upon its own Constitution read in conjunction with the Federal Constitution.",26
165,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Then why this clause?,26
166,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,The clause provides for a bond by which the person undertakes to convey the property to the State if the State wants it.,26
167,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"If the States have the power to take over an industry already, why put it in the bond?",26
168,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"The States' power of acquisition-thei r ""right of eminent domain""-is exercised under their general powers, in accordance with their laws. Under the States Land Acquisition Acts there is - a regular form of procedure. To accept this amendment would be an assumption on our part of the right to confer this power upon a State. amendment also purports to give the Commonwealth power to take over the industry; but we cannot confer power upon ourselves by a declaration in our own Statutes. The Iron Bonus Commission was very full y advised at the time by the Attorney-General that the Commonwealth had no power to nationalize industries, and that advice is fully set out in the Commission's report.",26
169,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,The Constitution may be altered.,26
170,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,Possibly ; but we cannot anticipate that in our legislation.,26
171,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Will the honourable member say that, in case of necessity, such as an impending war, we should have no power to control such an industry to enable us to secure the means of defence?",26
172,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"Undoubtedly , incidental to our power of defence,, we could, if it were thought necessary, manufacture our own arms and ammunition in our own factories, such as we propose to erect now.",26
173,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,We could also have a blast furnace.,26
174,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"We could for that purpose ; but that is not the honourable member's present proposal. He does not suggest now that we should acquire the iron industry for a specific defence purpose, but asks that we should take it over and It run it as an ordinary business.",26
175,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,We could sell our surplus production.,26
176,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member does not provide for the acquisition of this factory, and the appropriation of the necessary money to conduct it, for the manufacture of arms and ammunition for defence purposes, but wishes to assert the power of the Commonwealth to step in and acquire a running concern which a business man is carrying on as an ordinary citizen.",26
177,Mr HALL,MANUFACTURES,"This amendment will give us the power, subject to the Constitution.",26
178,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"Perhaps so; but the very clear rule of interpretation of Statutes laid down by the Courts is that if you purport to exercise a power which is wider than the absolute grant of power in a Constitution, and the clauses are not severable, the whole Act is void. Speaking from memory, I think that was recognised in the trade marks case in America. Congress had power to legislate as to trade marks so far as Inter-State trade was concerned, but they did not confine themselves to that. They attempted to exercise the power generally, and the Court held The that the whole Act was unconstitutional. The wording of the proposed amendment is absolutely outside our constitutional powers. Apart from that, its language is very uncertain; but, of course, if that were the only trouble, the wording could easily be altered. It is a matter of principle that causes the Government to oppose the amendment.",26
179,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Then the honourable member is opposed upon principle to the nationalization of the industry?,26
180,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,I am opposed to making thisamendment in the Bill because it purports to confer a power which the Constitution does not warrant. The honourable member for Angas pointed out that if there are any' unconstitutional provisions in the Bill we run the risk of having the whole of it declared bad.,26
181,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Angas said that the Bill already contained unconstitutional provisions, and instanced this very clause.",26
182,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Angas said he questioned whether this - clause was not unconstitutional, but he had 110 doubt about the amendment being so. In the circumstances, we cannot accept it .",26
183,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [12.52] - I - now move That all the words down to the word "" goods,"" line 13, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" From the .person or persons claiming any bounty in respect of pig iron, puddled bar iron, or steel, the Commonwealth or any State shall have power to take - over the lands, buildings, premises, machines, plant, and equipment of any kind used in connection with the manufacture of the goods at any 'time within twelve months after the date of the expiry of the bounty with respect to that class - of goods.""",27

Amendment amended accordingly.",27
186,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [12.55] see no harm in the proposal contained the clause as it stands, that any person receives the bounty should give his bond the Commonwealth to allow a State to acquire the industry. The provision is objectionable, because the State need take action unless it chooses. It is entirely to the State, and I am inclined think that the State has power to take over any such industry by its own legislation, unless some Commonwealth law is superior to the State law in that respect. But we have no Commonwealth law enabling to take over any particular industry in a State, the State law would be supreme, and without this clause the State could at any time take action. The only benefit of the - clause is that it puts the person accepting the bounty, as it were, "" o n notice."" If the State did resume his works, he could not demand compensation from the Commonwealth on the ground that when he accepted the bounty he understood that he would be allowed to go on continuously under the same conditions.",27
187,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,That security against a claim for compensation is not granted to the Commonwealth by the clause; it is granted only to* the State.,27
188,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,I suppose the honourable member wishes to give to the person receiving the bounty a. similar notice on behalf of the Commonwealth to that given on behalf of the State?,27
189,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Exactly .,27
190,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,I am against any such pro,27
191,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,But it is the same,27

If honourable members opposite can induce the majority of the people to sanction an of the Constitution in the direction of Commonwealth industries, well and twelve. good; but at present I am not of the oopinion that I should help them towards that object. The notice given by the clause is sufficient in any case, because it would cover the case of the Commonthat wealth should the owners of the works which claim compensation from the Commonfor alleged losses, on the industry being nationalized a few years hence. It would be a perfectly equitable and sufficient answer to say that in the Act itself I the owners were given fair notice that a in State could take over the works, and that who that implied that the Commonwealth could to take them over. The clause, in safeguarding the future with reference to the power unof the State, incidentally safeguards the not exercise of the power of the Commonleft wealth, if the Commonwealth does only to that which the State has a right to do.",27

I did not vote in the last division because I was under the impression that I had promised to pair with the honourable member for Melbourne; but I have since been given to understand that that honourable member arranged a pair with the honourable member for Hunter. But for that misunderstanding on my part I should have voted against the amendment.,28
195,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,"Corio) [2.20] - It seems to me that the intention is that the posedState may take over the industry at anytime from now until the expiration of the bounty period. The words used in the of clause areI f so required by the Government of the State within twelve months after the date of expiry of the bounty. It seems to me, therefore, that there is a limitation to within twelve months after the expiry of the bounty, and that notice of action by a State could not be given at an earlier date-that the words really limit the action to the date of the expiry of the bounty and twelve months afterwards. AYES. Mr GROOM - I think that the clause is clear as at present, but if there is a desire to alter it, there will be no objection to inserting the words "" before or "" before the words ""within twelve months.""",28

202,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,Adelaide) [2.28] We have had no explanation why these' words should be excised.,28
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,A new clause is to be proposed which is drafted in more definite language.',28
204,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"It seems to me that the words of the new clause, to which the .honourable gentleman refers, give the optionrto the Minister of paying rates of wages that are less than those paid in the industry at the present time. "" below the standard rates paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured "" are exceedingly wide and indefinite, and so play into the hands of the employing section that it is open to question whether the new clause is any improvement. The Bill as it stands is reasonably clear, inasmuch as the rate of wages shall be that prescribed by a State or a Commonwealth tribunal, whereas in the proposed new clause no such standard is provided, the matter being left entirely to the Minister. If I may take as a criterion the attitude of the Minister in desiring this great liberty, then the outlook for the employees is not a very good one. The Minister in suggesting this amendment seems to me to indicate the absence of a desire on his part to do anything of a specific character beneficial to the employees. In exercising this optional power, he would be controlled by the words "" below the standard rates paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured."" The whole trend of legislation of late has been to place the determination of rates of wages in the hands of what are, at any rate, nominally impartial tribunals, because the prevailing standards in different localities have been so wretchedly low. Yet we are asked by this new clause to perpetuate a system against which the whole trend of the legislation of the States and the Commonwealth Parliaments has been fighting for a number of years. Surely the Minister has not carefully considered the proposed new clause?",28
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I have.,29
206,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable member contemplate having a lease in perpetuity of the Treasury bench?,29
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It would be a good thing for the country if I had.,29
208,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,That is open to debate.,29
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Will the honourable member permit me to explain?,29
210,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,I should be pleased to have an explanation.,29
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Hume-Trea surer) [2.33] - I should like to point out that there will be no compulsion on the part of the Minister to prescribe the rates of wages.,29
212,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"Evidentl y the honourable member's original, proposal was very weak.",29
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I would remind the honourable member that it was in The words serted hurriedly when the B i ll was before the Committee last session. It was introduced at the suggestion, I think, of the honourable member for Wide Bay.",29
214,Mr BOWDEN,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member for Parramatta.,29
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"At all events, the words were hurriedly inserted. The amendment that I now propose provides that the Minister must, first of all, consider whether the rates of wages paid in the industry are below the standard prescribed by any Commonwealth or State industrial authority. It is only ii> the absence of such a standard that he is to step in and say to the employers, ' ' You must pay"" the standard rates of wages prevailing in the locality.""",29
216,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"Why should not the Minister take upon himself the responsibility of stipulating what wages shall be paid, just as has been done in the case of the sugar industry ?",29
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"We have had a good many complaints in.that connection. Even if I did propose that the Treasurer should stipulate the wages to be paid, objection would be raised.",29
218,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,That is what has been done in connection with the sugar industry.,29
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"And objection has been taken to it. Under the proposed new clause, the award of a Commonwealth authority will first of all govern the wages to be paid. It is only in the absence of an award by a Commonwealth or State authority that the Minister is to have power to say what wages shall be paid. I think that the. honourable member for Adelaide will admit that he was not quite fair to me, when he said that the amendment did not indicate any strong .desire on my part, to secure the payment of reasonable wages. ""My chief object in submitting it is to allow the rates of wages to be determined by a Commonwealth or a State authority, and to strengthen rather than to weaken the position of the men. I am informed by the Attorney-General that there is a similar provision in the Sugar Bounties Act. In that Act it is provided that, if the Minister finds that the rates of wages are below the standard rates paid in the district in which the sugar is grown, for similar white labour in the industry, then the Minister may withhold any part of the bounty.",29
220,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"But there are any number of sugar farmers, whereas there are not several iron smelting firms.",30
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I think that the position of the men is. safeguarded by the provision as to the rates of wages being those prescribed by any Commonwealth or State industrial authority. It is only in the absence of such an authority that the Minister is to step in.,30
222,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"Adelaide) [2.37] That is precisely the contention against which I argue. I contend that there should not be given to the Minister the alternative power, in the absence of an award by a Federal or State tribunal, to prescribe the rates of wages prevailing in the locality. If we are to allow that option, then some of the States Governments, as they exist at present, will not put into operation a tribunal of a character likely to regulate the wages in a reasonable manner ; neither will there be an incentive to move the Federal tribunal into action. It will be contended that there is no occasion to move into action either a Federal or a State tribunal, since the Minister has power to prescribe the rates of - wages.",30
223,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURES,What does the honourable member propose?,30
224,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,I prefer the clause as it stands to that which the Treasurer now proposes.,30
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That merely gives power to make regulations.,30
226,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"I know that everything will depend upon what is prescribed. Under the clause, as it stands, the Treasurer, or the Government for the time being, must prescribe in accordance with the terms of an award of a State or Federal tribunal. That is reasonably fair; but if this alternative power, be given",30
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It is not an alternative.,30
228,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,Unquestionabl y it is. .,30
229,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member said just now that it was an option.,30
230,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"If I used that word, I withdraw it. If the alternative power would give the Minister a free hand, there would not be so much objection to this amendment; but he is not to have a free hand. He is to be restrained in a manner inimical to the interests of the workers in the particular locality where the industry is carried on. He may, first of all, prescribe such rates as are agreed upon by a State or Federal tribunal. Therein he is limited in a manner to which I am not at present taking any exception. But in the event of his having to resort to the alternative suggested in His new. amendment, he will be limited in a manner that calls for the most severe condemnation. He must be guided, in fixing the rates of wages, by the standard rates paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured. Surely there can be no desire to revert to a position in respect of wages against which every Legislature in Australia has been fighting for a a number of years. Whilst I am prepared, irrespective of whether or not I believe in the absolute sincerity of the Ministry that I may be supporting, to let the Minister for the time being prescribe a reasonable rate of wages, I am not prepared to have the Minister limited in this way. The standard rate of wages prevailing, say at the Blythe River, may be entirely different from that prevailing at Lithgow. Where then is the use of the bounty if the Minister may not act as he would desire but is to be limited to prescribing the rates of wages that prevail in those localities? The workers at Lithgow are at present receiving, I understand, somewhat better wages than are paid in Tasmania. The Treasurer, with an apparent show of sincerity",30
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Do not insinuate.,30
232,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"I am not committing myself any further than that. Surely I am generous in saying that, with an apparent display of sincerity, the Treasurer stated yesterday that this was not a bounty for any particular firm or locality. He named, with some degree of force, a district in Tasmania, where there was every probability of the industry starting."" So much confidence had he in the deposits of ore there, that he said had he the funds he would immediatelv invest in the Tasmanian venture. In the event of his having to resort to the alternative of fixing the rates of wages in accordance with the standard prevailing in the different. localities, what would be' done ? Being limited in the exercise of the power to prescribing the rates of wages prevailing in the locality, he would be forced to provide for the payment of wages, in the one case according to the standard prevailing at Lithgow, and to provide for the observance of an entirelydifferent rate prevailing in Tasmania. The Treasurer is asking for a specific power, and plausibly telling us that which he now seeks is better than that for which provision is made in the clause as it stands, meaning thereby that the employees are likely to get better conditions under the suggested amendment than under the clause in the Bill. The Minister is forced to admit that, should he be put to the necessity of exercising the alternative which he praises, the rates of wages in one part of the Commonwealth may be 7s. a day, and in another part, 5s. 6d. That would cause an outcry on the part of those receiving the smaller amount. A firm compelled to pay the higher rate would complain of the unfair competition of those paying the lower rate. Then, no doubt, another measure would be introduced, as loosely drafted as this is, and, after about eight years of cussion and postponements, the proposals of the Ministry would be entirely altered by an amendment suggested in Committee. I hope that honourable members will force the Minister to prescribe that the rates of wages shall not differ. The peaceful conduct of the industry would be impossible if other works started and paid rates of wages differing from those paid at Lithgow.",30
233,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURES,"West Sydney) [2.48] To my mind, bounties should not be paid to employers whose wages were below the standard rates prescribed by a Commonwealth or State authority, and the provision, that the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable, should be amended by the substitution of "" shall "" for "" may."" No bounties should be paid to a firm whose rates of wages were lower than the standard rates paid in the localitv in which it was manufacturing.",31
234,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"Angas) [2.50] - ! do not think that it matters much whether we use the word "" may "" or the word "" shall,"" the rule of law being that, where it is provided that a Minister may do something if certain conditions are complied with, it is obligatory upon him to do it.",31
235,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,"Do nof the words ""may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty"" suggest, that the Minister will have a discretion?",31
236,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"No . It seems to me lhat the word "" may "" has been used to give the Minister the opportunity to say to a firm, "" Unless you pay the standard rates of wages you will not receive the ""bounty."" Perhaps the use of the word "" shall "" would put him in a fix. I understand that this new provision is being substituted for the old, because of objections of some weight which were taken to the original proposal. Power is given to make regulations not inconsistent with this Act, and "" in particular for "" certain prescribed purposes. A doubt was expressed as to whether the words "" in particular "" did not mean "" of the same class."" If they did not, regulations as to wages would be ultra vires. Now that a separate clause giving the power to make such regulations has been drafted, the right of the Minister to act is beyond dispute. No doubt a large power is to be vested in the Minister, who will occupy a difficult position in having to decide whether bounties shall be payable. I suggest that there should be an appeal against his decisions to the Presidisdent of the Court of Arbitration, whether he finds that wages are adequate, or that they are below the standard. ' The Minister will occupy an invidious position. Personally, I do not like to give discretion to Ministers where payments involving thousands of pounds are concerned.",31
237,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"Boothby) [2.55] I do not see that the substitution of ""shall "" for "" m a y "" . will make much difference, but I think that the words "" if the Minister finds"" ought to be left out of the proposed new clause. We do not desire that months, or perhaps a year or two, shall be permitted to pass, as in the case of the Harvester and Spirit Excise Acts, while the Minister is informing himself.",31
238,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"A similar provision has operated well in connection with the Sugar bounty. "" Mr BATCHELOR - It is not likely that a Minister, in giving effect to the Sugar Bounty Act, would be swayed by any sort of influence. I think that the provision should read If the rates of wages, or any of them, are below the standard rates, the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. It should not be for the Minister to decide whether the proper rates are being paid.",31
239,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,Then who should decide?,31
240,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"It would be a question of fact, and the Minister should act upon the matter being reported to him. He should not exercise a discretion, if the rates of wages were below the lowest prescribed by any Commonwealth or State authority.",31
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,The Minister cannot move until a matter is reported to him.,31
242,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"In connection with the Harvester and Spirits Excise Acts, nothing was done, although the Minister was repeatedly urged, in this Chamber and elsewhere, to take action. The Spirits Excise Act provided that if , on a certain date, the Minister found that certain rates of wages were not being paid, he should impose Excise duties; but he did not institute his inquiries until that date had expired, and probably has not yet informed himself on the question. Were the provision amended as I have suggested, the direction to the Minister would be stronger than it is now. Should the Minister be allowed to use his discretion, it would be implied that initiative lay with him, and I regret to say that experience has shown that it .is not safe to trust Ministers with discretion in a matter like this.",31
243,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"Hiridmarsh) [2.58]. - As the honourable member for Boothby agreed to- has pointed out, our experience in giving a Minister discretion in a case of this sort has not been satisfactory. In connection with the sugar industry, the Minister was asked to say whether a rate of £ 1 2s. 6d., which has given the greatest dissatisfaction facture. to the employees, was satisfactory. rates of wages, or any of them, are below posedthe standard prescribed, the Minister ought not to pay the bounty. Parliament should make that the law. Then employees who thought they were getting insufficient, employees could complain to the Minister, and the employers would also state their case, when the Minister would hear wages, both sides, and decide ingly. The Minister would act without such having to find out the wages for himthe self. It is too much to expect a Miniswithhold ter with all his other duties to constitute payable. himself a Board of inquiry to ascertain what wages are being paid all over the Commonwealth. I know that in a previous case posedI asked the Minister to take action month after month, and actually brought of persons who were not complying with the Act, but still he would not move.

It is highly probable that the first part of the sub-clause will come into operation in New South Wales, because we have those industrial authorities in that State, although some of the workers repudiate the particular industrial authority which is in force there at present. I understand from the honourable member for Nepean that the iron workers have accepted the Act and are ready to form a Board. M.r. J. H . CATTS-What about Tasmania, where there is no Wages Board?",32
248,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Where there is not an industrial authority, the latter words of the clause do not, I am afraid, suggest any possible standard. We cannot have a standard unless there is an industry in which wages are being paid that would form the basis of a standard. If iron works were established in Tasmania I am afraid that there would be no standard there to apply to that kind of industry.",33
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I hope that before this Act has been in operation very long we shall have a Commonwealth standard which will cover everything.,33
250,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"That would involve an alteration of the Constitution, which may not be approved. If honourable members are prepared to accept statements such as the Treasurer has just made, as if they were actually amendments of the Constitution, they should be reminded that their experience in that direction has been rather disappointing. We should not put the people who are going to invest their capital in this industry in an uncertain position as to their right to get the bounty, because the whole benefit of the bounty system is destroyed unless there is a carefully established method by which compliance with the conditions will enable the bounty to be earned. Unless there is ai proper standard in the Act, some unreasonable Minister, if the matter is left to his discretion, may create endless difficulty, which would prejudice the position of those in the industry. I do not think, however, that that would occur, as every Minister would be anxious to administer the Act in a liberal spirit. But the difficulty remains that, outside of States which have industrial authorities, there can be no standard in this particular industry. It is a pity to pass legislation",33
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It is the best we can do.,33
252,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"But where there is no standard, what is to be done? If the matter is left to regulations, the Ministry have a safeguard. They need not make a regulation for Tasmania, where there is no standard, and then no difficulty would arise. Under Regulations, the power is a discretionary one, which need not be exercised, and, if exercised, can be revoked. But we are now asked to put the provision in the Act as part of the law.",33
253,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"Angas) [3-13] - I am afraid the amendment will make the position worse for the Minister than before. If these words are left out, the Minister's power to withhold the bonus will depend upon his being able to show that the rates of wages are below a certain standard. If he has no power by regulation to show that, how is he to find out? The absolute duty will be cast on him, no matter what he surmises that the wages may be, to pay the bounty. If , however, we leave these words in, the Minister can say, "" I find that the wages are not up to the standard, and therefore I will not pay the bounty."" It will be a mistake to strike them out. The first part of the clause might stand as it is, and then we might go on to provide that if the claimant does not satisfy the Minister, or, on appeal from the Minister, say, the President of the Court of Arbitration, that the wages are up to the standard, he shall not receive the bounty.",33
254,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"Hindmarsh) [3.14]. - If these words are left in all that the claimant has to do is to certify the wages he is paying, and then the Minister can pay the bounty. The clause does not stipulate that the claimant shall pay a fair wage. So long as he certifies to the Minister the wages that he is paying, the Minister must pay the bounty, unless he takes the trouble to find out for himself that the wages are not fair. How is the Minister going to find that out? What we desire to d is 0 to take away the responsibility from the Minister, and leave the claimant to prove that he pays proper wages. The more we look into this new clause, the more unsatisfactory it appears ; and we should have been better advised had we retained the original provision.

255,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [3.19] - I must point out a fact which I do not think has been generally noticed. I am sure that the object which the honourable member for Maranoa 'had in view in submitting his amendment last night, met with general approval; but, however willing I may be to join in generous treatment of the Mother Country, it is novel to offer a bounty on the manufacture of something in another part of the world.",34
256,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,The amendment now proposed does not do that.,34
257,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"It does indeed, as the words show. The finished product of wire netting consists of wire which is Total Amount netted ; and the 10 per cent, ad valoremDate of which ma y be Rate of Bounty. Expiry of will cover the value of the English-made Bounty. wire as well as the value of the Australian* authorized . made wire netting.",34
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,The netting will not be made from wire from Australian ore^ but from imported wire.,34
259,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"That confirms my position. I do not know the values; but to the extent 1913 of the value of the wire, we shall be giving a 10 per cent, bounty to the Englishmaker. However, if that be the desire of honourable members, of course the responsibility must be left with them.",34
260,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"This was agreed to last night. £50,000 1st January, 11)11 Mr Reid - No one can say that we agreed to give a bounty on a materialmanufactured in another country; at any. rate, I arrived at no such agreement.

WILLIAM LYNE)",34
261,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MANUFACTURES,"Fawkner) [3.21] The Minister would have done well 10 adhere to his original proposal, even supposing he had paid a little too muchbounty. This would have enabled themanufacturers in Sydney to compete with the manufacturers of the imported article,, with the result that farmers and pastoralists would have got cheap wire netting. However, this proposal having been made LYNE) by the Government, I think our best courseis to support it.",34
262,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"Cook) [3.22] - The leader of the Opposition has done quite, right in pointing out the mistake we are making in adopting the amendment proposed by the Treasurer. I think, however, that the right honourable gentleman ought to give us an opportunity to vote on a further amendment, to carry out the ideas he has expressed. It seems rather ridiculous for an honourable member to complain of a provision in a Bill , and not be prepared to suggest an alteration. I appeal to the right honourable member to give us a chance to so vote as to confine the bonus to the Australian-made",34
263,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"Angas) [3.25] - The correct way of arriving at the true value of the additional manufacture of the article as a basis for the.bonus would, I think, be to follow the Canadian principle, and provide for a different rate where the com(modity is made from imported raw material. However, it would be a pity to split hairs, because, all through, we have recognised the principle of giving two or three bonuses-that is, we give a bonus on the puddled iron, on the wire, and on the wire netting. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat Class 3 be left out.",34
264,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"I desire to move the recommittal of the second column of the schedule, or, failing .that, to speak on the motion to report progress.",35
265,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,"I point out that if the honourable member moves that progress be reported, the question must be put without debate.",35
266,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,The Treasurer gave us to understand that there would be an opportunity to discuss the rates of bounty.,35
267,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,"I point out that we have just dealt with the schedule, and that that was the time when the honourable member should have raised any objections he has. Bill reported with further amendments.",35
268,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"Is it the pleasure of honourable members that the remaining stages of the Bill be taken forthwith? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. Motion (by Sir WILLI AM LYNE) proposed - That the reports be now adopted.",35
269,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,I desire to know whether I should be in order in moving that the Bill be recommitted for the consideration of the second column of the schedule. I understood from the Minister that he would give us an opportunity to discuss the schedule.,35
270,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,So I did; but was not going to discuss it.,35
271,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,It is quite competent for .the honourable member for Cook to move such a motion as he has indicated.,35
272,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"Cook) [3.28] - I wish to move That the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering the second column in the schedule. The leader of the Opposition stated that he would be prepared to assist honourable members in obtaining some explanation as to why the bonus should be 12s. per ton, when the loss was admitted to be only 3s. As I have already said, I understood that there would be an opportunity presented for the discussion of this matter.",35
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,So there was.,35
274,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"But all that .the Treasurer dealt with were the third and fourth columns of the schedule, and I was not aware that we were at liberty to discuss the second column.",35
275,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The whole schedule was under discussion. LYNE) Mr JH CATTS - Not so; because thf Bill was recommitted to reconsider columns of the schedule, but not the column specifying the rates of bounty. However, I simply now desire to protest that we are about to pay a bounty of 12s. when the loss to .the manufacturer isonly 3s.",35
276,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,East Sydney) [3.29] - I have since satisfied myself from factsj. that 12s. is not an unreasonable amount. I have only just now received the information.,35
277,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,Fro m whom?,35
278,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"From the honourable member for Nepean; and I shall read the figures. There is a loss of 3s. on themanufacture at Lithgow, which I may point out is not a manufacturing town in> the neighbourhood of Port Jackson. Ie is on the other side! of the Blue Mountains,, and even at the special rates granted for the benefit of the industry, the cost of carrying iron, thence to Sydney, where it begins to compete with iron from abroad, is 6s. per ton. That, added to the loss of 3s. per ton on the production of the iron before it reaches Sydney, makes a total' of 9s. per ton. There is an additional, cost in carrying it to Melbourne and to Adelaide, and a still further cost in conveying it to Fremantle. The cost of 6s. per tento convey the iron from Lithgow to Sydney, added to the loss of 3s. per ton onI .the iron at the works, gives us a total of 9s. per ton, which comes very close to the 12s. per ton bounty, for which provision is made, and which is not unreasonable, if the manufacturers are to obtain any interest on their capital.",35
279,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"What an argument that"" would' be for' the adjustment of protectionist duties if the honourable member wereon this side of the House.",35
280,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I have always said that the advantage of granting bounties for theencouragement of industries-whic h is a. national policy-is that under such a system the nation, and not the individuals. who patronize the industry to which it relates, has to bear the burden. It has always seemed to me to be a hideous injustice that the individuals who patronize the industry should to bear the burden of any increased expense resulting from action taken to encourage it . bounty system it is the nation that pays, and ought to pay; the buyer is not handicapped or penalized by encouraging the industry. If honourable members were prepared to vote for the encouragement of the sunflower industry they ought surely to be ready to grant a bounty on the production of iron. I am satisfied now that the rate per ton proposed to be given is perfectly fair and reasonable. Question resolved in the affirmative. Reports adopted. Bill read a third time.

283,Mr FISHER,THE GOVERNMENT AN D THE,"I desire to intimate to the House, and to the country, that which I have already privately intimated to the Prime Minister: that the Labour Party can no longer support the Government. I can only say that our relations with the Ministry, personally, have been of the most friendly character. Although from time to time embarrassing circumstances bave arisen, we have always endeavoured to co-operate in every possible way with the Government in regard to matters that we thought concerned the welfare of the - Commonwealth. There tions of embarrassment in which I have always sought, to the best of my ability, his to safeguard the interests of the Parliathey ment, and the well-being of the country. in this House. Whilst I freely admit that we have freThe quently felt the restraint that a large party such as ours must feel in difficult circumstances, I , personally, have always held that, occupying the position that we do, must treat any Government situated Ministry is, in a perfectly straightforward manner. We. are taking this course now, because it is, to our minds, one, of decency, and of order. The time might have come when one party or the other might take such action as would create a crisis, in circumstances that would render it imUnder the possible for the country to learn exactly how the situation arose. I have endeavoured, whilst safeguarding the interests of the 'Commonwealth, to restrain within reasonable bounds any adverse criticism, and now that I can no longer do that, I think that I am performing what is more a public than a party duty in telling the House and the country the determination at which we have arrived. I have stated our position as plainly as I can, and have only to add that in taking the course which I did during a previous crisis, I had the support of my party, the members of which felt that until at least the Tariff was dealt with there rested upon us the public duty of giving the Government a reasonable support in every situation that a party placed as they were and are might find themselves in .",36
