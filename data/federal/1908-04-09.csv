Progress report (No. 1) presented by Sir JOHN QUICK, and read by the Clerk, as followsThe Select Committee appointed to join with a Select Committee of the Senate to inquire and report as to the best procedure in cases of Privilege and other matters have the.honour to report that they have made progress, and request leave to report the Minutes of Evidence from time to time. JOHN QUICK, Chairman. Committee Room, gth A p r i l , 1908. Report adopted. Mr KELLY"" - The libellous statements of the Bulletin, alleging that bribery has taken place in connection with members of this House,- were, I think, brought under the notice of the Prime Minister by the Secretary to the Sydney Chamber of Manufactures, of which, I understand, Mr. Beale, who has also made grave charges against honourable members, is the President. Has the Prime Minister received a letter on the subject from Mr Beale, and will he lay on the table all the correspondence relating to it?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not know that the statements referred to contain libels of honourable members, nor am I aware that Mr Beale is the present President of the Sydney Chamber of Manufactures. I have not received a letter from him on this subject.",15
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will the honourable member lay on the table the letter from the Secretary to the Chamber?,15
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Certainly . FEDERAL CAPITAL SITES.,15
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I beg to ask the Prime Minister if he will request the Premier of New South Wales to have a return furnished, showing, of areas within .twenty miles of Dalgety and Canberra respectively : (1) The persons to whom Crown lands have been alienated since ist January, 1902 ? (2) The (persons to whom real estate other than Crown lands has been transferred since ist January^ 1902? {3) The present holders of .real estate? .?4) The present holders of leases convertible into freehold?",15
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I shall do so. FRUIT-GROWING AT COOMA.,15
6,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if it is a. fact that he has received a telegram from Cooma stating that, after years of effort, they have at last succeeded in growing there a wonderful citron melon, weighing no less than 34 lbs. ? MILITARY OFFICERS' UNIFORMS.",15
7,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The Inspector-General of the Military Forces, in his report circulated today, states that the minimum approximate cost of a junior officer's uniform is £ 4 4 8s. 6d., in which is included £ 4 for a sword, a weaponthat for actual use has been discarded in the British Army for more than ten years. Does the Minister of Defence propose to embarrass new officers obtaining commissions with unnecessary expenditure of this kind?",15
8,Mr EWING,Unknown,"As the Prime Minister has informed Parliament, the subject of military dress will be dealt with drastically in connection with the new defence scheme. The present cost of - an officer's equipment is ridiculous. No doubt the sword is an ornament rather than"" a weapon, and the propriety of continuing or discontinuing its use will be considered. PAPERS. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers: Federal Capital Site-Furthe r correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales, ist to qth April, J90S. - Electoral Rolls, New South Wales, 1906 Removals and Additions of Names. IMMIGRATION : PAYMENTS TO DR. ARTHUR.",15
9,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. What amount of money,, if any, has been paid on vouchers issued by Dr Arthur, M.L.A., of Sydney, from the vote for immigration purposes, and what were the particulars of the claims? 2. Did Dr Arthur make any representations to his Department as to the advisablenes of providing for the extensive immigration of Russian Jews, and, if so, will the Prime Minister cause all correspondence relating to this proposal to be laid on the table of the House?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers' to the honourable member's questions are1. The last payment to the Immigration League of Australia, while Dr Arthur was President, was March, 1907. No vouchers were supplied, but it is understood that the money was spent on. oversea advertising. After this financial year it is not proposed to subsidize immigration leagues in Australia. 2. There are no representations by Dr Arthur in respect to the proposal mentioned in the Department. It must be clearly under-"" stood that no person is ineligible as an immigrant because he is a Russian, or a Jew, or both. SUPPLY .(Formal.) POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT : ROYAL COMMISSION. Question - That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply-pro posed.",15
11,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat - Minister of External Affairs) [2.39.] - I move That all the words after the. word "" That"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" the consideration of the Order of the Day be postponed until tomorrow."" The debate on the Capital Site has reached a stage at which it would be highly undesirable to interrupt it, while the plea that the discussion of grievances is urgent cannot be made, seeing that we have only just dealt with the Estimates, and will very shortly have under consideration the Additional Estimates. Every possible grievance in connection with the various, branches of the Service has been, or .can soon be, ventilated. Consequently, I venture to submit that in the interest of public business, and with a view to closing the session within a reasonable period, it is not necessary to set apart today for that purpose, especially as to do so would interrupt the important debate on the Capital Site now proceeding. An arrangement embracing all parties has been arrived at. I trust that my proposal will commend itself to the House. .",15
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I - rise point of order. The Standing Orders profair vide specifically that every third Thursday shall be set apart for this particular motion to go into Committee of Supply,, and I doubt whether the motion can be postwait poned for any time.",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The standing order to which attention has been called is No. 241; and after setting out that the Speaker shall leave the chair when either the Comwhether mittee of Supply or the Committee of less.

Every point in that standing order has been satisfiedThe order of the day has appeared on the third Thursday, and I Department. have read-it us required; and any honourable member, the Prime Minister one, may speak to the' motion, or may move an amendment, as he has done. The whole matter is, therefore, full y in order. Mr HENRY WILLIS "" - Will you, sir, cept an amendment on the amendment receive proposed ?",16

15,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Gwydir) [2.43] - I am more than surprised at the action of the Prime Minister.,16
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean to say that he did not know this amendment was to be proposed?,16
17,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I always say what I mean, and I am not at all inclined to bury any knowledge that I have. For. several months past, in 'the interests of Government business, we have been. deprived of the time usually allotted to private members' business, and we have, therefore, not been able to ventilate some questions of great public importance. I to a do not 'chink that the motion to-dav is & return for the consideration which has hitherto' been shown to the. Government.",16
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Thes e questions have waited so long, that they might well another day until 'the Capital Site question has' been disposed of.",16

I the do not intend to discuss the matter now, be but merely to express the hope that the If Prime Minister will recognise the rights of private members,' and afford them the opportunity to which .'they are entitled.

Telegraph Department: [9 APRIL, 1908.]",16
21,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [2.48].^-!^ too, am surprised"" at the attitude of the Prime Minister. I take the view that no step as that now proposed should be takenthat the recognised order of business should not be interfered with-withou t honourable members having extended to them the courment tesy of a notice of intention to that end on the part of the Government. It is portunity known that opportunity is offered understanding order 241 to honourable members to ventilate questions if and, therefore, I repeat that it would have been only courteous on the part of the Prime Minister to signify his intention submit an amendment of this kind.",17
22,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The proposed postponea ment is only until tomorrow.,17
23,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"When does "" to-mordence ? row ' ' come ? Does the honourable member for Corio think I am simple enough to think that the Prime Minister is likely give honourable members an opportunity toquestion morrow? If the Prime Minister will say that he will allow private members' ness to be debated tomorrow, I shall down.",17
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is not my motion. It is now proposed to go into Supply; private members' business cannot be with in Committee of Supply.,17
25,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Prime Minister knows that it is possible understanding order 241 for an honourable member to introduce certain items of private business.,17
26,Mr SALMON,Unknown,That can be done morrow.,17

29,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I know the honourable member does not ask for any assurance; he is apologizing now for an extraordinary position.,17
30,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I am merely stating. a - fact.,17
31,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In my humble ment, it is not a fact. If the honourable member for Gwydiris not able to introduce his proposal today, it will of course, be postponed the third Thursday fromnow,' and I understand that the' Prime Minister anticipates that the Government be safely in recess. The* Prime Minister had reason to believe that the honourable member for Gwydir, on the motion that vou, Mr Speaker, do now leave Royal Commission. 10403 and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply,, intended to. submit an . such amendment expressing very definitely his views regarding the chaotic state of the Postmaster-Generalls Department, and I ask him whether he thinks that his Governis taking , up a decent attitude in refusing the honourable member the only opopen to him to take; that course ?",17
32,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The amendment before the Chair is that the motion be postponed ithey so desire; until tomorrow.,17
33,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Does the honourable to member think that, if the Prime Minister's proposal were agreed to, we should be in position to discuss grievances tomorrow? Does he not know that Government business in the ordinary course takes prece",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point of to order. The amendment provides that the of the House resolving itself into a Committee of Supply be postponed until busito-morrow. The terms of standing order sit 241, however, are clear, and undoubtedly confine the discussion of grievances on a formal supply motion to the third Thursday' and in every month. That being so, I should dealt like to know, Mr Speaker, whether we should be able. tomorrow to discuss grievances in the terihs of the standing order.",17
35,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If there is any doubt on the question, I should like to ' be heard. The motion that the. House resolve itself tointo Committee of Supply affords honourable members an opportunity to bring ford ; ward grievances. My object in moving its' me an postponement is that we may resume and complete, according to our express understanding, the debate on the Seat of GovernProvided that is done, it is my intention tomorrow to ask the House, in the terms of the amendment, to go into Committee of Supply to deal with the A d ditional Estimates. The consideration of those Additional Estimates will offer exactly the same opportunity for the discussion of judggrievances as does this motion.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But could we proceed with the formal motion tomorrow?,17
37,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member until for Gwydir could move that an item In the Additional Estimates be reduced by j Q i , to enable him .to discuss the Royal Commiswill then sion or any other question. .",17
38,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Bu the could not submit the motion which he has indicated, and the the chair, Prime Minister iknows it.",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"He could take an exactly equivalent course, which would enable the question to be brought forward in a most effective way, and with the same result.",18
40,Mr REID,Unknown,"As a matter of courtesy to the House the Prime Minister should have given notice of his proposal to vary the terms of standing order 241. I a,pprehend that however fully disposed the Prime Minister may be to carry out what he suggests, - there is a serious difficulty in the way, because no resolution of this House can alter the terms of a standing order. The Standing Orders remain supreme. If the course outlined by the Prime Minister were adopted, it would be open tomorrow to any honourable member to call your attention, Mr Speaker, to standing order 241, and in view of its terms I am afraid that it would be your duty, sir, to rule that there could be no discussion of grievances in the House on the motion that you do leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into a Committee of Supply, save on the third Thursday in everv month. Since the honourable member for Gwydir has intimated his intention of taking advantage of the undoubted right possessed by every honourable member understanding order 241, to review the actions of the Governmentsince the honourable member has given notice' or his intention to do so Mr SALMON. - When did he give notice?.",18
41,Mr REID,Unknown,"A few moments ago. Prime Minister only gave notice of his intention to submit the'proposition now before the Chair a few minutes before then. .This difficulty might have been avoided had the Prime Minister taken the House into his confidence yesterday. ' I am afraid that if the honourable gentleman's suggestion be adopted, and a point of order is taken tomorrow,, you will have to rule, Mr Speaker, that under the standing order in question you cannot permit the discussion of grievances on a formal Supply motion on a Friday. I think that since the honourable member has intimated his intention of reviewing the conduct of the Government on this Order of the Day, the Prime Minister is bound, as a matter of dignity, to withdraw his proposal.",18
42,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Then the debate on the Seat of Government Bil l is not to be resumed today ?,18
43,Mr REID,Unknown,I should rather have that bate resumed ,18
44,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It does not seem so.,18
45,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I understand that the Prime Minister contends that if the amendment moved by him is carried there may be an opportunity for the honourable member for Gwydir tomorrow to bring forward what is substantially the same motion as he now desires to submit. Standing order 24T seems to make it fairly clear that there will not be the same opportunity. The honourable member would certainly be unable to bring forward the question in the House, although he might ventilate it in Committee. ' I do not know what his object is, but understanding order 241 every honourable member is intended to have an opportunity to bring forward any grievance in the House while you, sir, are in the chair.",18
46,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,And to press it to a division.,18
47,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"And to press it to a division ' in the House. Although, as suggested by the Prime Minister, the honourable member might be able in Committee to debate the same subject, the initiation of a general discussion upon it in Committee might be totally foreign to the honourable member's purpose. The. standing order readsOn the Order of the Day being read for the Committee of Supply or Committee of Ways and Means, the Speaker shall put the question "" That I do now leave the chair""; but where either of these Committees has reported progress, the Speaker shall leave the chair without putting any question,. on the Order of the Day The being read. In ordinary circumstances there can be no debate in the HousesExcept that while the Committee of Supply and Ways and Means are open, the first Order of the Day on every third Thursday shall be either Supply or Ways and Means, and that on that Order of the Day being read the question shall be proposed - That is in the House""That the Speaker-do now leave the Chair,"" to which question any member shall be at liberty to address the House, or move any amendment thereon. Thus the honourable member would have a full opportunity on such a motion to discuss in the House the subject to which reference has been made.",18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I doubt whether he could do so on the Additional Estimates.,18
49,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It is very doubtf u l j I do not think the Standing Orders de- could be so stretched as to enable him to reach the point that he desires.,18
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I had no hesitation in determining the ruling which I ought to give. I listened to the Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition, and the honPostal orable member for Flinders, because, there seemed to be some feeling in the House, 1 thought that if any light could be thrown upon the matter, I ought not ing to refuse to allow that to be done. My unable hesitating opinion is that the action which has been taken so far is well within the powers and directions of the Standing Order. But, of course, it is most clearas has been pointed out by the honourable member for Flinders, the right honourable member for East Sydney, and the Prime Minister-that the carrying of this .amendposal ment will dispose of grievance-day for weeks, and that whilst the Order of the for going into Supply would-if the amendfor"" ment were carried-be set down for to-morthe row, I should leave the chair upon that Order of the Day being reached without any motion whatever. 'There is no doubt upon that point ",18
51,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does that mean that the consideration of the Seat of Government Bill must be postponed until after grievThe ances have been discussed ?,19
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memment ber will see clearly that we must proceed with the consideration of Supply until a decision has been arrived at upon the amendment submitted by the Prime Minislast ter.,19
53,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Now I understand the action of the Opposition.,19
54,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I trust that the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who was so dogmatic in his utterances a short time ago, has since received a little enlightenment upon the meaning of the standing order to which reference has upon been made. One might have, expected more accurate advice from an ex-Chairman of Committees than was forthcoming. refreshing to' know that the action of the Prime Minister this afternoon was rately designed to prevent the honourable member for Gwydir pressing to a division his motion in regard to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into ministration of the Postal Department. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable years ago. member has no right to say that the Prime Minister's amendment 'was deliberately deupon signed to achieve that result.",19
55,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister himCapital self has admitted that if his amendment carried, the honourable member for Gwydir will be able to ventilate his grievances gard to Postal administration only by moving for a reduction of the amount provided for [369] purposes upon the Additional Estias mates. I have not been a member of thi; House for a number of years without getting beyond the childish stage, and without learnthat it will be impossible for the honormember to obtain satisfaction - by following that line of action. The only wax in which the honourable member can obtain satisfaction is by submitting a definite motion. If the Government are preparec to justify their administration of the Postal Department, why do they not give him an opportunity of bringing forward his pro? But instead of doing that the three Prime Minister practically proposes to Day shelve the motion of the honourable member three xx'eeks, knowing full wel 1 that by end of that period he hopes to be in the safe haven of recess. It is grossly unfair that the Prime Minister should submit an amendment of this character without notice, and thus place honourable members who oppose it under the imputation of delaying the transaction of other important business. Prime Minister has been in office for six years, and yet he has only today manifested this burning anxiety for the settleof the Federal Capital question. H is xvonderful enthusiasm to get that question settled immediately is positix'ely alarming. Strangely enough, it is manifested on the Thursday afternoon upon which pri-' vate members have an opportunity of ventilating their grievances against the Government before going into recess.",19
56,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The honourable member knoxvs that his statement is not correct.,19
57,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Private members have had since Christmas only one Thursday xx'hich to air their grievances, and by common consent that xvas dex'oted to the discussion of the question of old-age penI t is sions.",19
58,Mr STORRER,Unknown,But I am speaking of delibethe Federal Capital question.,19
59,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Does the honourable member deny that the Government have been .in office for a number of years with the adout dealing with that matter? Mr - STORRER - The question was settled,19
60,Mr FRAZE R,Unknown,"When the discussion it is resumed I intend to take up the attitude that the selection of the Federal has already been definitely deterbe mined. But the Government do not take up any such attitude. On the contrary, in reshould the name "" Dalgety"" be deleted from the Seat of Government Bill 'they are willing to begin the xvhole proceedings de novo. I do think that the Government might, at least, have given notice of their intention to move in the direction that the Prime Minister has done.",19
61,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [3.9]' - In listening to the remarks-of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie one might almost be tempted to imagine that the Prime Minister had committed a great wrong. But I would remind him that upon last grievance day the privileges of private members were filched from them by the leader of the Labour Party, who made use of the.verymachinery which the Prime Minister himself is employing today.",20
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,With the encouragement and support of the Government.,20
63,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"To-day the honourable member for Kalgoorlie laments the employment of that machinery by the Prime Minister, although he applauded its use three weeks ago by the leader of the Labour Party. I cannot understand why the honourable member for. Kalgoorlie, who today has littered a tirade of abuse against the Prime Minister for taking away the privilege of discussing grievances,' allowed the leader of his party, on our last grievance day, to do the very same thing. desirous of settling the Capital Site question ; but' I cannot help saying that the Prime Minister has set a bad example in blanketing the honourable member for Gwydir and others who desire to take advantage of the formal motion to go into Committee of Supply. At the same time, I ask what will become of grievance day, if honourable members who have put notices on the business-paper are allowed to withdraw them r.t the last moment, and practically move them as amendments to the motion to go into Committee of Supply. Is it to be in future a case of first come first served? . Mr DEAKI N (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.12] - Yesterday I arrived at an arrangement with all ' the leaders of the House for taking at about half-past 5 this afternoon the division on the proposed amendment in the Seat of Government Bill, so that, if necessary, there could be a final ballot to-night. That agreement embraced all sections of the House.",20
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"When the underat standing was arrived at, 'the fact that would be grievance day was not menconsiderable tioned.",20
65,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is so. . Had it occurred to me then, I should have given notice of my intention to move the amendment, as in the ordinary course would have been my duty. But after the assurances received from all sections, I assumed it to be the desire of the House, as it was the desire of the Ministry, to dispose of the Federal Capital question definitely today. Under the exceptional circumstances of the session, I never anticipated any opposition even today, having found that the grievance motion was due, except from honourable members who desired to submit specific questions for consideration. As in not giving notice of my intention to move the amendment, I have taken them at a disadvantage, and the explicit understanding 1 mentioned is being departed from by the Opposition, the House being threatened with a long debate on the amendment, I beg leave to withdraw it.",20
66,Mr REID,Unknown,I wish to debate the question.,20
67,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,An amendment can be withdrawn only by leave of the House. Is it the pleasure of honourable members that the Prime Minister have leave? Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - I wish to make an I am explanation.,20
68,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Why does not the honourable member say that he wants to block the Seat of Government Bill?,20
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is as mean as 'the speech which we have just heard.,20
70,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"- I shall have to name an honourable member if interruptions continue. The question cannot' be debated. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. . .,",20
71,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) . [3.16].^ ! move That all the words after the-word "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into and. report upon the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone systems of the Commonwealth, and the working thereof."" For some months I have had on the notice paper a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, while another honourable member has given notice of, his intention to move for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I gave notice of my motion the beginning of the session, when 'there this was ample time for the Committee to make progress with the inquiry; but we are now so near to the end of the session that it would be useless to proceed with the motion, because nothing could be done under it. The Prime Minister has told the House that I shall have an opportunity to place my views before honourable members during the consideration of the Additional Estimates, and that I had such an opportunity during the discussion of the ordinary Estimates. That is so; but I did not take that course, because of the importance which I attach to the subject, and because, as honourable members are aware, it could have had no practical result. As to the comparative advantages of a Select Committee and a Cabinet Committee for the purposesof inquiring into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, there can be no question, though the Postmaster-General declared the other night .that a member of the British Parliament once stated that a Committee' could not investigate the affairs of so. intricate a Department. My present action is not taken with a view to censure the Postmaster-General. . I have no quarrel with the Government. My desire is to assist in the solution of a difficult question,, rather than to harass those who differ from me in regard to the method of investigation. The statement of the Postmaster-General was opposed to the practice of a number of British Governments, which have from time to time agreed to the appointment of Committees to investigate postal administration. In 1903, a Committee of private individuals was appointed by Mr Austen Chamberlain to investigate the conduct of affairs by those in charge of the British Post Office! That Committee, although composed of business men, recommended increases in wages and salaries of from 10 to 15 per cent. Parliament, however, decided not to act upon its report. Since then we have had in England the Tweedmouth Committee and the Hobhouse Committee.. The report of the last-named Committee induced the * British Postmaster-General to accept its unanimous recommendations, although they involved an additional expenditure of something like £1,000.000. Mr Buxton, instead of adopting the attitude of our Postmaster-General, thought that, in fairness to both the Department and the public, a Committee should be appointed, and the Hobhouse Committee was appointed on the unanimous vote of the members of the House of Commons. Speaking before the Committee was appointed, Mr Buxton is reported to have said-and I contrast this [369]- 2 statement with that quoted by the Post 1 master-General the other nightWhenhe' took up the honourable position of Postmaster-General it appeared to him that the position was such that the various grades of the: service were entitled, not to the sort of inquiries it had had previously in regard to questions of conditions and pay; but to go before the highest tribunal in this country- a Parliamentary Committee-and ask that they should consider the questions on the evidence put before them, from various quarters, and that their decision should for the moment at' any rate, be taken as final. He was sure whatever may have been the difficulties experienced in the past in this matter, that such an inquiry would do a great deal of good - He felt very strongly that the personal relations between the various grades did far more to lead to a satisfactory settlement of difficult questions than any number of memorials, letters, petitions, and such like, because those sometimes led to misunderstanding, and often aggravated the position. That was the advice of the Postmaster General of Great Britain shortly after his. accession to office. The Commonwealth Postmaster-General has practically just succeeded to the position, and the circumstances here are similar to those which prevailed at Home. And I do not think he could do better than follow the example of Mr Sydney Buxton, and remit the inquiry to a Select Committee or a Royal Commission. The objects I have in view are very similar to those which the British Postmaster-General sought'to attain, as will be seen from the following subjects of inquiry by the British Select CommitteeFavoritism, pensions, sick leave, chief medical officer, sanitation, auxiliary or temporary labour, board of works, promotion, lavatory accommo^' dation, bank holidays, telegraphists' leave, the wages of male telegraphists, Sunday duty of female telegraphists, wages of London postmen, sub-postmasters, provisional inspectors, and provisional overseers. I am sure that any one who has seen the report of that Select Committee would welcome similar results in the case of the Commonwealth Post and Telegraph service. It is not necessary for me to express my own opinion as to those results. It would be better to quote the British Postmaster General on the point. Speaking at Southampton, Mr Sydney Buxton saidThe demand of the staff for the appointment of - such a Committee appeared to me to be a reasonable .one, in view of all that had gone before. The British Postmaster-General, it will be seen, did not propose to appoint any Cabinet Committee,"" but to move for the creation of one of the highest tribunals,, namely, a Select Committee. Before this Select Committee was appointed in England, the various associations of employees-which , very .ightly, are recognised by the authorities in 3reat Britain just as they are in Australia - hel d a referendum as to whether-an investigation of the kind should be asked for. The voting was overwhelmingly in the tffirmative; and thereupon the PostmasterJeneral took action. That honourable gen..leman, in his speech at Southampton, .vent on to sayI therefore proposed, quite early in the first .ession of this Parliament,. the appointment'of i Select Committee, and its appointment was eceived with gratification. And I venture to say that the appointment ->f a Royal Commission, such as I propose, would be received with gratification, not only by the officers of the Department, but .iy the public generally, who have suffered ^ch serious inconvenience during the last few years.

It seems to ever, that those honourable gentlemen could not have realized the extent of the evil is honeycombing this great Department. quoted from no hearsay stories, or from evidence of any who might be described spies, but from the official reports of Department. In answer to me at that time, and apply a remedy. the Postmaster-General said he would have inquiries made, and later he informed that a subsequent report did not endorse the statements I had made However,' a very long time afterwards obtained a copy of that subsequent report, and though I am inclined to think that delivery was unnecessarily delayed, I am the opinion that it does not seriously affect the general question. However that Mr Webster. be, I can inform honourable members that that subsequent report practically endorsed all I had said when I spoke in August last. I - then stated that 32,000 hours of overtime had been worked in the General Post Office, Sydney, by the clerical and other branches; and, on that point, the subsequent report does not deny the fact, but arrives at another conclusion by calculating on a different basis. In the first report the overtime was calculated from half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, whereas in the second report n is calculated from half-past 5 o'clock; and thus, of course, there is a difference in the total number of hours. . If any further proof be needed of the statements 1 made in August last, as to a condition of affairs which has become more intense year by year, I.refer honourable members to the Treasurer's statement that, since that time, 1,500 additional hands have been ap^ pointed in the Sydney General Post Office. That fact speaks much more forcibly than any language at my command.  of these 1,500 additional hands cured the",20
72,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am sorry to say that the mere appointment of men cannot .cure the evils which are so deep-rooted in 1 this Department. According to the Treato surer, there is a still larger number of temporary hands than before, and, though in I may be wrongly informed on. the point, I cannot quite understand the position. I may point out that the 32,000 hours are of overtime in the clerical and other the branches of the General Post Office, Sydney, do not by any means represent the worked by postal officials throughand out the State of New South Wales. That me, howovertime represents about 800 official weeks of labour given for nothing- a wearwhich ing down of men, a breaking of hearts, I and the forcing, of good officials out of the. the service before their time. The Postas master-General and the Government have * the had an opportunity to make full inquiry In the subsequent report to which I have referred the officers me compute the total overtime at 28,030 hours; and this is iust about the figure previously. that would be arrived a't by deducting the I hour as represented by the difference between half-past 4 o'clock and half-past 5 the o'clock in the afternoon. On this point of the reply of the Postmaster-General wasThe hours of overtime - worked in clerical may branches amount to ' 28,030; the period covered being from ist January, 1906, or various subsequent dates, to 30th September, 1907, with one exception, viz., from 9th June, 1905, to 30th September, 1907-and that, with the exception of the usual tea money allowance, no payment for overtime has been made, nor time off in lieu thereof given. I propose now to place before honourable members some details as to the extent to which the system of employing temporary hands has prevailed in the Department, and am sure that the figures I am about to quote will satisfy the House that my complaints in this regard have been well founded. In 1903-4, 1,173 temporary hands were employed in the Department at a cost of £ 7 , 6 5 1 8s. 9 d . ; in 1904-5, 1,459 at a c o s t 3905-6, 1,828 at a cost of £ 8 , 9 1 8 18s. 9d. I come now to the figures for 1906-7, which show that, following upon the complaints made in this House, an effort was made by the Government to redress some of the grievances under which the service had laboured. In that year no fewer than 2,861 temporary hands were employed in the Department at a cost of £ 1 7 , 7 5 2 5s. 6d. The practice of employing temporaryassistance-or , as it is-called in England, "" auxiliary labour ""-wa s very strongly condemned by the Committee which inquired into the administration of the Postal Department of the United Kingdom. There was good reason for its condemnation. In New South Wales the-Department has been literally starved, an'd great inconvenience has been suffered by reason of its failure to train permanent employees _to discharge the duties allotted to higher grades. Temporary hands have been employed all along the line. In many cases the permanent officers would have done better without them. These hands have to be trained - in the work of the Department, and just as their services become valuable they are called upon to stand down for six months or longer and a fresh batch is engaged. That has been the practice for several years. It is unnecessary for me at this stage to deal at length with the evils of overtime, the employment of casual hands, and the many other objectionable features of the service which confront the present Postmaster-General. I have no desire to make this a personal matter. I freely admit that I am pleased with the steps that the Postmaster-General has - taken to redress some of the evils which have so long' existed in the Department. The Treasurer has come to his rescue by providing additional funds, and the action recently taken by the Government proves that our criticisms of the Department have been well founded. I give the Government credit for what they have done recently, but utterly fail to understand why a Committee of the Cabinet, instead of a Royal Commission, should have been appointed to investigate the working of the Department. There is no precedent for the. action of the Government. Whenever the anomalies of the postal service in Great Britain have become so great that the Postmaster-General or Parliament has found it impossible to adjust them, a Parliamentary Select Committee has been appointed to inquire and report. That course °f £ 8 , 2 8 7 9s. 3d. ; and in has been adopted again and again, but here the administration of the service is to.be inquired into by a Cabinet. Committee. - The evident disinclination of the Postmaster-General to state whether that Committee will sit continuously and prosecute its inquiries step by step until the whole administration of the service has been dealt with leads me to believe that that will not be done. It wourd seem that the Minister himself, accompanied by the Secretary of the Department, proposes to proceed to Brisbane to take evidence. S.uch an ' in vestigation cannot be attended by the desired results. In the first place] the evidence that would be forthcoming before a Royal Commission will not be obtained by a Cabinet Committee. The employees of the Department will not run the risk of being penalized by giving evidence before it. If we are to have a full , fair, and complete inquiry, we must have a Royal Commission, which can take evidence on oath and protect the witnesses examined by it - '",22
73,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Even a Royal Commission could not fully protect them; they would become marked men.,23
74,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It would grant them more protection than they could hope to obtain from a Committee of the Cabinet. Another objection to the Government proposal is that the evidence tendered before the Committee will not be given in public. I am sure that the Postmaster-General is sincere in his desire to place the service on a better footing, but in fairness to himself and to the Department, a Select Committee or a Royal Commission should be appointed to make a searching investigation.",23
75,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Why not have a Royal Commission?,23
76,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am moving that a Royal Commission be appointed. Having justified my action in urging the appointtory ment of a Royal Commission, and opposing an inquiry by a Committee of the Cabinet, I propose now to indicate the work that lies before those making the investigation. In the first place, consideration must be given to the requirements of the public in respect of a Department which is really one of the perience. chief arteries of commerce. Through its agency the people of the Commonwealth carry on business with each other and with the rest of the world-they have to make good any deficit in the working of the Desorry for the honourable member. partment-and their interests should be the primary consideration. In the second place, the service itself must be considered; thirdly, attention must be given to the ous, systems prevailing in this and other branches of the Commonwealth service. It is unfortunate that I should have been which exists. called upon to deal with this question at time when honourable members were expectply it with expert information. ing to be called upon to resume the debate on the Seat of Government Bill, and when, according to report, they believed they to be asked to vote upon that measure. a matter of fact, they,should not have pected anything of the kind, since the motion that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply was set down for consideration today. It was with regret that I had to interpose and break the continuity of the debate"" on the Bill, but I felt that the importance of the question with-which desired to deal justified my intervention this stage. We are all familiar with the inconveniences to which the public have to submit, for three or four years, in their dealings with the Department. We have been harassed by inquiries, while comrequire plaints as to the working of the service long been of daily occurrence. In countryGeneral districts, employees of the Department have been working long hours with the object improving the service. For some months I, condenser system. in common with other honourable members, have been endeavouring to secure the rethrough moval of injustices under which employees in the Department labour, and a few days ago was informed that four additional perlines. manent. officers were to be appointed to two offices in my electorate, where there are seven to ten men employed, as well as suffering several temporary hands. My constituents have long been up in arms regarding their treatment by the Department, and have plained with good reason of its failure provide them with"" anything like adequate conveniences. There has been a large numchaos. ber of complaints regarding the unsatisfacphonic Ur. Webster. condition of the telegraph service, and messages have been delayed to an unreasonable extent. In one case, three hours after, sending a telegram to an address 100 miles distant, 1 set out by rail for the town in question, and reached it before the telegram was delivered. That was 'my own ex",23
77,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,I frequently have a similar experience.,24
78,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Then I am very Of course, I may be asked how these evils can be remedied by the appointment of a Royal and Commission. But-1 think it will be convariceded that such a body empowered to take evidence upon oath would be in a position to probe the causes of the disorganizationIt would merely require to a loosen the tongues of officers who can supWe all know very well that what is known as the "".condenser"" system was introduced into were the Department by a previous PostmasterAs General with a great flourish of trumpets. exHe proclaimed it a cheapand effective means of linking up the residents of the a towns with those of the country. But to, day we know that it is little short of a curse. 'It has induced persons to apply for the establishment of exchanges under the impression that they would be able to I communicate with subscribers hundreds of at miles distant in the district around them. ' But, as a matter of fact, they cannot secure had any communication beyond that provided by the local exchange. My own opinion is that, in many places, the telegraph lines to be duplicated if satisfaction is. have to be afforded to the public. In the Post Office, Sydney, I know that the delay for which telegraphists are freof quently blamed lies at the door of the Whilst the operators are endeavouring to "" take "" wires coming on the Morse system, they are interrupted by the telephonic communication which is taking place on the condenser In regard to the telephone service, I need scarcely point out what the public have from been suffering for years. To-day they are from ineffective administration and absolute disorganization. The whole telephone system is in need of radical reform. comThe Department has endeavoured to introto duce too many innovations without making adequate preparation, and the result is With a knowledge of all the telesystems that are in use throughout the civilized world, a previous Postmaster General decided, to introduce the toll .system, under which subscribers were to be .allowed a maximum of 750 calls annually for a fee of £ 5 . But a "" howl "" immediately went up from the Chambers of Commerce and the big business men of the cpmmunity, and this speedily induced the - Minister to climb down, to the detriment of the revenue and of the public generally.",24
79,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the toll system does not pay?,25
80,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I say that it ought to pay far better than it does. The maximum number of calls allowed annually in any Continental country-rnotwithstandin g that their population is so concentratedis only 750. Yet, in a scattered population like that of Australia, the Department has endeavoured to supply subscribers with a cheaper service by allowing them a maximum of 2,000 calls annually.",25
81,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,What does it matter so long as the service pays well ? Surely the honourable member does not want to levy black-mail ?,25
82,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Government are .giving the commercial sections of our great cities the benefit of a telephone service at a lower rate than that charged in countries where the business done is from ten to fifty times greater. Of course, it would be the function of a Royal Commission to inquire into all aspects of postal administration. It will be readily admitted that unless we have a contented service we cannot get a satisfactory service. deal out justice to the officers of this Department if we are to obtain from them a fair return in the form of loyal and efficient service. A Royal Commission would have to inquire into all the evils which have grown up in the Department from the top to the bottom-fro m the secretary of he Central Administration down to the ' little boy who delivers telegraphic messages in connection with a contract post-office. It is exceedingly unfortunate that friction - should exist between the permanent, head, of the Postal Department and the Public Service Commissioner. Unless the department a f head is allowed great freedom we know perfectly well that discipline is impossible, and in the absence of discipline there must be confusion. One of the great evils associated with this Department has been the centralization which has taken place in Melbourne. When the Postmaster-General visits the General Post Office in this city he, perhaps, sees mailmen who are required to work excessively long hours, and he at once issues an order that this abuse is to be remedied. But he cannot see whether a similar state of things obtains in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide .or Perth. Thus the policy of centralization which has been adopted has led to deplorable results. I was extremely sorry to hear the Postmaster-General declare the ""other day that the Deputy Postmasters-General had not been as loyal as they should have been. In other words, he practically charged them with not having done their duty to the best of their ability.. My experience is that the Deputy Postmaster-General for New South Wales, has exercised to the f ull, and as well as he can, the powers bestowed on him - He cannot exercise powers which he does not possess. I have time and again visited his office, to discuss some matter concerning the administration, and although he could tell me what he thought should be done, nothing could be done until the matter, however trivial, had been - referred to Melbourne. We are suffering from centralization in many ways which could be brought fo light only by the investigations of a Commission, and which the Cabinet Committee will not discover. There is great discontent throughout the Postmaster-General's Department, and rightly so. The officers have been treated in a manner calculated to smother ambition, and to deprive them of that content which only fair treatment will give. The service has been over-worked and undermanned, and the chances of promotion are small, so that some of the offiWe must cers have preferred to leave it , although they had spent many years in it, and take nil the risks of striking out afresh in a new life outside. In the clerical branch a great deal of overtime has been worked without reward in the shape of monetary compensation or time off. The Minister promised that these men should be paid for the overtime worked. Eight hundred weeks of overtime have been worked to meet the demands of the Department. Has this overtime been paid for, or has any provisionbeen made for paying for it?",25
83,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It is impossible to make provision on the Supplementary Estimates, but I have promised that it' shall be provided for on the General Estimates,- and the Public Service .Commissioner is cooperating, so that that may be done. The returns are not vet ready.",25
84,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The policy of Ministers is always to postpone. When' Estimates are under discussion, honourable members are always promised that changes will be made, and that everything will be speedily put to rights. But, as a rule, these promises are made merely to obtain supply, and once the ""Appropriation Bill is passed one can complain until he is black in the face without much chance of getting redress. The officials in the country districts are under disabilities which I cannot go into today, because time will not permit. The legitimate complaints and grievances of the officers throughout the service cannot be removed merely by the appointment of additional hands. Notwithstanding the amount of overtime which has had to be worked, men have been waiting in vain for the increments which the law says shall be paid to them. If a Commission of Inquiry were appointed, I could bring forward shoals of complaints. I have a box full in my room. Some of the letters which I have received are from wives of officials whose sympathy for their husbands has compelled them to ask that the bread-winner be relieved from the sweating to which he is subjected. The Postmaster-General, if he makes inquiry, will find that injustice exists in the Telegraphists' Branch at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and Hobart. Many men on the day staff, who are supposed to work only six hours at a stretch, are frequently kept at work for eleven hours without consideration or reward.",25
85,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Not frequently.,26
86,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"-Too'frequently . The answer is on a par with that made to my statement that' 32,000 hours of overtime were worked in 1907. I can give the Postmaster-General an exact statement of the hours which have been worked after the ordinary day's employment. Men have been kept at work all the afternoon, and until 2 o'clock in the morning, without being paid tea money, or being given any concession.",26
87,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,There is provision on the Estimates for making amends to them.,26
88,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"After the trams and trains have ceased running, these .men have had to get to theisuburban homes as best they could, the. Department being mean enough to refuse even a telegram when they wanted to let their wives know that they were detained.",26
89,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I gave instructions that that was to be allowed, and that cabs were to be provided where necessary.",26
90,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I do not wish to be unfair to the Minister; but I am speaking of what I know has occurred.,26
91,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member ought to tell the House that, directly the matter was brought under my notice, I gave instructions that - a stop should be put to the practice.",26
92,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am not making statements which I cannot bear out. It would take me a long time to recite all the Minister's promises, though I admit that he desires to do something.",26
93,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,A great deal has been done.,26
94,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I admit that, too. The appointment of an additional 1,500 permanent hands is evidence that something has been done, though whether wisely or not I cannot say. I could occupy an hour in illustrating the disabilities of the officers in the clerical and professional branches, and in corroborating, from notes I ' have with me, the statements which I have made. The telegraph messengers also complain of the inhuman treatment which they have received. In the country districts they work, as a rule, from 8.30 a.m"". to 10 p.m., and for years the staff has been undermanned, so that they are kept at full tension all the time. The Department does not provide them with overcoats to shelter them from the rain and cold, although messengers'in other parts of the world are so provided, and, further, they have little prospect of advancement. No young man who wishes to make his mark in the world would wish to begin as a telegraph messenger. In regard to holidays and Sunday work, the treatment given by the Department to its officers is such as is not given to the employees of any private firm. It is absolutely devoid of equity. For Sundaywork, the officials of the Telegraph Department get a day of f ; but officers of other Departments are much better treated, and, in many cases, get double pay for Sunday work. Then, in private employment, Good Friday and Christmas Day are generally counted as Sundays, and are paid for. But in the Telegraph Department they are counted as ordinary days. I should now like to refer to the question of the fidelity bonds into which certain of the officers are asked to enter. No doubt these bonds were considered a very good idea when the system was first introduced, but they have proved not to be so equitable as anticipated. All officers who have any financial responsibility are requested to pay a guarantee charge of 5s. a year, and, if an officer also handles State funds, as in the case of the Savings Banks, he has to pay another 5s. I may say that, so far as I know, a charge of this kind is made in no other British Possession.",26
95,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,And at the same time the officers receive no extra pay for doing State work.,27
96,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,And the lowest paid officer has to enter into the same as the highest paid officer.,27
97,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That is so. In master-General England these fidelity funds are vested and managed by, the associations of the employees, and the result is that the charge, on the individual officer is not nearly much as is the case in the Federal service. It officers have to enter into these bonds, they should at least be allowed to administhe ter the funds. I may say that in England al! (he fines imposed on officers for breaches of regulations, and so forth, go to swell the guarantee fund, and this, again, makes the burden lighter all round. matter which I think might well be inthree quired into with a view of ascertaining best system to adopt - There is certainly' no warrant for allowing diese fidelity funds to accumulate beyond the amount necessary to meet requirements, and if the funds were controlled by the associations of employees, individual charges could be reduced, or there might be a distribution of the surplus. I do not propose to deal in detail with all the subjects which suga gest inquiry. There is, however, the questhey tion of furlough, which hasgiven rise serious discontent. According to the reguthe lations, a public servant, after twenty years' service, is entitled to leave of sence for. six months on full pay, or twelve months on half pay; but I am informed, and believe, that the regulation is not equitably carried out-that some men are allowed to exercise the right or privilege while others are not. In 'my opinion, i the regulation be a proper one, it ought be enforced in every case; and here again some inquiry would be useful. Then, in the telephone branch, it is nothing for man to work until 9 o'clock at night conance tinuously ; indeed, that has been the praclowance tice, especially in New South Wales. As I said beforej there is - trouble in most the branches, but I am now only briefly referring to the more striking cases which suggest themselves as proper for investigamonwealth tion. The men engaged in the technical work of erecting and equipping telephone exchanges are placed in the general division, which means that they are unable rise above a cerain standard; and I contend - that these men, being more skilled than are most of the other workmen in the service, ought to be placed in a technical or mechanical branch by themselves. Another grievance is that telegraph messenger boys and letter carriers are taken away from their ordinary duties to go round colbond lecting the money from the penny-in the-slot telephones, which the Postinstituted some time in, ago, and which give you three minutes' conversation for the coin-if you can get your man. By these boys being taken away so from their legitimate work, of which I am sure there is plenty, the Public Service must suffer; and it is a question whether work of the branches should be mixed up in this way, satisfying no one. . As to the mail branch, if any one goes down into the vaults of ' the General Post Office, Sydney, he will find men kept This is a there, owing to the.pressure of work, for or four hours beyond their ordinary the time, with no food provided, and, indeed, no opportunity to eat it if it were provided!",27
98,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,The mail rooms are practically underground vaults.,27
99,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"And the lighting and ventilation are not of the best; indeed, in my opinion, the conditions under which the men of the mail branch work are scandalous, because practically they do not get breath of fresh air during the whole time are on duty. The atmosphere is conto taminated owing to the number of men in place, and the ventilation, as I have already indicated, is quite inadequate. One abof the main branches of inquiry by the .British Select Committee was as to'sanitation and ventilation, and the opinion was strongly expressed that the Government had the duty, not only of paying the public servants, but of seeing that they enjoyed f healthy conditions in their work. "" I should to now like to refer to contract post-offices. If ever there was a deplorable condition of affairs, it is in connection with these a offices. I know an office where the allowis £ 1 0 0 , and another where the alis £1.10, and in the latter case the postmaster has all the telegraphic and posof tal work to do. Out of his allowance he has to provide a messenger, and also accommodation in which to transact the Combusiness; and, naturally, he employs the cheapest labour he can find. Very often, the assistant he employs is a boy thirteen years, of age, who has just left school, and vet that lad is intrusted to with the responsible duties of telegraph messenger and letter carrier. Only the other day, in a district where there is a contract office, the message boy, in going his rounds, saw some of his old schoolmates playing marbles, and joined in, laying, his letorable ters, in the meantime, on the ground. course, this meant delay ; and goodness knows what would have happened had there been a high wind. I merely mention this as an illustration of what occurs this contract post-office system'. The monwealth has no greater right than private individual to expect good service for inadequate pay ; and such allowances I have mentioned encourage sweating the worse type. Then, I have a complaint to make in regard to the Money Office in Sydney, where the public are seriously inconvenienced, owing to the lack of accommodation. The Postmaster-General commendation refer? does not seem to be able to appreciate the growththere has been in the business. While the public, are crying out about inconvenience they suffer, and the employees are complaining of their conditions, the vernment seem to be perfectly satisfied, and unaware that the present-day needs have outgrown the old arrangements and accombe modation. In the Sydney Money Order Office people have to wait a most unreasonreceive able length, of time before they can be tended to, and similar conditions prevail in the'Parcels Post Office. It really ought not to be necessary to point these matters out to those who are responsible for administration. I should like to mention also the dual position of postmaster and electoral officer, the remuneration paid connection therewith, and the need for alteration in the present arrangement. - The inland mail branch of the service calls for an inquiry of the most searching characothers ter, for there are associated with it tions' which would bring a blush of shame to the face of any just man who heard them. The'position of the despatch officers in the Inter-State mails branch is also dePostmaster-General. serving of inquiry. I have a number facts and figures relating to these branches of the service, but it would take too long to put them before the House. I had thought that the Government would agree' to the appointment of a Royal Commission. A point which I should like to emphasize .is that the Hobhouse Committee, in a port which has been accepted by the Postposition master-General of the United Kingdom, made a recommendation which is well wonder worthy of our consideration. We have dea termined that officers of the Commonwealth Service shall be entitled tb a Mr Webster. wage, but we have not recognised that provision should be made to enable our employees on reaching a certain age to assume the full responsibility of. citizenship. Honmembers frequently express a desire Of that the Commonwealth should grow in population and prosperity, but we have not yet thought of doing that which the Hobhouse Committee has recommended-w e under have not thought of granting what is deComscribed by that Committee as ""age pay."" any The Committee recommended that in one class officers up to nineteen years of age as should receive 19s. per week, but that on' of reaching the age of twenty-four years- a marriageable age- they should be entitled Order to 24s. 6d. per ""week.",27
100,Mr REID,Unknown,To what class did that re,28
101,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall be glad tohand over to the right honourable member the a copy of the report. The Commission recommended that a man who had been five Goyears in the service should not receive less than 19s. per week, and that on attaining the age of twenty-four-a n age when he might expected to marry and assume the full responsibilities of citizenship-h e should an increased salary. It recognised at that if a man were not fit for the service , he should not be allowed to remain in it;, that the mere fact that he had"""" passed anexamination was not in itself sufficient. The the granting of "" age pay "" is a development necessitated by present-day conditions. The Government should not only recognise that in employees in the service are entitled to a some reasonable wage, even when they have no .dependents, but that an increased allowance should be granted to those who havedepending upon them for a .livelicondihood. I wish now to refer briefly to amovement on foot in the service to establishof a superannuation fund. The matter is one that calls for inquiry on the part of the Under the present of system employees of the Department arecompelled to assure their lives, and thosereceiving only a small wage find it difficult to make provision for the payment of a large premium. It is all very well to call'upon those receiving, high salaries to pay a* certain premium in respect of a policy of-' reassurance for a certain amount, but theis difficult in relation fo the lower-, has paid men in the Department. Is it any that they should desire to establish superannuation fund ? Parliament should^. take care that the fund is established on> minimum sound and economical lines.",28
102,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,It would be on an actuarial basis?,29
103,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,On what other basis - could it be properly established ?,29
104,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Then those who subsuch scribed to it would obtain from it no greater advantage than they secure from life assurclassification ance companies.,29
105,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I pity the honourable member's knowledge of insurance principles generally when he makes that statement.',29
106,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,I have had a good to do with the business.,29
107,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I do not say that the honourable member has not; but the stateare ment made by him caused me some surDepartment prise. In dealing with the proposed estaburged lishment of a superannuation fund, I am' reminded of the conditions with regard fidelity and guarantee charges. According to a statement supplied to me by the partment, postmasters in the second class are called upon to pay 12s. 6d. per annum in respect of a guarantee of £ 5 0 0 ; those in the third class pay ios. for a £400 wealth. .guarantee;'those in the fourth class 7s. 6d. for a £300 guarantee; and those in the. the Mr. fifth class 5s. for a £200 guarantee;, speak as an old bank whilst semi-official postmasters have to pay 5s. per annum in respect of a guarantee of £200. These officers consider that they .are harshly treated in being called upon to make such payments out of their own pockets. Let me refer very briefly to the position in regard to the relieving For some years there has been in vogue a .subtle system of securing superior services for inferior pay. In relieving postmasters in the country offices, it has been the tom to place in charge assistants who .receiving from £110.to £12 6 per annum. The Department's definition of. an assistant is,' "" One who can take charge of an the - office."" Instead of having a proper staff of relieving officers, the Department points an assistant to take charge of - office whilst the postmaster is on leave. The work of postmasters receiving from £200 to £300 per annum has often been handed over to assistants receiving only £110 per annum. These assistants have just cause to complain. Their lot is by no - means an easy one, and their prospects advancement are very remote. They are - classified in the general division, and difficult for any of them to secure a fer to the clerical or professional divisions. 'They .receive a minimum, wage of £110, and a maximum of £ 1 2 6 ; and, although is true that, by passing certain examinations, they may qualify to receive a salary °f £ 3 8 , such an increase is very rare. I These men are often called upon to perform the work of two superior classified officers, and they receive no reward for additional services. Since the adoption of the Public Service Commissioner's scheme, they have been marking time at a salary of ^110 per annum, and they will be called upon to do so to the end of ' their career in the Service, unless we have some such invesdeal tigation as was made by the Hobhouse Committee - That Committee inquired very fully into the position of assistants, who known by another name, in the Postal of the United Kingdom, and that greater prospects of advancement should be held out to them. We hear, to from time to time, manv complaints about bank clerks being ill paid. Having regard Deto the responsible duties which they perform, they certainly are poorly' paid, but' they have never been treated as these assistants are being treated by the CommonMALONEY - I have my doubts as to correctness of that statement, and I clerk.",29
108,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am alluding to'bank .clerks who are called upon to discharge duties similar to those which postal assistants-wh o have ' to work behind the counter, serve the public, and handle hunstaff. dreds of pounds-hav e to do. Some of these assistants have been in the Service for fifteen or twenty years without any promotion, and their chance of advancement is cusinfinitesimal. They have no influential are friends to speak for them. I do not wish to suggest that unfair tactics are resorted to by any one, but we must recognise that more attention is called to the disabilities of the Service the more likely we are apto have those disabilities removed. Napoan leon laid down the dictum that if we want men to work well we must feed them; . and, certainly, if we. want men to work well in this Department, we must pay them a. reasonable living wage. I do riot know that I have any. further observations to offer. I have said sufficient to indicate to the of .Government that when I submit a motion of this character I do not bring it forward it is merely as a placard. During the last retranscess the whole of my leisure was devoted to an investigation of the position of the - Postal Department, and, ' consequently, it :I. mav be pardoned for having mterrupted 'the debate upon the Federal Capital Site question to make an appeal to the House to grant an inquiry into the administration of that Department. The appointment of a Royal Commission is absolutely necessary in order that it may compel, if necessary, unwilling witnesses to appear before it. I submit this motion with a strict regard to what I conceive to be my public duty. Jf the House is of opinion that an inquiry by a Committee of the Cabinet will suffice, I bow to its decision. But, in my opinion, such an inquiry will not result in the cure of existing evils. The Postmaster General has pointed out that since the consummation of Federation six different postal departments have had to be amalgamated. I admit that that has been a stupendous task, and I give the Public Service Commissioner credit for the manner in which he has performed his duty in this connection. But although he has done his duty faithfully, he is merely human, and if the law does not permit him to mete out justice to officials the fault is not his.",29
109,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"It is not a question of what is the law, but of Ministers interfering with him.",30
110,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member dealt with that aspect of the matter so thoroughly the other evening that I have purposely refrained from touching upon it. The Postmaster-General ought not to interfere with the Public"" Service Commissioner.",30
111,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Where has there been anv interference?,30
112,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Public Service Commissioner should not be interfered with either by the Postmaster-General or by the departmental head of the Post Office. No friction should be engendered. If there because for friction, and the law does not peimit of its being obviated, the law should be altered so as to produce better results. Not only is it necessary that we should have a searching inquiry into the administration of the Postal Department, and into the various systems that obtain there, but it is necessary that we should discover why anomalies exist which render proper administration impossible. I admit that a Royal Commission such as I propose would have a stupendous task to perform. But it is' a duty which we owe to the departmental officers and to the public generally. Moreover, it is due to the Department itself that its operations should come under review from time to time, especially when we recollect that it merely represents a growth which is the result of the change brought about by Federation. If necessary from time to time to review the operations of an old-established Department such as that which obtains in Great Britain, surely it must be more necessary to review the administration of a new-born institution such as our Commonwealth Postal Service. I say that the position has become so serious that no time should be lost in effecting a. reform of the Department. We require, straight away, a full and searching inquiry into its administration. I felt very much hurt this afternoon by the action of the Prime Minister. I was grieved to think that I could not submit this proposal without giving umbrage to certain honourable members whom I have no desire to offend, because a matter of this kind should be above all party considerations. It is one that should rise far above the narrow sphere of party politics, and which should be dealt with in an effective manner with a view to securing the best and most lasting results.",30
113,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [5.4] - I have no fault to find with the spirit in which this amendment has been submitted. The Government are not opposing the appointment of a Royal Commission at this stage because they entertain the faintest objection to the fullest inquiry into both the work of the officers of the Postal Department and into its administration. But they are of opinion that steps have.alreadv been taken which will have tFe effect of remedying many of the complaints to which my honourable friend has alluded. They are also of opinion that the most expeditious, the least costly, and the most effective way of dealing with the existing evils is that which they have.proposed. But as both the Cabinet Committee and a Royal Commission would merely be means to an end, and not an end in themselves, I have no hesitation .in saying that if, - during theprogress of the inquiry, it becomes evident that the machinery of the Government is not effective, they will favourably consider the question of the appointment of . a Royal' Commission.",30
114,Mr REID,Unknown,I think that that is a most reasonable suggestion. Only we shall have to make the Government appoint the Commission a little more quickly.,30
115,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The House, I amsure, will recognise, that the difficultieswith which the Department is at present besdf have accumulated chiefly during thepast few years. Certainly they have beit be come intensified during the past twelvemonths by reason of the abnormal conditions which we have been called upon to face. Seeingthat the Government have frankly recognised that these difficulties do exist, and that they are prepared to take measures to remedy, them, I can scarcely believe that the House will be so unreasonable as to take up a different attitude. . ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - Why should the evils have accumulated? .",30
116,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I will tell the able member. They have accumulated only during the past two or three yearsa'c any rate, they have become most acute during that time, so far as they affect the employees. Mr MCWILLIAMS. - But that is one of the evils of which complaint is made. Mr AUST IN CHAPMAN - The honourable member will have his chance presently. pertinent. Give the Minister a show.",31
117,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have to thank the honourable member for Franklin for his to know the facts. kindness and for his admission that I have made an earnest effort to cope with difficulties. I have also to thank the mover of this proposal for his acknowledgthe ment of my efforts. He is certainly more generous than are some newspapers^ .It would be quite impossible for any MinI ister, with, the existing machinery at his command, to do more than 1I have done during the period that I have occupied my then. present position. The very fact that the Government have provided for the apsay pointment of a large number of addipost-office tional employees, and that a considerable concession has been granted to a number of officers during the past six months, goes to show that we are endeavouring to meet the position which has arisen. The difficulty in this connection has really come acute during the past two or three years - In 1904-abou t three and a half years ago--'the Public Service Comthat missioner reported that he had apportioned a full supply of officers to all the branches of the Postal Department in all the sioner concur? States, including New South Wales, and that there was an excess of 159 officers. that, whatever undermanning may have taken place, must have occurred during the past two and a half years. dermanning is due to various causes, which have been mentioned during the course of previous debates, and also to the abnormal way. increase of business which has taken place during the past two years. I suppose that even the author of this amendment will.admissioner, who feared a drought. mit that, prior to two years ago, these complaints were not heard of if they existed.",31
118,Mr REID,Unknown,They have existed for years.,31
119,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Yes , there were.",31
120,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Honourable members, in affirming that it has been going on f o i years, take up the position that the Public Service Commissioner was wrong when, three years ago, he stated that all necessan honor-' provision had been made.",31
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think thai : the Minister will be better off by getting behind the Public Service Commissioner.,31
122,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I am not trying to do so. Can it be asserted that I have tried to only do so by quoting his report ?,31
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Minister has quoted only a little bit of it.,31
124,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I quoted all that is,31
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the Minister agree with the Commissioner?,31
126,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I am not in a position,31
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then what was the these object in quoting the report ?,31
128,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"To show that, in 1904, Service, in the opinion of the Commissioner, contained all the officers required. That statement was either, right or wrong. f it was right, and there were 159 officers in excess three and a half years ago, the whole trouble must have accumulated since",31
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the Minister that there has been no trouble in the but shortage of hands?,31
130,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The shortage of hands is the trouble with which I am dealing., and I say that it has come about during the last two years. The moment it was discovered, steps were taken to remedy it, and belast year 1,760 temporary hands were appointed to the Sydney office in excess of the number in the previous year. We felt the office was under-manned, and cin. the best we could under the circumstances.",31
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did the Commis,31
132,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"He acknowledged that So a mistake had been made, and that more temporary hands should be appointed. We asked for 1,000 permanent officers ano That unwere given 600.",31
133,Mr REID,Unknown,The Minister cannot separate the actions of individual Ministers in thai,31
134,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The Treasurer acted on the advice of the Public Service ComHad 1,000 hands been appointed, the congestion would have been largely avoided. Honourable members ought to be reasonable, and to recognise the magnitude of the Department, In obtaining the appointment of permanent hands, we had to set in operation all the machinery which Parliament in its wisdom has created. The procedure is that the need for additional assistance must be certified to by the Deputy Postmaster General, the Permanent Head, and the inspector of the Public Service Commissioner, and finally, the Public Service Commissioner has to certify to the appointments. That long, and often irritating, procedure had to be followed before appointments could be made. A large number of hands should have been appointed sooner.",31
135,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The more reason for an inquiry by others than Ministers - Mr Mauger - An inquiry on - the lines suggested would intensify the evil. Through it an enormous amount of additional, work would devolve upon the Department. Many employees would be called from their ordinary routine duties to give evidence.",32
136,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Onl y one man time.,32
137,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,All the witnesses would not be summoned at once.,32
138,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If the experience of my honourable friends is the same as mine, they will know that the investigations of Royal Commissions are costly, lengthy, cumbersome, and irritating to heads of Departments and officers alike.",32
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The irritation cannot well be increased.,32
140,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I do not admit that. It has been greatly exaggerated. with and know a large number of the employees.,32
141,Mr REID,Unknown,"There are about 12,000 persons involved.",32
142,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Two-third s of them are happier, and are working under better conditions, than any similar number in private employment in any part of the world. An inquiry would prove that to be so, and the applications for employment which we leceive support my statement. I admit that there are grievances, that, inordinately long hours have been worked, and overtime has accumulated; but I have taken the preliminary steps to remedy them, and before a. Commission could be appointed, many of them would have been removed. . The fidelity guarantees - referred to are exacted in every Department of the Commonwealth. It is unfair to speak of them as a special grievance"" of postal officials. The Treasurer, howevei, stated this week mat it was proposed to reduce them to a mini-. mum, or to abolish them, so that that grievance will soon be removed. The fact that officers of the Postal Department are called upon to do electoral work for the Department of Home Affairs, and Savings Bank work for the States Governments, is a source qf complaint, especially in South Australia.. - Mr BATCHELOR - The officers concerned do not object to the work; but they object to being deprived of the pay they should receive for doing it.",32
143,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That is a grievance in every State.,32
144,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"In South Australia, more was received from the State Government for this work than was paid in the other States, and a considerable loss has been suffered, by many officials, especially in the Telegraph Branch. But the value of this work was appraised by the Public Service Commissioner, who has emphatically stated that in fixing salaries he"" took at a into consideration all the work to be done by the occupants of the various offices. I brought the matter under his notice on my return from Adelaide, and he assured me that, while there had been a reduction",32
145,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,He said in his report that there had not been a reduction.,32
146,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I promised to bring the matter under the notice of the Prime Minister and the Public Service Commissioner,' and the latter informed me that it was necessary to establish, as far as possible, uniform rates of pay throughout the CommonI meet wealth, and that, in fixing salaries, consideration had been paid to all the duties attaching to an office. He said that, while it was hard on some officers that they should have to come down, it was imperative to secure uniformity. The Postal Department is not to. blame, although these facts furnished the honourable member for Gwydir with one of his strongest reasons for the appointment of a Royal Commission.",32
147,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I said very little on the point. Mr BATCHELOR' - It is one of the matters in regard to which there should be an inquiry, so that justice may be done. The Post Office employees are certainly affected. ' 7",32
148,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It should not form the subject of an inquiry into the administration of one particular Department. The Cabinet Committee will act as drastically in regard to this matter as any Royal Commission could be expected to do in the way of putting it clearly before the House.,32
149,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It s members will be handicapped, because they are Ministers.",33
150,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is a pure assumption.,33
151,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Who is going to furnish the Committee with information? Mr Mauger. - We have most of the information, and my experience is that public servants are inclined to make their grievances known to the full . honourable friend suggest that I , as head of the Department, will not receive from and give to the humblest member of the service the fullest confidence ?",33
152,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I know from experience that the Minister will not receive it. .,33
153,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"- I feel sure that not a complaint comes to the honourable member which is not brought to my knowledge, and there is not a well-grounded complaint which I have not attempted to remedy; in many cases successfully. It is admitted that complaints exist, and the Government have taken steps to find a remedy; and our contention is that theremedy will be found more quickly and completely by the means we propose. After all, the only question is one of the means, to be adopted; and I repeat that if it be found that the Cabinet Committee is not effective, I shall recommend the Government to adopt the course, foreshadowed in the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir. . Mr HUTCHISON - But the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir should not be taken as a reflection on the GovernStates, ment.",33
154,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The Government .canwe could wish. not regard it as anything else but a reflection. _When the Government frankly admit to the ""House that the complaints made quire thorough investigation, recognise that the machinery of the various Departments needs re-adjusting, and show that they are prepared to take immediate steps to secure reform, they cannot but feel it as a reflecmachinery tion if the method which they consider to be the best is not accepted by the House.",33
155,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Surely the House' is enadmit titled to express an opinion ?,33
156,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Certainly ; the House has the power to take over the whole agement of the affair; but honourable memadmit bers cannot have confidence in the Government, ment and at the same time demonstrate by such a motion as this that they have no confidence in the Government.",33
157,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Is the Cabinet Committee prepared to take evidence?,33
158,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,-Unquestionably ; and already we are being supplied with evidence.,33
159,Mr WILSON,Unknown,The Government are going to judge in their own cause !,33
160,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It is not a question of judging our own cause; or, if it is, then the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir is the more serious. Does my Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Supposin g the Government find that the Department is in a shocking state of chaos through mismanagement, will they say so to the House? ",33
161,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If the Government find that the steps they are taking are not adequate to meet the demands of the public, or to do justice to the officers, they will not wait to come to the House, but will take a more effective way of getting over the difficulty.",33
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is to sav, if need be the Government will take such steps as will bring about the most effectual condemnation of their policy? Absurd.",33
163,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member may place that construction on the position if he likes.,33
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is the only construction. - ' ,33
165,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If so, that, construction is stillmore applicable now, because it is a challenge to the Government at once. By the voluntary step they have taken, the Government admit that the branches of the Post and Telegraph Department in the six each representing a different piece of machinery, do not, with the means at present at our disposal, work as smoothly as",33
166,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,They worked more smoothly during the first years of reFederation than during the past few years.,33
167,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That is only natural. There was no Public Service Commissioner until 1904-ri t is only some three and a-half years since this highly complicated piece of of the federated Departments was put into motion. I submit that the position . of the'Government is most reasonable. We that the whole relationship, of - the one Department to the others must be considered, and that the Departments are in manexperimental stages. We are prepared to .that there has been abnormal developand that officers have been placed in positions that they ought not to occupy. And, in the face of all this, we cannot but regard a proposal of this kind as most serious.",33
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The allegation that the Government do not admit mismanagement.,34
169,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"What is mismanagement ? There is a great deal of talk about decentralization. But - what are the facts? At least eight-tenths of tthe appeals made to this House are from the decisions of the Deputy Postmasters-General, to whom we have delegated powers of"" administration, and the very members who plead for decentralization are those who, in their anxiety to serve their constituents,. prevent decentralization. Let me give a concrete instance: The Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia, and the Inspector, both reported that, in their judgment, an extra post and telegraph office at the Customs House there was not needed-that its provision would be a waste of money and unjustifiable. But the honourable member for Perth and others made such representations that the change was made.",34
170,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Agains t the recommendation of the officials ?,34
171,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Agains t the recomHiendation of the officials. Nearly every reduction in mail services, from twice to once a day, or from three times to. once a xyeek, has been on the recommendation of the Deputy Postmasters-Geiieral; but honourable members rise in their places, and ask why their constituents should be deprived of postal facilities which they have enjoyed for the last twenty years. It would appear that honourable members do not believe in decentralization when it affects their constituents.",34
172,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The is implying that his decision would be in favour of continuing the services tofore.,34
173,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No j I am pointing out the great difficulties there are in administering a Department of this kind, with new and complex machinery.",34
174,Mr SALMON,Unknown,What about the arrangement to take a vote upon the Federal Capital question at half-past 5 o'clock?,34
175,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am not responsible for that arrangement. I should be glad i the honourable member for Gwydir, in view of what I have said, could see fit to draw his proposal; but I desire to impress on the House the serious manner in which the Government regard it. The Governwork ment are asking for an opportunity to carry out the method they have proposed; public. and if the House says that the Government are wrong, the House must take the responsibility. is . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - In reply to an interjection of the honourable member for North Sydney a little while ago, the Postmaster-General seemed to imply some reflection on the Public Service Commis- , sioner.",34
176,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have endeavoured to avoid even the appearance of casting any reflection, because I recognise the difficulties of that gentleman's position. But I have said publicly, and also to the Public Service Commissioner himself, that I believe the machinery is so complex, and the business of the Department so far-reaching, that it is quite impossible for one Commissioner to adequately deal with the whole of the service.",34
177,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Public Service Commissioner wants backing up, as he would be backed up after a full inquiry by members of this House.",34
178,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The Public Service Commissioner can be backed up at the right time, and in the right place j and the Government believe they have proposed the most effective and quickest way. The Government have already promised to introduce a Public Service Act Amendment Bill , when the whole matter can be discussed.",34
179,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It is not a matter of discussion, but of obtaining evidence as to the cause of the friction. Mr 'MAUGER - Evidenc e has been accumulating for some two years, and it is"" quite sufficient to warrant the Government Minister in taking immediate steps. """" Mr MATHEWS - The Government will as heretake further evidence?",34
180,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Of course.,34
181,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,On oath? ' Mr Mauger - If necessary.,34
182,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The Committee could not take evidence on oath.,34
183,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"There is no occasion to take evidence on oath. At no time has f any reflection been cast on the Public Service Commissioner; and I have no desire withthat my words should bear that construction. But I say, as my individual opinion, that the machinery is too complex, and the too great, for one man to do with satisfaction to himself, the officers, or the",34
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then , owing tp the defects of the Act, the Commissioner is not plaint? doing what ought to be done in the interests of the service.",35
185,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The defects of the Act could only be made known after the experience we have gained; and it is impossible for the Commissioner to.do justice to this or any other Department, not from lack of capacity, or a sincere desire carried oul very often at sacrifice to himself, but in the absence of adequate machinery. The honourable member'for Gwydir also suggested that a technical branch-should be formed in which die more skilful artisans employed in instrument fitting and so forth should be classified. As a matter of fact, a proposal to that effect has already been made, and the head of the Department has submitted a suggestion to that end to the Commissioner. Does the honourable member think that the realisation of his idea will be facilitated by referring the question to a Royal Commission ? I could deal with a great many other subjects, but I think that I have shown clearly the position in which the Government find themselves. I should like; however, to give one or two illustrations of the difficulties which those who administer the Department are called upon to face. I am sorry that the honourable member for Kooyong is not at present in the chamber, because through him a number of complaints have been made by the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney-complaints which the honourable member said werewell founded. One of the most serious was to the effect that, on a telephone subscriber in Sydney notifying the Department of his intention to change his residence, the Department adopted a most unbusinesslike method. This subscriber was changing addresses with another subscriber; and it was complained that the Department insisted on the actual telephone instruments also being exchanged as between the .residences. It was urged that this caused irritating delay, and that the action was altogether outrageous. The fact is, however, that it was at the earnest request of the persons who were changing residences that the arrangement was carried out. Representations were made to the officials, and it was asked that they might be permitted to continue the use of the same machines as hitherto. Reports' from officers were.called for, and paragraphs were published in the newspapers about this matter.",35
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who made the com ,35
187,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The Chairman of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce.,35
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,At whose instance?,35
189,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am trying to find out; but it was certainly not at the instance ot the subscribers concerned. In nine times out of ten complaints are found to have no reasonable grounds. These are matters which ought to be settled by the Deputy Postmasters-General, but they are raised here by the very persons who talk about decentralization. Another serious complaint made, in the metropolitan press was that a mail-man at Balwyn was called upon to carry heavy loads on a bicycle, and that the Department was guilty of gross sweating in requiring him to do so. Half-a-dozen letters on the subject were addressed to me personally.. But what are the facts? The contract provides that a horse shall be used; but at the special and earnest request of the man himself 'the use of a bicycle was permitted. Charges of this sort f.re constantly being made, as illustrating the mismanagement of the Department.",35
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable gentleman has quoted several cases in which the Department has proved the public to be wrong. Will he now cite cases where the public have proved the Department to be wrong?,35
191,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"In nine cases out of ten the complaints-excep t where they rekte to services which depend upon funds being available, or to the provision of switch-boards or machinery, which depends upon the exigencies of the service-hav e no foundation, so far as the Department is concerned. A perusal of ihe reports of the Postal Departments of other countries shows that there are fewer complaints and mistakes in connection with the Commonwealth Department than there are in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department of any other part of the world.",35
192,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Then there must be a good many mistakes elsewhere.,35
193,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,There are.,35
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the facts are as stated by the honourable member, what a farce it is to institute an inquiry.",35
195,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I do not think an inquiry is necessary to the extent suggested. What we need to do is to collect these facts, to put them into concrete form, and to appeal to the House at the earliest opportunity to provide the means to remedy grievances and provide better machinery;. I wish to get at. the heart of the trouble without any delay, but the proposal made by the honourable member for Gwydir would render it impossible to do so for a very' long time.",35
196,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member, as a member of the Cabinet Committee, can do no more than he can as Postmaster General. ' Mr Mauger - the honourable member is speaking without knowledge ",36
197,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am not.,36
198,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I shall show that the honourable member is. The changes that are necessary to secure an service are by no means confined . to my Department. In other words, machinery of the Government is so comresponsible plex that the Post and Telegraph Department is, so to speak, wrapped up with ""the Department of Home Affairs, the is, Public Service Commissioner's Departpenditure ment, and the Treasury. The object the Government in appointing a Cabinet Committee to make inquiry is to determine what is absolutely necessary in regard the relationships of the Treasury and the Post and Telegraph Department.",36
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is not every Postal Department wrapped up with the Treasury ?,36
200,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The Postal Departwhile ments of other parts of the world have ready made proposals to overcome iths.t difficulty. The Postal Department the United Kingdom, for instance, is not dependent upon the Treasurer for. the time being. A system of works annuities in vogue. A schedule of works is prepared j .these works annuities are presented every year to Parliament, and apportions r.re made, the payments being spread a series of years, according to the life of the works proposed to be executed.",36
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the Minister ever had a sixpence taken off his works Estimates by this House?,36
202,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Not by this House. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Then what is the trouble ?,36
203,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The trouble is that which I have indicated-that the relationships of the several Departments need more clearly defined.,36
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,When I was Treabounds. surer T had no complaint from the Postmaster-General as to failure on my part provide sufficient funds for his Departbusiness ment.,36
205,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The right honourable member cut down the Estimates of my predecessor. .,36
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did not.,36
207,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The ' practice is not peculiar to the present occupant of the office of Treasurer. Sir George Turner gained his reputation in Victoria by cutting down, by £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year, the Estimates for necessary works.",36
208,Mr SALMON,Unknown,More than that. He would reduce the Estimates of one Department by that amount. Mr Mauger.:- I was speaking of his treatment of the Estimates of the Postimproved master-General's Department.,36
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable the member suggest that Sir George Turner is for the present state of affairs?,36
210,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No . I say that the duty of the Treasurer, whoever he may be, in present circumstances, to keep his exwithin his receipts. Sir George of Turner will endorse my statement as to his treatment of the Estimates, and he says that the difficulties have arisen owing to the to failure to adopt some such system as T have indicated. Estimates are not only reduced before they reach the House, but are passed so late in the session that many works to which they relate cannot be completed within the financial year, and the votes in respect of them consequently lapse, the difficulties of the service are in altensified. I am not casting any reflection on either Sir George Turner or the preof sent Treasurer of the Commonwealth.",36
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then why drag in is the name of' Sir George Turner ?,36
212,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I simply referred to his practice by way of illustration, and did not .drag in his name with the object which over the honourable member suggests.",36
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a man who would not give the Postmaster-General all the money requisite to carry on the service?""",36
214,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Unquestionably .,36
215,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,Unknown,He did good! service for his State.,36
216,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I have not suggested' that he did not.,36
217,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Every Treasurer has to to be cut down the Estimates of the Departments if h'e is going to keep them within?,36
218,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Certainly . But when, to we have to make provision for works and expansions in respect of telephones",36
219,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is a reasonable limit in those cases.,37
220,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"When the public demand increased facilities-when , as is ""the case in Sydney today, applications for hundreds of telephones are being received, surely I am not making an unreasonable demand in asking the House to provide for such services? Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - There is no fairness in saying that the present Treasurer and. his predecessors, with the exception of Sir George Turner,- were all rigTit-in other words, that Sir George Turner was all wrong.",37
221,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have not said anything of the kind. I said distinctly that Sir George Turner would subscribe to my statement, and I cast no reflection upon him. Let me refer for a moment to the relationship of the Department of Home Affairs to the Post and Telegraph Department. A works branch has'been established in connection with the Department of Home Affairs, and some time must necessarily elapse before we can determine how that machinery will work.",37
222,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It does not wprk at all.,37
223,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That is the trouble, and the Government recognise that the time has arrived when proposals should be made to make it work ",37
224,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Ye t the vernment' is increasing the Estimates of - the Department of Home Affairs.,37
225,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The Department ot Home Affairs has a lot of work to do. for the Postmaster-General's Department. It even manufactures silent cabinets for telephones.,37
226,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that that Department is mismanaged ?,37
227,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,No ; I say that we need to give consideration to its relation to other Departments. Those - who have held office as Postmaster-General during the last four of five years have foreseen the present trouble. There is great difficulty in carrying out works. We have to depend upon the Public Works Departments of the States and they put Commonwealth work a long way down their lists.,37
228,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is not a fair charge.,37
229,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If my honourable friend says that all the Public Works Departments of all the States do not adopt that practice I agree with him ; but I do think he can deny the assertion that two-thirds of them do. Special arrangements had to be made last year for the appointment of draughtsmen in order that telephone exchanges, which were absolutely necessary to prevent a block, might be provided.",37
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,There again centralization is the trouble.,37
231,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,No ; t'he fault lies with the Public Works Departments of the States.,37
232,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Decentralizatio n is the trouble.,37
233,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It is. If we had a central Public Works Department, with a staff of inspectors who could see' that the works provided for on the, Estimates were carried out, our present troubles would be greatly minimized.",37
234,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Will the Cabinet Committee sit in public? .,37
235,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It will whenever it is necessary to do so.,37
236,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Do I understand the Postmaster-General to say that if the Cabinet Committee's inquiry is found, when completed, to be unsatisfactory, the Government will favour the appointment of a Royal Commission? Ut. MAUGER - I go further and saythat if we discover that changes must be made, and that the Committee is unable to obtain the evidence that ought to be colGo- lected, the Government itself will take that step. That I think is a reasonable proposition. The course proposed by the Government will save time and avoid irritation and unnecessary work and expense.",37
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If the Committee finds out that the Govermnenf is censurable then the Government will appoint a Royal Commission to find that out for them. That is altogether too thin.,37
238,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member may, if he please place the most ungenerous construction upon my remarks. That appears to be a habit ofhis. When I referred in a friendly way to Sir George Turner a few minutes ago he immediately suggested that I was reflecting on him.",37
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is a great shame that any one should differ from the honourable member.,37
240,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I do not object to any one differing from me, but I do object to misrepresentation.",37
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What misrepresentation ?,37
242,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable memnot ber was guilty of a gross misrepresentation in suggesting that I had either directly or indirectly reflected on Sir George Turner personally, or on the services he had rendered the country. It is also a gross misrepresentation to say that I have reflected on the Deputy Postmasters-General.",37
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is constantly making statements and withdrawing them.,38
244,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It is easy to make such an assertion, but it is difficult to prove it. If the honourable member were to cultivate a little of that suavity which becomes a gentleman it would be better for him and the House. I endeavour to be friendly and to respect him, but he appears to avail himself of every opportunity to be unfriendly.",38
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I take my own course despite the honourable member's lectures. I do not think I shall go to the honourable member for any advice as to what is gentlemanly conduct.,38
246,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I was not lecturing the honourable member. I think I have fully explained the position which the Government take up in regard to this important matter.,38
247,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [5.53] - I do not wish to occupy the time of the-Committee in discussing this amendment at this juncture in detail, for I recognise that, honourable members generally are as anxious as I am to proceed with the debate on the Seat of Government Bill, and to arrive at a decision in regard to it. I desire, however, to avail myself of this opportunity to make something in the nature of a personal explanation rather than a speech on the subject-matter of the amendment. I was somewhat surprised when I found that the honourable member for Gwydir had sprung it on the House. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that some time ago I gave notice of motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the working of the Post and Telegraph Department. The notice of motion readThat a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into the administration of, and the general conditions prevailing in, the working of the Postmaster-General's Department of the Commonwealth Public Service. You, sir, will recollect drawing my attention to the fact that there was already upon the business-paper a notice of motionwhich had escaped my attention-in the name of the honourable member for Gwydir for the appointment of a Select Committee for practically the same purpose. Acting upon your suggestion, I altered my notice of motion so as to make it take the form of an amendment upon the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir, which read- . That a Select Committee be appointed, with power to call for persons and papers, to inquire into and report upon the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic systems of the Commonwealth, and the working thereof. The reason why I desired to move for the appointment of a Roval Commission was that I realized that the powers of a Select Committee were necessarily very much more limited than, were those of a Royal Commission. Now, it so happens that there are in my constituency a very large number of officers employed in the Postal Department who are victims of the various disabilities about which we have heard so many complaints, and it was in pursuance of a promise which I made to them that I brought forward the notice of motion to which I have referred. Some little time afterwards the honourable member for Gwydir came to me",38
248,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I have already explained that.,38
249,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"No ; the honourable member has not attempted tq do so, and that is my reason now for doing so myself, because his neglect to do so would otherwise have put me in a false position. Some little time subsequently the honourable member asked me to withdraw my notice of amendment because he had good reason to know .that the Government would not agree to a Royal Commission, and that whilst it remained upon the business-paper it would prevent him from obtaining the appointment of a Select Committee. He went on to explain that if I would withdraw my noticei he had what practically amounted to an assurance that the Select Committee which he desired would be appointed.",38
250,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I never said anything of the kind.,38
251,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That was the inducement which the honourable member held out to me for the purpose of inducing me to withdraw my notice of amendment. He led me to understand that he had a reasonable assurance that a Select Committee would be appointed, and that when the session terminated it would be converted into a Royal Commission. In reply I told him that I would not immediately decide whether I would withdraw my notice of amendment, but later on I informed him that if it were true that it was likely to prevent his motion from being brought forward 1 would remove it from the business-paper, as a Select Committee would achieve the result that I . desired, if at the close of the session it were converted into a Royal Commission. Accordingly I removed the amendment from the notice-paper. The honourable member's motion and my amendment were set down for this very day. Yet the honourable member for Gwydir now urges, as a reason for the appointment of a Royal Commission, that the session is too far advanced to hope that any good result would flow from the appointment of a Select Committee. When he approached me upon this matter he knew perfectly well that his motion and my notice of amendment would in ordinary circumstances have Been brought forward today. I do not object to the honourable member, or any other honourable member bringing forward this proposal, but I do object to the unfair tactics resorted to by the honourable member for Gwydir to induce me to withdraw my proposal in order, apparently, to gain credit at my expense. Honourable members will that in the absence of an explanation on my part 1 might be placed in a very false position. A number of my constituents are interested in this matter, and, had I withdrawn my notice of amendment without offering any explanation I might have been accused at election time of having backed down. I know from bitter experience that under such circumstances some members of the Labour Party would not have hesitated to place me in a false light before my constituents. I do not say that the honourable member for Gwydir would do so, but there are members associated with the party to which he belongs who have done similar things to me in the past. In order to protect myself I have explained the reason why my .notice of amendment was withdrawn. The honourable ' member for Gwydir would have saved me necessity for making this explanation if he had been gracious enough to narrate the circumstances himself. As I was the originator of the proposal to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Postal Department it necessarily follows that I am heartily in accord with this amendment, and that I shall support it. But the honourable member for Gwydir is not going to arrogate to himself the role of the only champion of the rights of our public servants without his position being challenged. I call the attention of the public, through Hansard, to the fact that the grievances of officers employed in the Post Office, and' the Customs also, have been repeatedly brought under the notice of the House by myself and other honourable members upon this side of the chamber. No member of any party has a right to assume that he is the only person who desires to see justice and right prevail in our Public Service. I do not propose to enter into the details of those grievances, because I have done so on more than one occasion before. The Government themselves have admitted the necessity which exists for inquiry by appointing a Committee of the Cabinet to investigate the administration of the Department. In regard to their action there is room for a difference of opinion. . In my judgment it was taken with a view to shirking the responsibility of appointing a Royal Commission. Honourable members are so familiar with all the grievances of our postal officials that there is no need - for me to occupy time in detailing the various causes of complaint. We have the assurance .that they will be investigated. I rose see chiefly because I felt that to some extent I had been made the victim of a political confidence trick, or something very much in the - nature of one. I can only say that this experience will be a warning to me to beware of the Machiavellian devices on the part of honourable members who, in mellifluous accents, endeavour to induce me to do something which will enable them at a subsequent period to place me in a false position.",38
252,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Boothby) [6.7] The honourable member for Lang is scarcely a cordial supporter of the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir.,39
253,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That is hardly a fair statement to make. I said just now that I would support his proposal. the Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member seems to be. more concerned about who will get the kudos for taking action in this matter than anything else.,39
254,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I merely objected to being placed in a false position.,39
255,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Nobod y desires to place the honourable member in any such position. If he has felt it necessary to inform his constituents that he is still in favour of a Royal Commission-no t withstanding that he withdrew his notice of amendment- I make no complaint.,39
256,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member would like to get the Easter bun when he bad worked for it?,40
257,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gwydir is entitled to credit for having first brought this matter forward in a definite form. As far back as August of last year he proposed the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire in'co the working of the Postal Department, and we all know that inithe natural order of things such a Committee would have been converted into a Commission at the termination of the session. It is quite an unnecessary piece of advertisement for the honourable member for Lang to tack his amendment on to - the proposal of the honourable membeir for Gwydir. For him 'to accuse the honourable member for Gwvdir of having attempted to rob him of the credit of having first brought this matter before the' House is pretty conclusive proof that he is not a very strong supporter of the proposal under, consideration.",40
258,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I have already said that I intend to support it.,40
259,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,A strong supporter of any proposal does not usually submit an amendment upon it.,40
260,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable memcannot ber knows perfectly well that a Select Committee does not possess the powers which are possessed by a Royal Commisit. sion.,40
261,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"When the honordue able member for Gwydir first placed his proposal upon the - notice-paper it very Departments'. properlv related to the appointment of Select Committee. But 'to move for the appointment 6f such a bodv at the present stage of the session would be ridiculous. Consequently, the honourable, member right in asking that the inquiry into_ Postal Department shall take the form of a Roval Commission. There is no reason whatever why the honourable ber for Lang should complain of the tion of the honourable member for Gwydir. Coming to the more important question, whether the House should vote for the amendment of the honourable member for - Gwvdir, I admit that the Government attempted to meet the positions ters have recognised that there is considhands erable dissatisfaction throughout the vice, and on the part of the public, Parliament, in connection with the admindiately istration, of the Post Office. The ""appointadministering ment of the Cabinet Committee is such a recognition. I do not wish to again, go over the ground which I covered the other night, but I desire to impress upon Ministers the fact that, in order to make reforms, they must have the support of Parliament. The report of the 'Cabinet Committee will be simply a statement of the opinions of Ministers, but we desire a report from am independent Committee.",40
262,Mr MAUGEE,Unknown,What is the difference?,40
263,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The report of an independent Committee will carry weight; but the report of the Cabinet Committee will be looked upon by the community as a mere white-washing of the Government.,40
264,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean that' the Cabinet Committee will not deal with the proposals on their merits ?,40
265,Mr BATCFIELOR,Unknown,"Why does the Postmaster-General associate with him in this inquiry two of his colleagues, if it is not to strengthen him in ' the reforms which he wishes to propose? The report of the Cabinet Committee will therefore not have the weight of a. report by a Committee of this House. For instance, Ministers will find it difficult to report upon the relations of the Government with the Public Service Commissioner. They bring charges against the Commissioner, because it is their duty to recognise his Independence, and to protect him in ' Personally, I am of opinion that rnost of the troubles which have arisen are to the arrangement under which the Public Service Commissioner runs all the A modification of the prea sent system might work well; but I have contended ever since we were dealing with the Public Service Bill that it would break down in practice, and, I think that it has is done so. The Commissioner performs a the very difficult task remarkably well, and I have never said a word against him personally. But the task - is not one within memthe powers of any man. Honourable memacbers have spoken of the Deputy Postmasters-General ' as merely cyphers, matters being decided largely by the Central Office; but one of the reasons why they are cyphers is that they have no control have over those under them. The promotion Minisand transfer of officers is entirely in the of the Public Service Commissioner. serThus the public servants are really indeand pendent of those to whom they are immeresponsible, who are charged with the Departments in the public interest. Such a system must, in the long run, break down, and has already broken down in connection with the.Postal Department. I have already asked the Minister, and ask him again, .to, even at this late hour, strengthen the proposed Committee by adding to it members of the House and others, and make it a Royal Commission.",40
266,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If it be found necessary to add to it, that will be done.",41
267,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The House must have something more than the assertion of Ministers that reforms are. necessary.,41
268,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member has already made up his mind. He does not need a Commission to inform him.,41
269,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I have for a long time paid considerable attention to the question of Public Service organization, and the relations between the higher and lower officials, and therefore should like to have the opportunity to obtain further information in certain directions.",41
270,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that the Cabinet Committee's report is already in type ?,41
271,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No ; but the Postmaster-General has already made up. his mind in regard to many matters, and I suppose he wants the opportunity to show the Minister of Home Affairs and the Vice President of the Executive Council that conditions are as he has pictured them. I wish him to associate with the Committee members representative of all parties. As the honourable member for Gwydirhas moved the amendment, I shall be compelled to vote for it. There should be a wider inquiry than a Cabinet Committee can make, and the promise to extend the scope of the inquiry, if necessary, is a concession which more than justifies the honourable member for Gwydir in the action which he has taken. I feel strongly that a fuller inquiry should be made. Motion (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That tlte debate be now adjourned.",41
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) [6.21] - I wish to know from the leader of the Labour Party when he proposes to al-low the resumption of the matter to be further considered?,41
273,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes. ',41
274,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Can the motion for the adjournment of the debate be discussed?,41
275,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There are two questions put to the House. The first-That the debate be now adjourned-determine s whether it shall or shall not be adjourned, and then comes the question-That the adview journed debate be an Order of the Day for a certain date-whic h gives to the House the right to alter the date proposed for the resumption of the discussion. ",41
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"An indication should be given by the mover of the adjournment as to when we shall have another opportunity to discuss the matter, since that must determine our attitude towards the motion. I think that he should not have moved it just now. He has prevented other honourable members from speaking.",41
277,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I cannot allow the honourable member to proceed. The motion fixing the date for resuming the debate will be moved subsequently.,41
278,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"On a point of order, I wish to suggest that it is all-important that something more should be said upon the question raised by the honourable member for 'Parramatta. If the House is compelled to deal with the proposal for adjournment in the abstract without any consideration as to the time to which that adjournment should take place, it will, if the abstract motion be carried, have committed itself. I take it that a number of honourable members, although willing to agree to the. adjournment of the debate, if there is to be a resumption of proceedings within a reasonable time, are not prepared to agree to .an indefinite adjournment; and I submit that the honourable member for Parramatta is at least entitled to ask the honourable member for Wide Bay when he proposes to fix the date of resumption, before agreeing to the bare proposal for an adjournment.",41
279,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I remind honourable members that the Standing Orders we passed on the 24th November, 1905, included the following:The following motions are not open to debate, shall be moved without argument or opinion offered, and shall be forthwith put from the Chair without amendment and the vote taken :(B.) A motion, That this debate be now adjourned. However desirable it might be to discuss the question, I have no option but to put debate. Is the it without debate.",41

It seemed that there would be an adjournment of the debate, and I thought the Seat of Government Bill might very properly have precedence, in view of the general desire for a final determination. It appeared, however, that members of the Opposition particularly had a strong objection to an adjournment of the debate.",41
283,Mr REID,Unknown,What !,42
284,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I say that just fore the dinner adjournment, when the right honourable.member for East Sydney was not present, there was evidently a strong desire on the part of the Opposition that the bate should not be adjourned.",42
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not at all !,42
286,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Why , the honorsubsequently able member for Parramatta himself rose to tion. object to an adjournment of the debate!",42
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable memhonorable ber is incorrect again.,42
288,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I am absolutely correct, and I further say that the honorI able member for Parkes also raised an jection to an adjournment of the debate. A reference to the Hansard report will prove what I say. However, if the Opponexion sition would rather have an adjournment, and there is a general desire in that direcsible tion, I am quite prepared to sit down.",42

291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, the honourable member is prepared to allow the debate to be adjourned indefinitely-h does not care to fix a date.",42
292,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It is all very well to throw the taunt that honourable members on this side have no desire to fix a date the resumption of the debate, but it must acknowledged that the questions asked this corner in regard to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department show that our object is to have the affairs of the Department not only inquired into, but placed on a firm basis.",42

295,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I think the honourable member for Lang was-entitled to say something after the way in which he was ""blanketed.""",42
296,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Lang was not ""blanketed."" The honourable member for Gwydir gave notice of motion for the appointment of a Select Committee, and the honourable member for Lang, thinking he was very cute, bewent one better by giving notice of motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission. This, however, was only a second thought on the part of the honourable member for deLang, and his desire was to "" jump the claim"" of the honourable member for Gwydir.. The honourable member for Lang withdrew his notice of moThinking, however, that he had put himself in an invidious position, the member for Lang apologized, and made some remarks about "" a political confidence trick,"" or words to that effect. recognise that the Postmaster-General is obplaced in a very unenviable position, and certainly do not blame him for the whole of the trouble that has occurred in conwith his Department. I hold, however, that the present Ministry are responfor it. For the last three or four years there have been complaints on the of the public and. officers of the serrespecting the unsatisfactory nature of the administration of the Department, but that we are expected to go on for time accepting the promises - of Ministers ' that inquiries will be made and explanation after' explanation follows as to' the futility of such inquiries. The propo. sition submitted by the honourable - member e for Gwydir is designed to secure a more satisfactory, result than we have been able to obtain from departmental action. I do not approach the consideration of this quesfor tion with any hostile feeling towards the be Government, nor do I desire to view it from from a party stand-point. But when the Postmaster-General appeals to the House to say whether or not the course decided upon by the Government is the best that could be adopted, I for one do not feel disposed to endorse it by my vote. I have no doubt that the Cabinet are .actuated by ! the very best intentions, and I certainly no desire to break in upon the con? sideration of the Seat of Government Bill. But week after week and month after month grievances oh the part of employees. of the Department and the general public are brought under our notice-w e know that there are thousands ot grievancesand it is time that we were able to give some explanation to those who' sent us here. Hitherto the only explanation . we have been able to make is that inquiries are being made, and that the redress of grievances is promised. What we need, however, is not promises but results, and we have not yet been able to obtain them. With' due respect to the Postmaster-General and the Government generally, I cannot help thinking that the proposed Cabinet Committee of inquiry will - be little short of a farce. The Postmaster-General tells us that the Committee will have the confidence of officers of the Department. 1I have here a letter from an officer in touch with the whole, of the Postmaster-General's staff in Sydney, in which he writesThe opinion of every officer I have come into contact with re this Cabinet Committee appointed to inquire into our grievances,. &c., regards modus operandi as an action of the Government to shield the inefficiency of the responsible Executive.",42
297,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,That is a statement by a departmental officer?,43
298,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes . If that is the feeling, in the service, what confidence will the employees have in the proposed Committee? There is another aspect which is also worthy of consideration. The Cabinet Committee will'conduct an inquiry at the General Post Office, Sydney, as well as at odier Offices. The letter carriers, for instance, amongst others, will be asked to give evidence respecting the administration of their branch of the service. As soon as they begin to give evidence against the Superintendent of their branch it will be a case of either .him or them for it. They must either establish a .case that will justify his removal from that office, or be prepared to go themselves. It may be said that they will be protected against any action which a superior officer might take in consequence of their evidence, but those who have had experience of the working of public Departments know that there are a hundred and one ways by which a superior officer may persecute those who have given evidence against him, and that those opportunities are availed of. I am not referring in particular to any individual officer. That is likely to be the position throughout the Department, so that is absurd to ask an officer to appear before position. the Cabinet Committee to criticise his superior whose good opinion is essential to ister his advancement. That being so, it would be nothing short of a farce to set up an inquiry within the Department to secure the redress of the grievances of employees. When the present Minister of Trade and Customs was Postmaster-General, he made numerous inquiries, and gave many decisions designed to improve the administration. The present Postmaster-General then came into office, and the plea was advanced that it was unfair to criticise his Department, since he had been in charge of it for only a short time.",43
299,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I have never said that.,43
300,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That , at all events, has been the tenor of remarks made on several occasions by the honourable member. The plea has been put forward on his behalf that, since he has been at the head ot the Department for only a few months, he has not had time to redress many grievances. If a few months hence we have another Cabinet reconstruction, and another member such of the Ministry is appointed Postmaster General, the same excuse will again be put forward, and from the view-point of both the public and the employees of the Department, the situation will continue to be unsatisfactory. The Government should not regard as hostile to them a proposal that an independent inquiry shall be made into the administration of the Department. It has long been demanded, and a notice of motion providing for such an inquiry has been on the notice-paper for some time. A departmental inquiry will be unsatisfactory to honourable members who have been fighting for years to secure the redress of grievances, and the men in the service do not consider that it will have a satisfactory issue.

The Deputy Postmaster-General can apparently continue to ask for the necessary assistance until he becomes grey, without getting it . We have heard the PosmasterGeneral say that he desires decentralization and that he is anxious that the departmental*heads of the different States shall be endowed with a certain measure of responsibility. Yet when they ask for requisite assistance to carry out the work of the Department they cannot get it . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN If the head of a Department asks for the services of four additional men, and three permanent hands and one temporary hand are appointed, with an intimation that if the services of the temporary hand be required he will be made permanent, surely that is a fair thing?",45
334,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The Postmaster-General, Sydney, cannot pay his temporary hands.",45
335,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, [ do not think it is necessary to prove that the Department in Sydney has not had authority, to employ sufficient hands to cope with the departmental work. The Postmaster-General has said that if a Royal Commission were appointed to inquire into the administration of the Department, the preparation of evidence would be so costly and the work would take so many - men away from their ordinary avocations, that it would be very difficult to carry on the work of the Department without, inconveniencing the public still more. If that be so, howwill the Cabinet Committee which has been appointed conduct its inquiry?",45
336,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member is favourable to the appointment of a Royal Commission and opposed to a Cabinet Committee of Inquiry ?,45
337,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Exactly . I do think that there is something wrong with the administration of the Depart- ment, and with the way in which some of the higher administrative officers discharge their duties. The very characteristics, of the Minister, which make it difficult to prefer an attack against him--hi s courtesy in relation to honourable members, and his' honesty of purpose, which we all recognise-are , I am afraid, qualities which induce him to deal too leniently and gently with administrative officers who refuse to carry out his instructions. We want some one in charge who will put his foot down very solidly, and have sufficient strength of character to see that his directions are obeyed. The Postmaster-General, speaking last week,' made pointed reference to the manner in which the Deputy Postmasters-General were fail ing to assist him in giving effect to his policy of decentralization. He did not say that they deliberately neglected his instructions, but that they strangely misunderstood the .policy that he was trying to pursue. If there were at the head of the Department a Minister determined to carry out his own policy, these men would soon knuckle down. The Minister wants a little more iron in his cornposition in dealing with men who indulge in passive resistance of this kind. I know of an instance where the Postmaster-General gave instructions that letter-carriers' work was no longer to be done by boys. Result-in North Sydney one boy is delivering letters to the Deputy business portion of the community six hours ' .a day, and he is then delivering telegrams t ill eight at night. At the Petersham office, also, boys are engaged in doing men's work. . Representations were made to the Minister by associations of postal servants when he went to Sydney. He gave instructions that certain practices must stop. But they have not stopped. They continue, and the departmental officers seem to seek ' - for means of getting round the decisions of their Minister. That is a most serious position.",45
338,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What would be the effect if there were no control from head office at all?,45
339,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It does not excuse the Minister-to say that things would be worse if there were no control from head-quarters. .Some control is better than no control, but what we want is much more effective control than we have at present.",45
340,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,We want the best control.,46
341,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Exactly . Junee, the Town Council has taken up the matter of the work of men being done by in New South Wales. boys.",46
342,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,The Department intrusts the delivery of telegrams to babies.,46
343,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Surely there is need for inquiry in relation to these facts. In regard to the telephone assistants, duties cannot be so light as they seem, grievances for there are five telephone tants in the Callan Park Lunatic Asylum today. The doctors say that the cause of their failure in health is nervous pressure.. At the Newtown Telephone Exchange*, Sydney, where there are 470 telephone calls per hour-on e every eight seconds-on e of the attendants is on duty four hours at a stretch. In the Newtown Post Office, boys sixteen years of age are left in charge the whole night long. There are sometimes hundreds of pounds in the office. I have been told by relatives of the toys that they are frightened out wits to go to the door if a knock comes during the night. These boys are receiving only 12s. 6d. per week. It is true that Newtown is a thickly-populated part of Sydney, but every one knows what the danare discussed. ger is. It is not a fair thing to leave a boy, sixteen years of age, in charge ot post-office, practically as a man, 'at a wage of 12s. 66. per week. could give a number of instances upon same lines.

I made representations on the subject, and, after comtrying for twelve months, I was successf u l in having the case re-opened. In order 1 I should wise of this man's claims, I attended the the inquiry by the Appeal Board, and took of the case myself. A decision has given against the appellant, and I far perhave no more to say at present on point, as - his case was fairly. put. But what I wish to refer to is the fact that one of the officials sitting on the Appeal Board-and I wish to say nothing against him personallyhad previously been elected as an employees' representative. When the time for . such an election came round again, he submitted himself for re-election, and the posfafl employees chose another person in his place by an overwhelming majority, thus practically telling this gentleman that in that position he had forfeited their confidence. I was naturally surprised to find that, although the employees did not wish this man to be a member of the Appeal Board, the Department appointed him to the position of departmental representative. If , after an .employee stands election as sn Appeal Board representative, and "" is told that his fellow-employees - have no confidence in him, the Department is to turn round and appoint him to represent them, what sort of confidence can we expect the employds to have in a Board so constituted? I have no doubt that, the Postmaster-General will admit that the discontent in his Department is costing the country many thousands of pounds - A discontented service is the most expensive service we can have. Men will not do their work with any heart if they are dissatisfied and will do onily a fraction of the work which they would do if they were working contentedly. It is admitted in railwav management that the cheapest, service is a contented service, and that, entirely apart from the rates of wages paid, the most expensive service is a discontented service. From, the point of - view, therefore, of securing the best return for the expenditure of public money, a contented service in the Post and Telegraph Department should be established at the earliest possible moment. I favour very strongly the appointment of a Board of Commissioners, such - as we have managing the States Railway Departments, independent absolutely of all political influence.",46
357,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,That would be a nice thing. How would the public servants air their grievances then ?,47
358,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I should make the Postal Commissioners employers under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and should permit the employees associations to register under the Act. They might then settle their differences by means of a Board appointed for the purpose. I do not say that I am likely to succeed in bringing about what I advocate; but, in my opinion, it would be the best course to pursue. I should hope that we will not continue .indefinitely the very unsatisfactory state of affairs which has existed for the last two or three years, under which this House is made an institution for the ventilation of grievances of postal and other public servants. It must be admitted that there does not appear to be the same amount of discontent in the other public Departments that there is in the Post and Telegraph Department. The National Parliament of Australia has certainly more important work to do than to be continually listening to a recital of the grievances of public servants.",47
359,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Whic h of the previous for Postmasters-General is responsible for the existing state of affairs?,47
360,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"In my opinion, the Government are responsible. We have a continuous Administration, and the fact that a different Minister is from time.to time appointed Postmaster-General does not relieve the - Government as a whole of responsibility for the state of affairs existing in the Post arid Telegraph Department. I think that a sufficient case has been made out for the appointment of a Royal Commission. It could be composed of experts.",47
361,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Where shall we get them?. In the Department?,47
362,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Does the honourable member really think that it would be impossible for us to secure the appointment of experts as-a Royal Commission to deal with the grievancesof the Post and Telegraph servants? In the interests of the postal employees, the public, the business of this House, and of Ministers themselves, and if the Commonwealth is to lay claim to be able to conduct a Public Service effectively, it is necessary that some drastic action should be immediately taken to remedy the unsatisfactory state .of affairs that has existed for so long. This is a question which has a special interest for members of the Labour Party. We look upon the Post and Telegraph Service, or any of the great Public Services controlled by the State, as affording examples of the benefits of the adoption of a system which we desire to see extended in other directions. To justify our faith in the system we advocate, it is absolutely necessary that the Post and Telegraph Department, .as a great public Department controlled by the State, should be administered effectively, and that in the public interests we should have in it a body of contented servants.",47
363,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [8.29] - Wit h the indulgence of the Chair, and the House, I should like to make an explanation which I was prevented from making when the Prime Minister rose to withdraw his amendment, because debate was not then admissible. The honourable member for Parramatta and myself were, at the moment, drafting an amendment which' would have had the effect of carrying out the Prime Minister's wish to adjourn this, debate, and would at the same time have safeguarded the ""right of the honourable member, for Gwydir to another opportunity to move his motion. That amendment was completed and written out at the table, with an alteration I suggested, when the Prime Minister suddenly rose and asked leave to withdraw his amendment. Honourable members were unable to say a word, and had to allow that to be done. I . strongly sympathized with the desire of the Prime Minister to adjourn this debate.",48
364,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable gentleman took a queer way of showing it.,48
365,Mr REID,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister allow me to explain? He. is not often here.,48
366,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member is always explaining when he is here.,48
367,Mr REID,Unknown,"When I was Prime Minister, I was here constantly. The honourable gentleman's health plea has gone now. We were all fairly indulgent when he was ill . But now that he is well, we should be glad to see him a little more in the chamber than we do. An amendment was written out by' the honourable member for Parramatta and corrected by me 'just at the' moment the Prime Minister rose to ask leave to withdraw his amendment. We proposed to meet the wishes of the Prime Minister by adjourning this question, but at the same time not jockeying the honourable member for Gwydir out of his rights. That was a. move that we were tide prepared to join in. If I had had the' opportunity I should have moved an amendment which would have enabled the honourable member for Gwydir to bring this important matter before the House, as he' was entitled to do. The' moment I arrived here on Tuesday, and had an opportunity, without any idea that the honourable member for Gwydir was going to take the step he has .taken,I expressed my views in the strongest possible manner upon the absurdity of the Committee which the Ministry had appointed - At that time. I made no hostile move-n o endeavour to move any amendment or bring any party - feeling into the question. I confined myself to as strong a protestas I could make as to the absurdity of such ' a Committee to deal with the widespread dissatisfaction and grievances that exist in this Department, which is under the - control of Ministers. To ask the Minister to sit upon' grievances alleged against his administration, or to ask his colleagues to do so, is one of those freaks which are rare in the history of parliamentary government. IJiave never heard of such a case. I have heard of cases which are quite apart from any question of .grievance or dissatisfaction ini which Ministers have formed a sub-committee. For instance, on defence and matters Of thfOt sort, sub-committees are quite common, but where the administration of Ministers themselves is being arraigned in Parliament and by the public, then Ministers never appoint a Committee to whitewash themselves. They might have declined to appoint any Committee whatever,, and it was perfectly within the - rights of the Ministry to say to the House and the country,-""We are aware that matters are not satisfactory in this Department,- but we ask you to trust us by the ordinary methods of administration to bring about a remedy of .existing grievances."" But the Ministry took no such step. They have taken the unusual step of asking Ministers who are ih charge' of other Departments-the Minister of Home Affairs is one-to leave their Departments and become members of a Committee which will be .an absolute waste of time and energy unless it visits, not only the large centres of population, but the remoter centres of Australia, where these grievances are felt far more bitterly than in cities like Sydney and Melbourne. The other day an extra delivery was given in one of those great cities, which already has, I believe, four deliveries a day. A fifth delivery, which cost thousands of pounds, was granted, whilst there are many places in the country which do not get a delivery once a day.",48

369,Mr REID,Unknown,"If the inquiry is to be a thorough one, it must travel all over the Commonwealth. It must take into consideration the grievances of people in the outlying districts of Australia, as well as in the large centres of population. How can the Postmaster-General, with this enter. ormous Department upon his shoulders, give up the time necessary for such ouiry ? How can the Minister of Home Affairs do so? It is physically impossible that those honourable gentlemen can dismonths charge the duties of their offices and perexpect form also the duties of such a Comexpressed mittee. Who are concerned in this ? Some honourable members like to assume that they are the chosen representatives of workers of Australia. They claim they are also the representatives of the workers in these great Departments. We desire to claim an equality-n o more-wit them in our desire to look after the legitiin mate grievances of the workers of Ausas tralia. The honourable member f o Gwydir- I do not know whether his action was contrary to the wishes of the Labour Party or not-ha s brought this matter It affects 12,000 workers in the Commonmember wealth- a pretty large body of persons, whose interests ought to command some gard, not in one corner' of the House alone",48

There must now, so that there are about 13,000.hands of all grades-Australia n workers-em ployed in this Commonwealth service.

Surely the the honourable member cannot complain that when I take advantage of this opportunity to repeat my objections to the course which the Government has taken. I do not think h I am to be accused of political manoeuvring doing so. I am asserting the same right the honourable member for Cook has just r asserted. Does the Postmaster-General say that the honourable member for Cook was guilty of political manoeuvring in addressup. ing the House in support of the honourable for Gwydir ? Why should there be one law for a man on one side of the chamreber and another law for a man on the other side ? - That imputation is an unworthy one, and suggests what will probably. take too. place.

The Minister of' .Trade and Cusemployes toms is responsible for his administration of the Postal Department, and the present Postmaster-General has inherited that responsibility. The Ministry is responsible for the administration of the Department since it has been in office, as any other Ministry would be. Not only is there intense in all ranks of the service, but the public of Australia is dissatisfied. he The administration of the Department can never be sound until it has been scrutinized in by a fearless and competent body of men. It is not for us to say who the Royal Commissioners should be. That is the function of the Executive. They must decide the I matter on their responsibility. All that the do honourable member for Gwydir did was to seek to,give an opportunity to the House to express the opinion that the inquiry which Ministers have, enteredupon should be conducted, not by Ministers, but by. Royal Commissioners, . a position which almost every honourable member must in his heart and soul approve. When honourable members who are able to vote on the prothe posal before the House do not wish to do so, the only thing to be done is to adjourn the debate. The alternatives are to come to the scratch and vote like men, or to run away. My honourable friends wish to run away. Will the Government allow these tactics ?

I am sure that he knew it. position he took up was that to him the interests of the Government are not as as are those of 12,000 postal and of the general public of Australia, and that in the performance of his dutyi to the Department and to the public he must take a course which he would probably have avoided could he study the exigencies of political warfare. I have not invented the situation; it has arisen independently of me. But surely it is not expected, when such a situation arises, that I should abandon the view which I have taken on other occasions. I repeat with greater earnestness my belief that one of the greatest services that can be rendered to the public of Australia is the putting of the affairs of this Department on a sound and more satisfactory footing. That can never be done by Ministers, because the responsibilities upon them are such that if they were to leave their Departments in order to conduct the necessary investigation, "" confusion worse confounded "" would follow. Is it not an extraordinary way of reforming a Department to send the man at the helm of affairs away from the central Seat of Government-the place from which he can do his best to administer theSe varied interests throughout the Commonwealth-to send him on a travelling Committee of inquiry ? It is only an excess of party loyalty and devotion that can justify such a preposterous proposition. It is bad in itself. It is a sort of revival of the StarChamber inquiry of former days. Where would the men of liberty have been centuries ago if they had had to bring their ances before the Ministers of Henry VIII . or Queen Elizabeth, or Charles I . ? Where would they have been if they had had to go before an authority of that sort to ventilate their grievances against the Government? Fortunately,, we live in different days, and in these enlightened times, when men .have grievances to be investigated, we endeavour, as far as we can not to make the judge of those grievances the man or men of whom com- plaint is made and who are responsible for their existence. If honourable members are prepared to justify that sort of inquiry the issue is a very simple one. We do not need to run away from it. We can easily vote on it one way or. the other, and I d;> not think it is likely that the Prime Minister will throw any influence into the scale of endeavouring to prevent the issue, now that it is raised, from being decided. I endeavoured to make a suggestion when the rules of the House prevented me, but now that this debate has proceeded, what an absolute waste of .time it would be to [37o ] postpone it in order to renew it on another occasion-unles s there is some other motive!",50
401,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister will tell us that, in view of the state of public business, he cannot possibly force it on.",51
402,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think that that would, be very likely to happen. If any definite day can be given to the honourable member for Gwydirto renew this matter in some pointed way, and personally I do not wish to throw any obstacle in the road- ,. Mr MCDONALD - What about GoodFriday ?",51
403,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is no doubt the sort of day that would be appointed for the purpose. Now that the matter has occupied the time of the House, I think that it ought to be got rid of. It is a simple proposition, namely: Should this Commitr tee of inquiry proceed or not? The Post-. master-General makes a propositio.n ""to meet the stress of the occasion which, in my opinion, is only another eccentric jokein the. way of government. . The first eccentricity was the appointment of Minis-! ters to investigate complaints against themselves. But that is succeeded by a proposal more eccentric still. The Minister now tells us that if he should find that he and his brother Ministers were incapable he would pass a vote of censure upon himself, and them, and supplant-them by a griev- Royal Commission. That is one of the additional follies of this most foolish situation. Whether the matter ranges from a mail contract down to the. quantity of. beer which the miners of Kurri Kurri consume, when was the Postmaster-General otherwise than' confident of his complete ability to deal with every situation which might arise? That is not what the public want. They do not look to the Department for reform. They look for a searching inquiry which would cast a flood of light upon the whole' of the operations of this Department. I should like to read to the House a sentence or two from the report of the Public Service Commissioner, .whose name has been brought into these debates, in my opinion, in a most objectionable way. There have been attempts to interpose that officer between the Ministry and their responsibilities. That is an absolutely wrong thing to do. . If we put a man in the position of Public Service Commissioner, he should be protected.",51
404,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If he, as a matter of policy and public duty said that certain 1. appointments should not be made, surely there is no objection to that being stated?",51
405,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should not like to draw the rules too tightly, but I have noticed a desire to drag his name into this discussion as if he, in some way or other,, were responsible for the existing state of things.",52
406,Mr MAHON,Unknown,He is responsible for their interjections. more than half of it.,52

412,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That-is just what he does.,52
413,Mr STORRER,Unknown,He puts juniors over seniors.,52
414,Mr RE ID,Unknown,"I am very sorry that I drawn these remarks. Whenever a man is in the position of a Public Service Commislittle sioner, honourable members can easily open the flood-gates upon him. He has few opportunities, if he is an honourable officer, of being an amiable officer. But he has many opportunities of incurring unpopuin larity and dislike. I regret that I have troduced his name if it is to be the means of reviving these attacks upon a man who square miles. is unable to defend himself.",52
415,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman withdraw his statement that the Postmaster-General was responsible for the introduction of boys of sixteen years of age into responsible positions?,52
416,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not withdraw that.,52
417,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It is a fact that it has been done. . Mr Reid - I do not hold the Service Commissioner responsible for that.,52
418,Mr SALMON,Unknown,No ?,52
419,Mr REID,Unknown,No ; because I do not . lieve that he did it.,52
420,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I can cite an instance where it was done in my electorate.,52
421,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We want to'find out if he is responsible for it.,52
422,Mr REID,Unknown,"If the Bublic Service missioner is involved in any way in this matter, that only creates another objection to an inquiry by a Cabinet Committee. There have been strained relations between the Department and the Commissioner as to the position which a certain assistant' secretary should occupy. Does not that show the wrong of appointing a Minister to sit in judgment upon matters which involve an officer with whom he is in conflict' in .the administration of his Department? It only points to the unfairness - of the course which has been taken, and I am much obliged to honourable members for I want to draw attention to. some observations of the Commissioner which honourable members have reIn his annual report, he saysIn previous reports I had.occasion to refer to the circumlocutory and unbusinesslike methods that mark the administration of Government Departments generally; and, although I am pleased to observe that some improvements are in this service, I nevertheless feel that there still exists much scope for bettering the systems on which Federal' Departments are administered, particularly by the introduction of what he a policy of decentralization. I believe that we never can have an efficient postal service for the Commonwealth, unless we have a system under which the responsible heads in the States do the execuhave tive work, subject to review in important matters by the central authority. From the I know of the relations between the head office and the State officers, I should not like to express an opinion positively; but I have a very strong suspicion that the main reason for the chaos which, exists this Department is the absurd and iminpossible attentat to govern on principles of red tape a continent containing 3,000,000",52

428,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I know that the Parliament has conferred upon him absolute power. be Mr THOMAS BROWN - In his last report, the Commissioner points out that he is decentralizing his own Department by giving the State inspectors greater power.",52
429,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not care whether the principle is adopted by the Commissioner Comor any one else-it is an absolutely sound principle. In my opinion, we shall never have satisfactory results unless, the heads of these States Departments have almost as much authority as they had in preFederation days, in the actual management of the Department, and in the effort to study the convenience of the public.",52
430,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Postmaster-General said that powers have lately been given to the Deputy Postmasters-General.,53
431,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,And I have a list of the powers here.,53
432,Mr REID,Unknown,I ask the honourable member for South Sydney whether he approves of this Ministerial Committee .of Inquiry?,53
433,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I shall be prepared to answer that when I am on my feet- I am now referring to a different matter.,53
434,Mr REID,Unknown,I hope the honourable member is not offended at the question.,53
435,Mr WATSON,Unknown,No ; I think it is very amusing.,53
436,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not see why it should be amusing. It is the adjournment idea that is amusing.,53
437,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is much that is amusing about this debate !,53
438,Mr REID,Unknown,"Is that what wreathes the countenance of my honourable friend with smiles? How care-worn some honourable members looked before the dinner adjournment, but how happy 'they look now that the strain is removed.",53
439,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Than k goodness, there is no strain for me either way 1",53
440,Mr REID,Unknown,I should like to ask honourable members to listen to some words from the annual report of the Public Service Commissioner.',53
441,Sir WILLIAM LVNE,Unknown,Is it wise to into these matters?,53
442,Mr REID,Unknown,"Thes e are matters upon which we may be ""taken to be all agreed.",53
443,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The raised is one of administrative detail.,53
444,Mr REID,Unknown,"My only desire is to get the benefit of the experience of the Commissioner on a question, not of personal management, but of the general administration. . This is what-he said, . . . the future condition, of the Federal Departments must necessarily ' depend in no small measure .upon, the principles of administration adopted and pursued in the early stages of their career. Let me stop there - The proposed Cabinet Committee will have.to sit in judgment on the principles adopted by their colleague in the management of this Department. Is it not absurd to ask one Minister to sit in judgment on another? . Mr Mahon - The present Ministers did. not invent those principles of management. The right honourable member himself ad-' ministered them. - [37o]- 2",53
445,Mr REID,Unknown,"May I suggest that I am not still responsible for what went on in the years 1906-7-8? Surely the most rabid degree of political hatred cannot go so far as to suggest that? Surely I can review the conduct of Ministers during the last two and a half years ? Surely the Ministers are on their own responsibility, and are not mere children to copy the blunders of others ?",53
446,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,How about the blunders of the right honourable member's colleagues ?,53
447,Mr REID,Unknown,"If there were blunders, the present Ministry ought not to be such children as to copy them. However, the Public Service Commissioner goes on to sayThe time is therefore opportune for the summary checking of any tendencies that may be now insinuating themselves into official life, and which may ultimately have the effect of bringing upon Australian administration that opprobrium and ridicule to which uther services have, been subjected-whe n it is then all too late to ""effect any substantial reform. I should look to a Royal Commission to render great public service to Parliament by throwing a. flood of light on the operations of the Department, and by making recommendations which would prove of infinite assistance, not only to the present Ministry, but to those who may succeed them. We can quite realise the complication which would arise in the Cabinet on recommendations being presented affecting the administration of its members. go The initial consideration of any report from the . Cabinet Committee would involve a number of difficulties which could not .arise in the case of an indepenquestion dent Royal Commission. We have had Royal Commissions on questions of much less consequence. There was a Royal Commission on the Drayton Grange affair, on bonuses, on navigation, old-age pensions, the administration of Papua, and an expert Commission on the Federal Capiral Site. If the unfortunate blacks of New Guinea are worth a Royal Commission, surely the 12,000 men in this Department, and the public of Australia, are worthy of similar consideration. Mr LIDDELL' - The right honourable member has forgotten the Secret Drugs Commission.",53
448,Mr REID,Unknown,"Was that a Royal"" Commission ?",53
449,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Yes ,53
450,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then I am glad that the gentleman who .formed the Commission had the opportunity of travelling in state, because he is a very worthy man as an individual citizen. In view of these previous Royal Commissions, can it be said that it is not worthwhile to have an inquiry of the kind into the grievances of the 12,000 workers in the Post and Telegraph Department-int o the allegations of overworking and sweating? Surely, those honourable members who look on overwork and sweating as blots on modern civilization, and who are anxious to 'turn things upside down in order to prevent such evils, will now assist the cause of the workers, whom they are supposed to represent? Now that the grievances of the Post and Telegraph employees have been voiced by a member who is supposed to represent these men, we shall surely have the members of the Labour Party, and the champions of social reform generally, joining in the camnot paign against sweating in the Public Service.^",53
451,Mr WATSON,Unknown,This is quite pathetic !,54
452,Mr REID,Unknown,"When the honourable member for South Sydney was on the hustings he strained his throat with pathetic ing, and his eyes were filled with tears as he pictured a time when sweating would be unknown. Now, however, when he is seated on his well-stuffed cushion in Parliament, the wrongs of the 12,000 workers in the Postal Department are a subjectof merriment,",54
453,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,No. : the merriment is due to the right honourable member's funny way of saying things.,54
454,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think the proposal for the appoinlmetnt of a. Royal Commission is a good one. If is not in itself a party proposition, and has not been submitted in a party spirit. I quite admit that, brought forward as it has been, it is a proposition which the Government may have to take into consideration; but all I now say is that the proposal having been laid before the House, it is our duty to deal with it. If honourable members « think that the proposition is one that should be supported, let them vote for .it; or if. honourable members think it is a proposal that should not be supported, let them vote against it. But the flag ought not to be hauled down at the first sign of fight-do not sneak out of the conflict. Come up to the scratch like the men you have always professed to be. Will you all run away?",54
455,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member address the Chair?,54
456,Mr REID,Unknown,I ought to have asked whether all honourable members in the Labour Party will run away?,54
457,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Why this anxiety?,54
458,Mr REID,Unknown,I have no anxiety at all on the subject.,54
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member does not even desire an adjournment.,54
460,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not even desire to prolong the debate.,54
461,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The right honourable member desires to make party capital out of the question.,54
462,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is a nice thing to say ! I am only saying what I said when there was no issue of this kind before the House. That may be a reason why I should repeat myself,, but it is only what I laid before honourable members when there was no party - issue involved. I have no desire to push this question to a sudden division, if the. honourable member for Cook will name some reasonable day for plead- the resumption of the debate.",54
463,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The right honourable member's party prevented an adjournment before dinner.,54
464,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member must be fair. May I suggest to the honourable . member that, in common fairness, even to an opponent-becaus e that is where fairness comes in",54
465,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,We do not get much fairness from the Opposition.,54
466,Mr REID,Unknown,"Migh t I suggest to the honourable member that when an honourable member in moving the adjournment of the debate is prevented by the Standing Orders from explaining his object in doing so, the whole House is placed at.a disadvantage.",54
467,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Some one at the time desired that the House should proceed with the debate on the Seat of Government Bill.,54
468,Mr REID,Unknown,"The adjournment ""of this debate without an arrangement as to when it should be resumed would be very unfair. Mr J. H. CATTS - The honourable member who. objected - did not care when it was to be resumed.",54
469,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is a matter of comment, not of fact.",54
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is absolutely incorrect.,54
471,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,It is correct.,54
472,Mr REID,Unknown,"When the temperature rises sometimes, we get a little unfair, but I believe that every honourable member in cold blood 'wishes to be fair to his opponents. I should like to point out that if an honourable member moves the adjournment of a debate without mentioning when it is to be resumed",54
473,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"-The honourable, member did not wait for a date to be mentioned.",55
474,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It would be the next question.,55
475,Mr REID,Unknown,"The debate having once been adjourned, there .would be no "" next question."" If the honourable member has in view some definite date, within a reasonable time, for the. resumption of the debate, well and good. I am prepared to agree to its adjournment for three weeks. That would give the Government time to appoint a Commission, and there would then be no party trouble.",55
476,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is fair.,55
477,Mr REID,Unknown,I am speaking only for myself; I have not consulted my party.,55
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This day weeks will be the next grievance da v. . Mr Reid - I did not have that in mind; I am not dreaming of making such a concession. What I say is that if the debate were adjourned until the first day on which we meet after the holidays, I should be satisfied. I do not wish to push this question to a division with undue haste. If the honourable member wishes to know my real opinion, it would not be at all to my interests to precipitate a crisis at the present time. I have no particular interest in forcing on, at the present time, a division on this question, but I have a very strong opinion upon it, and wish to give effect to it . If the Government will consent to the adjourned debate being made an order of the day for the first day on which we meet, after the holidays, I shall not object.",55
479,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Why should the ' Government give a preference to one and not to another?,55
480,Mr REID,Unknown,"The only reason is that we have the floor, and that when honourable members are asked to give up possession, they are entitled to some consideration - If any reasonable arrangement can be made, I do not wish to push the question to a division now; but if no reasonable arrangement is come to, it is ""only right that we should settle it, now that it is before the House.",55
481,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [9-14] - I should not have risen, but for the change in the attitude taken up by the right honourable member for East Sydney. The attitude that he assumes when he wishes to gain a point is historical. He has addressed the House to-night in his old style-wit h his claws gloved but ready to pierce the Government at any moment. He imagines that by special pleading, by special suavity of manner, he can impose on men who know him as well as he knows himself. He would make honourable members believe that all he desires to do is for their good and not for his. I venture to ; think that the right honourable member's political character is too well known to permit of his imposing on any one. He has endeavoured to-night to throw into the vortex of party feeling and party voting a proposal introduced I believe by the honourable member for Gwydir without any desire that it should be made a party matter. He is very much mistaken if he thinks that he is going to succeed. His statements tonight mean, if anything, that he wishes to create a situation that will disturb the three % Government.",55
482,Mr REID,Unknown,"What a horrible offence. I plead guilty. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable member has been stirring this way and that way to ascertain the temper of the House, and finding that it is opposed to him he has decided that it would not be reasonable to do anything to-night. That is his usual attitude. He does not come out boldly and accept the responsibility for an attack upon the Government; he tries to shelter himself, and in order that he may reap the advantage endeavours to work up party feeling in respect of a proposal made by another honourable member. I do not think that he will be able to do so on this occasion. What is his political history as to the redressing of grievances ? When he was in office the condition of affairs complained of 'existed in the Post and Telegraph Department very largely as it does today.",55
483,Mr REID,Unknown,Nolhin g like it.,55
484,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"At that time he did not raise his voice against it or attempt in any way to change the system. The attitude assumed by the right honourable member ill becomes him. 'No one can accuse the Government, and especially my honourable colleague, the Postmaster-General, of not having the greatest sympathy for the Public Service.. My complaint against the Postmaster-General 'sometimes is that he bends too easily to clamour.",55
485,Mr HALL,Unknown,Does the fault lie at the door of. the Treasurer because he would not provide the money ?,55
486,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am going to' refer to that, but I wish first of all to deal with the attempt of the leader of the Opposition to cajole honourable members into the belief that.he is acting in their interests and in those of the public servants of the Commonwealth.",56
487,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"How treat the Public Service of New South Wales ? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - W it h one stroke of his pen he reduced by ,£301,000 the salaries of - public servants in New South Wales. He said to the Public Service Board, "" You have to reduce salaries to that extent.""",56
488,Mr REID,Unknown,That is not true.,56
489,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is absolutely correct.,56
490,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the leader of the Opposition to withdraw that remark.,56
491,Mr REID,Unknown,"Certainly , sir, I withdraw it until the honourable member has finished.",56
492,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,An honourable member should rise to withdraw a remark.,56
493,Mr REID,Unknown,"I thank you, Mr Speaker; but it is hard on me.",56
494,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not want to do the honourable member an injustice,56
495,Mr REID,Unknown,"Will the honourable member allow me to say that the. reduction of salaries by ^301,000 was made on the report of the Commission which I appointed to inquire into the service.",56
496,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The amount of the reduction was not fixed by the Commission.,56
497,Mr REID,Unknown,Absolutely .,56
498,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If I am wrong I apologize to the right honourable member, but I do not think I am. The right honourable member threw into the lap of the Public - Service Board his ultimatum that salaries were to be reduced to that extent.",56
499,Mr REID,Unknown,Absolutel y no. It was the recommendation of the Commission.,56
500,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The determination to make that reduction was not conveyed in the ordinary way to the Public Service of New South Wales. them learned of it for the first time by having a notice of dismissal placed in their hands when they reached their offices,- while others on returning home at night received an intimation that they were dismissed from the service - I have no desire to further discuss the matter. I was led to refer to it as illustrating what the right honourable member is prepared to do when it suits him. I repeat that no one can justly accuse the Postmaster-General of not being in sympathy with the Public Service. I do not think that any man can accuse me of lack of sympathy with it. My past history is evidence of that. In New South Wales I was instrumental .in securing the enactment of legislation which indid he sured the payment of good salaries to the public servants of that State. The honourable member for Cook has referred to the action of the New' South Wales Railways Commissioners, and, in that connection, I would ask himwho prevented the questions which were being asked in the New South Wales Parliament .by dozens and dozens concerning the disabilities under which the railway employees laboured?",56
501,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"- I rise to a point of order. I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether the Treasurer's remarks are relevant to the question before the Chair? , Mr ' SPEAKER - The Treasurer appears to me to be justifying his present action and any proposals that he contemplates by a reference to his past action in similar circumstances. In doing that, he is perfectly in order.",56
502,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member for' Cook .declared that the railway servants of New South Wales did not, through their representatives in Parliament, shower upon the Government of the dav questions regarding their disabilities. I rrlay say that these clamours continued until the Commissioners appointed a Board of Appeal. The railway servants desired that one of their officers should be elected to sit upon that Board, and I was responsible for the introduction of a measure which was passed by the State. Legislature, and which enabled them to attain their object - From that time forward, scarcely any questions were asked in Parliament in reference to their troubles.",56
503,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The Treasurer will remember that the Labour Party was sitting behind him then.,56
504,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have always admitted that the Labour Party helped me Many of to pass the best legislation in regard to the Public Service that has been enacted - in Australia.,56

506,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member has been my friend a good many times recently.,56
507,Mr REID,Unknown,Does the Treasurer want an adjournment of the debate ?,56
508,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The right .honourable member has stated that the Prime Minister deliberately attempted to prevent the honourable member for Gwydir from getting this motion discussed. Any person who knows the Prime Minister must be - aware that he would not be guilty of an act of that sort. I happen to know what are his views upon this question, and I also chanced' to be sitting close to the honourable member for Wide Bay when he jumped up and moved the adjournment of the debate. I turned to him, .and said, "" You had better fix a day,"".and' he replied, "" I am going to do so."" That is how I knew that he intended to fix a. da.y upon which the - debate could be resumed.",57
509,Mr REID,Unknown,"It could not come on otherweight wise. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - If an agreement were arrived at that the debate a good officer. - should be resumed on a special day, there would be nothing to prevent that course ing adopted. The Prime Minister does not wish to prevent the honourable member for Gwydir from dealing with this question upon a future date. Some honourable memmatter bers apparently desire to blame the Public Service Commissioner for the existing - of affairs. From the speech which I desioner livered the other evening, and which was intended to make my position clear in gard to the increased expenditure in the Postal Department, it must be plain that 1I have no feeling against the Commissioner. On the contrary, I support him. I say that if I were to search the whole of Austo tralia, I could not obtain a man in whom I have greater confidence.",57

512,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is a matter which ought to be fought out in Cabinet?,57
513,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I never wish again to sit in a Cabinet in which I have Commissioner. to deal directly with public servants. I am responsible for the measure under which Public Service Commissioner was - appointed.

LYNE - I pin my faith beto the Commissioner because of his strength of character'and honesty. Let me take the case which has been referred to by the honourable member for Cook in regard' to the of' appointments'. One thousand appointments of a permanent nature _ were state required in this Department. The Commisnever said that the additional officers were not 'wanted, but I impressed upon him reand upon the Department that to appoint a thousand new permanent officers in a boom year might place us in a very awkward position if the boom"" ceased, and we could not get rid of those who were afterwards found be unnecessary. I maintain that that was a sound principle to lay down'.

Post and Telegraph Department. I believe that a great deal of good will be done by the Postmaster-General and those associated with him in the re-organization of the Department. Probably the tails will have to be carried out by persons having more time at their disposal than the members of the Cabinet Committee will have; but the Government as a whole will not take up the. position that the intricacies of the Department are not to be inquired into. Indeed, the Government have sisted upon such an inquiry, as the Postmaster-General said a short time ago. fore I sit down, I cannot help saying that although the leader of the Opposition was so glib just now in trying to cajole the orable members of the Labour Party, he has to-night, whatever he may say to the contrary,, absolutely blocked the opportunity of dealing with the Federal Capital Site - question.

I have no doubt that the Postmaster-Genelack Tal and his colleagues will be able to the same, and will not need to go very or to occupy any considerable time in taking evidence.

They should be able to deal with that very quickly, and should, in doing - discover the reasons for much of the trouble that has arisen. We should then have an improvement in the condition of affairs within a very few months, and that is what I desire. I certainly do not desire that it should be necessary for me to bring forward another set of Additional mates like the last.' I wish to be assured that the greatest economy^ is being practised. I do nqt - think that it necessary that I should say any more, but I do hope that this will not be converted into a party question in the manner in which the right honourable member for '.Sydney has attempted, both by his speech, and by his attempt to get under the of the Labour Party.",60
558,Mr CARR,Unknown," [9.43] - I generally admitted that there are very serious grievances in the Post and Teleto graph Department. In common with other honourable members who have spoken, could enumerate quite a number of them, but it seems to me that, in common justice to the Postmaster-General, we should some allowance for the fact that he has recently taken charge of a service which, for. some time past, has been badly in need of repair. Almost the whole of the .appliances are practically worn out, means have not been provided ""to cope with the great expansion of business which has largely been due to the enterprising innoposition to decide such questions vations of Commonwealth administration. -""We have had an assurance that it would - require an expenditure of something like may ,£3,000,000 to put the Department in a bethoroughly efficient condition as regards and offices. I - believe that to adopt ' the course suggested of appointing a Royal Commission of - Inquiry would only delay the the alleviation - of the grievances of the officials. No one will charge me with any, of sympathy for the public servants. do I think that, in connection with the adfar ministration of this important Department, it might be said that, whilst the - Postmaster-General proposes the Public Service Commissioner disposes. In this connection also we have a right to bear in mind the existing unsatisfactory system, for which I think Parliament in a large measure has itself to blame. I believe that the Pubenlic Service Commissioner is an admirable part man, and the best man available for the position which he holds. I do not desire to reflect upon him in any way, but I say he is asked to carry out a superhuman task. How is it possible for any one man so, to familiarize himself with all the details of administration connected, with the largest public business in Australia to such an extent as to be able to say what particular officers should be appointed or promoted. I should not for a moment advocate the introduction of political influence in conEstinexion with the management of such a Department, but we should divide the responsibility for its management. We can - is best do that by investing the Deputy Postmasters-General with greater powers., They should not be under political control, or even suggestion, but we should make them East permanent heads or managers of the Department within their respective States. If wing we were running a commercial concern doing business throughout Australia, we t is should' not dream of making one man to such an extent the sole administrator as call upon him to deal with promotions and appointments in every part of the I country. It is impossible for the Public Service Commissioner to be conversant with the circumstances of every case, and make to be able to say that a particular man should be promoted to a certain position, or that an additional hand is required in a particular post-office. The Deputy Postmasters-General, whose inspectors are more and numerous and more closely in touch with the ramifications of the Department in the various States, should be in a much better It would have been very much better to adopt a system under which it would be their duty to deal with such matters than to create an autocrat, as we have done. 1 use the term advisedly, but without any reflection upon the Commissioner. I believe that he does the best he can in the circums.tances, and better than many others who might have been appointed to the position would have done. But we are asking. him to do a great deal too much. We are blaming the Postmaster-General far stagnation in his Department, though his suggestions for the improvement of the condition of affairs might be checkmated by the Public Service Commissioner, who, in his turn, would no doubt do what he believed to be best in the circumstances. The improvement in the service, which we are all anxious to see, might have been effected had the Deputy Postmasters-General been made managers of the Department in their respective States rather than mere clerks, who must do - practically what the .Public Service Commissioner tells them to do. I have great hopes of the inquiry now being made by the Cabinet Com-' mittee, before which every employee may give evidence, and be protected. I have every confidence in the Postmaster General as a sympathetic administrator. Altruism in an administrator is a better qualification than an adherence to hard-andfast business principles. The conclusions arrived at by the Committee of the Cabinet as the result of their inquiry must come - before the House for discussion; and we can apply hard calculating business acumen to the consideration of their recommendations, if it should be considered necessary to impose a check upon the adoption of proposals due to the too kindly nature of the Postmaster-General. I . prefer the inquiry entered upon by the Cabinet Committee to an inquiry by a Royal Commission at present.",60
559,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [9.50] The woes of the Public Service, especially in the Post and Telegraph Department, are well known. I think I have heard of them for the last fifteen years. Sweating, long hours, and overtime have frequently obtained. But I know, and have confidence in, the present Postmaster General, because I have worked with him. He was the principal means of having the inquiry which obtained the first Royal .Commission on factory legislation in Victoria. That was the origin of the present - factory law in this State. I know no man who is his superior for his present - position, in so far as he is afforded an opportunity for putting down sweating. The leader of the Opposition says that the proposed Royal Commission should go into every part of ihe Commonwealth. To that suggestion the words of the comic song can most fittingly be applied-it - would be "" Years and years, and years and years, and years "" before the Commission reported. I have not yet known of a Commission that has not wasted time and' delayed action, and their results have not been worth half what they have cost. The right - honourable member spoke of the Commission on the Public Sendee in New South Wales. I should have thought his bitter memories of that affair would cause him to leave' it alone. What good did it do? It simply delayed the settlement of the question. If we are honest; we have this matter in our own hands. If the hours are too long, let us pass an Act that no employ^ in the Department shall work beyond - eight hours, and wherever an employehas to work longer, let him send in his account and lie paid. Let us provide the money, and not compel the Treasurer to refuse to make fresh appointments. What Treasurer, has done as much as 'the present Treasurer has? The Post Office authorities said that they wanted 1,000 extra employees io put an end to the present system, bu't only two-thirds of that number could be provided because the Treasurer could net supply the money required. With regard to. Commissions, I may fairly quote the words of 'the cynical German philosopher,- that "" If 'the Almighty had placed the making ' of the earth in the hands of a Commission, it would not have been made yet."" I speak with a knowledge of many Commissions. I have been on them, and know how delay takes place. If die present Pootmaster-General were appointed as a 'Commission ro deal with this great question, I should have every confidence in the resuPt. I know no man who has done more than he has in the fight against sweating. With Mr Stephen Barker as organizer, he and the Rev. Mr Edgar, Mrs Muir, and others .did splendid work as a Committee against sweating,. I am sure 'the Prime Minister, if he were pre r sent, would endorse that statement. The first complaint in regard to the conduct of the Department is 'the long hours. This Parliament can stop that, or say that every man who works overtime shail be paid for it. Another complaint is that it is hard for the employees to advance. There must be great difficulty in such a large Department in satisfying, every one who wishes to be advanced. I am a great believer in examinations, and should like to see some form of examination adopted, by which those in the fifth class could prove their fitness for promotion to the fourth class, and so on through the service. If there were ten carpenters working together, one week would be quite sufficient to show who was the best workman amongst them. I thought it only fair to my friend the Postmaster-General to give.him my meed of thanks for the work lie has done. To show that I have full confidence in him, I shall vote against the proposed Royal Commission unless I am fully convinced that it can get 'through its work in a short time. The honourable member for Cook suggested the appointment of a Commission to control the Pos*t Office independently of this House, but the splendidly officered body of which he is the secretary, and therefore the directing officer, would not seek for any one outbide their ranks, over whom they had no control, to fill his place if he resigned. Parliament should keep full control of the Department. Mr J. H CATTS - I urged the pointment of a body of Commissioners, like the Railways Commissioners, but with a Wages Board and an appeal to an Arbitration Court for the redress of grievances.",61
560,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I will give a slight example of what has happened under the Victorian system of the control of the railway's by Commissioners. Under that system, one man's salary was raised from £ i 6 to £ 7 0 a week. The honourable ; member for Flinders was Premier at the time, and his Minister of Railways was Mr Bent. I challenged bdth of them to deny my statement, and they dared not do it. The railways in Victoria were never better managed than, they were when Mr Bern: was previously Minister of Railways, and directly under the control of Parliament. „ Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member's argument is-a condemnation of the present system of control of the service by ,a Public Service Commissioner. - Mr MALONEY - I am not speaking against the three Railways Commissioners personally. They are fine men, for whom I have the highest regard and respect. I am speaking of the system. There is much more sweating in the Victorian Railway Department today under the Commissioners ""than there ever was under any Minister of Railways who was answerable directly to Parliament. I am always pleased to see the leader of the Opposition present. No matter how he may ""try to cajole us. he always raises ' a laugh, and T should like to see him oftener in his place.",62

We shall have the honourable member for Dallev with us before very long. A't any rate, I guarantee that he will vote more often with us than against us.",62

564,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Many of us fchink we are free agents when we are not. I am afraid the honourable member is one of that kind. I am totally opposed to the' appointment of a Royal Commission. I am content to await the report of the 'Committee already appointed by the Government, and must compliment them upon the man whom they have in the position of ap- Postmaster-General.",62
565,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [10.0]. - I do not endorse the opinion of the honourable member for Melbourne that Commissions are useless. The experience of this Parliament is that they do useful work. I can scarcely imagine a more onerous and intricate task than that intrusted to the Tariff Commission ; but it was disposed of expeditiously. The proposed departmental inquiry would not be nearly so heavy, and the public investigation of competent and independent Commissioners would give general satisfaction to all concerned. That an investigation is necessary is no longer open to question. The Postmaster-General now admits that the Department is not in as satisfactory a state as can' be wished, and the Government has recognised the need for reform by appointing a Cabinet Committee of Inquiry-. That Committee may do useful work. Its members may discover the cause of much of the friction and dissatisfaction which exists, and may submit proposals, the adoption of which would do much to remedy the trouble; but they cannot deal with the subject as a Commission such as that advocated by the honourable member for Gwydir could do. The departmental officials will not have the confidence in the Cabinet Committee that they would have in an independent Commission, because they will naturally argue that this and previous Administrations aie responsible for the existing state of affairs, and, therefore, not too ready to bring about reforms. Even if the Cabinet investigation is made, the Government will ultimately be forced to appoint a Commission.",62
566,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Cabinet Committee will do a great deal of practical work in a short time, and, at least, clear the way, if it does not satisfv everv demand.",63
567,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"It may the way for a wider and more thorough investigation ; but this is practically all can be expected from it. By appointing the Government is only staving off the appointment of a Commission. It wpuld better, in the interests of the public and the service, to at once comply with the demand for a more thorough investigation at the hands of an independent body. The cause for the present dissatisfaction must be removed - If it is not'removed, the mand for the appointment of an indepengested. dent Commissio'n to control postal adminisadditional tration will become so strong as to be sistible. I do not desire the appointment of an independent Commission, because think that it would prove inelastic and servative. I would rather sent administration made efficient. I disagree with those who say that the . existing dissatisfaction - is chieflv to the fact that officers cannot the promotion to which they think themtwo selves entitled, and thus nourish grievances against their superiors or the Public Service Commissioner. The causes of the friction are deeper than that. I believe that the source of the trouble is that a wrong policy has been pursued since the beginning of Federation in centralizing a wide stretching organization in Melbourne. To the heads of Departments who previously chaotic existed in the States there has been .added a seventh, and the desire has been to centrate the vast and intricate work of administration in the Central Office. this policv, the Public Service Commiswell sioner has joined issue with the Post Office Administration. In his report, points out that the tendency all over civilized world, particularly where advanced democratic legislation, is centralize; but that we are moving in the new policy. opposite direction. At present, if a telegraph messenger asks for a holiday, or a recommend another policy. promotion, or a transfer on the ground ill-health, the application has to be investiadopt gated locally, and finally submitted to Central Office for a decision. The heads ' of the States Department have been practically shorn of administrative power. Force of circumstances has compelled the Postmaster-General to confer on them certain powers; but it has been done unwillingly, and with, ill-grace. Not very long ago, it was necessary to expend or a few shillings, in carrying out some urgent work in a little country office. But, before anything could be done, the matter had to pass through miles of red-tape, until it clear reached the head office.",63

We want a Commission fo find out why. some officers have been tained, and why others have been dismissed in terms of the law.

In this report, it is also distinctly shown were that the Postmaster-General interfered in matter of the classification of an officer. face of an adverse report from the Comnecessary missioner, and in face of the fact that.that officer, though appealed to again and again, refused to make a recommendation, an officer was promoted to get an increase salary outside of his classification by transfer from the clerical to the administraIn tive division. That is another point on which the Commissioner and the Postcalls, master-General are in conflict. In his port, the Commissioner urges upon the head of the Department the need of decentraable lizing' the service, and the gain and adbeen vantage which would accrue therefrom.

I do not desire to go into the details of grievances, particularly those of a personal character; but I must say that the present on central method of management has duplicated and immensely increased the work, men while not providing any additional means of carrying it out, or additional pay for the officers. For instance, the other day .1 was reinformed that, in consequence of some frauds involving a sum of about ,£300, the Central Administration had devised a new preventing similar frauds in the These frauds were of an exceptional character; but new regulations issued, and they involve much duplithe cation of work, clerical and otherwise.

573,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Werriwa) [10.35] - I do as not wish at 'this late hour to unduly detain honourable members, but having moved the adjournment of the debate, I think it right' to say that ' I am not prepared to go further in that direction. . I propose now to vote for .the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gwydir, providing for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I shall do so, realizing, the possibility of serious results following - the carrying of that amendment. I should vote for it with much less regret if the Seat of Government Bill and the Tariff had been disposed of, AYES. but as I am thoroughly in favour, of the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the serious grievances existing in the Postmaster-General's Department at the present time, I intend to vote for its appointment whatever the result may be. I have ho doubt that whether the present Ministry remain in office, or some other party take possession of the Treasury Benches, the wishes of the House will be respected, and that if a majority desire the appointment of a Royal Commission, that Commission will be appointed. NOES. Mr DEAKIN (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [10.37] - Perhaps , after ail, Mr Speaker, I shall serve my purpose better by expressing the hope that we shall at once proceed to a division on this, question, and intimating that if the Government are defeated upon it they will regard it as an indication of the desire of the House that His Excellency the Governor General shall find new advisers.",65
574,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Is this a rallying cry ?  showing us that he has some pluck.,65
575,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [10.38]. - I am one of those who, although the hour is late, desire to speak to the question. Much as I appreciate the implied attitude of the leader of the Government, I do not think that it should debar us from expressing our views on the point at issue. I should have preferred the. debate to be adjourned so that honourable members might give expression to their opinions' upon the question without being called upon to remain here until an inconvenient hour - I think that it would have been wise to allow a little time to elapse so that the situation might be considered.",66
576,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The leader of ' the Opposition said that he had no objection to that.,66
577,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Quite so; and with his usual consistency, he voted the other way.",66
578,Mr REID,Unknown,"Do not say that. I said that I had no objection to the adjournment of the debate if a definite date were fixed for its resumption, but no one suggested a definitedate.",66
579,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I was under 'the impression that a. date had been fixed. Air. REID - Oh , no. Mr WATSON:-Whils the was addressing the House, I understood the right honourable member to intimate that he was willing to agree to the debate being adjourned to a convenient day if a day were fixed.",66
580,Mr REID,Unknown,"I mentioned the very day. I said that if it were agreed that the debate should be resumed upon the first sitting day after the holidays, I was quite in favour of its adjournment; but, up to this moment, no such suggestion has been made to me.",66
581,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I was under the impression that the head of the Government had stated that a specific date would be fixed for the resumption of the debate. In my opinion, there is need for an inquiry into the Post and Telegraph Department. There is no doubt that for a considerable time past a great deal of friction has been created in that Department, part of which I fear is due,' not to the officers at its head, but to this Parliament. In the first place, we know that friction has arisen between the Public Service Commissioner and one of the Ministers. I wish to say here that there is no officer in the Public Service for whom I entertain a greater respect and admiration than I . do for Mr MCLachlan. I think that he is a man of firmness of purpose, whose temperament peculiarly fits him for the office which he fills. He is also a man who has a wide grasp of the working of the various Departments, - and who pos- sesses considerable ability in other directions. But, in my view, Parliament has a right to criticise his policy, and I contend that the policy which he has carried out, of placing junior officers, in every instance, in important positions in expanding Departments, is not a good one. Departments which are rapidly expanding call for the services of at least a reasonable proportion 'of men of experience. The Public Service Act gives to the Commissioner power to grant to officers certificates of exemption from the ordinary routine prescribed, if the circumstances of the case should warrant it . In my view, the Public Service Commissioner has adopted a wrong policy in respect of the Post,and Telegraph Department. That Department has had to bear the result of an unwise policy upon his part. In addition, We know that the Treasurer of any Government is always anxious to cut down the Estimates as much as possible. I was such a short time in the office of Treasurer that I had not an opportunity to exercise any malign influence in that direction.",66
582,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member tried to do so.,66
583,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I did in some respects. It is only natural that' every Treasurer should attempt to cut down the Estimates of the various Departments-especiall y the Estimates of a large and growing concern like the Post and Telegraph Department. All this shows that there is a necessity to reconsider the whole position so far as this Department is concerned. After having given the matter a great deal of consideration, I am of opinion that the Department has grown to such proportions that nothing short of placing it under an independent Commission will meet the possibilities so far' as its expansion and management are concerned. . I am strongly of opinion that it must be withdrawn from the direct control of Parliament, and that its finances must be' placed on a much more independent footing before we can expect to achieve any satisfactory results. That being so, I say that there is a need for inquiry into its working. In regard to the action taken by the Government, I wish to say that there is a good deal in the contention that it is a mistake for Ministers to think that they are necessarily the best judges of .the new duties which should be cast upon the shoulders of the Public Service Commissioner. In myopinion, they have come into conflict with the Commissioner in instances, and, consequently,' their judgdeal ment as to the best means of overcoming the difficulty which has gradually sprung up is, to some extent, warped. That being offices as well. so, I should prefer to see an inquiry conducted by an independent Commission, rather than by a Cabinet Committee. But the amusing feature of the situation to- night is that honourable members upon your left, sir, have shown a unanimity and yearning for the appointment of a Royal Commission that is nothing short of marvellous. Those honourable memberswho tonight clamour for the immediate appointment of a Royal Commission, without even affording time to allow two or three little urgent matters to be fixed up-for example, even - the Federal Capital Site questionwho urge that justice shall at last be to our public servants",66
584,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is it not time that something was done?,67
585,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I dare say. Butthe gentlemen who are so unanimously clamourvote ing for the appointment qf a Royal Comorable mission would have expended just as much' vocal energy in denouncing the Governing ment for shedding their responsibility they appointed, such a Commission.",67
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"How can the honbate. orable member say that, when, as a matter of fact, a member of the Opposition has had a motion relating to this: very matter speaking on this question. standing upon the business-paper for some position: time ?",67
587,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I do not include that honourable member in my remarks. The unanimity of honourable members opposite is simply marvellous, whilst toan extent it is amusing.",67
588,Mr REID,Unknown,There has been a wonderbeen f u l unanimitv upon the honourable member's side for some time.,67
589,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I do not know that it has always been manifest. It was rather entertaining to find that there had suddenly been developed amongst both sections of the Opposition a desire to have this matter settled out of hand. From appearances, it looks as though they will have an opporWe tunity-durin g a short period, anyhow-o doing something in that direction. trust that we shall find a proper recognito do-that is their look-out. tion of the pathetic picture put before by the leader of the Opposition to-night. done right or wrong.

[3.71] many quite agree that there has been a great of sweating in the Central Offices of the Department in the various big cities.",67
590,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,And in the country,67
591,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes ; but the overwork has been mor.e pronounced in the big offices than in the country offices. There has been a great deal of sweating that has not been creditable to the Department, no matterfrom what stand-point it is regarded. I trust that my honoiable friends will show a little more anxiety later on than'has been exhibited to-night, both in regard to the object aimed at, and the reforms that it is desired to accomplish.",67
592,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [10.51] - I think that what we are doing done to-night ought to be madequite clear. The honourable member for Gwydir submitted a proposal towards which honourable members of all parties had expressed their entire sympathy many weeks ago. It was put to us to-night that surely we would not in such a way as to prevent some honmembers from speaking on the question at issue.

595,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes , it could. .",67

At all events, they should have taken into their confidence the. honourable member for Gwydir.' They should have said to him, "" We recognise that you have a motion on the paper, and, as we have suspended private members' business for the remainder of the session, and there be very few opportunities of dealing with your motion, we should like to know what your opinion is as to what should be done."" It might have made a great difference as to the attitude of the honourable member Gwydir had the Government taken that Commission ? course. I think that those who voted as I did on the last division, took the only possible course, with the object the appointment of a Royal Commission to deal with the matter.",67
597,Mr MCDONA LD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [10.54] The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has said that those with whom he voted on the last, division took only course they could have taken towards securing the appointment of a Royal Commission. I presume that the honourable member has taken some interest in political life and political methods. If he had least suspicion of what generally occurs in political life in such circumstances, should know that a Government could not remain in office in. the fact of such a vote as has just been taken - . I say that Government remained in office in face of the last vote, they would be the most contempit tible set' of men who ever held office history of Australia. If the next division goes against the Government they will cersolitary tainly go out of office; and what chance has the honourable member for Gwydir ting his Royal Commission then ?",68
598,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,E very chance.,68
599,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Does the honourable the member for Gwydir hope to appeal to the right honourable member for East Sydney and his party to secure the appointment of this Commission?,68

615,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"No , but some of members of the party to which I belong voted with the Opposition, and so gave them a majority, which shows that it was not a party question with us.",68
616,Mr REID,Unknown,Is this relevant to the question ?,68
617,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think that so far the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy has been absolutely relevant, but an interjection made just now by the honourable member for East Sydney was decidedly disorderly.",68
618,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not know whether it is due to the burning anxiety of honourable members of the Opposition to get on to the Government benches; but what has amused me most in connection with today's proceedings has been the way in which they have treated a certain question. A great, public question has been, for the last six or seven years, ing the minds of the people of New South Wales to such an extent that they were prepared,' at one time in our history, to bring about a revolution in the Commonwealth if it were not immediately dealt with. 1 refer to the question of the selection of the Federal Capital Site. Honourable, members opposite have, however, today been prepared to waive that great question, because they have raised all sorts of objections to the adoption of any course which would insure its being decided to-night, in order 'that they might obtain a victory over the Government which might land them on this side of the House. I find no fault with them if they consider that good parliamentary tactics.",69
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All this comes of voting for a motion which proceeded from the Labour corner. There is no satisfying honourable members of !the Labour Party.,69
620,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It does not come from voting for a motion to prevent this debate being adjourned. It has arisen because 'the right honourable member for East Sydney, and the honourable member for Parramatta, refused to allow the Prime Minister to carry an 'amendment which would have enabled the House to deal with the important question of the selection of the Federal Capital Site, for which they have previously professed themselves willing to die. That is what brought about the crisis. I think that, in the circumstances, we had better' at once settle the Capital Site question by voting solidly for Dalgety. I have nothing further to say - The Opposition may take advantage of the position which has arisen, but I must' compliment the Prime Minister upon the action he has taken. It was the only honourable and straightforward course which he could take in the circumstances.",69
621,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [11.2] - I wish to speak upon a subject of very great interest-the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the Post and Telegraph Department-bu t as it is now very late, and as I understand that the Prime Minister has definitely stated that he is willing that the debate should be, adjourned until Wednesday next, and then resumed, I move That the debate be now adjourned.",69
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Prime Minister said no such thing. Mr Speaker having risen and several agitathonorable members interjecting,",69
623,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Standing Orders specially require that honourable members should give their attention while the Speaker is ' addressing the\ House. Honourable members will see that inattention then might, lead to serious misunderstanding - afterwards, and I therefore ask them, if not out of regard for the Standing Orders, at least for their own sakes, to permit me 'to speak without interruption - An honourable me^iiber, an moving the adjournment of a debate, is required to do so without speaking to 'the question. As the honourable member for Corio has spoken to the question, I cannot receive his motion for the adjournment of the debate. I therefore callupon the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.",69
624,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Hav e I not the right to continue my speech ?,69
625,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,No ; the honourable member resumed his seat.,69
626,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [11.4] - I do not wish that this debate should be immediately concluded. An anxiety was displayed earlier in the evening to get rid of this most interesting subject. I must say that I have been somewhat surprised by the speech delivered by the honourable 0 member for Kennedy. The honourable member has adopted a role which is new to him.,69
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",69
628,Mr HALL,Unknown,The honourable member should be careful when he is cheered by the Opposition.,69
629,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I care very little whether the Opposition are cheering or hooting. I was not aware that the honourable member for Kennedy had been appointed lecturer-in-chief to honourable members who take a different view of this matter from that which he takes. I have yet to learn the reason for the extraordinary anxiety the honourable member has now displayed for the continued existence of our present paternal Government. I am quite well aware of the condition of the suffering fortunates who travel the interior of the Commonwealth, and very often get - less than 30s. a week. I have looked through the Government programme; I have heard many of their protestations; I have assisted in passing some of their measures, but I must add that the honourable member for Kennedy has himself mentioned one measure which they have not introduced. The honourable member is aware that although the Prime Minister has for six years held a position as head of the Government, or has been a prominent member of a Ministry, the people to whom the honourable member for Kennedy has referred are still in an unfortunate condition, and have not been relieved by any measures submitted by Ministers. The Prime Minister directly ' intimated three weeks ago that the passing of a measure to establish old-age pensions in this Parliament depended upon his ability to securean agreement with the Premiers of the States.",69
630,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is . not correct.,70
631,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Will the honourable member for Kalgoorlie take his seat. The honourable member for Kennedy said something two or three times about men earning 30s. a week, but I was not aware that he referred to the question of old-age pensions.",70
632,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The honourable member did mention old-age pensions.,70
633,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I was not aware of it. If the honourable member for Kennedy did incidentally refer to that question I shall not, as I intended, prohibit the honexisting orable member for Kalgoorlie from referring incidentally to the question.",70
634,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I thank you, sir, for that consideration, and will take advantage of it first by replying to the interjection of the Prime Minister. I said that the orable gentleman had stated in this House that his ability to pay old-age pensions during this Parliament' depended on ' a satisfactory arrangement with the States Governments, otherwise an old-age pension system could not be initiated until the piration of the Braddon section.",70
635,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is not correct. later than this morning I pointed out that the Government were considering alternatives in the event of the States Governments not agreeing.,70
636,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If it be shown that my memory has played me false in this matter I shall give the Prime Minister an un- ample apology, but I shall be very much surprised to learn that the honourable gentleman did not reply to me when speaking in this House that, so far as the Government proposal in connection with old age pensions during this Parliament was concerned, it depended upon a satisfactory arrangement being made with .the States Governments. I put it to the Prime ' Minister to say why, if . an arrangement-of the kind was not necessary to finance the Government proposal, he has waited so long before introducing it.",70
637,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is not necessary that I should answer, the honourable member. He knows the answer to his question.",70
638,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not expect the Prime Minister to answer questions tonight. I do not intend to deal further with ,the statements off the honourable member for Kennedy, who has been long enough in' Parliament to know that honourable members have a habit of .accepting responsibility for their actions when they have done what they believe to be right. I believe that there is a condition of seething discontent in the Postmaster-General's Department so far as the officials are concerned, with a maximum of inconvenience to the public. Whilst the Minister has been running here and running there expressing opinions about the sobriety of miners in other places, and all other questions; his Department has been getting into such a state that the majority of honourable members deem that there should be an impartial inquiry into the conditions in it. The amendment was submitted in the most friendly fashion by the honourable member for Gwydir, and the Government chose a position for themselves, and they will not make me alter my vote by any threats of possible consequences. I hon- have heard a few threats before in this House. They can adopt the attitude which they believe . to be in accord with their dignity. They have perfect liberty to interpret their responsibility in any fashion that they desire. I have made no ex- complaint of that. They cannot say that 1I have broken faith with them, that I owe No them any particular consideration, or that they owe me any. Those who voted against the adjournment to-night did so for the purpose of getting a. Royal Commission of Inquiry. A proposal was submitted earlier today by the Prime Minister, which indicated that he wanted to take the time in which this motion could be . debated and decided. House was against him, and proposals have been submitted all the afternoon to overcome the difficulty. Members who favoured the motion were agreeable to the fixing of any date, so long as they were satisfied that the motion could be forced to a conclusion before. this session ended.",70
639,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I was pledged to that, and the Prime Minister agreed to it.",71
640,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wide Bay, as the result of investigation, assured me that it was possible for the motion to come up on the next grievance day-the e weeks ahead-but , if we happen to be here then, somebody else with a grievance may get in front of this particular grievance. Mr FISHER.:- I thought I could give an assurance that that would not happen.",71
641,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Corio desires to speak, and if the Prime Minister will say that the question will be brought to a conclusion- I under-, stand that there is now an agreement to that effect",71
642,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,There was from the first.,71
643,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,There was One before the last vote was taken.,71
644,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We were not made parties to it.,71
645,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I hope the Government will go to a vote to-night.,71
646,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That will suit me admirably. If the Government had stated this afternoon their readiness to make a day available within a reasonable time for the consideration of this question, the members of the Labour Party, who are voting for this inquiry would have agreed to that course being taken. I understand that a proposal to that effect has been submitted now in an informal way, and that the Government desire to continue the debate next Wednesday.",71
647,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",71
648,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If so, I think I can speak for the members of the Labour Party who voted on this side when I say that, upon that understanding, we will not further oppose the adjournment to-night.",71
649,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If there is an understanding to take a vote which the Government have declared that they will regard as a vote of want of confidence ! . The Mr Frazer - I make no secret of the fact that I want a Commission appointed, and intend to vote for it. Those associated with me have not taken up this attitude to. embarrass the Government. If the Government like to make it an embarrassing motion, that is their responsibility. I have no particular regrets about it. If the Government choose deliberately to assume a certain attitude, what have I to cry about? It is due to the members of the Labour Party, who voted on this side, that they should get a direct indication from the Government as to when the division is to be taken. _ If the Government say: "" Take the division to-night,"" I am quite prepared for it. If they say: "" Take the division next Tuesday,"" we are prepared to give them until Tuesday to make up their minds to agree to the appointment of the Commission.",71
650,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What good is there in putting it off beyond to-night?,71
651,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Vot e to-night,",71
652,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,This is an illustration of how informal arrangements sometimes lead to trouble between members. Mr .CROUCH - The honourable member promised to agree to an adjournment.,71
653,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I will agree to it now.,71
654,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The honourable member is doing everything he can to prevent it.,71
655,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Government have intimated through the honourable member for Corio that they want an adjournment till Tuesday or Wednesday.,71
656,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"No ; they have agreed to it at my request. I wanted to speak, and the honourable member spoilt my speech. I could say more in five minutes than the honourable member could in five hours.",71
657,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the Government say that a division must be taken to-night, I shall be abundantly satisfied. I shall conclude by referring again to the statement of the Prime Minister in connection with old-age pensions, reading from a clipping his actual words. When speaking on the subject, I saidThe Prime Minister thinks that he will then be able to make a statement that will be satisfactory to all.",71
658,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I propose to lay all the proposals relating to the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, involving old-age pensions, on the table.",71
659,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister indicate to the House how - near that will bring us, in the event of 'the House being agreeable to the adoption of the Bill , to the provision old-age pensions?",72
660,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I - could not say that now.,72
661,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister having said that he is going to introduce a Bill , must accept the responsibility of admitting that he is not in a position to say when pensions, in the event of the Bill being passed, will' be paid to the old people. The Prime Minister an assent, and I admire the honourable gentleman's frankness. He does not appear to be sanguine as to the possibility of doing anything until the expiration of the Braddon provision.",72
662,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Quite true. That was the promise made on 21st March.. But to-night the Prime Minister sat on rail, when I said that the making of provoted vision for the payment of old-age pensions by the Government in this Parliament depended on a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at between the Government and the Premiers of the States.",72
663,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Not at all. I pointed out the alternatives before, arid I did so again today.",72
664,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"When I said what the Prime Minister's"" statement was, he disputed my accuracy.",72
665,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I do now.,72
666,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Then the honourable and learned gentleman had better read the rewhich port for himself. I am prepared to vote ior the appointment of a Royal Commission division. to inquire into the state of the Post arid adjournment Telegraph Department.

While I was being consulted by the oppose it. honourable members for Wentworth and Corio on points of order, the honourable member for Kennedy, I understand, spoke on the subject, and had I been listening to him, instead of attending to other official business, I should have called him to order; but as he went so far, I have permitted the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to do same. I cannot, however, allow other honopinion orable members to discuss the matter.",72
668,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) .[11.25] - I regret that there should be any heat in this of discussion, because there is no necessity for it. A number of honourable members, including members of the party to which I belong, are desirous that a Royal Commission shall be appointed; I do not take thatview. I think a Commission unnecessary. Honourable members must, of course, vote nods as they see fit; but I personally am opposed to the appointment of a Commission. Indeed, I regret that the Cabinet Committee has been appointed - No doubt there are matters which want rectifying; but a sympathetic Minister could remedy every grievance in the Postal Department. Therefore, I shall vote against the amendment of the a honourable member for Gwydir. Those who in the last division may be divided into two classes. In the one class are those who honestly think that the present Administration should not be in power, and that they could render better service to the community'. They were justified in voting as they did. In the other class are those , who regard the appointment of the Royal Commission at the present time as the most important question affecting the interests of the Commonwealth. Even if I thought the appointment of a Royal Commission necessary, I should consider that there are matters of even greater importance than the rectifying of the grievances of the Postal Department. I am delighted with the stand Ministers have taken, and trust that they will remain firm. I know of no real reason for postponing the taking of the Those who voted against the of the debate must feel so strongly on the main question that I cannot imagine that any change of opinion will l occur within twenty-four hours, or between' now and next Wednesday. The honourable to member for Kalgoorlie has stated frankly that an adjournment would make no difto the ference to his view.",72
669,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"But if the Prime Minister, any through a private member, requests an ad- matjournmerit until Wednesday, I shall not",72
670,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The real question is: Shall a Royal Commission be appointed? I admired the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for the frank way in which he has spoken. The honourable member does not object to the debate being adjourned for a few days, but I venture to say that if it the were adjourned he would be of the same at the end of a few days as he is to-night.",72
671,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Absolutely .,73
672,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Then let us settle the question now. If it is considered that Royal Commission should be appointed, it be done tomorrow. If there is seething discontent in a great Department' of the Public Service, the sooner action is 1 taken the better it will be for the country and the Department. - trust that the Government will consent a vote being taken. I regret, sir, under your ruling, we are not allowed make any reference to the"" question of oldbour Party. age pensions. If it had no,t been given, 1 would have said that one reason why I . of himself. should be very sorry to see the Government displaced at the present moment was that they ,have given us a promise of establishing a system of old-age pensions.",73

676,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I should be very heat or passion. sorry, indeed, to belittle any member of the House, even if I could, particularly a member of my own party. I have been supporting the Government on this tion, and I have to give some reasons I take a different view from those who spoken so strongly.

677,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We propose to vote for the appointment of a Royal Commission, and not against the Government.",73
678,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In the last division I voted with the Government, because thought that. if they retained office we should have a better chance of getting cera tain matters which I consider to be of let greater importance than even the appoint'ment of a Royal Commission dealt with. If , however, 1 had thought that the appointment of a Royal Commission was of more importance than the settlement of I those matters, I would have unhesitatingly to voted for its appointment. I understand that, that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to has expressly spoken on behalf of the La",73
679,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"No , he spoke on behalf",73
680,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"He used the words, "" On behalf of those who voted against the motion,"" and no one disputed his statement. I am not questioning the vote of any member of the Labour Party, or of any other party. Every one has the right to vote as he likes. I am not finding fault and with any honourable member for the vote to which he has given,' but surely I am enOldtitled to state the reasons for the vote I than am about to give. The honourable member had for Werriwa has stated that, although he voted in favour of an adjournment of the* a debate, still, if the issue were raised, he would vote for the appointment of a Royal Commission. He is quite entitled to take that stand, just as I am entitled to say why I intend tc vote in the opposite direction, and that is that, in my opinion, we are more likely to get a system of oldother age pensions from the present Government, rule though, of course, I may be wrong in my view.",73
