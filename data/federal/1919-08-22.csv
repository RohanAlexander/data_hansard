1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m. anti read prayers. IMMIGRATION. NA IMMIGRANTS - BRITISH EX-SERVICE MEN AND FARM LABOURERS. Mr HIGGS' - In the absence of copies of the speech made by the Minister for Home and Territories, in introducing the Immigration Restriction Bill, I am in doubt as to whether it is the intention of the Government to prevent all persons of German and Austrian parentage coming into this country during the next five years. Will the honourable gentleman enlighten the House as to the intention of the Government in that regard 1",20
2,Mr GLYNN,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,In the speech referred to by the honourable member I made a statement on the subject.,20
3,Mr HIGGS,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,Unfortunatel y we have not yet received copies of it.,20
4,Mr GLYNN,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,I am at a loss to understand why copies of the speech have not been received. I wrote a special memorandum cm the subject. On looking through that speech the honourable member will find that provisions in the Immigration Act enable exemptions to be granted.,20
5,Mr HIGGS,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,To certain persons'.,20
6,Mr GLYNN,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,"Yes . I stated my own personal opinion as to what classes of persons should be allowed to came in.  Home and Territories state what steps the Government have taken to encourage 'British farm labourers and other desirable immigrants to come to Australia, and what is their policy in that regard)",20
7,Mr GLYNN,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,"Speakin g generally, our police at present is to settle upon the land, in conjunction with the States, members of the Australian Imperial Force, and after that to help the Imperial Government to place upon lands in Australia ex-service men. The Imperial Government has decided to pay the fares of such men to Australia, as well as those of women who have done certain classes of war work. The question of general immigration has been considered, but is to remain in abeyance until the classes to which I have just referred are provided for. I may say that there is very great difficulty in inducing farm labourers and others employed on the land in Great Britain to come out. Shortly before the war, when I held office as Minister for External Affairs, we endeavoured to encourage that class of immigration. As the result of a canvass made on a fair day about three years previous to the war about 130 persons intimated their willingness to come to Australia; but on a subsequent occasion we found that only some four were prepared to do so. This shows that farming men in Great Britain are more inclined to remain at home. I hope, as the result of a conference with the State authorities, to arrange a policy as soon as we have settled the others on the land. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE. WIVES OJ SOLDIERS-VOCATIONA L TRAINING: ATTITUDE OF INDUSTRIAL UNIONS HMS FOR - SOLDIERS : BUHDING MATERIAL.",20
8,Mr BAMFORD,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,"Will the Assistant Minister for Defence inform the House on what conditions the wives of our soldiers who have married in England are given a passage to Australia, and if any special privileges are extended to the sisters-in-law of such men 1",20
9,Mr WISE,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,I shall make inquiries. The matter is dealt with by the Repatriation Department.,20
10,Mr LECKIE,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation inform the House whether it is a fact that the industrial unions are restricting the vocational training of returned soldiers by refusing them admission to their organizations ? If it is a fact, will he state to what extent that restriction iB operating. Mx. POYNTON - I am not aware that anytbing bas been done by the industrial unions in the direction mentioned by the honourable member. Tbey bave agreed to the vocational training of maimed soldiers, and it bas been proposed that this agreement sbould be so extended as to provide for the vocational 'training of all returned soldiers up to twenty years of age. A conference bas been 'held with the industrial bodies to determine their view of further proposal. I am not aware of the decision arrived at, nor can I say that any attitude has been taken up by the industrial unions in the direction to which the honourable member Tefers.",20
11,Mr FENTON,EXCLUSION OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Eepatriation whether those who have the disposal of building materials have made favourable offers to the Department for the supply of such materials for the erection of homes foT soldier-s. If they have not done so, have the Government taken any direct action to obtain a supply in order to provide homes for soldiers at reasonable rates?  yesterday a paper which gives all the information on that subject of which I am yet in possession. I moved that the paper be printed, and it will probably be available to the honourable member next week. NA TASMANIA.",21
12,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs been officially informed of the outbreak of influenza in Tasmania? If so, what is the intention of the Government in regard to the existing quarantine restrictions as between the mainland and that State? MT. GREENE - I have received from the Tasmanian Government an official intimation of the outbreak of pneumonic influenza in that State. Upon receipt of it, we immediately notified the Tasmanian Government that in the circumstances we proposed to abandon the existing quarantine restrictions as between Tasmania and the mainland, and to substitute in their stead surveillance before, going on board ship,-and three days' surveillance after arrival in the State.",21
13,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That is what you are doing?,21
14,Mr GEEENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Yes ; the Tasmanian Government have intimated its approval of that step being taken» IMPOETATION OF SHEEP DIPS.  reconsidered the question of allowing the importation of sheep dips, as promised by the Minister for Trade and Customs to a deputation of primary producers who this waited on him some three or four weeks ago?",21
15,Mr GEEENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Yes . The Government 'has given the matter further consideration; but I have nothing to add to the statement on the subject already mada to the House. .. DESTRUCTION OF BIRDS AND SEALS.,21
16,Mr KELLY,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I desire to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whethei past protests by the Commonwealth Government in regard to the destruction of bird and seal life on Macquarie Island, south of Tasmania, have met with any response from the Tasmanian Government. If not, will he consult with his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and ascertain whether it would be possible, equitably to impose some Excise duty calculated to prevent the wasteful destruction of lives of the kind which might be in time to come a valuable asset to the people of Australia?",21
17,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The question of acquiring from Tasmania control of Macquarie Island is under consideration. I looked into it some five or six weeks ago,, and determined to again submit the maitter to the Cabinet. About 1916 we asked the Tasmanian Government whether they were prepared to hand over to us the control of the island, which is about 900 miles from Sydney. I think that on a voyage from New Zealand an exitra two days would enable vessels to call at that island, and the question is whether there may not be naval visitations to the place at times. I agree with the honourable member that something oughlt to be done in the direction suggested by him. When the island was transferred to Tasmania, I think it was under lease for about £40 a year. So far as I can ascertain from the dockets, there was then a very large destruction of excellent fauna, including penguins, seals, and whalfc are known as seaelephants. Something should he done to put a stop to such destruction.",21
18,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,iWha t is to be said as to the destruction of edible fish by seals ?,22
19,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I am not at present going into submarine maltteTS. I hope that some action will soon be taken in the direction desired Iby the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly). A communication has been sent to the Tasmanian Government, asking reconsideration of the matter. SLAUGHTERING OF SHEEP.",22
20,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I desire to draw the attention of the Minister for Trade Customs, as Ifche Minister in charge of foodstuffs, to a very grave situation that faces stock-owners, and which has a national significance, because of the increasing danger of drought affecting conditions in Victoria and Riverina, where stock today are in fair condition. In Southern Riverina and Victoria, when this season's lambs mature, there will approximately 34,000,000 sheep, and the military provision for slaughtering is wholly inadequate. I desire to ask the Minister whether the Government has any proI posals to meet the situation, which inChanter volves, not only serious individual, grave national, loss.",22
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"All that I can say day is that we have made most urgent representations to the Imperial Government with regard to lifting existing stocks of frozen meat in Australia, so to provide the fullest possible room in existing slaughtering works. We making further representations to them in regard to the whole situation.'",22
22,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The present capacity of those works is quite inadequate.,22
23,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The capacity of the existing works to deal with the stock quite another matter. AUSTRAXLAN INDUSTRIES.,22
24,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Is the Minister for Trade and Customs aware that, owing the competition of cheap labour countries, Australian industries are closing down ? When will the Government, afford relief to local industries ?",22
25,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I suggest to the honhe orable member's consideration that if his under arrest. colleagues will allow the House to do a little more business than has been done lately the consideration of this matter will be expedited. ALLOWANCE POST-OFFICES ,22
26,Mr LECKIE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"In reference, to the revenue scale which governs the allowance to small post-offices in the'country, I ask the Postmaster-General whether a new scale was issued in the early part of this year, and is it in consequence of that revised scale that the present allowances for post-offices are being curtailed?""",22
27,Mr WEBSTER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,There has been no alteration in the scale or in the methods of dealing with allowance post-offices durand ing the last three or four years. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.,22
28,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I desire to make a perdaily sonal explanation. The Age newspaper this morning, in reporting remarks made by me yesterday, in regard to the Somali incident, gives the following statement: Mr Chanter - Did Mr Yates deny that on be a prior occasion he had refused to obey a belts ? order regarding the donning of lifeMr Yates - No ; but by whom was I brought before the commanding officer?-by your son. desire to explain that it was Captain who ordered me to put on a filthy but lifebelt next to my skin. It was not Major Chanter who made the statement to to the press of which I complain. Later :",22
29,Mr CHANTER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I was absent from the chamber when the honourable member as for Adelaide (Mr Yates) made a perthe sonal explanation regarding the distincare tion between Major J. C. Chanter, D.S.O., and Captain A. L . Chanter. AU .1 desire to say is that the Major Chanter referred to is my son, and Captain A. L . Chanter, who, I stated yesterday, had placed the honourable .member for Adelaide is under arrest and reported him for insubordination, is my grandson.",22
30,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I rise to another personal explanation. I have no objection to the honourable member for Riverina adto vertising his son and his grandson.,22
31,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Order !,22
32,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,But the honourable member misrepresented me in regard to the events that took place on the Somali when stated that Captain Chanter placed me,22
33,Mr CHANTER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Well , he reported the honourable member to the Officer Commanding.",23
34,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The honourable member has been misled. If his son and grandson have told him things that are not correct. I cannot help it ; hut the fact remains that their statements are incorrect and malicious, and that they detrimentally affect me. I was not placed under arrest on board the Somali. I was ordered on boat parade, and I promptly stood to attention at my position near the boat to which I was allotted. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - And they gave the honourable member sixty days for that ?",23
35,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,No ; the honourable member's brain is incapable of understanding the position.,23
36,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN, Order ! The honourable member must not 'be offensively personal!,23
37,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"My sentence of sixty days' imprisonment had nothing to do with the incident to which I am referring. When the whistle for boat stations was sounded on the occasion referred to by the honourable member for Riverina, I was playing a game on the deck. By the time. I had descended to the troop deck to get my lifebelt, another digger had been there before me.' In consequence, I had no lifebelt, and when I got on deck",23
38,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to a personal explanation, amd I ask other honourable members to refrain from interjecting.",23
39,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I had to get a lifebelt' from some place,23
40,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The honourable member will not be in order in going into all these details. I again remind honourable members that a personal explanation must be confinedto matters in respect to which >an honourable member has been misrepresented or misunderstood. The sole purpose of an explanation is to correct a misrepresentation or clear up a misunderstanding of something he has said previously. The honourable member for Adelaide will not be in order i ing to the House a lot of details, which, however important and interesting in themselves, are not properly relevant to a personal explanation.",23
41,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,In order to controvert the statement of the honourable member for Riverina that I was placed under arrest; it is necessary for me to state what happened on the occasion referred to.,23
42,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,iSurel y that is admissible.,23
43,Mr BEEHTVAST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That will be all right.,23
44,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Order ! I have already laid down the procedure in connection with personal explanations. If the honourable member for Adelaide desires to go beyond a personal explanation, he must obtain the permission of the House to make a statement. I have no desire to limit the rights of honourable members under the Standing Orders, but I must insist that some regard be paid to the rules of the House.",23
45,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I was not placed under arrest. I did not see Captain Chanter until he entered the orderly-room at Victoria Barracks to give evidence in connection! with the charge laid against me. on his information. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - On the honourable member's own showing, he ought to be shot.",23
46,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Order !,23
47,Mr YATES,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"And if the officers had their way, I would have been shot.",23
48,Mr MATHEWS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,(Interjecting.),23
49,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is out of order.,23
50,Mr MATHEWS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,(Again interjecting.),23
51,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is again out of order. I call the attention of the House to the frequent exhibitions of disorder, in defiance of the repeated calls from the Chair. I do not wish to have recourse to the extreme measures which the Standing Orders empower me to use, but I must insist upon, at least, some semblance of order being maintained in the proceedings of the Chamber.",23
52,Mr CHANTER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"B y way of further personal explanation, I desire to state n statthat my remark that Captain Chanter placed the honourable member for Adelaide under arrest was not strictly correct. I admitted that by interjection, and stated that the honourable member was reported by Captain Chanter to the Officer Commanding for his offence on the occasion referred to.",23
53,Mr BAMFORD,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I desire to ask Several honourable members ing,",24
54,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Order ! MT . TUDOK - They said I spoke twice when I only spoke once.,24
55,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"This disorder cannot be permitted to continue. The asking of questions without (notice is de generating into au irregular interchange of statements shouted across the chamber. I , therefore, direct the Clerk to call on the business of the day. SMALL ARMS FAOTORY. WAR BADGES POR EMPLOYEES. Mr .GREGORY asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the employees of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, or any of them, have been granted war badges? 2. If so, how many, and for what reason?",24
56,Mr WISE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Thre e home service volunteer badges and thirty-sis munition workers' badges were issued to employees of the Small Arms Factory who volunteered to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, but were debarred from doing so. CENTRAL WOOL COMMITTEE. DUMPED WOOL.",24
57,Dr MALONEY,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has the Central Wool Committee received any moneys from persons who received such moneys as bonuses or commissions in respect of wool dumped by any company or companies? 2. Was this wool purchased by the British Government? 3. What action was taken by the Central Wool Committee to recover such moneys? 4. If so, against whom? 5. Is there any system of receiving secret commission in respect of dumped wool belonging to the producers of wool in Sydney or Melbourne ? 6. If so, what action has the Government or the Central Wool Committee taken to abolish this illegal system? 7. How much money, approximately, is distributed in Melbourne and Sydney respectively by wool dumping companies in respect of bonus or free shares issued to influence business connected with wool dumping?",24
58,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I shall endeavour to obtain the information desired, and will furnish the honourable member with a reply as soon as possible. POI NT COOK AVIATION SCHOOL.",24

62,Mr GREGORY,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"the Acting Minister for the Navy, upon notice What is the estimated cost of the new gunmounting stores proposed to be erected at Garden Island?  cost is £13,000, towards which the A d miralty wiU contribute about £5,000. BLYTHERIVERIRON DEPOSITS. Mr ""GREGORY asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice Whether it is not a fact that prior to the Blythe Kiver iron deposits in Tasmania being placed under option to Sir John Higgins they were placed under option for £10,000 or thereabouts to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company.",24
63,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I have made inquiries, and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, it is not a fact that the Blythe River iron deposits were offered to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for £10,000 or thereabouts. Immigration [22 AUGUST, 1919.] PAPERS. The following papers were presented :Koyal Australian - Naval CollegeKeport for 1918. Ordered to be printed. Public Service ActPromotion of T. O'Callaghan, Attorney General's Department. Promotion of VV. J. Nielsen, Prime Minisfor ter's Department. IMMIGRATION"" BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 20th August (vide page 11716), on motion by Mr. GLYNNThat this Bill be now read a second time.",24
64,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Yarra) [11.26] - I regret exceedingly that circumstances have prevented me from studying the second-reading speech of the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn). I have had a hurried glance through it this morning, but have not had an opportunity of completing my perusal. The press reports of debates do not give the details that honourable members are anxious to have in studying an important measure of this kind. I regret, too, that the Government on this occasion have departed from the practice of reprinting"" the principal Act with the proposed amendments shown in black type, so that honourable members may see at a glance what alteration in existing law is contemplated. The Bill itself conveys no idea to honourable members of what the Government are proposing unless they are conversant with the provisions of the main Act. Por instance, the Bill provides that section 2 of the prinicpal Act shall be amended by omitting the definition of "" the Minister."" What that means cannot be 'comprehended without reference to the principal Act. Again, clause 3 proposes to amend section 3 of the principal Act by omitting paragraph c and' inserting in its stead another paragraph. There is nothing to tell honourable members what the original paragraph c provides. Only a limited number of bound volumes of the Statutes are available in the building, and yesterday, in anticipation of the continuation of this debate, at least three honourable members on this side were studying the principal Act and the effect of the Bill upon it. [447 ] Bill. 11885 Clause 3 proposes to prohibit the immigration of any idiot, imbecile, feeble-minded person, epileptic person suffering from dementia, .insane person, person who has been insane withiu five years previously, or person who has had two or more attacks of insanity."" I do not know whether the medical experts of the Government advise that it is necessary the country to prohibit the entry of that class of person. No worse affliction can overtake any person than insanity, and I am not aware whether the medical experts advise that a° person who has suffered from insanity should be refused admission to the Commonwealth within five years of his recovery from that affliction. This provision will necessitate that every person seeking entrance to Australia shall be questioned regarding his mental history. When the Minister was explaining the Bill I asked, by interjection, what America is doing in this regard. The Minister informed us that America had taken certain action, and I know that every person arriving in the United States is first paraded on the ship, in order to ascertain whether he has been vaccinated, and then again at the Immigration Depot, Castle Garden, where further information has to be given. If we adopt this clause every person who comes to Australia will have to be asked the question, "" Have you been insane during the last five years ?""",25
65,Mr BAMFORD,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Is that question asked in America?,25
66,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"It was not when I arrived there in 1891, but I was asked how much money I possessed, and, I think, I then had 50 dol. What I objected to in America was the differentiation of treatment as between the different classes of passengers; and in the Bill before us we are adopting an entirely different principle from any hitherto acted upon in Australia. The Bill breaks away entirely from our previous ImmigrationAct. Mr G'^YNN - It does not alter the administration one bit, but it is more explanatory. '",25
67,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"We all know of persons who have suffered mentally, and who have recovered, and I hope that we are now learning more in regard to the treatment of mental diseases, as well as other diseases. I should like to know from the Minister what is the reason for this provision regarding insanity within five years.",25
68,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"That is the line of administration actually pursued, and it is now simply proposed to provide for it in the Statute.",26
69,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Is every person who comes here asked if he has ibeen insane during the last five years?,26
70,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,No .,26
71,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Then how are the sons picked out who are asked this question ? e Mr Glynn,-As a matter of fact, the of immigrants. the mental examination is made in the Old Country, and the certificates are gran'ted there. That practice has not been altered, this Bill is explanatory of testing. Mr TUDOR,-Thes e certificates are mentally defective. granted only in the cases of persons who come out on assisted passages; a person who pays his own fare from Great tain, or any other country, is not, so far as I know, asked a single question. States at one time had control of these examinations, but it was thought better for the Commonwealth to deal with Ithem, and Dr Norris was sent Home to put business on a proper basis, and bring about uniformity. It was then openly stated that immigration agents, not only for Australia, butt other countries, who were paid so much per head, utilized services of local doctors, who, of course, had no responsibility. It is true that some undesirable persons may have to Australia under that system; but the' provision in the Bill will apply to one section. That, I admit, section, because more workers than shirkers, or better class people, will ba ashall affected.",26
72,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The Bill does not say that only one section is to be exor amined.,26
73,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It does not; but we are informed by the Minister that the Bill merely gives effect to the administration in operation today.,26
74,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The insertion of any examination. this provision in the Bill makes the examination necessary.,26
75,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,In introducing the Bill I said that the words referred to really indicated the line of administration pursued at the present time.,26
76,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I object to any differentiation of itreatment.,26
77,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,There is none.,26
78,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The Minister has admitted that only those who come out on assisted passages have to obtain medical certificates. Personally, I am confident that no other class of passengers requires certificates. It is true that in a later portion of the Bill it is provided that commercial travellers, tourists, and others, who do not come under clause 3, permay be admitted as at present.",26
79,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It is desirable to examine and physical fitness,26
80,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That is all right so and long as the examination applies to all our line of classes of persons.,26
81,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The clause cannot be applied to sane persons, but only to those",26
82,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"But how are the mentally defectives to be picked out? I Briknow that the Health officer meets a vessel down the Bay, and if, for instance, The small-pox is discovered, the vessel is quarantined at Portsea; if not, while the vessel is off Williamstown the medical examination of 500 or 600 persons is the over in an hour or two. Is the Health officer to stand in front of a person and tell him that he looks as if he were mentally defective? If this provision is to stand, it ought to apply to every person the who comes to the country.",26
83,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It does now.,26
84,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"This is a new provicome sion in our immigration law. Mr. GLYNN - I refer the honourable only member to section 3D, paragraph 2, of is the larger the principal ActWhere an intending immigrant embarks at port where there is no medical referee, he prior to his departure be examined as to his physical and mental fitness. . . .",26
85,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"But only immigrants assisted passengers are to be examined. A person who can pay his fare may travel without submitting to medical examination. I can go to the Orient or any other shipping office in London, and, if I pay my own fare, may embark without",26
86,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I assure the honourable member that when I was Minister for External Affairs I arranged all the procedure for Dr Norris to carry out.,26
87,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,But only for assisted immigrants.,26
88,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Not necessarily.,27
89,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"What I have stated was the position, and, so far as I know, there has heen no alteration.",27
90,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"In order to save trouble we provided for an examination at the home port first. Passengers, however, could be examined on the voyage, and reports given by the captain on arrival, as to whether, those passengers had been examined at Home or not.",27
91,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The only persons examined under the principal Act were those who came on assisted passages. I never heard of a saloon or a 'second-class passenger being examined, and a saloon passenger who was mentally defective might be brought here. The ex-member for Nepean (Mr Cann), when I was Minister for Trade and Customs,'brought under my notice the case of a woman who had been brought out by her husband, a coal miner, and who, according to the British authorities, was liable to tubercular disease, and it was deemed desirable that she should be sent back. It was to meet such cases that an alteration was made providing for an examination in England. However, there are other provisions in the Bill of more importance. Clause 3, paragraph b, provides for the exclusion of any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who is opposed to organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. Under such a provision as that it would have been possible to exclude Sir Edward Carson, when, before the war, he was arranging for the shipment of arms to Ireland. Further, it would be possible under the clause to exclude the present Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook).",27
92,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"On what grounds do you say that? ' Mr TUDOR - I remember Thomas Ewing, in this House, giving the details of the political career of the M in ister for the Navy, and showing the number of parties to which he had belonged, and how he had preached Republican [447]_ 2 doctrines and the overthrow of Monarchy. Another honourable member, who has since gone to another place, prepared a record of the career of the M in ister for the Navy, under the title, "" Ere Joseph went down into Egypt,"" and in this there was quoted many political opinions which the honourable gentleman had expressed in former years. As I say, the Minister for the Navy, or, indeed, any person, could be excluded under such a provision as this. It all depends on the way these things are administered. The Minister himself admitted that any one could be kept out under that clause.",27
93,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I did not say so.,27
94,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The clause is a piece of nolitical camouflage.,27
95,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Rea d it , and see what it means.",27
96,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I have read it to the House already. The Government are anxious to pass a clause of this nature so that they may be able to say that they have tried to keep certain persons out of the Commonwealth. The clause could be > interpreted'in such a way as to keep out practically any person.,27
97,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Do you believe in these men being excluded from Australia, or do you not ?",27
98,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,What men?,27
99,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Me n who advocate the overthrow of society by force.,27
100,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"It all depends on the interpretation of the words. For in stance, men like Donovan and Devlin could be kept out for advocating Home Rule for Ireland.",27
101,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Do you call that anarchy?,27
102,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I do not; but such men could be kept out under this clause, because they are anxious for a different system of government for Ireland.",27
103,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That is a most unjust 'reflection on the character of those men.,27
104,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Still , they could be kept out, and Robert Blatchford, when he was a leading member of the Socialist party and editor of the Clarion, could have been kept out. Now, of course, he would be admitted.",27
105,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,No ; Blatchford was never a revolutionary Socialist. Sir Mr TUDOR - Honourable memberj can put on my action today any interpretation they like.,27
106,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Y o u have not told us whether you believe in these' men being excluded from Australia.,27
107,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The men whom the honourable member presumes that the clause is aimed at will probably be more vigorous opponents of members on this side than of members on that side.,28
108,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That does not matter.,28
109,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I know it does not; but I am not going to be prejudiced by tha fact that they are likely to oppose me. and led into saying that they must be excluded for that reason. This clause will never be administered by the present Government in the way it reads here.,28
110,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It can be administered only in the way in which it reads here ,28
111,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"This is all political "" flam."" It is stuff being prepared for the next election.",28
112,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It seems to hurt a bit.,28
113,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"It would be very easy for any member to sit down and let the Bill go through, accepting the narrow interpretation which honourable members opposite are putting on it. They say "" We are aiming at anarchists,"" but the clause goes further. I am not going to vote for a clause of that kind, when I believe that it is contrary to a policy of which we as Britishers have always professed to be proud. If there was one tradition on which the Britisher prided himself it was that persons who had been driven out of any other country on account of the views they held could find sanctuary in Great Britain.",28
114,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,What has been thd effect of that policy in Great Britain?,28
115,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"They are still there. Persons driven out of their own countries for the views they held were not those who caused danger and injury to Great Britain during the war. That came from the wealthy people, the commercial travellers, traders, and others, who had businesses in Great Britain, and whom the vernment - will let in under this Bill. German commercial traveller, and the German business man can come in under this Bill. Under it, too, the Government will let in the Japanese commercial traveller, the Japanese business man, and the Japanese wealthy man. They will also allow the wealthy German to enter.",28
116,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Well , move an amendment that Germans be not allowed in.",28
117,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If the honourable member desires such an amendment he can move it himself. All this sort of thing will be done by administration. I shall vote against the Bill, believing it to be only a piece of political shop-window dressing. I know that men's liberties have been taken away in this community, and even in this House. Our Standing Orders provide that every member shall be allowed to speak twice in Committee. On one occasion, I was made to sit down, although I had spoken only once, as I proved by reference to Mansard.",28
118,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If that occurred, it could only have been accidental.",28
119,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"When I made my protest, the man who had made me sit down had not the manliness to rise and admit that he had made a mistake. Our liberties can be taken away in this House or outside.",28
120,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If your liberty is taken away, you have plenty of licence.",28
121,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I have never exercised licence. I exercise nothing but what I believe to be my right. I suppose it will be said that I dare not open my mouth here unless I have licence to do so. We have been told that we must wait until we see what Great Britain is doing. A week ago today, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) said that we had to wait until we saw what Great Britain had done before deciding what to do with the money belonging to internees and held by the Government. Will the Minister tell me that Great Britain has legislated upon lines similar to those of this Bill ?",28
122,Mr LATRD SMITH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Nobod y has suffered more than the British worker from the influx of aliens. I have been in the east end of London, and seen what has happened.",28
123,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"My position was different from that of the honourable member. Go- I went to England in the steerage because The I could not work my passage. I could not afford to pay any more. I was not a visitor to England for about five minutes, seeing the place from a train window, and then coming back to talk about it. I lived and worked there and in the United States for five years. I had to go to the United States as an immigrant, so that I know from practical experience the treatment which steerage passengers or third-class passengers receive there compared with others. First class is not a bit too good for me after that experience. I know the position in London, for I have lived and worked with the people there. Will the Minister say that Great Britain has legislated on lines like those of this Bill?",28
124,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I have already said that the British Government dealt with the question by means of regulations.,29
125,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,But the point is that we have not waited in this case to see what Great Britain has done.,29
126,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Because we cannot make the regulations. Great Britain can make the regulations because she is a unitary power.,29
127,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Wa r Precautions Regulations are in existence as affecting somesections of the community, but the price fixing regulations were immediately withdrawn. One regulation prohibits any one from flying the red flag with the word "" Socialism "" in white letters on.it, but an auctioneer'is permitted to fly a red flag with his name on it. Apparently, Great Britain can deal with immigration questions by regulation and we cannot. We have to wait in some cases, but we must not wait in others.",29
128,Mr SAMPSON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The honourable member has not told us whether he is in favour of or against paragraph gd.,29
129,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I have told the House that I shall not vote for it.,29
130,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN, Order ! I remind honourable members that the discussion of particular clauses is a matter for Committee.,29
131,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If I had not answered the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) he would probably have gone on the platform and said that I was afraid to do so. . 1I have told the honourable member that I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill. I believe that, as Mr Lloyd George was reported to have said the other night, the people are suffering from shell-shock. Their minds are inflamed, and there is a danger of them running amok. They cannot see and think as clearly as they did before the war broke out. suppose' no honourable member has a smaller proportion of Germans or dependents of Germans in his electorate than I have. I cannot call to mind one of them in the whole of my electorate. There was one man who desired to be interned, because he had been deprived of his livelihood, but I do not know whether he has been let out or not. The Minister pointed out that the Government had power under this legislation to deport. Section 7 of the principal Act provides, in effect, that: Every prohibited immigrant entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of this Aet shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable upon summary conviction to be imprisoned for not more than six months, and in addition to or substitution of such imprisonment, shall be liable, pursuant to an order from the Minister, to be deported from the Commonwealth. That means that every person of the German, Austrian, Bulgarian, or Ottoman race, asenumerated in paragraph ge of clause 3, will be liable to deportation, even though he has beeu here for thirty or forty years. He will be found within the Commonwealth, and, therefore, be liable.",29
132,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"That .is not correct. It is for a period of five years after the commencement of this measure. The .dictation test practically applies. The clause means five years' prohibition, unless an exemption is granted.",29
133,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"But it can be continued so long as the party now in office remain there, and so long as the people are of the same mind as they are today. I still believe that persons of German, Austrian, Bulgarian, or Ottoman birth, if found within the Commonwealth, will be liable to deportation.",29
134,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Not unless it is proved that they have come in as prohibited immigrants. I showed that in my second reading speech.,29
135,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The honourable member's second-reading speech will never be considered in a Court of law. When a Court takes this measure into consideration, lawyers like the Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) will be prepared to do their best to confuse the Judges as to the interpretation of its provisions, and will be quite willing either to defend or prosecute a man for the same thing. I Mr GROOM - The immigration of certain persons into the Commonwealth is prohibited, and those persons are described in the Bill.",29
136,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Yes ; but every prohibited immigrant found in the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of the Act is liable to be deported. It is not specified that this provision is limited to those who arrive in Australia within a period of five years.,29
137,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Yes , that is provided, as I pointed out when introducing the Bill.",30
138,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"A Court will take no notice of a speech delivered in Parliament, and, although the Minister (Mr. Glynn) may have good intentions-it is said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions-h e will not live for ever;he will not be in office administering this Act for all time. I agree with Mr Lloyd George that the people are suffering from a certain amount of shell-shock. Ministers are anxious to take advantage of this circumstance. During the currency of the war we all denounced the German method of cultivating in the minds of their young people a spirit of hatred of their enemies. I do not believe in extending that system of hatred for one's enemies.",30
139,Mr LAIHD SMITH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I am pleased to hear the honourable member say so.,30
140,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"A Bill of this character will tend to stir up hatred. It will tea'ch our children to treat certain people, not as human beings, but as something quite different. I really believe that the object the Ministry have in introducing this measure is to cover up their misdeeds and their failure to take action in other directions. On one occasion two gentlemen were driving along a road behind a restive horse, and when they approached a traction engine the driver said to. the other, "" I will give him a good clout over the head."" "" Why ?"" said his companion, "" Because,"" said the driver, ""he can think of only one thing at a time. If I give him a clout over the head he will think of that, and will forget about the traction engine."" Ministers think that by stirring up their supporters with this class of legislation they will distract their attention from the profiteers. They will say to the electors, "" We legislated to keep every German out of Australia for five years,"" but they will not tell them that at the same time they will permit German commercial travellers or wealthy German tourists to come in, or that they will have one method of examination applied to those who travel in the steerage, and another to those who travel in the first saloon. I object to a continuation of this policy of keeping up hatred. We should endeavour to get the people, of Australia to realise that no good purpose will be served by doing so. Professor Meredith Atkinson, in a recent address, said that he had heard more extreme views put forward in Oxford University than he had heard at any gathering on the Yarra Bank or elsewhere. Apparently those who expound such views in Oxford University would be prohibited immigrants under the proposed new paragraph gd.",30
141,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Professo r Atkinson would also be kept out.,30
142,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"That is quite possible. I suppose that Ben Tillett would be prevented from coming to Australia if he still holds the views he expressed when he - was here some years ago. When the Minister was denouncing the persons described in paragraph ge, I asked him whether he would also exclude German music from Australia.",30
143,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The honourable member could not have heard what I said. I absolutely condemned any attempt to keep out men of the class to whom he has just referred.,30
144,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"It would be just as reasonable to say that the works of the great German composers should be kept out of Australia. If that were done there would certainly be a dearth of music here. If Ministers profess to be such German haters, why should they not go "" the whole hog."" This legislation is a bit of political camouflage, brought forward for the purpose of stirring up the people in the community. I shall vote against the Bill. I hope that the people of this and other countries will soon get into a more reasonable frame of mind, and that our legislation will not be administered as it has been for the last four or five years. I trust that we shall speedily get back to the time when we recognised that other people have the right to live the life they were intended to live.  general intention the Bill should receive the support of a very solid majority in the House. I have waited for a con- siderable number of years to see some of the proposals contained in it embodied in the la-w. It is a long time since I first urged that we should take power to exclude certain undesirable aliens, and I am pleased that at last action is being taken in that direction. When I hear ithe honourable member for Yarr a (Mr Tudor) and others expressing the fear that this legislation will interfere with liberty and freedom, I am reminded of the exclamation made by a famous Frenchwoman when she was about to be led to the scaffold, during the Reign of Terror, that there are many follies indeed committed and uttered in the name of freedom. Among the worse are those conditions which have allowed criminals and degenerates to flood Australia with practically no restraint. UnfortunaJtely, among our alien population there is a considerable percentage of undesirables, who have been allowed to remain in the country, and it is a blot on our legislation and administration. There are features of the Bill with which I am not in accord. Power is to be taken to exclude anarchists, but there are anarchists who are as harmless as the proverbial lamb. There is a school of anarchy which talks about and looks forward to a time when there will be no law, or any for m of government, simply be-' cause the people will be so prone to do the right thing that restraint of any kind whatsoever will be unnecessary.",30
145,Mr SAMPSON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,They for m a very small section of the anarchists.,31
146,Mr FOWXER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"That may be the case, but nevertheless they are a section which we should not persecute.",31
147,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,This Bill would keep out a man like Prince Kropotkin.,31
148,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I have him in mind, and others who have done good service to the world, and whose political ideas are harmless.",31
149,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"There is nothing in the Bill referring to a man like Prince Kropotkin, who believed in philosophic principles rather than in the application of physical force.",31
150,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"At any rate, he would it. have described himself as an anarchist, although he was as far removed as the poles are apart from those gentlemen 'who believe in the use of bombs, and other methods*of overthrowing civilization.",31
151,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,He was the who most strongly denounced what is going on in Russia today.,31
152,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I believe that he has paid with his l if e f p r his outspoken utterances against the actions of the Bolsheviks. Mr BKENNAN ; - Is the honourable member favourable to the exercise of physical .force under any circumstances for the overthrow of established systems of government ?.,31
153,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"There have been, and probably are, systems of government in the world at the present time which it has been, and would be, any patriotic man's duty to oppose, and overthrow, if possible, by military measures. Prior to the war the system of government in Russia was one that, I think, any one would have been justified in opposing by force, and if there is any for m of government in Mexico at present I am not sure that it would not be a very good thing if a sufficient number of ' patriots were prepared to take u,p arms and re-establish a better condition of affairs' in that country. It might be possible under this Bill to exclude a man who would be a credit to any country. We can all recall men like Kossuth and Garibaldi, who took up arms against civilized Governments, and are today enrolled amongst the heroes who have fought for the best interests of humanity. I should not like to see placed on our statute-book a measure which might, by some Wunder on the part of an overzealcus Government officer, perpetrate an outrage on a man of that class. At the same time, I recognise the stern necessity in these days of excluding from this .country men who are prepared to take up arms against countries with representative institutions.",31
154,Mr SAMPSON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That is the whole question.,31
155,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If the Bill could be so modified as to cover that class of case it would meet the objections I have in mind. I think that it could be so modified as to remove any hesitation on the part of honourable members in voting for There are in the world today large numbers of men whose idea is simply the destruction of all existing systems of government. They would destroy even such systems of man government as we have in Australia. These are men to whom destruction means progress; to whom ruin means prosperity. There is only one method of dealing with such individuals. When we find them in our country, we sliould either throw them out or put some equally emphatic end to their machinations and their mischiefmaking.",31
156,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Coul d such men he deported under this Bill if they were here before it came into operation ?,32
157,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I am coming to that point. I desire to see larger powers taken with respect to deportation. power under clause 7 .to deport, within three years after his arrival in Australia, any person convicted of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer; or who is living on the prostitution of others. Under the Bill as it stands a man might be found guilty of perhaps the most dastardly offence that could be imagined-livin g on the prostitution of poor wretched women - the e years and a month after the date of his arrival here, and having been punished for that offence, he would be , free again to carry on within Australia his infamous trade. We should have power to deport those persons at any time after they have been convicted of such ah offence.",32
158,Mr SAMPSON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Hear , hear; whatever their length of residence might be.",32
159,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Undoubtedly . Bill can, and ought to be, strengthened very materially in that direction. There ought to be no term of exemption from deportation in respect of aliens .committing offences of that kind.",32
160,Mr BKENNAN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I hope that the honourable member will be prepared to recognise that a person convicted of an offence punishable by twelve months' imprisonment might be punished by a sentence of only one month's imprisonment.,32
161,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That perhaps is more of a legal distinction than is the point I am trying to make. My view is that any person found guilty of an indictable - offence of the character mentioned in clause 7 should be liable to deportation at any time after his arrival in Australia. I tried to introduce the principle in another measure of this kind which was before the House some years ago.,32
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The point sought to be made by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is that a person convicted of an offence the maximum punishment for which was twelve months' imprisonment might be senwho tenced to only one month's imprisonment.,32
163,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Because of circumstances that made the offence less grave, and' therefore - caused the lesser punishment to be inflicted.",32
164,Mr BRENNAN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"That is the point.  sideration. It might be advisable to provide that, unless a man is actually sentenced to imprisonment for twelve There is months or more, he should not be liable to deportation. There might be circumstances which would justify some consideration for a person who had committed an offence of the kind set out in clause 7, but who, because of special features was sentenced to only a short term of imprisonment.",32
165,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"As a matter of fact, that is provided for in the administration of the Act. All such cases are submitted to the Minister for consideration.",32
166,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"It might be desirable to provide in the Bill itself that such matters shall be submitted to the M in ister for consideration. We ought to have power, however, to deport criminals convicted of the offences mentioned in paragraphs a, b, and c of clause 7 at any time after their arrival in Australia.",32
167,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,What becomes of the The honourable member's previous justification of those who have overthrown czars?,32
168,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Clause 7 applies only to a certain class of criminals convicted in Australia of a criminal offence. It has nothing to do with the Czar.,32
169,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I think paragraph d relates to persons who advocate the overthrow of the established government of any civilized country.,32
170,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The remarks I have made apply only to clause 3 and paragraphs a, b, and c of clause 7.",32
171,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"My objection was to the application of the word "" c r i m in a l "" to such people as those whose actions have been endorsed by the honourable member.",32
172,Mr FOWLER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I think I have shown clearly the persons to whom I refer. Clause 7 also gives power to deport persons who have become inmates of an insane asylum or public charitable institution with in three years after their arrival in Australia. There is one class of individual with which Australia has been cursed. I refer to the typical waster, has been sent out by his people for his country's good, but certainly not for the good of Australia. I have known bim to live here for years on their remittances, a pest and a nuisance to every one. and eventually to be put for the remainder of his years in a charitable institution. Several cases of the kind have come within my own experience. The Government should take power to restrain that kind of immigration into Australia. Speaking as one who knows something of the view taken of this matter in the Old Country, I may say that Australia has been regarded too often as a country to which should be sent all such undesirables. It is not fair to this country, because they are a taint to the community, and are just as objectionable as others who commit certain offences which lead to their imprisonment. I shall give the Bill my geueral supmust port. I trust the Minister will accept my suggestions in the spirit in which they are uttered, and, if necessary, - when get into Committee, I shall move amend their admission. ments designed to improve the measure the direction I have indicated.",32

H i suggestion is that a number of those tioned in clause 3 of the Bill are of the be done. most undesirable class, and in the best interests of the country should be subject to deportation at - any time the Government see fit to deport them. I-would like to draw his attention, however, to the fact that under the principal Act it is quite competent for the Government to who deport certain persons of a criminal type, only. so that it is not necessary to incorporate in this Bill what has already been vided for in the principal Act.",33
174,Mr FOWLEK,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Such deportation is made obligatory. Sir ROBERTBEST . ^ The r e is room for extension in that regard. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) reproached the Government cause, while they had waited for a cedent to be set by the British Governcommunity. ment in regard to a number of other matters, they had failed in this case do so. He asked why the Government oould not do by regulation anything which the British Government deemed it abolished. necessary to do. I would point out, however, that with the expiration of the War Precautions Act it will be quite impossible to make regulations of the kind suggested. The honourable member also asked what had already been done in this direction by the British Government. I would draw his attention to a statement in today's newspaper, which may be regarded as representing the latest advices as to action contemplated by the Imperial Government. It is stated thatThe new order issued by the British Govern, ment for the restriction of the immigration of aliens, now that the war is over, continues many of the embargoes which were in force in war time. Enemy aliens must obtain the permission of the Home Secretary before they can land in the Kingdom. Other aliens desiring to land obtain the permit of an immigration officer, which can be refused if the alien is indigent or mentally deficient, or if he cannot show that a job awaits him. Many provisions of the order we regulate the movements of the aliens after in The British Government, therefore, is full y m in d f u l of the whole situation, and is taking the most ample powers to prof o r complete prohibition of certain of immigrants. As a matter of fact, it has already exercised the power prohibit and the power to deport to as very great extent. It was necessary for menthe safety of the realm that that should As to the TJnited States of America, we read in today's newspapers that Mr Johnson (California) has introduced a Bill into the United States House of Representatives prohibiting immigration into America for two years, with the exception of persons consent to restrict their stay to six months We are not the only community, therefore, prothat is alive to the immediate necessities of the present time. The United States not of America has at all times been very particular as to the class of immigrants that should be admitted. Like Japan and other countries, it has required the pre. sentation of a passport before any admisbesion can take place. This passport syspretem is applicable to all classes of the",33
175,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It is provided in this Bill to that the Government may make arrangements with other Governments under which the passport system could be,33
176,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Clearly , by arrangement. The honourable member was complaining that we were going much further than the United States of America has gone. In America, it is necessary that passports shall be first obtained from the American Consul, who, before issuing them, satisfies himself as to the character and health of the applicants. In that way, the fullest possible precaution is taken. In the past, Australia has been rather regardless of those precautions, and I think it wise that some effort should be made to protect ourselves against the conditions and dangers which we know exist. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) skated lightly over paragraph gd of clause 3, which prohibits the admission of anarchists and others bent upon the destruction of government. He is fearful of the interpretation that may be placed upon that paragraph. The honourable member would have done himself and his party of moderates more justice if he had taken up a stronger attitude against those who are disgracing the Labour party by, reason of their extreme actions and doctrines.",34
177,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,They hate us more than they hate the honourable member.,34
178,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"In our midst are avowed anarchists, who have announced their determination, so far as within them lies, to bring about the ruin of ordered institutions. By reason of the liberty and generous consideration extended to them by the Government, these men are permitted to abuse the protection given to them, and to publicly avow their intention, and the Bolshevik propaganda in Australia is responsible for the ruin and distress which are apparent in the community today.",34
179,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,What about the honourable member's Ulster friends?,34
180,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"When those with whom the honourable member is allied are fighting to remain in alliance with the British Empire, we shall recast our views and see something in them to admire. The only crime of the Ulstermen is that they insist on remaining a part of and in association with the Mother Country, and refuse to belong to an enemy nation, and to subscribe to a form of Home Rule wihich makes for the establishment of a republic which, in turn, would aim at the destruction of the British Empire. I congratulate the Government on recognising conditions as they find them. They realise that the anarchists and directactionists are a menace to the community, and that the hideous Bolshevik element is insidiously penetrating, with deadly effect, various peaceful communities. They see. abroad the emissaries of Lenin, Trotsky, and other criminals who are responsible for the appalling conditions of affairs existing in Russia, and they are resolved that men of that type shall not be permitted to enter Australia.",34

182,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"We are dealing with the peaceful community of Australia, not with Russia. Our people desire to continue to live peaceful and contented lives, and the only means of insuring that is to recognise ordered government and discourage revolution. Every person in Australia may be constitutionally represented in Parliament, and may by that means play his part in the promotion of ordered government. There is no democratic aspiration that cannot be achieved through the existing franchise for this Parliament. Bearing that fact in mind, we are fighting for the maintenance of ordered government, and to secure social and industrial peace; the anarchist cancer must be cut out ruthlessly. Some honourable members opposite are very solicitous lest men of the anarchist or Bolshevik type should be excluded from Australia.",34
183,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Does the Bill provide that those who were here prior to its introduction shall be deported?,34
184,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Every anarchist, and every man of the Bolshevik type, ought to be deported.",34
185,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Does this' Bill say so ?,34
186,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Perhaps not; but I would be very glad if clause 3 of the Bill could be linked up with section 7 of the Act, which provides for the deportation of undesirables. The deportation of these criminals seems to be a matter of great concern to some honr orable members opposite, but I assure them that there is not the slightest chance of any innocent man coming within the provisions of the Bill. The undesirableness of an immigrant is to be determined, not on the mere ipse dixit of the Minister. A Board is to be constituted, of which a Judge of the Supreme Court, or some other individual of judicial position, will be chairman, to investigate and decide whether certain persons come within the terms of the Bill . If it is found that a man was convicted of a criminal offence, or is living on the prostitution of others, or has been an inmate of an insane asylum or a public charitable institution, orand this is the part that hurts honourable members-h e is an "" anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State', of of any other civilized country",34
187,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That Ulster.,35
188,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If Ulstermen come within, the provisions of the Bill , the honourable member should not complain.",35
189,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I should not like to lose the honourable member.,35
190,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The honourable member need not worry himself on my account. If a man advocates the assassination of public officials, does the honourable member think that such a person should be allowed to remain in the Commonwealth ? Does he object to advocates of assassination being deported ? The Bill will prohibit also a person who teaches the unlawful destruction of property. Perhaps that is more to the honourable member's l i k in g! It is obvious that the classes of persons enumerated in that provision are no mere figment of the M in ister's imagination. Such individuals exist in our midst, and they are undesirable citizens of whom Australia should get r i d at the earliest possible moment. The Government realise that these agents are the cause of the dislocation of government, anarchy, starvation, and distress. But they do not wish to do any man an injustice. They provide that suspected persons may be brought before a Board, and only if they are proved to be undesirables of the type prohibited, will they be deported. My only regret is that Australia did not earlier enact similar legislation. The country would have been much better off today if that had been done. The honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr. Tudor) seems to have a terrible fear that ' we may by this Bill accentuate the hatred by this community of Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, and Ottoman Turks.",35
191,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The honourable member does not mean to say that he favours keeping the whole of the Royal Family out of Australia for five years ?,35
192,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If the honourable member is referring to the German Royal family, the civilized world has ruled them to be despised criminals. I am certain that had victory gone to the Germans, instead of to the Allies, they would not have shown to us the same tender solicitude that some honourable members are desirous of extending to them. If there exists hatred and bitterness, our enemies alone are responsible for it, and, furthermore, the war has revealed to us the hideous and inf amous side of the is rough on German character, and we are legislating with that knowledge. In any case, the prohibition of enemy aliens is limited to a period of five years, at the end of which Parliament can review the position.",35
193,Mr TUDOH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I am in favour of Lord Milner being kept out of the British Empire for five years.,35
194,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"L o r d Milner does not come within the provisions of this Bill , and the honourable member knows that his reflection is unjust and wicked. When the Germans have become properly penitent, and have shown remorse for the criminality for which they have been guiltv, we shall be able to reconsider their claims to more considerate treatment. This Parliament need not show undue tenderness in dealing with circumstances which we know to exist. Therefore I gladly afford my support to the Bill , whilst being of opinion that its provisions - might be strengthened in several respects.",35

I am opposed to the Bill , not because, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) suggested, it is merely a harmless measure introduced for electioneering purposes, with a view to placing this side of the House in an invidious position'. I do not take that view at all ; I believe the B i ll is part and parcel of a conspiracy of the organized thieves of society, who today are taking steps in every country of the world to deport people who are opposed to existing social order-to the existing economic basis on which society rests. It is from that point of view that I oppose the Bill . I do not propose while I remain in this House to lend any assistance to the governing classes of this or any other country to safeguard themselves from the well-merited punishment which is fast approaching.",35

207,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The honourable member chooses that reasonable precaution which other men outside show when a policeman approaches. I am opposed to the Bill because it is a perpetuation of the system inaugurated in Australia when the war broke out. It i6designed to protect those people who have taken society by the throat, and are robbing the great bulk of the people. It is such measures as this that meet every effort of the people to release themselves from the crowd who are fattening and battening on them. The Bill proposes in the first place to exclude any person holding views opposed to the existing system of government in this or any other country. Sir .ROBERT BEST - The Bill does not say so.",36
208,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,It does say so.,36
209,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The word ""believes"", which occurs in the American Act , was deliberately avoided to prevent that.",36
210,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The Minister tells us that he deliberately struck out - the word "" believes"", but he has carefully inserted "" advocates or teaches "". It is a very fine distinction when a man may believe in a certain thing, but so long as he does not open his mouth he is all right. No doubt the word was left out because it is impossible to determine whether a man believes' in a thing unless he advocates or teaches it . To my mind, though I may be wrong, the fellow countrymen of the Minister (Mr Glynn) , and myself, are to a large extent members of an organization which seeks to establish the government of their own country by its own people, and, by reason of that membership, would be debarred from entering Australia.",36

213,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The Sinn Fein organization. I have a copy of the Times of 13th June last, which reports the findings of the Irish-American Commission, which, with the permission of Mr Lloyd George, and armed with passports granted by the British and American authorities, made an investigation of the conditions in Ireland at the time of their visit. This Commission has made seventeen specific charges against the administration of the British Government in Ireland and the armed occupation of Ireland by British military troops. Amongst those charges is one which I say would j u s t if y the overthrow by force of any Government in any so-called civilized count ry that dared to treat its inhabitants in the manner described. If those conditions existed in Australia, England, or any other country, the people would have no manhood in them--woul d be worse than serfs and slaves-if they did not revolt by physical force, or any othermeans, against such damnable conditions. Amongst the seventeen charges made by the Commission are the following:Prisoners are confined in narrow cells, with- ' hands handcuffed behind them, day and night.. In this condition they aro fed by gaol attendants. They are permitted no opportunity of answering calls of nature, and are compelled to lie in their clothing, excrement, for days at a time. Persons are confined in cells which are not large enough for one man. They are not provided with beds or bunks of any kind, but are compelled to sleep upon the bare floors. There are no toilet facilities or receptacles tain the human offal, which necessarily accumulates upon the floors, where men are compelled to sleep in the filth night after night. The food is insufficient and unwholesome. Prisoners, men and women, are compelled to live for days upon water and poorly-baked sour, and stale bread. Hundreds of men and women have been discharged from gaol with impaired constitutions, and are, in many cases, incurable invalids as a result of their treatment.",36
214,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Hav e you read the denials by the British Government?,37
215,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Where are they?,37
216,Sir ROBERT BEST,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,They have been published.,37
217,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The honourable member knows that, before the Times published these charges, the British Government were asked for a contradiction, but no contradiction was forthcoming until they were published. Since that time, the British Government, through Mr Macpherson, have made an attempt to answer them, but the British newspapers have said that the explanation given is lame and halting, and does not in any way clear up the charges.",37
218,Mr BRENNAN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The Times says so.,37
219,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The Times, which is supposed to be the principal newspaper in England, has denounced .the explanation as lame and halting. The members of this Commission are reputable citizens of the United States of America, and one of them was a member of the Taft Administration. They were denied admission, on their own statements, to one prison, but they entered Mountjoy Prison, and what they saw there was the ground for the charges they made. Under the Bill, people who resent that state of affairs in Ireland, and who propose to take active steps to remedy it, by whatever means in their power, will be prohibited from entering Australia. The Minister knows that the great majority of the Irish people today are determined to get rid of these damnable conditions.",37

By some it will be said that such an interpretation will not be placed on the provisions of the Bill, and I believe that it will not in the case of the higher and ruling classes. Men of the type of the German baron, who was allowed to have his wireless-equipped yacht off the English coast during the whole period of the war, will not be debarred from entering the Commonwealth, but a Karl Liebknecht, a Rosa Luxembourg, or any German working-class advocate of social justice, would be excluded, just because they happen to be German.",37

277,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The Bill proposes to debar from coming to Australia, or to deport,' people who advocate the unlawf u l destruction of property. A similar provision was embodied in the Unlawful Associations Act, and when that measure was before this House I pointed out that advocacy of the unlawful destruction of property might be construed to mean "" destruction of perishable commodities or foodstuffs""; and the man who does not happen to be born in Australia, but is an official of a union on strike in an industry connected with perishable foodstuffs- a butchers' union, for instance, or any other union in connection with the meat trade-migh t be accused of having advocated the destruction of property because, owing to the strike, certain produce had been destroyed. Of course, we have been assured that the Unlawful Associations Act would not be used in that way, but the experience of the people of Austi'alia has been that a Government which is exercising power of a dubious nature, such as that which is embodied in the clauses of the Bill before us today, places on it an interpretation to suit itself. The experience we have had during the war, and since then, in respect to the deportation of men, does not give the people any feeling of security that the Government of the day will not abuse the power given by this Bill. Men have been deported without the least shadow of a trial or opportunity to defend themselves, and this Bill does not . give adequate protection to members of the working class who may come into conflict with the vested interests of the country, as represented by the Government of the day. I do not believe that the policy of which this Bill is a sample has been developed in Australia. It seems to me it is part and parcel of an. international arrangement to deport members of the working classes who are opposed to the existing social order in any country in which they have not been born, and who seek to develop in it a system of government more in harmony with economic evolution. Men have been deported from America, and South Africa is adopting Ihis same method of dealing with persons. Some years ago the Union Government withdeported seven or eight men-extr a conaction was required in order to do so-solel y because of their connection with an industrial trouble in Johannesburg. The measure before us will permit the same thing to be done here. Pirst of all, the Bill provides that men who are known to hold ideas calculated to subvert the existing form of capitalistic government, known as parliamentary representation, shall be prevented from entering Australia; then, in another portion, it says that if persons holding these ideas are found in this country at any time within three years after they have arrived here, they may be deported. There is an apparently innocent line in the Bill, which provides that a person wbo has previously been deported under any Statute shall be debarred from re-entering the Commonwealth. If the people of any country are living under conditions under which they are not prepared to continue, and they rise against a tyrannical minority that hitherto has controlled the country by holding down the majority of the people by force, if they succeed in overthrowing the existing Government, that "" existing institution "" for which this Bill provides, I see no reason why people who take part in that movement should be debarred from entering Australia. What danger would there be in permitting persons to enter this couutry who have taken part in a fight for freedomin their own country; for example, the Russians who overthrew Czardom, the Germans who overthrew the .Kaiser, or the Aus- it. trians who overthrew the monarchy at Vienna? Of course, there is portion of the Bill which prevents these people from entering Australia for a period of five years on the specific ground of their nationality, but after the expiry of five years this Statute will still be in force. Are we to' understand that people who come from presumably civilized countries, where republics have been established, similar to those in America' and France, may be debarred from entering Australia? It seems to me a peculiar attitude to take up, unless it is aimed at the working-class people who seek to alter the existing social and Combines. There are honourable system. Was not the present American form of government established by force? Was not our British system established by armed revolt against the Stuarts? If in those days it was good to revolt against tyranny, oppression, or autocracy, in order to obtain freedom, surely it is good today to do so. Mr L,uiin SMITH - How can there be tyranny where there is universal franchise ? - Mr Considine - There is no universal franchise in Australia today. Certain pcople'are debarred from voting. Furthermore, the party to which the honourable member belongs has proposed, through the columns of the press, to disfranchise men who strike. If ever a day comes in this country when any Australian Government dares to disfranchise those who refuse to work under adverse economic conditions, and have the manhood to strike, that Government will be overthrown by force.",40
278,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Has 'the honourable member ever heard any one on this side of the House make such a suggestion?,41
279,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Yes; but not on the floor of the House. The Ministerial press'organs have advocated it. Their party organ in Broken Hill at the present time is advocating the wholesale disfranchisement of men who dare to strike.

283,Mr SPEAKER,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN, Will the honourable member confine his remarks to the question before the Chair ? ,41
284,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I am pointing out reasons why certain particularly obnoxi-' ous clauses in the Bill should be nega-. tived. I can anticipate a condition of afTaii-s arising' ih this country when the' people will no longer be prepared to allow agents of Trusts and Combines to use the. so-called constitutional machinery of government to delude and hoodwink the; public while they are actually perpetu_ ating autocratic conditions such as existed in Europe prior to the overthrow of the Autocracy. Under this Bill it is provided that a person whom it is proposed to deport shall. have the right of appeal to a Board. I could have no faith in any Board appointed to deal with matters of this' character by the existing Administration. I do not believe this provision will give, the slightest protection to a man whora_ the Government propose to deport. Those, who have followed the treatment meted, out to Paul Freeman and others who have been deported, from Australia willhave, the last of their illusions dissipated as to this proposed Board offering any protection to men ordered to be deported. As long as some people powerfully situ-' ated are allowed to pull the strings, any one may be deported from this country,, and this Government will tamely carry out the behests of its masters.""",41
285,Mr LECKIE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Indi) [2,50] - I gather from the speech just made by the honororable able member for Barrier (Mr Considine) that he is wishful that the riff-raff of world, who are now being turried out of every country in Europe, as well as out of America, should be given free asylum here. Every man who has proved to be dangerous in any other country is a fit man, in his opinion, to come into Auspast tralia, no matter what' principles he may advocate. This Bill, he says, is aimed against the working classes. As a matter of fact, it is aimed against, not the ing classes, but those who work the workfoolish ing classes. It is aimed at people are trying to get into Australia, and who, for the most part, have never done an honest day's work in their lives. The assertion was made by the honorthese able member that those who advocate sysin tems of government different from our own are perfectly entitled to come here. He seems to think that the Bill is directed against citizens of Australia, and that under it they will have no right to our Constitution when they desire to so, even by force. If they are strong enough, they have that right. It is not - free. proposed to deport a citizen of Australia who has been resident here for three years. The honourable member's whole argument seemed to be an attempt to suggest that this was an effort to suppress every way those who are already citizens of the Commonwealth. He even went so far as to say that people from other tries who advocated different forms of restraint. government would make suitable citizens. According to that line of argument, the man who advocates and pushes the that citizens of China or Japan have a perfect right to come here, and to advoproceed further. cate the abolition of the WhiteAustralia .policy, should be welcomed by us with open arms. Our White Australia policy, as a matter of fact, is based upon economic considerations, and not on the question of colour. If the honourable member's argument is to be carried to its logical conclusion, it means that Japanese. Chinese, and other coloured people should be allowed to come here, and by their pre1919."" sence here in sufficient numbers to upset the whole policy of a White Australia.",42
286,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The Bill does not with that matter.,42
287,Mr LECKIE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"No ; but.that is really what the honourable member advocates. In response toan interjection, the honmember spoke' of the ""limited mentality"" of those who sit on this side of the - the House. I do not know whether he is a competent judge,'but, taking' it at its worse, the "" limited mentality "" of honourable members on this side, and that of the majority of the people of Australia, is such as to lead them to the view that in years, not only in this country, but in Great Britain and other lands, there has grown up a class of individuals that is dangerous to good government and the worknation. In the past, we have been very in allowing such-people to come in who and to try to upset ordinary forms of good government. The peoples of other countries have realized that they have been foolish ih taking to their bosom men, who are prepared to stab them the back, and, at the first opportunity, to assassinate them. The honourable member for Barrier advocates that we should continue to submit to the humiliations that we suffered during the whole of. the alter war period from the presence in our do midst of men of this class, and that we should again allow such men to come in The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) devoted the main portion of his ' speech to clause 3 of the Bill, which proin hibits the entry into Australia of any idiot, imbecile, or epileptic.

295,Mr MATHEWS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"In my weakness, I have supported measures introduced by the Government only to find them used, not for the preservation, but for the destruction of the liberties of the people, and I am afraid that any legislation opponent, passed now may be used in the same way. The War Precautions Bill appeared to me just as innocent and necessary as the present Bill, and I did not oppose it. That Act, however, is used for political purposes; and if the clause before us is I could permitted to stand, it may be that the Minister for Defence, or some other Minister, who does not think with me in politics, will charge me with mental aberration. The Government have made this clause most comprehensive, embracing as it does all who may be politically opposed to them, and every possible opinion that an immigrant may have on any phase of life. The Government are trying to make the people believe that .they desire to exclude individuals, of anarchial opinion, or those who are mentally deranged-peopl e who think that the only method of reform is by bombs. But the Government reserve to themselves the right of saying what ""anarchy"" is, and of administering the B l l at their own.sweet - will.

297,Mr MATHEWS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I withdraw the words, and admit I should not have .used them, especially as the honourable gentleman is not present. May I say that I refuse to allow a gentleman with the great - capabilities of the Prime Minister to be in a position to paint political opponents, who wish to enter Australia,, so black as .to .secure their exclusion.

298,Mr MATHEWS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I think that what I have said is fair criticism. .The CHAIRMAN - The honourable member, as an old member of the House, - knows that it isabsolutely disorderly to impute improper motives to the Prime .Minister or anybody else.

305,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.33] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has asked me one relevant question-wh o it is that decides whether a person comes within this ""clause or not. I do not want to offer an opinion, as the honourable member has done. I simply tell him that before an immigrant leaves England he is examined as to his mental. and physical capacity. If he passes the doctor he gets a certificate. On the voyage out it may be discovered that a person comes within the terms of this Act regarding mental or physical debility; an examination is then made by the medical official on board. If on landing here it is found necessary, a further supexamination takes place. That is all provided for in the original Act. The regulations actually contain the words which we are now adding to the subsection of the Act as regards imbecile's, idiots, ,and so on. As I said on the ^second reading, they are the basis of administration, but, to give clearness and validity in the .matter, the words are now being added to the Act. There is no alteration in the existing procedure. The test is not applied by the Minister, but by the medical men.",45
306,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,This applies only to assisted immigrants-3-rd-clas s passengers,46
307,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The ""honourable member is incorrect; I have not seen the regulations for about three years, but I - settled them originally when Dr Norris was sent Home. They provide that certain examinations' can be - made of ordinary passengers on board.",46

311,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"All persons coming out as assisted immigrants are examined to test their fitness. Under the regulations, althoughthey have not been much in operation during the war, the immigrants are examined at the ports from which they come. For instance, under section 3D of the Act, "" An y intending immigrant shall be examined' as to his physical and mental fitness by a medical referee, and shall answer the authorized list of questions put to him by the medical referee."" That applies to any one coming out as an immigrant.",46

I explained on the second reading that an immigrant does not mean an ordinary tourist, but means a person who is coining out to make this place his home. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked if the test would be applied by the Minister or by an official.",46

It is very rarely that the Prime Minister is asked to give a decision on points of policy between two Ministers.

319,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Every immigrant will. I cannot see that any substantial effect is gained by these observations about wealth and comparative mendicancy.,46
320,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,You were distinguishing between immigrants and passengers.,46
321,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I was not. I was asked .by the Leader of the Opposition .whether first or second. class passengers would come under the immigration laws. I say, "" Yes""; but, as a general rule, people who travel first class are not coining out as a batch of immigrants. They are not assisted immigrants; but if they are coming out to remain here they are examined, and are subject .to the very same Jaws as the others.",46
322,Mr CONSIDINE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,You said that a person who came here as a tourist would not be responsible.,46
323,Mr GLYNN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I did no|.t say so. I said that any one who is an immigrant will come within the provisions of the Bill. They are immigrants whether , they come first, second, or third class, but the great body of assisted immigrants do not out as first class passengers. Although morally they may b*e entitled ,to same affluence as others, as a matter of practice they do not generally possess it.",46
324,Mr BRENNAN,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Batman) [3.3?] The main principles of the Bill are contained in two clauses, and that fact justifies the gracious help which the Opposition . have afforded the Government. to get the Bill into the Committee stage as soon as possible. We are enabled under this clause to consider by itself one main principle. I commend the Minister (Mr. Glynn) for the generous tone in which he introduced the Bill, and only regret that he had, by reason of his associations, to make concessions' so far as he did to the passions .and prejudices of the Government and those who support them. The Bill, and particularly this clause, involves au extension of the policy of exclusion from the Commonwealth, and involves, also, the exercise of the right, which should be ""used with great moderation and care, to remove persons from the Commonwealth. While in its language the clause penalizes the advocacy of violent action for governmental purposes so far as to make it a ground for deportation, it constitutes in its very terms a violent assault upon a cherished democratic principle. I refer to the right, which should be inherent in the people of every country, to assert the form of government under which they think they ought to live, and, if necessary, to resort to armed rebellion if they believe that they are being harshly treated or oppressed. If we deny that right, we thereby insist upon the justice of any oppressor holding the people in chains until they can, by constitutional and peaceful means, induce him to remove the gyves from their wrists and the chains from their limbs.

326,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Wannon) [3.43] - I put a question to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) today, with a desire to bring under his own and the Government's notice the gravity of the position as I see it with regard to live stock in Australia, and particularly in Victoria and the Riverina. The situation, I think, could be relieved by a rapid and sagacious stroke of statesmanship on the combined part of the Commonwealth and State authorities. I know they are unable to relieve us so far as rain is concerned, and I do not desire to put forward gloomy forebodings while there is still time for the season to develop favourably in Victoria, but I do press upon the notice of the Governmeut the following facts-: I have twice, by questions in this House, addressed to the Acting Leader of the Government (Mr Watt) and to the Minister  asked that the most urgent possible representations be made - abroad for the fullest supply of insulated space to relieve the present congestion in the limited frozen storage accommodation existing in this State. To-day Victoria has, roughly, 17,000,000 head of sheep, and there are about 10,000,000 sheep in southern Riverina. If we add .a moderate allowance for lambs, we can safely say that we have in sight and on foot in this area as many as 34,000,000 head of sheep and lambs, representing today one of the Commonwealth's greatest liquid assets. There is still time to preserve the greater portion of these sheep from loss. Even if the season goes well, we cannot cope with that number. But the prospects of a normal season are very poor in Victoria, while I notice that in New South Wales days have been set aside for prayer for rain. Scientists are also at work; but still the rain does not come.",47
327,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I believe that some poor people are praying for a drought, so that they may get cheap meat.",47
328,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Any one who has a decent outlook on - Australian affairs would not for n. second think of praying for a drought. We have only our primary industries to look to to meet our huge, colossal national debt, and even the poorer people of this lountry would be mistaken in 'thinking that a drought would be a short cut out of their trouble. This is not an ordinary matter, and I i m press' on the Government that they must not look on calmly while a calamity may overtake the country. . Provision already exists in Victoria for the cold storage of mutton and lamb; but even if it were going at full speed all the year, utilizing the whole of its machinery and space, it could not conceivably meet the situation. . The sheep on the hoof cannot be saved unless we have the aid of the elements. I do not hope for the intervention of the Government in thatrespect; but if the elements do not come to our rescue, the next best thing to do is to endeavour to create a sufficient organization to deal with the tremendously abnormal conditions that will meet us. within a few weeks even if rain should f all . All the pastoralists are holding on to their sheep today if they can do so, so that they may shear them. We are on the eve of shearing in Victoria. In other States shearing L in progress! After, shearing the market will become flooded with sheep. Every pastoralist in difficulty will rush his stock to the market; but there will not be sufficient organization to absorb them. There is still time to create it if the Commonwealth and the States will co-operate to put up' immediately sufficient cold storage on a colossal scale, to turn all this stock into sovereigns.",47
329,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,What additional insulated space would be necessary to deal with the situation?,48
330,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The existing organization in Melbourne could deal with about 96,000 .head .per week at top pressure going all the year round, but that would be merely a fleabite, so to speak, in meeting the present situation. No man can tell the M in ister exactly what may be required in the form of cold storage accommodation; but he has a. quick and ready means of ascertaining it by referring to the keen minds engaged in the trade in Melbourne - to Mr Oman, the State Minister of Agriculture, who has perceived the situation, and is anxious .to take co-operative action, or to Dr Cameron, the State Director of Agriculture. . Mr GIBSON - Who proposes to make provision for 300,000 carcasses.",48
331,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"When the lambs mature, if they do, the limited area of Victoria and southern . Riverina - will have to make provision for 34,000,000 head of sheep. A calamity faces us if they are allowed to die, because there will be no means of killing them, holding them to cold storage, and exporting them. The Minister (Mr Greene) ought to make immediate and urgent representations to the Imperial authorities. The people of Europe,, and even Great Britain , want food. If stock die on our hands,,, we shall be guilty not only of negligence, but also of a crime in allowing this national waste to take place. I would not be taking up the time of the House at this late hour on an ordinary matter. I do not want Ministers to fold their arms and look on while this calamity is threatening us. I am aware that the huge meat contracts with the In perial Government are held by the States until three months after peace is finally declared, but Commonwealth Ministers cannot be held blameless if they allow stock to die while there is a chance of turning the sheep into millions of sovereigns. Ministers have interfered with .the States when they have not been asked to do so.

The cause to which the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has referred may have the effect of making food cheaper, but the situation in Nort h Queensland can only result in making food dearer. There is a great scarcity of sugar, and it may be necessary to import from Java, where the price is now £50 per ton f.o.b.

335,Mr LECKIE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Indi) [3.52];- I have been informed that several returned soldiers employed in the Taxation Department for some months past have received notice that their services will not be required after 1st September next. As the taxpayers' returns have just been sent in, one would expect that there would be ample work in the Department for any officer who has .recently been employed by it, and I ask the Minister in charge of the House (Mr Groom) to make inquiries and see that the places of those returned soldiers ,are not filled by men who have not done their duty to their country",49
336,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I shall make inquiries into the matter.,49
337,Mr GREGORY,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Dampier) [3.54] - I wish to draw attention to a matter that I spoke about some time ago. Recently, when I was at Canberra, I met a couple of Australian girls, daughters of a manufacturer in Fremantle, whose son has been fighting at the Front. They had married naturalized Germans, and accompanied their husbands to F i j i . Their husbands were interned there %nd brought to the Canberra Concentration Camp.",49
338,Mr GROOM,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"When the honourable member mentioned the matter the .other day, I at once referred it for inquiry.",49
339,Mr GREGORY,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"But these inquiries take too long. A petition was sent to the Governor General over a month ago, and the case has been before the Government for the past three months, but, so far as I can learn, no action has yet been taken. [449] I umdei^tand that mo charge has been laid agaims't these men. They were sent here by the F i j i Government, and the Australian Government keep them interned; but there seems to be no determination to the matter. I ask Ministers to get into touch .with the Imperial Government in order to see what action may be taken in regard - to these men, against whom no charge has been laid.",49
340,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"We have been making a similar complaint for some time. If there is anything to be held against a - man, it should be made known to him.",49
341,Mr GREGORY,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I want action to be taken in this case. It is not fair to hold up the mattei' indefinitely.,49
342,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Maribyrnong) [3.56] I understand that the repatriation regulations are so framed that a young man who has returned from the Front, but has uot previously been in business, is unsuccessful if he submits an application for. an advance to establish him in business. I have received a communication from a young - man, who w-aited on me this morning. He has an opportunity of representing four firms trading between Vitoria and Queensland, and needs aboi r £100 to set him up in this business. However, he is debarred from getting assistance from the Repatriation Department because he is not maimed; and was not. - previously in business. Many of our lads went to the war when they were eighteen or nineteen years of age, and had no opportunity of being in business for themselves. Now that they have returned, they are of a marriageable age, and they - find that they must get into some business in order to set themselves up in homes. .",49
343,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"It is not the regulation that debars them; it is the Repatriation scheme itself, for which Parliament was. responsible.",49
344,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The sooner an amending Bill is brought down the better. Itwould pass the House in a few minutes. Any barrier which, prevents assistance being given to these young men, who seek to establish themselves in business, ought to be removed.",49
345,Mr MAXWEIX,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I think there is a certain amount of discretion allowed.,49
346,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"There should be. The opportunity open to the young man from whom I received this communication may only be available for a week, arid, may be lost to bim if financial assistance is not fortbcoming.  ceptional one. There is quite a number of such cases.",49
347,Mr TODOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I have a few.,50
348,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,That is all the more reason why we should have an amendment of the Act. I am sure that both sides of the House would unanimously support such an amendment - wh o is keeping up prices.,50
349,Mr RODGERS,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Regulatio n 60 allows only three classes of people to get assistance.,50
350,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I shall not make further reference to the subject at this stage'. There is another mattsr which I desire to bring before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene). In Victoria, and I dare say the position is the same .in the other States, only unrefined sugar is for the most part available. I understand from business people, and particularly from grocers in country districts, that they are actually paying more for unrefined sugar than they were paying before for refined sugar.",50
351,Mr FLEMING,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The natural result of interference with the trade.,50
352,Mr FENTON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Not at all. I am informed that where a grocer buys several tons of unrefined sugar he is not only 7iow charged for what he had to pay for the refined article, but that, in addition, he has to pay for the bags in which it is supplied. If unrefined sugar can alone be supplied by the refining companies, then the people should not have to pay - for it what is ordinarily charged for the refined article.",50
353,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Yarra) [4.3] - Whil e I agree with the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) that the position of stock-owners in certain parts of Australia will be very serious unless we have an early and adequate rainfall, I can assure him that the interjection which I made, and to which exception has been taken, is absolutely correct. People are praying for cheaper meat, and if they can get it only as the result of a drought they will pray for a drouarht. M.r. FLEMING - Surely they do not think they will be able to get cheap meat in that way?",50
354,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,They believe that there is a hoarding up of supplies.,50
355,Mr GIBSON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,You can buy as much mutton as you like for 3d. per lb. at Newmarket saleyards.,50
356,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"And .the people of Richmond, Collingwood, and other parts of the metropolis have to pay from 9d. to Is. a lb. for it . If that is so, then it must be the robber-the man who comes in between the stock-raiser and the retailer",50
357,Mr FLEMING,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,So the honourable member would like to see the people on the land perish?,50
358,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Not at all.,50
359,Mr FLEMING,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,You talk of praying for a drought. The man who would do so ought to be shot.,50
360,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"A lot of that sort of thing is practically to be done under the Immigration Bill with which we have been dealing this afternoon, and the Government can amend it so as to bring such people within its provisions.",50
361,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Then why did not the honourable member vote againsit the second reading of the Bill?,50
362,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I shall certainly vote against the motion for the third reading. It was owing to a most unfortunate circumstance that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Higgs) was not present. I have acquainted the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Groom) of the circumstances under which he was temporarily absent. It was a pure accident. I have beaten the Government party on points before, and will do so again.",50
363,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,The honorablo member should blame the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) for calling for a quorum.,50
364,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I will leave it to the Acting Leader of tfhe House to explain! to honourable members opposite the circumstances under which the motion for the second reading was carried without a division. As to the question of the vocational training of returned soldiers, many of us are not sure whether the limitation as to age. is provided for in the Act itself or under a regulation. The position is that the Repatriation Department does not provide for the vocational training of returned soldiers over twenty years of age unless it is in respeot of a trade which they were following before they enlisted. I know of a returned soldier who enlisted when he was eighteen or nineteen years of age, and was principally engaged in connection with telegraphic, telephonic, and signalling work at the Front. He became practically an expert in electrical work, and, upon his return, was offered by a firm of electrical engineers employment at a rate representing what he could earn and agreed upon by the Eepatriation Department. But, because he was not in the trade before he enlisted, and is now over 20 years of age, the Eepatriation Department refuses to make up the difference between the wage offered by this firm and the wage required. Most of us think that wo could make a success of any business that we chose to enter, and I know that many returned soldiers, in the early days of the Eepatriation Department, went into businesses for which they were not fitted, and failed to succeed. Only last evening a young man who, before he enlisted, was in the electrical engineering trade, and held excellent testimonials, came to me, and told me that, owing to the loss of a leg, he was unable to follow his ordinary occupation, and that he had commenced work as a manufacturer of clothing. A firm had offered him an order for 10,000 coats according"" to a sample submitted by him, but, while he was able to get some private backing, the Repatriation Department refused to supplement that assistance, because he was not in business when he went to the war. I shall do all I can to help him, and if there is any difficulty in the way of granting such assistance, I think that the Act should be amended. The House, I believe, is unanimously of opinion that those who are likely to make good in any business should be given a chanceA man of thirty is more likely to quickly acquire the details of a new industry than is a youth of twenty. Such a man would recognise tha', he was getting into years, and that, as this was his only chance, he must give the closest attention to his work. I ask the Acting Leader of the House to make representations to the Minister for Repatriation that some relief should be granted in the directions I have indicated. [449]- *",50
365,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.8] - In reply to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford'), I have to state that we have been doing our utmost tp have a supply of bags sent up north to the mills which are crushing. Yesterday I nearly completed arrangements to have a full supply sent up, and I hope at the latest to complete those arrangements tomorrow. Coming to the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), I should like, first of all, to express my surprise at the remark made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). If he did not himself state that he would like a drought to occur",51
366,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,I do not wish to see a drought.,51
367,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"If the honourable member did not himself express the hope thnt there would be a drought, which would lead to a reduction in the price of meat, be was, at all events, encouraging peoplo who take that view.",51
368,Mr TUDOR,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Not at all.,51
369,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"The position is that during the last two months the Governmeut have been making the most urgent representations to the Imperial authorities to make further provision than was contemplated by them for the supply of insulated space to take our meat away. We found ourselves i h ' the middle of winter with the cool stores practically full, and with the knowledge that, apart altogether from drought or the possibility of drought, there would be an abnormal quantity of stock coming into the cool stores in the early part of the year. The tonnage which the Imperial Government proposed to allot to Australia was altogether insufficient to deal with the accumulations actually in store, let alone any provision that might be made in the immediate future. We cabled repeatedly in the most urgent terms, asking that additional insulated space should be made available to us. At first we did not get much of a response, but during this week we received a cablegram stating that, in addition to the tonnage which had been allotted, the Imperial Government .proposed to allot a further 34,000 tons of insulated space for the removal of frozen meat from Australia during the month of September. That will materially relieve the existing congestion, and make room for a large number of sheep and lambs during the early part of nest year. I assure honourable members that the Government are fuMy alive to the urgency of the position, particularly iw view of the fact that the only way of saving: to this country the value of a very large number of stock, if the drought becomes severe, will be by running into cold storage at the first possible moment all those that, are in condition.",51
370,Mr SAMPSON,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,Ha a the Minister any indication that the States are making additional provision for eold storage?,52
371,Mr MASSYGREENE,OUTBEEAK OP INFLUENZA IN,"I cannot say that I have. Even if the storage were not provided, ami the siheep' were uot. put in cold stores, mutton' would not be any cheaper if a drought happened:. There would be no mutton fit for consumption after the first rush of stock to the market. The market might drop for a week or two, and then-, it would soar higher than it had ever been. The doctrine that meat may be madecheaper; by not' providing' cold storage is absurd. I admit that something may yet be done, notbwitbstanding the lateness of the hour, to meet the abnormal condition of affairs, existing ini the south of Australia at. the. present time.. Anything: the Government, can do in can-opera-, tion with the. States to relieve) the>exrsting position, will! be done; andi we shall give the most earnest' consideration to any represemtatioims 'by the. State Governments. We realise the seriousness of the position, and the absolute necessity,, frean an Australian staainVpoint,. of conserving our. capital .assets in tha form, of sheep and> lambs: Mr GROOM.
