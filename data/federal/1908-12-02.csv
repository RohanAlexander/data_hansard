NA DEPARTMENT. .JPJAYMENT OF TEMPORARY OFFICIAL SWEST MAITLAND TELEPHONE INSTRUMENTS-ALBAN Y TO EUCLA MAIL SER. VICE - NEWCASTLE-WEST MAITLAND TELEPHONE-SORTIN G OF MAILS ON TRAINS .",11
1,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yesterday T asked the Postmaster-General to make inquiries as to the truth of the statement that temporary officials employed by his Department in the city and suburbs of Sydney are sometimes not paid until' ten or twelve days after the due date of payment. Has he ascertained that that is the case, and, if so, will he give instructions to prevent it?",11
2,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Deputy. Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following reply: Temporary employees in the head office, Sydney, are paid regularly on the day following that on which permanent employees are paid. In country and suburban offices they arc paid by vouchers submitted through the postmaster. If correctly rendered and otherwise in order claims are passed in the order of their receipt in the Accounts Branch. Vouchers for payment occupy from three to four days. Nearly 50 per cent, of the claims are not in order when submitted and delays beyond about a week are almost invariably caused by irregularities in accounts rendered, which, in the majority of cases necessitates return of the voucher for correction or completion. Steps arc being taken to instruct postmasters to carefully scrutinize vouchers before submitting them to the accountant so that delay in payment may be obviated.",11
3,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I know a case in which there was a delay of sixteen days.,11
4,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member will bring it under my notice, I shall investigate it.",11
5,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hav e tenders yet been received for the mail service from Albany to Eucla, and, if so, has any been accepted by the Department?",11
6,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Tender s have been received which, according to the size of the boat and passenger accommodation, vary as much as ,£3,000 per annum. The lowest tender, which is a little above that of the last contract, is one that I am prepared to accept at once, as it fulfils all the requirements of the Postal Department. The highest tender even does not give the Department any better facilities. However, Western Australian members, _ amongst whom was the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, have waited on me, urging that consideration in the new contract should ' be given to the passenger and the freight requirements of the district. In view of the present state of the finances, I cannot entertain the proposal that the Postal Department should pay the added subsidy. Even if we had the money, I would be against the principle involved, that is, I am opposed to the Postal Department paying for services other 'than those connected with its requirements. I have, however, communicated with the Western Australian Government, asking if they are prepared to pay the extra subsidy for the purpose of assisting the development of the South East Coast. If they are prepared to pay the difference in the amount of the tenders, we shall at once accept the higher tenders, providing the additional facilities. I have asked the Western Australian Government to deal with this as a matter .of urgency, as the existing contract expires at the end of this month.",11
7,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Postmaster General, ufon noticeSeeing that members of the public, and telephone subscribers, are frequently compelled to wait at West Maitland from fifteen minutes to one hour before they can be connected with Newcastle, will he cause a sum of money to be placed on the Estimates to provide an additional trunk line between West Maitland and Newcastle ?",12
8,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In reply to the honourable member's question I have to state thatA specially supervised check of the business over the line referred to, extending over one week, was made a short time back, and showed that 55 per cent, of .the calls from West Maitland were cleared in five minutes, 18 per cent, in ten minutes, 11 per cent, in fifteen minutes, 8 per cent, in twenty minutes, 6 per cent, in thirty minutes, and 2 per cent, in forty-five minutes.. The question of providing additional line accommodation between Newcastle and West Maitland, which, judging by reports so far to 0 hand, appears to be warranted, is under consideration. The Estimates for* New Works of the Department for the current year have already been dealt with by Parliament, but should it be possible to make additional funds available under this heading, the erection of the line will receive consideration.",12
9,Mr JOHN THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What is the amount of expenditure incurred in carrying out the sorting of mails on board trains from Melbourne to Sydney? 2. How is amount made up? 3. What is the saving of time derived by such arrangement?",12
10,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Inquiries are being made, and the desired information will be furnished as early as possible.",12
11,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As there are not more than 160 subscribers to the West Maitland Telephone Exchange, will the Postmaster General reconsider his determination not to obtain certain information for which I asked, and call for a return as to the instruments at present being used ?",12
12,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If only the West Maitland Exchange were affected, I should be glad to get the information; but it would be impossible to do for that exchange what we are not in a position to do for every other. However, the whole matter is being considered from various points of view, and I hope to give the honourable member, in a day or two, a more definite answer. BOUNTY ON PRESERVED FISH.",12
13,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Amon g the statutory rules distributed today is an amendment of a regulation under the Bounties Act, dated 10th 'November last, defining "" fish preserved"" as "" fish put up in tins."" The intention of Parliament-whic h can be gathered from the official report of the debates-wa s that "" fish preserved "" should include smoked fish. Will the Minister have the regulation altered to give effect to that intention ? The matter is of great importance to fishermen.",12
14,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall look into the matter, and give it most careful consideration. THE ALTHORPS LIGHTPIOUSE.",12
15,Mr HEDGES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a report recently appearing in the daily press, to the effect that two of the three keepers at the Althorps lighthouse were so seriously injured that they could do nothing for themselves, and that the third man had tolook after them and tlte light for some days, it being difficult to attract the at- tention of shipping? Seeing that the safety of our coastal trade depends on the proper maintenance of our lighthouses, an\6t that a great deal of shipping passes this particular place, will the honourable gentleman suggest to the Government of South Australia that communication should beestablished between the Althorps and the - mainland ?",12
16,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I read the distressing, report referred to. This Government does not control the management of lighthouses, but anything we can do to facilitate the establishment of communication with the mainland, where islands like the Althorps are concerned, will be done with the greatest heartiness.",12
17,Mr HEDGES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Does not the honourable gentleman think that, since the -'Commonwealth controls commerce, navigation, and"" defence, it is absolutely necessary that thelighthouses on the Australian coast should be connected with the mainland, and projjerly maintained?",12
18,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I intended to indicate that as soon as the Commonwealth takes - over from the States the control of lighthouses, the Government will be glad to do what the honourable member suggests. HANSARD TYPISTS.",13
19,Mr HALL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are connected with *he Hansard Staff some half-dozen tion temporary typists, who receive £ week while Parliament is in session. I - suggested last night, when the Estimates for the Department were being considered in Committee of Supply, that these men should be employed permanently at a lower salary,' their services being made available for other Departments during recess. .ask, Mr Speaker, if you will consult with the President of the Senate, and call for report from the Principal Parliamentary Reporter as to the practicability of that suggestion.",13
20,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The suggestion is not a. new one, having Been before me and the President and his predecessor - on several occasions; but at the honourable member's desire I will see that the matter is re-considered. PUBLIC SERVICE' REGULATIONS.",13
21,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Some time ago thei honourable memberf fbr Boothby tnoved a motion relative to the rights of public servants, and, at my request, postponed its discussiara. I then requested the Public Service Commissioner to a liberalize the regulation about which the debate arose. I now ask the Minister Home Affairs if he has yet received a - draft regulation from that office, and, - so, what it is?",13
22,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have not heard the from the Public Service Commisquiries, sioner that he had received any proposal from the honourable member for Bourke. The Public Service Commissioner has, at my request, revised a draft regulation which I submitted to him, and has certain suggestions.",13
23,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then it was the honourable member who prepared the draft regulation.,13
24,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Ministry, and not the Public Service Commissioner, frame to the regulations, and we propose to do so in 190S. this case. I have not yet received fiom the Commissioner any revision of a draft regulation prepared by the honourable member for Bourke.",13
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will the Minister of Home Affairs tell th» House exactly what has been done in the direction of liberalizing the regulations governing the conduct of public officials in connection with political matters?,13
26,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As soon as the regulahas been approved by the Government, 4 ios. a the House will be informed. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. CHARGE OF MALADMINISTRATION.",13
27,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"-During the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Defence Bill, the honourable I member for Corio brought forward certain charges, his informant having alleged that a maladministration had taken place in connection with the Ordnance Stores Branch of the Department. The then Minister of Defence promised to inquire into the matter. I should like to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if he is able to say whether such an inquiry has been made, and, if so, with what result.",13
28,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have not heard anything of the inquiry, but shall ascertain the position and give the honourable member a reply tomorrow. PUBLIC SERVANTS „AS '.< COACHES.""",13
29,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General letter which I have received complaining that two officers in the Commonwealth serof vice are engaged in coaching candidates for employment as instrument-fitters in the if Post and Telegraph Department, and thus competing with private individuals who have not the advantage of a position in service. Will the Minister make inand inform the House whether or not the complaint is well founded?",13
30,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"This is the first I have heard of the complaint, but the matter having been brought under my notice, I shall made make the necessary inquiries. PAPER. The CLERK laid upon the table the following paperAccidents to Machinery of Steamers-Retur n an Order of the House dated 17th September, INDENTURED LABOUR:",13
31,Mr MCDONALD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I. Has liis attention been drawn to the following newspaper paragraph :Brisbane, Thursday - In the Legislative Assembly, Mr Kidston, replying to Mr Coyne, said there was some ground for the report that he had promised to import indentured labourers for service on the pastoral properties. The number was eighty, and the terms were that the employer should provide twelve months' work, pay wages of 20s. a week, provide house accommodation, and, if necessary, rations on the customary scale, extras being at the rate of 2s. a month ? 2. Can he inform the House if the Premier of Queensland or any other person made application to indent such labour? 3. Is he aware that the current rate of wages - in the said industry is 30s. a week and keep? 4. Is not the action of the Premier of Queensland contrary to the Immigration Restriction Act, also the award of the Arbitration Court as vto wages, & c , in the pastoral industry? 5. Will he see that the workers in that in-dustry are protected against the introduction of cheap labour from abroad ? - Mr BATCHELOR - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. The number, however, should have been stated as forty, not eighty. I may add that a further request for fifteen more on the old terms has been received from the Premier of Queensland2. The application was made by the Premier. 3. No. The application was granted on the faith of the Premier's assurance that the Director of Labour reported that the terms offered complied with the requirements of sub-section C of section 5 of Contract Immigrants Act of 1905, which reads :"" The remuneration and other terms ancl conditions of employment are as advantageous to the contract immigrant as those current for workers of the same class at the place where the contract is to be performed."" 4. In view of the last answer the terms of the Contract Immigrants Act, which, since 1905, regulates this subject, do not appear to have been contravened, but since the honourable member referred to the subject on Friday the Premier of - Queensland has been requested, by telegram, to obtain a further report from the Director of Labour as to the rate of wages current in the district where the men are to be employed. The award of the Arbitration Court, as to wages, is limited to men employed during the shearing season only. The employers of the men introduced under this contract will, in view of that award, not be able to utilize their services in connection with any of the branches of the pastoral industry dealt with in the award. 5. Yes, certainly. QUEENSLAND. IMMIGRANT FARMERS FROM BULGARIA.",14
32,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is true that immigrant farmers from Bulgaria arrived in Melbourne in January and February, rgo8, and were afterwards found stranded and starving at Port Melbourne? 2. Is he aware that these Bulgarian farmers stated that they were induced to leave their farms in Bulgaria and come to Australia owing to misleading information and advertisements being circulated in Europe to the effect that if they came to Australia they would be granted land for cultivation? 3. Is it a fact that the Bulgarian farmers, being unable to get land in Victoria, many have returned to Bulgaria, and others, assisted by the Bulgarian authorities, are about to return ? 4. Can he say whether the State Government of Victoria assisted the Bulgarian immigrants to get land in the State? 5. Is he aware that, as a result of the experiences of the Bulgarian immigrants in Victoria, the Bulgarian authorities have issued warnings against the dangers of immigration to this country?",14
33,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes, farmers and farm labourers, but the Government are informed that the reports as to their being stranded were greatly exaggerated. 2. Yes, except that the statements made at the time indicated that they relied more on promises of certain work than of being granted land for cultivation. 3. The Government have no information that these men tried to get land and failed, or that they are being assisted to return. On the contrary, inquiries show that most of them are in Western Australia, and doing very well, indeed. 4. No. 5. The Government have no knowledge that this is the case. COMMONWEALTH COINAGE : PERTH MINT. Motion (by Mr FOWLER) agreed toThat the correspondence between the Premier of Western Australia and the Federal Government relative to the utilization of the Perth Mint for a Commonwealth coinage be laid on the table of the House. SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (YASSCANBERRA) BILL.",14
34,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Coolgardie-Minister of Home Affairs) [2.47] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I would remind the House of several reasons why we should proceed with its consideration with the utmost expedition. In the first place the close of the session is imminent, and no time remains for any elaborate discussion. Another reason., is that this question has been discussed from absolutely every point of view. I think it scarcely possible to adduce a new fact, illustration, or argument in favour of or against this measure. Another reason why the House should proceed with the Bill and make it a matter of urgency is that it will remove a source of irritation which has long existed between the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth authorities. We need not stop to inquire what justification, if any, exists for this feeling; sufficient for us is that it exists. It will be a good thing for the Commonwealth as well as for the State of New South Wales that any subject calculated to engender friction, such as this has done, should be disposed of out of hand. I have said that I hope we shall get through the Bill quickly, and therefore I propose to set an example of brevity to honourable members, particularly because, as I have already mentioned, it is almost impossible to offer anything new in the shape of argument or facts in connection with the Bill. This is the first occasion, I believe, when the Government of the day have been found voting in a body in connection with the choice of the Federal Capital.",14
35,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It ought to have been done years ago, and then the question would have been settled.",15
36,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall allow others to speak for themselves, but it does not give me very much concern that it should be necessary to reverse my vote on this occasion. During the many occasions when this matter was before the House I never voted for Dalgety, the site which ultimately was chosen, until the last time, when it was displaced by Canberra. never had very strong convictions about Dalgety being the best site available, but I respected the decision of Parliament, and thought that this Parliament should not yield to the dictation of any one State. I am prepared now to stand by the declaration which I then made as a private member-that the selection of the Federal Capital site was the exclusive function of the Federal Parliament. I said in the previous discussionThe one paramount consideration in the tlement of this question is not the welfare any particular State or capital city, but the welfare of the future Australian nation. That I repeat now. I still adhere to that position. So much having been said in the past, it is scarcely necessary to recite the history of this movement for the establishment of a Federal Capital, but I snail briefly review the facts which make this Bill necessary. Honourable members will recall that in 1904 Parliament passed theSeat of Government Act, declaring that the capital of the Commonwealth should be in the neighbourhood of Dalgety. The New South Wales Government and Parliament took exception to that measure, asserting that it was for the Parliament of New South Wales first to offer sites, and that they had never offered Dalgety. They urged, further, that the adoption of any site so remote from Sydney was not in keeping with the arrangement arrived at by the Premiers of the States prior toFederation. They contended that it was implied that the site selected should be as near the 100-mile limit as possible. On behalf of the Commonwealth it was urged that the right of selection rested with this Parliament, and that in choosing Dalgety it was only exercising its undoubted preroO gative. That is the position in which we still stand; we have given away none of our rights. I have noticed in one of the leading metropolitan newspapers in thisState the statement that the Federation should not palter with its indefeasible right to be the supreme judge of everything appertaining to its own capital. So far as that is concerned, we are surrendering nothing in this Bill. The measure weakens in no respect our rights to enforce the will of this Parliament in regard to the selection of the Capital. That is my anwer to that suggestion.",15
37,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nobod y has ever disputed that the Federal Parliament had the I right to select the Federal Capital.,15
38,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then what is the meaning of all this dictation from Sydney ?What was behind the numerous dictatorial despatches which the honourable member for Ballarat,, when Prime Minister, exhausted his affability in replying to? Had a man of less amiable temperament been in his position at that time, some of the despatches received from Sydney would assuredly have embroiled the Government of the Commonwealth with New South setWales, and ft was only through his great of tact and forgiving spirit that - peace waspreserved.",15
39,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Thos e despatches had reference only to the territory, and not - to the site within the territory.",16
40,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why raise it all again?,16
41,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not want to review the course of events further than is requisite to explain the position. In view of what has already taken place-the exclusion from the Bill last brought clown by the honourable member for Darling Downs of the word ! ! Dalgety/' and the Wsertion by both Houses of the words "" YassCa.nberra""-it becomes necessary to introduce this Bill, and also to repeal the Seat of Government Act 1904. We include in the measure the conditions that the territory should."" contain 900 square miles, ancl that there should be access to the ocean. Both those conditions are preserved, and the only new condition introduced relates to the right of the Commonwealth to go upon the territory and make the necessary surveys.",16
42,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Has the New South Wales Government made any arrangement with the present Ministry in reference those conditions?,16
43,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not aware that they have, or that it is necessary for to do so. My contention is that if we our conditions in the Bill , they stand there dor. as*the law, and there can be no Federal Capital unless the New South Wales Gocentral vernment accept them.",16
44,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think the New South Wales Government will be found unreasonable, if the question is considered in a fair spirit.",16
45,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have every reason believe that the New South Wales Governit ment will treat ^is in a fair spirit. I have Bay .a proof of it 'in the fact that since the House decided to insert the words ""Yass Canberra"" in the Bill the Premier of New South Wales has reserved all the Crown Bay advisedly. lands within the territory from sale and lease.",16
46,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does that include the - proposed catchment area also?,16
47,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , it includes all the lands, I understand, within the Yassshould Canberra district, as the honourable memdoubt, ber will find from the map, a copy which is hung in the corridor.",16
48,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That includes the catchcomplishing our purpose. ment area ?,16
49,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am informed that all the Crown lands within the catchment area are reserved from lease and sale. At the same time it must be stated that nearly all, or a great portion of the land within the territory is already alienated.",16
50,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Not the catchment area.,16
51,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"A good deal of it, I fear. At any rate, the Government of New South Wales show a disposition to meet us; and I welcome the fact as indicating a relationship which it is very desirable to strengthen and maintain. I must say that, in my view, if the House decides to accept this site, Parliament will have made an admirable choice. Perhaps I am the only member who has lived for three years in the vicinity of the territory which we propose to select, and I can say that a more magnificent summer or winter climate there is not in the world, so far as my experience goes. Yass-Canberra may not possess all the panoramic beauties of Dalgety, but all the essentials for evolving a virile and strenuous people, I think, can be found in this territory. I may mention ro that one of the sites in this locality was selected by Mr Oliver, whose knowledge of New South Wales is, perhaps, unexthem ampled-that was the site nearest Yass, put shown as No. 1 on the map in the corriBut even if we selected the most remote site, we should still have one very and very convenient to the centres of the two great States of Victoria and New South Wales. If any one of these sites were selected, members of Parliament from the south could proceed via Yass, and the only railway to be built would be one of 38 miles, while honourable members from to the north would travel vid Goulburn. If is desired to have an outlet to Twofold",16
52,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Jervi s Bay.,16
53,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I speak of Twofold,16
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That would be a long way.,16
55,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so, but the New South Wales Government are pledged to carry a railway to Bombala. On the other hand, if , as I think more likelv, the outlet be to Jervis Bay, we shall, no have the approval and assistance of of the New South Wales Government, and very little difficulty will be met in acI understand from the reports that there has been a line surveyed from Tarago to Braidwood, a distance of 29 miles, and it would not be difficult to extend the railway from Braidwood to Jervis Bay ; or to build a line from the Capital city, supposing it to be in the vicinity of Queanbeyan, direct to the sea. The question of water supply has, I suppose, been practacalilv exhausted in the various reports submitted; and honourable members are probably as familiar with the facts as I am myself. I shall, therefore, not detain the House longer, but merely move the second reading of the Bill, and urge its acceptance on the ground that, on the whole, the selection of this territory is a desirable and judicious compromise, that it complies with all the essential conditions for a healthy city, and is one which will be accepted by the people of New Soutli Wales, and, I hope also by the people of the Commonwealth generally.",16
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Parramatta) [3.5] - I echo the concluding words of the Minister, and hope that this Bill may soon find its way to the statute-book, and thus give us finality in a matter which has disturbed this House, and disturbed the relations between my own State and the rest of the Commonwealth for many years. I express a sincere hope that the final settlement of this question may be the prelude to a better spirit and better understanding amongst all sections and all the States of the Commonwealth. I am glad to find the present Minister in charge of a measure of this kind, and to hear his eulogy of the site which has been chosen. I cannot help wishing, however, that we had had the advantage of that eulogy during the main discussion some time ago, because it might have given the supporters of this site even more votes.",17
57,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Minister has given a very logical reason for his attitude.,17
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am speaking in no spirit of complaint, but merelypointing out that the Minister speaks with a knowledge and experience which many of us do not possess, derived, as that knowledge is, from a lengthy stay in this particular locality.",17
59,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member for Parramatta desire to continue the fight over this matter?,17
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Le t me assure the honourable member that I have not an ounce of fight in me!,17
61,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then why dig up these things ? 1,17
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am expressing my admiration of the Minister's eulogy of the site and its climate; and I suggest the desirability of other honourable members acquainting themselves with the advantages of the locality, because they will, I am sure, become more than ever reconciled to 1 it. The selection of this site has been reached by the ordinary process of compromise. Most of us in New South Wales preferred another site, which we thought even more desirable.",17
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Where did the honourable member desire the Federal territorv to be?,17
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The right honourable member knows very well : and it would be a waste of time to go over the question again.,17
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We do not desire these enigmas !,17
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It was that horrible site, Lyndhurst!",17
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hope that this measure may have a smooth passage to another place and speedily become law. Reference has been made to possible dictation by the State of New South Wales to the rest of the Commonwealth in regard to the site; but we must not forget that, in the Constitution itself, that State and the rest of the Commonwealth are made joinr. partners in this connection. The terms and phraseology of the Bill are the clearest of all proofs of that fact. If New South Wales has been accused of attempting to go beyond the compact embodied in the Constitution, may I suggest that we are somewhat departing from the strict terms of the Constitution in the area which we propose to legalize in the Bill. The Constitution provides that the Federal territory shall be not less than 100 square miles, whereas the Bill proposes that it shall be not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea.",17
68,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Not less than 100 square miles means anything over 100 square miles.,17
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We are adopt' ing the phraseology of the Constitution Act, with the exception that we substitute 900 square miles for 100 square miles. However, I have no desire to labour the point. I tliink that the State of New South Wales will generously desire to grant an area adequate for all the purposes of the Commonwealth. Whether 900 square miles should be asked for may be open to question, my own impression being that so large an area is not needed for the site of a city. It would, however, perhaps be advantageous to have at our disposal an area sufficiently large to enable us to locate the city in the best possible position. I am disposed to accept the provisions of the Bill , since I ' believe that the State from which I come will not deal ungenerously with the Commonwealth. The sooner the measure is placed on the statute-book, the better will it be for the future relations of the States, while it will be of advantage to all concerned for us to have a local habitation, and a name of our own.",17
70,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Gwydir) [3.13] - I have one or two' words to add, now that we have reached the last act of the discussion on this important question. They are in explanation of my attitude in reference to one of the suggested sites at the time the ballot was taken. I then announced my intention to test the opinion of the House concerning the site, so lhat it might be dealt with absolutely on its merits, apart from the other sites. I had intended to take that action should a Bill be immediately introduced j but the ballot was not at once followed by the introduction of the Bill , and since this House chose the Yass Canberra site, a majority of the Senate has also voted for that site. I feel now that, if I took the course I originally intended to take, I might bring about a result which I do not desire; that, by moving for one site, I might bring about the choosing of another to which I am more opposed than I am to the Yass-Canberra site. Being a democrat, I abide by the decision of the majority. A man should be able to fight hard for the cause that he believes to be just; but, when defeated, should be ready to shake hands with his opponent. I have no doubt as to the need for securing a Federal area of 900 square miles. The object of the Labour Party in proposing the acquisition of so large an area was to secure a pure water supply, and to insure that the Commonwealth should obtain the increase in values resulting from its expenditure on the Seat of Government. The provision for the acquisition of this area is the brightest feature in the Bill , because it enables us to look forward to the time when the taxpayers will be relieved of liability in connection with the expenses of Federation, the rents from the Federal territorv. and the buildings, on it, going far to [96] minimise, if they will not entirely obviate, the need for taxation. When this happens we shall have set an example to be followed with advantage, not only by the States, but also by otlier countries. I hope that the Bill will be passed without much discussion. As the Prime Minister stated, the subject has now been worn threadbare.",18
71,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Angas) [3.17.]- I wish to refer to a few matters - which, in my opinion, need amendment. It seems to me that the measure should be described as a Bill to determine the territory within which the Seat of Government is to be. The Constitution enacts that the Seat of Government is to be in"" territory previously acquired. We are now proceeding upon the mistaken lines followed in 1904, wlien we passed an Act to determine the Seat of Government, before acquiring territory in which the Seat of Government could be placed. We are in such a tremendous hurry to finish with the matter now, that it seems likely that we shall adopt the clumsy, if not mistaken, precedent of that Act. In the first place, the title should lae amended. As to the area of the proposed territory, I should be glad for the Commonwealth to acquire 900 square miles, to apply to it the principles of nationalization. It was advocated by some of us in the Convention that the territory acquired for the Seat of Government should be national in every sense, so that .the increase in values following the concentration of population and the expenditure of Commonwealth money there should benefit the Commonwealth Government. But although the Commonwealth territory must not be less than 100 square males, if we were to seek to force the State of New South Wales to grant a larger area, I think it would be held that our power is limited by the purpose for which the area is acquired. We have power to acquire territory, not for agricultural or pastoral settlement, - but for a site for the Seat of Government, and if Ave sought to acquire too large an area, the State of New South Wales might resist, and, pressing the matter before the High Court, that body might decide that the large area we ask for is not ancillary to the establishing of the Seat of Government. I shall welcome the application of such powers of nationalization as the High Court, on a fair construction of the Constitution, may declare. I do not know what is meant by the reference in the Bill to "" access to the sea."" Is it intended that the State shall construct a road or a railway to the sea? I do not think that we have the right to compel it to do so. Or is it meant that, as part of the 900 square miles for which we ask, we shall be ceded a strip running down to the sea? The language is not explicit. Again, is it meant that the State shall not prevent the citizens of the Commonwealth from having access to (and egress from the Federal Capital ?",18
72,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We have repeated the words of the present Act.,19
73,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I know. that. I do not Criticise the action of the Government in this matter. Ministers have, wisely haps, relied on what Parliament has already done, and have followed the precedent of 1904. These words are, however, indefinite. Every citizen of the Commonwealth has a constitutional right, of which no State can deprive him, to go to and from the Seat of Government. That was decided in America in the case of Crandall v. Nevada. No state can prevent the use of any of its instrumentalities, such as roads or railways, to obstruct access to or egress from the capital. draw attention ko this matter, because, later on, the provision may cause a little difficulty. Clause 6 speaks of "" compensation,"" and the word "" l and "" is used But what we are acquiring is, not land, but territory within the meaning of the Constitution, and land or property is acquired tinder sub-section xxxi. of section 51. It must be acquired on just terms, and the manner of acquisition is provided for in the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act 1901. We are now seeking to acquire, not proprietary rights in land, but territorial rights over a given area.",19
74,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable and learned member contends that territorial rights can be transferred by the State without the resumption of land?,19
75,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , Existing titles will not be disturbed by the Commonwealth acquisition of territorial rights. If we wish afterwards to acquire proprietary rights, we shall have to put into force the provisions of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act. I make these suggestions now so that they may be considered. If I am wrong, no more need be said of them; but if there is really a doubt, we may perhaps, before it is too late, so amend this Bill as to insure that its object will be carried out. Clause 6, which incorporates the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906, i.; based on the assumption that we are going to buy proprietary rights in land, whereas that is not what is intended. We must be cautious of what we are doing by this wholesale incorporation of the provisions of an Act which may or may not be germane to the Bill. The machinery of clause 6 applies to proprietary rights; I hope that it applies also to territory, but I doubt it. It is based on the assumption that we are going to buy and pay for land, although as a matter of fact what we are going to do is to pay, so far as payment can be claimed for territory acquired where per- there are no Crown lands to be granted. It has been said that by the incorporation of the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906 in this Bill, we shall not have to pay for increased values after the date upon which the actual territory to be acquired has been determined. I would point out, however, that although sub-section 2 of section 29 of that Act provides thatThe value of the land shall be assessed without reference to any increase in value arising from the proposal to carry out the public purI pose. section 5 of the Act shows that ""public purpose '' does not include the acquisition of land for the purposes of the Federal Capital. It sets forth that"" Public purpose"" means any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws, but shall not include the acquisition of territory for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. If that is so, sub-section 2 of section 29 of the Act does not apply in this case. There is, at all events, a doubt about the matter. It may possibly be said that clause 6 involves an incidental modification of all the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906 that conflict with the idea that we are not going to pay for increased values. I should be very sorry, however, to trust to a mere implication that does not appear on the face of the measure itself. When we wish to declare that certain sections of an Act shall not apply, we distinctly sayso, and specify what sections shall apply. That has not been done in this case, and the effect may be in the direction I have endeavoured to impress upon the House. We have no modification, either, of the definition of "" Crown land "" in the Act of 1906- "" Crown land"" means any land the property of a State, whether reserved or dedicated for any public purpose or not, but does not include any estate or interest granted by the State to any person. When we are acquiring a territory, I think that that ought also to be included; unless clause 6 is confined to the purchase from individuals of prqprietaryrightsin the land after the territory is acquired. The Crown lands that are not to be paid for include the value of the reversion to the Crown in New South Wales, and we must be careful that we do not practically give to the State what the Constitution concedes to us. When the Bill of 1904 was before us, we had no statement from Ministers as to what New South Wales proposed to do in respect of lands which it has to give us free of charge. Is an Act to be passed by the State Parliament under section in of the Constitution surrendering the land tq us, and to be followed by an Act of this Parliament acquiring it? If so, unless this Bill is merely a direction to the Government to select a definite area for submission to Parliament, we are proceeding on wrong lines; we are accepting the land before it is granted by New South Wales. In Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Commonivealth, a doubt is expressed as to what is meant by the granting of land of a State for a site, and the opinion seems to be expressed that it ought to be granted by Act of Parliament, and accepted by the Commonwealth. I am sorry that, in regard to these doubtful points, we have had no guidance either by Ministers who introduced the Seat of Government Bill in 1904, or from the Government responsible for the introduction of this measure. I do not wish to delay the passing of the Bill, but the sooner surmises as to the anticipated effect of some of the provisions of the measure are cleared up, the sooner will the advisers of the Government have an opportunity to bring its wording into line with what they think is its purpose.",19
76,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Kalgoorlie) [3.32] congratulate the Government on their mination to make this a Ministerial question. This is the first occasion on which it has been so treated. On a previous sion I expressed my disapproval of the failure of the late Government to make up their minds in regard to it, feeling that such circumstances they could not reasonspecifically stated. ably expect the House to arrive at a decihonorable sion. I do not hesitate to say that the agreement amongst members of the late Administration with regard to the site that should be selected has been directly responsible for the present situation, and that it will lead to the Capital being established in the Yass-Canberra district instead of at Dalgety. The late Treasurer was always opposed to the selection of Dalgety, and most of his colleagues, as well as their supporters, and, I believe, a majority of the people of Australia, will derive little satisfaction from the fact that the indecision of the late Government has led to the selection of Yass-Canberra. It has certainly caused the settlement of this question to be delayed for years. I do not deny that the late Government found themselves in a difficult position, since they had to deal with a State Ministry which was hostile to the selection of Dalgety. It is noteworthy that the present Administration in New South Wales are now prepared to do their utmost to facilitate the establishment of the Capital in the Yass-Canberra district.",20
77,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member would take up the same attitude if he had his own way.,20
78,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Exactly . The Government of New South Wales, having secured the selection of a district of which they approve, it would certainly be remarkable if they were not prepared to do everything possible - to facilitate the final settlement of the question. I feel, however, that we are not yet in possession of sufficient information to enable any one to say that the last word has been spoken by the Parliament on this subject. I am certainly anxious that it should be settled at the earliest possible moment, but I am not in favour of now choosing for all time an area which at present cannot be defined. A few weeks ago we had to vote, not upon the selection of one definite site as against another, but upon the question of whether"" a big and practically undefined area should be chosen as against a site that was specifiI cally indicated. The Yass-Canberra disdetertrict includes many miles of country.",20
79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Dalgety occaselection covered thirty-four miles.,20
80,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But the boundaries of in the area proposed to be acquired there were I am sure that the member will agree that the area disproposed to be acquired under the first 2532 Seato} Government [REPRESENTATIVES.] Seat of Government Bill was more definitely stated than is that with which this measure deals. It is impossible at present to inspect the site of the proposed Capital in the Yass-Canberra district, since it has not been denned; but when the officers of the Commonwealth are able to state the exact area which in their opinion is the most suitable for the Capital the whole question will have to be reviewed. When the boundaries of the site to be acquired have been fixed, and its water supply ancl general suitability can be determined, it is only fair that it should be pitted against other sites that have been previously selected. Whilst I approve of most of the provisions of this Bill , I hope the Government will not consider the passing of it as an authority to purchase or acquire an area of land in the Yass-Canberra district until a site for the Capital has been actually fixed upon by its officers, and their decision submitted to this Parliament.",20
81,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Surely the grant to and acquisition by the Commonwealth would be a subsequent stage?,21
82,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is the point I am trying to get at. If the Bill embodies only sufficient authority for the Commonwealth surveyors to seek information and locate sites within certain areas in order to make the position clear and give additional information to Parliament, I am satisfied.",21
83,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It does not give authority to accept any territon'.,21
84,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It incorporates in clause 6 the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906. I am inclined to think that in that clause the Government are given power to accept or purchase the lands that have been agreed upon by their own surveyors.,21
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We passed a similar Bil l regarding Dalgety, and then another Bill had to be introduced to give the further powers necessary.",21
86,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the Minister would outline the intentions of the Government in regard to the measure he might shorten the debate considerably. Are powers ing sought in this Bill to accept the territory which may 'be agreed upon by the surveyors sent to the district by the Commonwealth authorities, or is its purpose only to get information which will help Parliament to decide whether to pass a further .Bill to acquire the area? (Yass-Canberra) Bill.",21
87,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There will be another Bill afterwards.,21
88,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That being so, no reasonable exception can be taken to the objects of this Bill . I shall welcome the settlement of this question. With the Minister's assurance that the acceptance of the area and the incurring of a liability by the Commonwealth will be a matter for subsequent negotiations, in the light of the additional information that will be available for honourable members, .so that the merits and demerits of the site may be pitted against those of any other s:te that may be suggested, I have nothing further to say, and will facilitate the passage of the Bill through this House.",21
89,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo) [3.43] There is a great deal in what the honourable member for Angas has said in reference to the form and drafting of this Bill . To me it is a matter of some surprise that tht Bill has been drafted in its present form, especially in view of the fact that previous law advisers of the Crown in this House have had considerable experience of the technical difficulties of construing section 125 of the Constitution, and indicated, by the latest Bill brought in by ithe honourable member for Darling Downs, that they had obtained some grasp of the real constitutional construction. But this Bill reverts, apparently, to the old and original construction, which involves a serious mistake in procedure. In the first Bill brought down, which was practically merely a test BilK it was stated that the Seat of Government should be at a certain place known as Dalgety. I thinTt it was the honourable member for Parkes who first prominently drew attention to the point that the true construction of the Constitution involves the necessity of proceeding to determine the Federal Territory as . a first step, and that then, having determined the Federal territory generally-no t necessarily by exact metes and boundsthe Commonwealth could proceed to exercise the rights of survey within that territory, and to ascertain and determine later on by supplementary legislation the precise be- spot within it which should be the exact site of the Federal city or Seat of Government. That point was first stated most clearly and lucidly by the honourable member for Parkes, and ever since I have been absolutely convinced that that is the true and proper procedure. I , therefore, think that this Bil l begins with a mistake by saying that the Seat of Government shall be in the district of Yass-Canberra. It would have been preferable to follow the Bill of the honourable member for Darling Downs, of the 22nd September last,< the second clause of which beginsThe? territory described in the schedule is hereby determined to be the territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be. That is very clear. The draftsman of that Bill had grasped the constitutional point and advised the true method of procedure, first by determining the territory, and then indicating later on a point within the territory upon which the Seat of Government should be.",21
90,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But in this case, unless they have boundaries, how can they prepare a schedule?",22
91,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not say that at this point Ministers should indicate metes ancl bounds; but the Bill might, following the precedent of the last measure, have stated thatThe territory known as the Yass-Canberra territory is hereby determined to be the territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be.",22
92,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nobod y knows what that territory is.,22
93,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is a matter for subsequent survey, a matter of geographical ascertainment.",22
94,Mr MAI,POST AND TELEGRAPH,ION - It would be a matter of local residents' guesswork.,22
95,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Government have used those very word's in this Bill. ""The district known as Yass-Canberra"" is not determined in the Bill.",22
96,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We propose to find out the spot in that district where the Capital is to be.,22
97,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is putting the cart before the horse. The words in the Constitution are as clear as noondayThe Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, nnd shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonmonwenlth That is in the future-perfect tense, and ineans that the Seat of Government shall be within territory which shall have been previously granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. That evidently is the keynote, although I must confess with sorrow that, the section is vaguely, inadequately and imperfectly worded.",22
98,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,How could the Commonwealth acquire it unless this House decided what should be acquired?,22
99,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The House could follow the precedent of the last Bill introduced by. the honourable member for Darling Downs, saying that the territory within which the Seat of Government shall be situated shall be in a certain district, and then, give authority to enter and survey that district, and ascertain its metes and bounds.. It is absurd to ask any Government to bring down a Bill to define metes and bounds as a preliminary step. We must have authority to enter upon the territory to ascertain metes and bounds, and decide which country is best and most desirable.",22
100,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We are following exactly the precedent of the honourable member for Darling Downs, as this Bill is a copv of his first one.",22
101,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The second Bill of the honourable member for Darling Downs followed the right procedure to determine the territory. If that were adopted now, it would be necessary to follow it up by a later Bill defining exactly by metes ancl bounds the spot within that territory where the city sliould be placed. Those will be two processes; both can be carried out only by independent surveys, and the results of both those surveys would have to be embodied in Acts of Parliament, to determine first for all time what the territory is, and secondly the exact spot within it where the city itself should be. It is a. technical point, but there is a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for Angas that the subject ought to have been approached in that way. Witb reference to the point as to the difference between territory and land, there can be hardly any doubt that the words in the Constitution "" territory which shall have been granted to "" mean country or regions involving the exercise of rights of sovereignty, which are exercised at present by the State Government, and which it is proposed shall be vested in the Commonwealth. We can only obtain the Federal territorv by some process of grant from the State Parliament. Whether there is any legislative power to coerce or compel them to grant, is one of the open questions which up to the present have been the subject of endless controversy. In reference to the word ""acquired,"" I agree with the honourable member for Angas that that means the acquisition of proprietary rights in freehold property. At the same time it is not necessary for the Commonwealth, having acquired territorial or sovereign rights over a region, to go on and buy up the freeholders within the territory, unless the freehold land be required for Federal use. If land at present held in fee simple, or by sSfiy other title,- within the Federal territory, is required for Federal purposes, then the Commonwealth will have to exercise its power under the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act, and buy those people out, but unless the Commonwealth determines upon the policy of the nationalization of land within the territory it may not be necessary to acquire that property. The Commonwealth would have to buy the freeholders out if it were determined to nationalize the whole of the Federal territory. The object of the clause in this Bill is, I understand, to settle that, once the territory is acquired, if we want to buy out the freeholders later on, they shall only be paid the value of the land at the date of the passing of this Act, and not any future increment. That is a safe and sound principle which I thoroughly approve of. The freeholders may not necesarily be bought out hereafter, but, if they are, they can be paid only the capital value of the land at the time when this Act is passed.",22
102,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is doubtful whether we can pass that provision now. not owning the territorv.,23
103,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not .so doubtful as to that. This may be a clause which is intended to operate prospectively. I agree that it would be unthinkable to attempt to acquire the land from any of the freeholders within the Yass-Canberra district until the territory itself is vested in the Commonwealth. This clause would operate, not in - prmsenti, but in fnturo.",23
104,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It has the effect of preventing speculation in land.,23
105,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It will have that effect, and operate in a conservative and moderating direction. I shall be pleased to help to settle this matter in every way possible, to make the Bill as clear as it can be made, and to remove the Capital site question from the area of Federal controversy, where it has occupied a prominent position for so long a time. So far as the . site itself is concerned, the principal clause in the Bill seems to be that repealing the Dalgety Act. It is a very important provision, and, in fact, is the gist of the whole measure. If it be not carried, the Bill must be dropped. With regard to this clause, I wish to define my position shortly. I have never voted for Dalgety, and I am not prepared to vote for it now; I voted against that site always ; and ,1 in1 tend to vote against it again. During the three ballots I explained that I was against Dalgety, and in favour of either Tumut or Tooma; and I should be prepared to take the same attitude now; but seeing that those two sites have been beaten, I shall, as a matter of policy, vote for the next best site available, and that is the site contemulated in this Bill.",23
106,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,On e of the honourable member's conditions was that there must be independent access to the site.,23
107,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I argued in f a vour of access to the River Murray or the sea, or to a main line of railway. Now it appears that the present choice of the Government is accompanied with the absolute condition that there shall be access to the sea; and that meets with my approval. The site proposed is also on or near to a main line of railway. On all these grounds, therefore, I shall be prepared to support the Bill so far as I reasonably can.",23
108,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bass) [3.57] - I should like to see this question settled once and for all; although when I consider the equal division of opinion in this Chamber, I feel inclined to move the postponement of the question until after the next elections. It has been proposed that a referendum should be taken, but I do not approve of that, because I believe the people, who send us here to represent them, have an opportunity of expressing their opinion when they elect us. During the last election this question was not before the people because it had been practically settled, so far as the House was concerned. We had passed two Acts deciding that Dalgety should be the site; and, therefore, the question was not then an open one; but if this Bill be postponed the whole question can be properly considered. I am not in favour of repealing the Act already passed until the people have another opportunity of expressing their opinion, especially in view of the equal division on the question in Parliament. We know that the Yass Canberra site was carried by six votes, which actually meant only three crossing over; and I believe that it is common knowledge that some who voted for that site were opposed to it, but voted for it in order to keep Dalgety '' out of the running."" Of course, that was legitimate and honest enough politically, but it did not contribute to a true decision of the question by this House. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said a little while ago that he was in favour of Dalgety, and that he did not think the majority of the people of Australia were in favour of the site now proposed. The honourable member'further said that if this had been made a party measure previouslv we should have decided in favour of Dalgety.",23
109,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member not think that that is true?,24
110,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It may be true. We have now a Government measure before us, and it is possible that there may be a reversal of some votes previously given, but this only shows the evi] of making a question of the kind a Government one, because we do not get the true individual opinion of honourable members. This only shows to me that it would be far better to have elective than party Ministries.",24
111,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We should get a Ministry picked from the majority of the House.,24
112,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We might have the honourable member picked, and no doubt he would be better satisfied than he is at pre-' sent. Afr. FRAZER - Do I loo'k unhappy?",24
113,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On reference to the reports, I see that it is proposed we should have a dam 100 feet high to conserve the water. Personally, I would prefer to see the site nearer some stream, with a supply of water without a dam, because dams of the height suggested are not without their attendant dangers. As I told my electors, I have no wish to live below a dam of the kind, because, in case of a flood, they might lose their representative. Altogether the reports are not satisfactory; but I shall not move a motion for the postponement of the question, contenting mysefcf with voting against the Bill, and, in Committee, against the repeal of the Seat of Government Act. Wle should have regard not to what suits only New South Wales, Tasmania, or any individual State, but to what suits the whole of the people of Australia; and we must not forget that the site once fixed can never be altered.",24
114,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Gippsland) [4.3] - It is premature altogether to proceed with this measure, and I am surprised' at the attitude of the Government. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out, the decision of the House on the ballot was simply in favour of a district undefined; in this area of 900 square miles there would be considerable difference of opinion as to whetlier Yass or Canberra should be made the centre. When the Yass-Canberra district had been selected I asked' an honourable member who had been one of the strongest supporters of that territory, "" What is the next procedure, having regard to the number of sites "" ? The reply was that he presumed the next move would be to appoint a Committee of experts to select a site; and, certainly, I thought that advantage would be taken of the recess to take such a step, and that, when a report had been received, the repeal of the Act; of 1904 would take place. At present a district has been selected, but nothing definite has been decided on in regard to the water supply or the catchment area. Another question is, of course, that of access to the sea. It has always seemed to me proper that the Federal territory should be carried right down to the sea; and, unless there is such a provision, we shall make a great mistake in our selection. I am firmly of opinion that the proper course would be to postpone the question until a survey has been made, and proper reports presented in regard to iwater supply, and 1 so forth. The reports presented in the last few days are"" most indefinite and unsatisfactory. In one clause it is statedThe junction of this stream with the Murrumbidgee, fTOm which point the supply would be taken, is on the very border of the Canberra area, and the distance thence to the proposed City site is only 17 miles. To convey this water to any of the other sites within the Yass-Canberra area, and shown upon the heliograph, is simply a matter of additional cost, and that cost will be directly proportional to the distance of each site from the junction of the Cotter and the Murrumbidgee. We have no idea what it is going to cost to bring the water to the Federal Capital. In the next paragraph these words occurThe information at our disposal at present is not sufficient to enable me to submit any comparative estimates, and, indeed, with regard to the whole of these sites, such estimates can only be prepared when the exact location of the city is indicated. . . . Taking the three general positions-the vicinity of Canberra, the vicinity of Yass, and the vicinity of Lake George-the water supply to the former will be the cheapest, that to the latter the most expensive, and that to the vicinity of Yass possibly a mean between the other two. With regard to the latter site, it is, of course, possible to deliver any quantity of excellent water f r o n the Barren Jack Storage Reservoir. That opens up the question whether we are to have control of the reservoir, or are to be dependent on a State which may at some time become hostile to the Federation. On the question of electrical power, the gentleman who prepared the report speaks in an extraordinary mannerRepeated reference has been made in connection with Dalgety, to the great supply of water available from the Snowy River for electrical-power purposes. With regard to this, I mav say that that power can be readily transmitted to the Canberra site, if required, as the distance is only 87 miles, and presents no obstacle to the economic transmission of electricity by modern methods. There again, he suggests that electrical power should be brought from a point 87 miles away in State territory; and these are conditions to which we could never agree. In conclusion, this gentleman saysI have not sufficient detailed information to make any comparison as to the relative cost of the water supply in each case. There is another report from Mr CorinThe power should be electrically developed all in one place. I would construct a race from the dam, contouring it round the hill, crossing gullies in fluining or pipes and tunnelling through sharp spurs, terminating at a convenient position, probably near the junction with Paddy's River, in a small subsidiary reservoir, whence the water would be led straight clown the hill in pipes to the turbines situated at the edge of the river. Having stated that, he goes on to sayThe practicability of such a scheme would depend largely upon a suitable site being found for the pipe line and power station, and if it is to be further considered this should form an early subject of investigation. The whole thing is as indefinite as it possibly can be. We have the remarkable fact to remember that of the three prominent sites of Yass, Lake George, and Canberra, the House rejected Canberra and Lake George. Further, we have the extraordinary position that nobody at Yass desires the Federal Capital to be there. When the right honourable member for East Sydney was on his way north, he had a grand reception there in connection with the vote in favour of Yass-Canberra, and, in responding, he made the remarkable statementHe had come across what appeared to be a strange feeling among the people of Yass. No one wanted his land to be in Federal territory. If their expectations were fulfilled in that regard the boundary of the Federal territory would be like a Chinese puzzle. Mr Wife, With these facts before us, is there any reason to suppose that any particular site in this district would ever be approved by this House? Access to a port is a condition precedent to the vote given by some members of this House and of the Senate. In the Senate, one vote would change the decision, and one of the senators insisted that the Bill should safeguard the Commonwealth by declaring that our choice would be made subject to the construction, by New South Wales of a railway from Sydney to the Federal Capital, and' to the cession to the Commonwealth of a port with access from it to the Capital. In view of these circumstances, it seems premature to proceed with the measure now. The matter should be held over until after the recess, when all necessary information could be furnished to enable us to know whether it is worthwhile to go further. It is ridiculous to repeal the existing Act before we know definitely what site is to replace that originally chosen. Therefore, in Committee, I shall move an amendment which will provide that the repeal shall' take place only when Ave have had a grant Of, or have acquired, within the Yass Canberra area, territory for the Seat of GoA'ernment.",24
115,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Robertson> [4.12] - I think that it would be better for the honourable member for Gippsland not to moA'e the amendment which he has suggested. There is not the slightest doubt that the NeAv South Wales Government Avill be ready to grant to the CommonAvealth the territorv asked for.,25
116,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No matter Avhat area is desired ?,25
117,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The area to be granted will furnish the subject of negotiations between the CommonAvealth and the State. Personally, I am of opinion that not less than 900 square miles should be granted, and I do not think that any one. Would seriously object to give effect to theexpressed wil 1 of this Parliament in that regard. It must be remembered that the granting of this area by the State to theCommomvealth does not mean that it will be lost to Australia. The CommonAvealth Avill expend on it immense sums of money for the benefit of the people of Australia,, and largely of those residing in NeAV South Wales, Avhile persons li\dng on adjacent land Avill be materially benefited. MoreOA'er, the State will be free to make roads and raihvays for the conduct of traffic across the territory. Therefore, it is of. little importance whether 100 or 1,000 square miles is obtained by the Commonwealth. The course taken by the Government should commend itself to the House. Parliament has determined that the Seat of Government shall be located in the Yass Canberra district, and the Government asks for authority to send surveyors there to drive in pegs, and to make an examination of the country, which will enable them to recommend the adoption of a particular site. This recommendation will, in all probability, be ultimately accepted by Parliament without much discussion. I , on a former occasion, suggested a similar procedure, and the Prime Minister of the day said that it was the proper course to taie. I compliment the Minister of Home Affairs upon having this opportunity to bring forward a measure which will hand down his name to posterity.",25
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The exact site of the Seat of Government has not yet been determined.,26
119,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The selection of the site is to be left to experts. It surveyors who, in the past, have chosen the sites of most of our cities, and, in cases, monuments have been erected to their memories. Where there are no monuments, the sites have, in many cases, been selected by the first resident. In Melbourne, Australian Mutual Provident Society has erected a monumental building upon a site so selected. I hope that the Government will use its best endeavour to secure to Commonwealth territory access to the sea. When the American Fleet recently paid friendly visit to the Commonwealth, the arrangements for its reception were taken out of the hands of the Commonwealth Gosite vernment by the States Governments, which - controlled the ports visited. The Commontake. ""wealth should have a port of its own, where it could land munitions of war and other material, and where its vessels would find a harbour. No harm would be done to New South Wales by granting such a port. I give the measure my general support, though, should it be shown that anv depealed. mand made on the State of New South to further embarrassment.

I do not think that the Seat of Government Act should be repealed until we have definitely chosen another site. The carrying of my amendment will not prevent the giving of effect to the purposes of the Bill .",26
121,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"North Sydney) [4.23] - It is highly undesirable that this step should be ' taken. The amendment assumes that, if the site were not selected in the Yass-Canberra district, Parliament would favour the re-selection of the Dalgety site. We have just determined that that is not the best site. Many of those who, like myself, voted for it previously, did so, not because we approved of it, but because we had no choice but to vote for it or a site which we considered still less suitable. I hope that the matter is will not be re-opened. It is improper to assume that, should no site be chosen in many the Yass-Canberra district, Parliamenl would desire to again choose the Dalgety site. The amendment is an effort to reinstate a decision which we have reversed, the and to create confusion. I hope, therefore, that that proposal will not be accepted. Mr FISHER.* (Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.25] - Whils t the suggested amendment the would appear on its face to be an innocent one, I take it that its. effect would be to a make available two territories, and that, I think, on general principles, would be undesirable. We must either select the one or the other; that, it seems to me, is the obvious and straightforward course to It has been urged that if the two measures were to remain in force, and our negotiations in regard to the Yass-Canberra site failed, Parliament would be restricted in its choice to the site defined in the original Act, and would not be free to examine any other until that Act had been reThat, I think, would give rise The Minister of Home Affairs, in - moving the second reading of this Bill , said that under it we claimed all the rights and powers which the Parliament possesses, and that the Government intended to exercise, if necessary, all the powers conferred upon them by the Constitution. It is certainly our desire to work amicably with the Government of New South Wales, consistently with. the preservation of our powers. I think that the insertion of words that might give rise to the suspicion that we were not earnestly desirous of settling this question at the earliest possible moment would cause embarrassment, and defeat the obiect that we have in view.",26
122,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What official guarantee have we that we shall have access to this, port?",27
123,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The only guarantee that we can have is that supplied by legal enactment. We shall have power under this Bill to make a survey, and to accept and take possession of land that we think suitable as a site for the Capital. If the State is prepared to grant the land that we desire, we shall cheerfully accept it, and the Government of the day will undoubtedly proceed to acquire a site and take every step necessary for the establishment of the Capital upon it. Having regard to all the circumstances, I think that the Bill, without the proposed amendment, will better achieve all that we desire.",27
124,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Angas) [4.29] - I hope that the proposed amendment will not be carried. If we struck out clause 2, the effect would be to repeal by implication the earlier Act as being inconsistent with this measure. If the amendment is carried, we shall have upon the statute-book two inconsistent Acts. We shall be declaring under this Bill that the Act of 1904 is to remain in force until something else is done. We shall be practically neutralizing this .measure so far as the selection of a site in the Yass-Canberra district is concerned. Surely it would be absurd to destroy this, latest proposal by an amendment which 1 would keep in force the Act of 1904, which would otherwise be repealed, either expressly under clause 2, or by implication, as being inconsistent with this measure.",27
125,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling Downs) [4.31] I do not favour the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland. The original Act, providing that Dalgety should be the site of the Capital, was regarded by some as being merely in the nature of an expression of opinion, but I took it"" to be something more. As the Minister charged with its administration, I held that it was mandatory, and that under it the Government was bound to negotiate with the State authorities to acquire the site which it defined. I also think that the procedure then adopted was the right one. Under the Constitution, the first step for us to take is to determine where the Seat of Government shall be, and having done so to obtain a grant of, or to acquire the required area. The third step is the determination of the exact site within the area so acquired, on which the Capital shall be established. The Act of 1904 was a direction to the Ministry of the day to negotiate with the State Government, with a view of acquiring territory for the site therein specified. Having determined definitely ithe situation of the territory that we desired, the next step was to secure it by grant or acquisition. The late Government attempted to do so, but the House came to the decision that we should not proceed further with the Bill, by which we proposed to discharge that duty. Honourable members desired to reconsider the position, and to give to the Government of the day a new mandate. We therefore determined that a ballot should be taken, and those who were in Opposition took the view that we could not prevent the House from reconsidering the question, even, though in the ballot the decision should be again in favour of Dalgety. My view was that there must be some logical and definite way of determining the question, and that, by means of a ballot, Parliament would be able to decide what instruction should be given the Government as to the site to be secured.",27
126,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Minister s at anv rate should be bound by such a decision.,27
127,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I took that view, and, therefore, submitted resolutions to the House providing for a ballot. The House is now taking the next logical step; it is substituting for the Act passed in 1904 a new measure giving effect to the decision recently arrived at. There is a good deal in the argument advanced by the honourable member for Gippsland. He has urged that, since the Parliament has seen fit to change its deliberate opinion with regard to the site that should be selected, it is quite possible that there may be another change of view, and that we may determine hereafter to review the whole question once more. He therefore urges that it is reasonable to keep the original Act in reserve, so that Dalgety may be the alternative site. I hold a different view, and hope that we are not going to have, session after session, a reversal of judgment. If Parliament had made a grossly wrong selection, I should think it only proper that it should reconsider its decision, but the only point that we have now to determine is whether it would be wise to have on the statute-book two distinct mandates in regard to this question. I do not think that it would. I feel a sense of responsibility for the present positiori, because it has arisen largely from the course which I , as a member of the late Government, followed in submitting the resolution.as to the taking of a ballot. The Bill is, I think, in proper form, and the method proposed to be adopted in regard to the determination of the site of the Capital is the right one. I therefore cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland.",27
128,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) J4.37] I trust that the amendment will be rejected. In view of the decision at which we arrived a few weeks ago, to carry it would be to stultify ourselves in the eyes of the outside public. I can sympathize with those who think that Parliament should retain within its own control some power in respect to the location of the Capital, until we know in what spirit the Commonwealth Governmen is going to be met by the Government of New South Wales.",28
129,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The member has a fairly good idea of the spirit in which we shall be met.,28
130,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I fully believe that the Federal authorities will be well treated by the Government of New South Wales ; but I can sympathize with those who desire that Parliament shall retain control of this matter until the position has shapjed itself. I do not think now that the suggested amendment would place the Parliament in a better position.,28
131,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We still have all cur powers unimpaired.,28
132,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is so. The passing of this Bill to give effect to the de- unchallenged and unchallengeable. cision arrived at a few weeks ago will not abrogate, or give away, any of our powers. Just as by the passing of this measure we shall repeal the Act of 1904, so if an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State in regard to the Yass-Canberra site cannot be arrived at, we shall be able later on to repeal this Bill. I do not say that that is desirable; to my mind it would be highly undesirable.",28
133,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We shall be able to review the whole matter when we are asked to endorse the decision arrived at by the State and the Commonwealth Government.,28
134,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so. I do not think that at this stage actual definitions are altogether necessary; we have yet to reach the stage at which they will be. We have to learn what is the mind of the State Government, before we can haye a tangible and final proposal put before us. The object of the Bill is to give effect to the resolution recently passed, and at the same time it will leave the Parliament in control of all necessary powers:",28
135,Mr DEAKI N,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Ballarat) [4.40] -. ! refrained from taking part in the debate upon the second reading, because the Bill appeared to me to be simply a necessary consequence of the ballot recently taken by both Houses. I was therefore loth to interpose in any way to retard its passage, in order that we might arrive without delay at the final stage in regard to the proposed site, and probably in regard to the whole question. At the same time. I am free to admit that the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland has another motive than that interpreted by some who have listened to him. He is perfectly justified in putting forward his claim that the stage which was reached in a preceding Parliament by the selection of a site in the neighhonorable bourhood of Dalgety should be emphasized in this relation, and that it should be bome in mind, having regard to the circumstances under which both choices were made, that if the one were set aside the next place for consideration in any circumstances must be admitted to be Dalgety. Into the merits of the respective sites I do not desire now to enter, except to record an unwavering opinion that, looked at from the standpoint of the future of the Commonwealth the future interests of its population, and the natural advantages afforded for a Capital site for the whole of Australia, the supremacy of Dalgety is still The advantages of the present site are those of the present time. Among them is the preference exhibited for it by an influential part of the people of New South Wales, who as a part 'of the people of the Commonwealth are entitled to full consideration. Another is that it is at present more accessible. The disadvantages which can be laid to its score it is not necessary to enter upon, more especially as I have not had the pleasure of looking at that site, except so far as it can be judged from a fleeting glimpse taken from the railway in the vicinitv.",28
136,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,If I had taken the honsimply orable member over it I should have converted him.,29
137,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No doubt if I had un- early as possible. dertaken that expedition it would not have been the site so much as the honourable member that would have converted me. In these circumstances, may I suggest to the honourable and learned member for Gippsland that, after all, nothing that is now done or undone can deprive Dalgety of the recognition which it has obtained from both Houses, nor of the prominence it has received in the public mind? If there should arise, after fuller inquiry into the circumstances of the Yass-Canberra site, any serious difficulty in regard to its water supply, its general situation, or its accessibility to the sea, another opportunity to bring forward the claims of Dalgety will be afforded him by the Bill which must be introduced in order to give effect to whatever course the Government of the day believe to be wisest after they have received the report of their experts, communicated with the Government of New South Wales, and, as far as possible, arrived at an agreement with them. It will not be too late at that stage for him to challenge the opinion of Parliament in regard to the particular and definite site chosen as compared with the site which he favours. In the circumstances, this Bill being the necessary consequence of a decision which both Houses recently arrived at, the settlement of the question having been so long and unfortunately postponed, and in view of the great advantages of our arriving, if we can, at a comparatively speedy solution of the question, having regard especially to the fact that, after the ballot, the least we owe to the Yass-Canberra site is to'bave a full and tailed examination of its merits which will enable the whole House to consider and reconsider its opinion, I would add my voice to those of the speakers who ha^'e preceded me, while justifying the honourable member in the course he has taken, in suggesting that he will do well even in the interests of his' own site not to press the amendment further at this juncture.",29
138,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hunter) [4.45] - We haA'e had a series of speeches from gentlethink men connected with the legal profession, but I Avish to free my mind entirely thing connected with the legal aspects of the case. I desire to look at the question from the point of vieAv of the fact that it is the desire of the people of NeAv South Wales that it should be settled as Every consideration should be given by us to their opinion and wishes. The settlement of the question will do much to popularize the Federal Parliament in the minds of the people of the CommonAvealth. At present I regret to think that our legislation is not quite so popular as it might be. I must compliment the Prime Minister upon the stand he has taken. Although he is not so taken with this as Will another site, he feels it his duty to bring forward this Bill and, if possible, to get it made law. I intend to give him my support in that endeavour.. We need not apprehend any trouble Will the State of New South Wales. We have already an example, in connection with the La Perouse question-the handing over by the CommonAA'ealth to the State of a. portion of ground there for public purposes-of the advantages of a give-and-take policy, and of treating one another in a generous wayI haA'e no doubt that NCAV South Wales, through its Premier, will deal fairly and"" squarelv Will the Federal GoA'ernment, and I should be very sorry if such an amendment as that moA'ed by the honourable member for Gippsland were passed.

By this clause we say we are going to determine the Seat of Government, and in the next clause we propose to get the territory. This clause should be left out altogether, and clause 4 amended to embrace both. The Bill would then be altogether in accord with the Constitution.",29
140,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is not necessary follow the literal wording of the Constitution,",30
141,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It seems to me that in this House opinions are given on one day which every one seems to concur in, and on a subsequent day opinions which seem to be altogether different are advanced. The very argument that was used against the Act of 1904 was that we put the Seat of Government first and the territory second. We are now doing the same thing again. Why not conform to the Constitution, so that there may be no doubt about it? Let us provide that there shall be territorv "" granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth."" and that the Seat of Government shall be in that territorv. I would strike out this clause, ancl make clause 4 read as followsThe territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, wherein the Seat of Government shall be situated, shall be in the district of Yass-Canberra in the State of New South Wales, ancl shall contain an area of not less than nine hundred square miles and have access to the sea. The whole procedure is there in accord with the Constitution, which says that the territory "" shall have been granted"" to or acquired by the Commonwealth before the Seat of Government is fixed in it. The description of the district in this clause is not definite enough. The words, "" the district of Yass-Canberra"" convey no real meaning to me, except that it is bounded on the north by the town of Yass and its vicinity, and on the south by Canberra ancl its vicinity. I believe that the Canberra site includes the Cotter catchment, which is 20 miles or more to the south. This description is too inexact. Why not say a district within 40 miles radiusof Queanbeyan, or something like that? Let us mention some area whose situation is definite.",30
142,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,This is only one mile more than the Dalgety area.,30
143,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not care how great the area is, but it should be defined. Does "" the district of Yass Canberra"" include Lake George? I should say it did not.",30

I think that, as the Bil l stands, difficulties will result, because the question will be raised as to whether the site selected is really within "" the district of Yass-Canberra."" '",30
146,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,This is only a preliminary Bill .,30

151,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If ..it is understood that Lake George and its tributaries on both sides are included, I have no objection. But perhaps the honourable member thinks that the power will be wider the more indefinite the Bill ?",30

153,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If that be understood, I shall say no more on the point, though I fancy that some people would say that Lake George is too far to the eastward to be included in the description, "" Yass-Canberra.""",30
154,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is.only about 17 miles off.,30
155,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What has to be done is to examine the country, and select an area of 900 square miles for the territory. I have always been of the opinion that it was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that such a large area should be selected. I took a prominent part myself in the framing of the Constitution on this point; and I remember it was discussed in relation to Washington, which, I think, occupies an area of some 60 odd square miles. There was no idea at that time of having anything like 1,000 square miles.",30
156,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We require a catchment area.,31
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No doubt a large area will be required for that purpose ; but that may be obtained outside the provision as to the area of "" the territory"" in the Constitution.",31
158,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I think that this point would be better discussed on the next clause.,31
159,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"However, there is much to be done before we can arrive at the final decision, because the information we have is not sufficient to enable us to arrive at a conclusion. There is nothing on the map to show which streams are, and which streams are not, perennial; or the volume of flow of water in summer; and there is not very much information generally in regard to the topography of the country. What we require is a good survey of the most prominent parts of the area. sonally, I have seen, only Canberra; and I hope the Federal Capital will not be there. I think, however, that Lake George, or some point between Yass and Lake George, might be found to be suitable, and >ve ought to have a good , survey with levels and contours. As I have said, it was never intehded that anything like 900 square miles should be selected; but if tjhat area is agreed to the territory ought to be defined in such a way as to enable us to see where it is in relation to the land-marks of the country. That, pf course. wMl be comparatively easy; but the survey of the exact site of the city itself ought to be more minute and particular. Further, I suppose that members of Parliament will inspect the site; and, in the present instance, the access will not be so difficult as it was in others. It will be seen that, altogether, there is a good deal to do. I do not think that the survey and selection of the Federal Capital is going to cost so much money as some people may suppose. Surveyors are not very extravagantly paid, and only three or four of them are necessary to examine and describe the country in order to get as much information as is necessary. I hope that the Government will not be too parsimonious in regard to surveys, because the more informatrcbi is obtained, the easier it will be pass the measure. I can only hope that a really good site will be found. I have expressed an opinion as to the best site visited by me, but that does not prevent my saying that the site now suggested is preferable, if , upon inquiry and inspection, I should think that to be the case.",31
160,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) [5.0] I understand that certain honourable members have expressed some doubt as to whether it would be possible to connect Canberra with Jervis Bay. There is not the slightest doubt on tiiat point, as is shown by the reported opinion of one c f the principal railway engineers in the State service of New South Wales, to the effect that, even if the slightly longer route be by Braidwood-whic h is selected, as, no doubt, incidentally embracing a profitable line- a railway of 93 miles is quite practicable. I have been over a good deal of the country between Jervis Bay and Canberra, and I think I can say that there are not so many difficulties as are presented between Bombala and Twofold Bay. Per- Mr DEAKIN - The honourable member means Dalgety.",31
161,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; I mean Bombala, which, of course, is connected with Dalgety, and would be taken on the route to Eden. The difficulties occur between Bombala and Twofold Bay, and not between Bombala and Dalgety. There is a sudden drop of 2,000 feet, very similar to that between Canberra and Jervis Bay, but, in the latter case, the country is easier.",31
162,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The - distance is not as short.,31
163,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The distance is a little greater, and there are several leading ridges, of which advantage could be taken to ease the gradient. I admit it is not possible to construct a light line, and there must be some expense, considering the great drqp in a short distance of about 40 miles.

It seems to me that what was understood and intended by the words was that the territory over which we should have access to the sea should be Federal territory. In the Bil l introduced by the late Attorney General, it was proposed that access should be over a strip of country 30 miles wide; and my desire is that any such strip of country shall belong to, and be under the control of, the Commonwealth, and not one over which we have merely the right of road. Of course, there will be nothing to prevent the State Government passing over or using this strip of land; but there ought to be no question as to the rights of the Commonwealth to use it for what purposes it desired. In the course of the canvass „ on behalf of Yass-Canberra, a great deal was made of the statement that the New South Wales Government will be prepared to give, not only access to, but a portion of Jervis Bay to the Commonwealth.",31

166,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member who says "" hear, hear "" was one who made a statement to that effect; and a condition of the kind was stipulated by a senator who changed his vote in another place. The question was raised as to whether Jervis Bay is within 100 miles of Sydney; and it was found to be so. But I think the honourable member for Lang asked whether it was not quite competent for the Federal Government to acquire territory in any part of New South Wales, and he was told that it was so. I move That the words ""have access to the sea"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" shall include a line of access to and a seaport at Jervis Bay.""",32

This Parliament could refuse to go further if it considered the terms offered by New South Wales unsatisfactory. But the less definite we make our conditions now, the greater the probability of a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations. The Premier of New South Wales has publicly stated, since we chose the Yass-Canberra area, that his Government will act readily in the matter, and has satirically pledged himself to the granting of access to Jervis Bay. I take it that he would give us a right of way to the bay. We do not wish to obtain exclusive possession of territory between the Yass-Canberra district and Jervis Bay, so as to prevent the State from controlling and extending the communication between its metropolis and districts lying to the south. Nor do we need the whole of Jervis Bay. I understand that the State Government is willing to give us a frontage sufficient to enable us to deal with all possible traffic.

The route was fixed for a railway. He laid down a route, and allowed a margin of 15 miles on each side to provide for deviations. I should like to know if the promise of the Premier of New South Wales to give access to the sea has been officially communicated to the Government. It would not d'o for the Commonwealth to be dependent for access between its territory and the sea on a railway controlled by the State Government.

221,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That may be; but I prefer to stand by what I know. The suggestion that we should acquire access to the sea over a strip of territory 30 miles in width is, to my mind, absurd. Of what use would such an area be to us?",35

225,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so. The language 4 employed in the clause has been carefully considered, and since it has stood the test of two Parliaments, I hope that the honourable member will withdraw his amendment. If he cannot see his way to do so, I trust that the Committee will reject it.",35
226,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Angas) [5.39] - If access to the sea is to be gained by a surrender of territory, or a grant, as part of Federal territory, of a strip of land extending from the Capital to Jervis Bay, I think that that can be done without any violation of the Constitution. Although Jervis Bay may be within 100 miles of Sydney, there is nothing in the Constitution declaring that Federal territory may not be within that distance, provided that the Capitalitself is not. All that it provides is that the site in the Federal territory must be not less than 100 miles from Sydney. We can therefore get this land in the shape of a strip of territory, which may be a more efficacious way, but it opens up very difficult questions of sovereignty. If we get absolute sovereignty over that strip, the question will arise whether we can, under our power to pass laws exclusively for our territory, prevent citizens of the State passing to and fro over iti. That question !dbes not arise very largely in connection with a particular area of territory such as Washington, or a particular area such as Yass-Canberra, which one can always get round. But it might arise in the case of a long strip extending from the Capital to the sea. The Federal Government's exclusive power of dealing with that territory could not possibly, in my opinion, prevent citizens having proper access from' one side to the other, because the Constitution must be read as a whole, and a fundamental provision embodied in section 02 is that there Seat 0} Government must be perfect freedom of intercourse when the Tariff has been passed. section limits the power of the Commonwealth even in respect of its own territory. New South Wales, therefore, cannot suggest any difficulty in the wav of granting us a strip of territoiy from Yass-Canberra to the sea. We may also acquire something that is not sovereign. We may, for instance, get the power to construct a railway. The power given us in the Constitution is to construct railways with the consent of the States concernedI n America, however, Congress can construct railways for the purposes of Inter-State commerce. In that case, the construction of a railway is a public purpose. But if , as in our case, it is merely a permission given by a State or States, we must be careful not to rely on that exclusively, because what the .State can grant to the Commonwealth as a matter of right, it can afterwards repeal. If , however, a public purpose is involved, we can acquire the land in spite of a State. They can grant it, but we can acquire it compulsorily. If , however, a public purpose is not concerned, the act of the State ib giving us the right to construct a railway is not final, for the State can repeal what it can grant. I merely utter that as a word of caution. My opinion is that railway construction by consent is a public purpose, and that after construction the consent could not be withdrawn.. I the Government that in regard to that strip of land, what rights, not sovereign., we do get ought to be the subject of an agreement, and that that agreement should! be ratified by both Parliaments, because then, while the State may repeal its act if it likes, we can sue them on the rights granted, whether acted on or hot, and get an order from the High Court to enforce them. If , however, we have merely two Acts of Parliament, they would not be an agreement, and the repeal of one would frustrate the purpose of the other. On that point let me refer to the Northern Territory Act of South Australia. That is an Act surrendering the territory to the Commonwealth, and we have subsequently to pass nn Act accepting the surrender. It will be found that that Act is the adoption of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia, and no repeal by the Commonwealth or the State separately can possibly affect its terms.

228,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"-That is quite right, so long as the area is given over for the purposes of a Federal territory. That is final, but to express a case where the grant is not for that purpose, I use the term "" anything less than sovereignty."" The transfer of the territory is the transfer of the sovereign rights over it, and not of proprietary right's as against the people who have bought the land. I suggest, therefore, that if there is anything less than sovereign rights,'it may be expedient to have an agreement, so that the Parliaments may be subsequently bound, and any repeal of its Act by New South Wales-whic h is practically unthinkable-coul d not affect the rights granted to us at the time.",36

The technical points will afterwards, no douhf, be settled in the final' measure. This Bill deals with two or three broad principles. One is that there must be access to the sea. Whether that is to be by means of a strip of territory 15 miles wide, or in some other way, will be a question for the Government to negotiate with New South Wales, submitting the result to this Parliament. Another condition is that the territory must have a port.

If that is Federal exceedingly careful in that regard. territory I have no doubt that New South Wales ' will extend her .railway to the northern part of Jervis Bay, and she should have a right to do so. But she should not have any right to interfere with our complete power over the southern or southwestern part of the harbour, which we should mainly want, and which we should tap by a railway of our own. I do not mean'that New South Wales should' be deprived of any of her rights. _ Surely some form of agreement is possible by which her rights may be preserved, even if the harbour becomes absolutely Federal territory. The Minister said he did not think it was wise to fix any particular place, and that access might be taken to relate to Twofold Bay, but Twofold Bay is not to be compared with Jervis Bay. It is a nice little harbour, but it is not what I should conceive to be a harbour fit for a Federal city. If any area near Yass or Canberra, is'going to be the Federal Capital, Jervis Bav, and no other bay, must be the Federal port. I am sure that a ll parties will be well satisfied if the ComWe must monwealth can obtain a large portion, if not the whole, of Jervis Bay, with certain rights reserved to New South Wales. I do not wish to follow the honourable member for Angas into technical constitutionaldetails, although I have no doubt that his ideas are good. They usually are cleancut and sound, but we can deal with them later on. We should say to the Government : "" Make an agreement something in this fashion. We want two or three main points adhered to, and we want New South Wales to grant what we ask."" Later, we can look into every minute phase of the question from beginning to end. I sincerely hope that our rights to the harbour and frontage to the harbour will be unimpaired.  Committee is indebted to the honourable member for Gippsland for concentrating attention on this most important feature in connection with the Capital site. There is evidently a consensus of opinion that we must have access, and not merely a roadway, to the sea. We must not be in the hands of any particular State Parliament. We must also have a frontage to the sea, so that we can carry out our own works in our own way, without asking the leave of the State. If we look back a few months, we can see the necessity for being, At that time certain gentlemen, in spite of the Federal Customs Act, used their own police to take wire netting out of bond. History sometimes repeats itself. We should feel indebted to the honourable member for Gippsland for concentrating the Minister's attention on the necessity for having an agreement with the New South Wales Government, so that there may beno misunderstanding. Personally, I would prefer to see the provision introduced into this Bill , so that the State authorities cannot say afterwards, "" You made certain proposals, and now you come back and' ask for something more."" We should' have nothing short of full right of access to the sea, and a frontage to the sea sufficient for Commonwealth requirements. I do not say that we should take the whole of Jervis Bay, nor do I think that the' honourable member for Gippsland meant that. There is rio reason to specify 15miles as the width of the strip of territorv between the site and the sea. We should have sufficient room to get to the sea. independently of the State, and a right lines. at the sea to do whatever is necessary in connection with the future arrangements of the Commonwealth, without any fear of ing challenge by any Parliament, whether the present Parliament of New South Wales, or one elected witbin the next ten, twenty, or fifty years.

There was a strong out of element in favour of another site; and of honourable members who favour it will always be in the position to control any contemplated expenditure, if what I call fair play is not observed. Access to the sea would not be sufficient in itself, because certain facilities must be afforded which honourable members will realise are indispensable. For instance, as one in favour of an Australian Navy, I can see that we must have a large area for docks and other works; but, in the meantime, I am of opinion that it is not necessary to have more than, perhaps, a strip of land twenty chains wide from the Federal Capital to the sea. As I have already indicated, I am quite willing to abide by the decision of Parliament, but if , in the future the just rights of the Commonwealth are endangered, there is ample power retained in the hands of honourable members to refuse to vote amy money for the construction of any building, or for the preparation of the site for any purpose whatever.",38

I think that the Minister of Home Affairs has demonstrated that the wording of the Bill is the best that the legal advisers of the Government could submit. _ Tn my opinion., the drafting of the previous^ Bill expresses completely the views and desires we have on this occasion. I admit that the lawyers are just about as clear as the laymen are on this subject. The lawyers are in the greatest difficulty as to what are respectively the powers of the State and the Commonwealth.",39
271,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Exactly .,40
272,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But if a subject is to be one of agreement, a Bill had better be left in a broad general form, as on the present occasion. We can do more by agreement than by making - anv definite stipulation in a Bill of this kind. It has been suggested that we only want a strip of territory from the Federal Capital to the sea. It may be absolutely necessary to have, as a preliminary, about fifty miles of territory surveyed in order to ascertain the best route for the railway; and it is just as well that the State of New South Wales should know our views on this matter. I understand that this is a difficult country, and it may be necessary to have a considerable grant of land in order to make the necessary surveys and ascertain the easiest way to get over the difficult country. And it may be necessary not to bind ourselves down to a particular route until it has been surveyed. We desire a general grant for a survey, in order to get the best line of railway at. the cheapest cost. The people of the State would not wish the Commonwealth to waste their money, and that of the other States, by following an unnecessarily expensive route.",40
273,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Surely , if they give a line of access, it will be the possible ?",40
274,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think so. However, this is a matter to be settled by agreement. I think, too, that the State Government should favourably consider a proposal to give us frontage to Jervis Bay, 100-miles limit if necessary, the grant to be sanctioned by legislation by the Parliao ments of both New South Wales and the Parliament. Commonwealth, so that it may be binding for all future time. Mr .FRAZER (Kalgoorlie) [6.13] Whilst we all agree that we should come to an amicable agreement with New South Wales for the transference of territory be subsequently controlled by the monwealth, there are some of us who think that, as we need to obtain possession Jervis Bay, or of a part of it, that desire should be expressed in the Bill. # Mr JOHNSON.:-The Constitution gives us power only to acquire territory.",40
275,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable memwas no port. ber's disinclination to make mention of our wish to acquire some portion of Jervis might tend to create suspicion as to genuineness in this matter. The tion is not concerned, since we are making arrangements now merely for negotiations. The prospect of acquiring Jervis Bay, dr a portion of it, largely induced some honourable members to vote for the Yass-Canberra site. Why, then, should we not say in the Bill that we desire access to the sea at a place where accommodation can be made for shipping? Why should we not mention our desire for a port, as well as our desire for access to the sea, and for a certain area? If honourable members professed opposition to the desire for a port, their position could be more easily understood.",40
276,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We are in favour of the Commonwealth having a port.,40
277,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is it desirable that the Commonwealth should have access to the sea at a place where there is no port?,40
278,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No . We are willing that the Commonwealth sliould obtain part of the frontage to Jervis Bay.,40
279,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then why not sav so in the Bill?,40
280,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is no need to do so.,40
281,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We should take the op-"" portunity to make a clear statement of the wishes of the majority in the matter, so us that the parties to the negotiations may be best thoroughly conversant with them.",40
282,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member desires to tie the hands of those who are to conduct the negotiations.,40
283,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I would be prepared to prevent negotiations for access to the sea within the where there is no port.,40
284,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,A proposal to accept such access would not be listened to by,40
285,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think that it would. As we desire a particular port, why not say so in the Bill ? On an earlier clause, honourable members were anxious to prevent Dalgety from being further conto sidered, and I accepted the reasoning of Comthe honourable member for North Sydney.",40
286,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The wording of of this Bill is similar to that of the Bill providing for the negotiations in respect of the Dalgety site.,40
287,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We would not negotiate for access to the sea at a place where there,40

289,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We did not have a similar provision in the other Bill.,41
290,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is no reason why we should be unnecessarilv indefinite now.,41
291,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why this new found enthusiasm for a port?,41
292,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have always held the opinion that the Commonwealth territory should have access to a port, and wish now to provide for negotiations having in view the securing of one.",41
293,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does not my honourable friend trust the Ministers whom he supports ?,41
294,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; though, if we are to accept that line of argument, the whole Bill is unnecessary. We have stated the area which we desire, and the fact that we desire access to the sea. Why cannot we say also that we wish to have part of Jervis Bay?",41
295,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,A right-of-way pliedWe are using the language of the Constitution.,41
296,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Constitution does not say that the Commonwealth territory must have access to the sea.,41
297,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Such a right-of-way is implied.,41
298,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"T n my opinion, we should stipulate in the Bill for access to the sea at a certain place, and for frontage to a specified port.",41
299,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Gippsland) [6.24] - As regards the words ""have access to the sea"" being carefully"" considered in connection with previous measures, as suggested by .the Prime Minister, it is true they are used in the Act of 1904, but I believe they were not part of the original draft, but were inserted, in Committee by way of amendment.",41
300,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is so.,41
301,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable and learned member for Flinders and the honourable and learned member for Angas have asked what these words mean. I hold that we should have sovereign rights over a strip of territory leading from the Seat of Government to the sea, so that we can construct a railway or exercise other authority in regard to it without question. The honourable and learned member for Angas pointed out that such territory could be acquired by surrender on the part of the State Government or by agreement. The better way would be to acquire it by surrender on the part of the State Government; an agreement might become the subject for litigation in the High Court. If we secure the ownership of that territory, no question can arise as to the use to which we may put it ; but, at the same time, as the honourable member for Angas has pointed out, there will be nothing to prevent the people of New South Wales from passing over it. If the State is ready to give us access to the sea, it will be prepared to meet us by a survey of this territory without our going to the trouble of making an agreement. As to my contention in regard to Jervis Bay, I would remind the Committee that there is no reference to a port in the clause. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was asked why he did not raise this question when the Bill providing for the selection of Dalgety as the Seat of Government was before us. I venture to say that he probably shared the view which I entertained at the time, that there was no question as is im- to Twofold Bay being included with the Dalgety site. It was only in the course of a speech then made by the honourable member for Lang that any serious doubt in that regard occurred to me. The honourable member, on that occasion, referred to the advantages of Jervis Bay as a port, and when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie interjected, "" Will New South Wales give us Jervis Bay?"" he replied, "" I am not talking about our giving anything at present."" Later on, when I reminded the honourable member of what he had said, he interjected, "" Does the honourable member think that the Commonwealth is going to get Twofold Bav with Dalgety?"" I replied, "" Certainly.'"" ""Then,"" said he, "" the honourable member is altogether wrong."" That was the first time that any doubt was raised in my mind as to our securing Twofold Bay if Dalgety were selected. I then determined that if the Bill which the honourable member for Darling Downs had then introduced were proceeded with, I would move an amendment that would secure to us the right/of a seaport at Twofold Bay. If honourable members generally are in favour of our securing a seaport there, why should they object to the insertion of such a provision in the Bill? Is it not idle to say that the Minister knows what honourable members desire, and that it is consequently unnecessary to insert these words in the Bill? How is the honourable gentleman to know what our wishes are unless we express them in the Act of Parliament itself? We can do no harm by so amending the Bill as to provide that the Commonwealth shall have a line of access to, and a seaport' at, Jervis Bay. That would still leave open the whole question as to the terms of control. I agree with the honourable member for Hume .that the Commonwealth should have supreme control over the bay, and that the right of New South Wales in that regard should be a subordinate one.",41
302,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The State must have an outlet for its own territory.,42
303,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Exactly , but the Commonwealth must ha^'e the paramount control, unless it can be arranged that the Commonwealth ancl the State shall have equal rights. We must have control over Jervis Bay without any reference to the State, and we must have control over a strip o i territorv extending from the Capital to the sea. If honourable members share that view, I fail to see why Ave should not give effect to it in this Bill . The A'ery fact that objection is raised to our doing so leads me to think that it is not intended to give us that control. 1 agree with the vieAv expressed by the honourable member for Kal goorlie that the assurance we received that access would be giAen to Jervis Bay, and that Ave should haA'e a Federal seaport there, induced many honourable members to vote for the Yass-Canberra site Avho AA'ould otherwise have been opposed to it. I know, from what has been said to me by several honourable members, that that is so'.",42
304,Unknown,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to -7.45 p.m.,42
305,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Adelaide) [7.45] - A charming feature of the debate on the amendment which is worthy of more than passing notice is rhe Avonderful confidence displayed in the Government, so far as rh;s particular question is concerned, by every honourable member of the Opposition Avho has spoken.",42
306,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,-Why should we not display our confidence in the Minister? He has shoAvn his sincerity.,42
307,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so; but it is so remarkable that I am sure the honourable member will forgiA'e me for briefly calling attention to it. It ought to be placed on record that, in respect of a matter requiring the utmost delicacy in handling, the display of the greatest possible tact, and the exercise of much discretion, coupled Will broad statesmanship, every honourable member of the Opposition - notwithstandin g that on other and minor matters they exr>ress"" a want of confidence in the Government-ha s expressed a belief in the Ministry that is truly commendable. I have no doubt that the Government will be duly thankful, and AA'ill endeavour to rise, so to speak, to the occasion, and earn by Avork the commendation that they have received from the 1 Opposition, because of their present proposal, l t is small Avonder that in such circumstances the Government can vieAv with perfect equanimity an attack, from a member of the centre support, and can almost put it aside with an indifference that Would lead one to believe that the centre on this particular occasion, at any rate, is not further required. Small Avonder, too, that four members of the Ministry, Will great courage and in almost valiant manner, should have entered the lists against one of their immediate supporters. I refer to the Avay in which the Minister of Home Affairs, the At torney-General, and the Prime Minister himself entered the arena in opposition to the mild suggestion offered by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. As though that Avere not sufficient, the honorary Minister also entered the lists armed almost to the teeth with Aveapons in support of his colleague. Then', too, we found an ex-Prime Minister occupying a central seat, and vociferously cheering the Ministry, seeming to be ever ready to hold up his thumbs if one of his proteges for the time being happened to secure a fluky AA'in.",42
308,Mr COON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then the honourable member is very happy?,42
309,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I never have occasion to be otherwise than happy. I regard the amendment as quite unnecessary, unless indeed the Ministry are surrounded by an impenetrable misunderstanding of what the House really desires. There seems to be a consensus of opinion that Ave require an outlet at the seaboard. Consequently Ministers will be sadly misinterpreting the feeling of the House if , in their instructions to the survey party, they neglect to giA'e pointed effect to the desire that has been so pronouncedly expressed. This is merely a Bil l to instruct surveyors as to what they shall do in a particular area which is at present not too carefully defined, although it is perhaps sufficiently clear for surveyors, and' it AA'ould be unAvise if the Government misinterpreted the AAdsh of the House. It seems to me that the phrase "" access to the sea"" means something more than a mere bridle track, or a path doivn which the members of the Federal Parliament may surreptitiously, and in the dead of night, rush to the blue ocean, take a wetting, and return.",42
310,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,In single file.,43
311,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Apparentl y the Ministry are not accustomed to single rile, because four of them were arrayed just now in opposition to what was, after all, a mild suggestion from one of their supporters. .. I take it that these words mean something very different from the tracks by which the wreckers of old reached the sea.",43
312,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member does not suggest that the Ministry are going to be wreckers?,43
313,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am inclined to think that the wreckers just now were behind the Ministry urging them to fire the ball which they themselves were not prepared to use. The debate on this amendment will not be altogether wasted, since it has given the Ministry a clear indication of the desire of a number of honourable members that the words "" access to the sea"" shall include a reasonable road thereto, with suitable provision on the board. To my mind, it includes facilities for shipping, such as anchorage, reasonable navigation, wharfage, and access by railway-it includes, in short, the ordinary facilities of a port commensurate with the requirements of the Commonwealth.",43
314,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Sufficien t for a naval depfit.,43
315,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am sure that the honourable member will not ask me to go into all the details, although provision for a naval depot is very important. Another fact which has been brought out by the debate is that the general meaning which was attached to the words of those who were in favour of the Yass-Canberra site when the question was recently discussed has to be considerably modified, and modified in a way that I personally regret. We have it now in unmistakable terms that, so far as they are concerned, there is no intention that the Federal Government shall have control of the' whole of Jervis Bay. That appears to be clearly the view of honourable members of the Opposition who were specially prominent in their advocacy of the Yass-Canberra site. During the whole of the canvassing- I do not use the word in a harsh sense-for the selection of Yass-Canberra in preference to Dalgety, not a whisper was heard of any limitation of the right of the Commonwealth to control Jervis Bay. On the contrary, its many qualifications were pointedly referred to, and every statement, and every move made, tended to lead honourable members who were uncertain as to how they would finally vote to the conclusion that it was intended that the whole of Jervis Bay should be under the control of the Federal Government.",43
316,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Where is there any statement to bear that out?,43
317,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I quite admit that there may not be on record any definite statement to that effect.,43
318,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not think anything to the contrary has been implied by us.,43
319,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Was the impression conveyed that the whole of Jervis Bay was to be handed over?,43
320,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That impression was indelibly left on my mind. I admit to the Attorney-General that there is nothing in the attitude of the Government to show that they have given up hope of securing the whole of the bay, but I am dealing at present with the pointed statements of members of the Opposition who were enerseagetic and enthusiastic in their advocacy of the Yass-Canberra site.",43
321,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There were others quite as energetic.,43
322,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I will include the whole of those who spoke to me. There was no secrecy about the matter. It was very open work, and every, honourable member should be commended for the enthusiasm he displayed on that occasion. But. all over the building, in the various rooms to which we have access, conversations were going on in order'to induce honourable members who had previously voted for other sites to vote for Yass-Canberra. Those conversations were attended with success. During the whole of those negotiations, there was not one whisper to lead one to suppose that those working in that direction believed anything except that the Federal Government would control the whole of the bay.",43
323,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They may be able to get it now for all we know.,43
324,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hope they will, but I am justified in drawing attention to the modification now suggested of what was previously put before honourable members.",43
325,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,This is the first time that we have heard of any claim to the whole of the bay.,43
326,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is the first time that we have heard of .any modification of that claim. My knowledge of wharfage and shipping leads me to the conclusion that unless the Federal Government has the full charge of the bay, there will be endbest, less trouble, which will not reflect credit upon honourable members who agree to accept a partial control.",43
327,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable memHarbor. ber mean the whole of the foreshores ?,44
328,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I mean the whole the bay, with a reasonable distance back from the foreshore.",44
329,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is a frontage of miles.,44
330,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not know the actual extent of the bay, but the honourable member for Lang, who nominated Yasssouthern Canberra, in his attempts to persuade honhope orable members to his way of thinking, exhibited charts of Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay, and called attention to the difference in size, in the depth of water, and in the oossibilities for anchorage and wharfage, and spoke of the unlimited scqpe that we should have, not merely for a naval dep6t, but for naval manoeuvring. It was also stated that the Australian Squadron go now to Jerof vis Bay for target practice. We therefore led to believe, although not bythere specific words, that the whole of the bay, together with its foreshore, would be within the control of the Federal Governless ment. While I intend to vote against amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland, I wish to express to him my gratitude for initiating a debate which has given me an opportunity to express an phatic opinion on this point, and call at the negotiations. tention to the altered state of affairs, and at the same time to voice the hope that Government's instructions fo the surveyors will be of a character to secure the of the bay for Federal control. It was suggested by one honourable member that tion. the Federal Government should have the southern portion, leaving the northern under State control. Can any honourable member say which is the best part of the bay at the present time? Mr HENRY"" WILLIS - The southern part.",44
331,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My knowledge leads me to believe the contrary. I am not quite clear as to the extent of the seaway into the harbour, but the strongest winds come from the south and west, and, knowing reasonably well where the mouth of the bay is situated, I know that if a southerly westerly wind is blowing, the southern and western portion of the harbour may not Jervis Bay for shelter. necessarily be the best.",44
332,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It must be the because then it is the sheltered side.,44

335,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The entrance to the of Sydney Harbor is not nearly so wide as the entrance to Jervis Bay. Consequently, the effects of wind and sea inside the har200 bor may not be the same as those of wind and sea outside. The bay being so large, there is room for a considerable sea to get up, and it is quite possible that the portion may not be the safest. I that the Government will see that the whole of the harbour is included in the survey. After that will come the negotiations, and we, on one side, and the State Parliament on the other, will be able to decide whether the whole of it should be handed over to the Commonwealth. My vote will be given if I am still in Parliament in the direction of securing the whole the bay, apart altogether from the were question of which is the safer side. If is to be any kind of dual control, if there is to be a line where Federal control ends and State control begins, endtrouble will be caused, especially if the the temper of the New South Wales Parliament in the future is anything like it has been during the past seven years.

336,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Illawarra) [8.7] - The the contention of the honourable member for Adelaide that the southern portion of the whole bay is not protected from the heavy southerly winds, will not stand investigaI t must be apparent that when a"" southerly wind is blowing the southern portion of the Bay, which is immediately behind the land, is protected from the weather. The honourable member for Hume has had some experience in that regard, because on one famous occasion, he and a number of other members of Parliament struck a heavy southerly storm, and had to take shelter, not in the northern, but in the southern, portion of the bay. On different occasions, in the olden days, before there was railway communication to the south coast, I have been taken in heavy or southerly weather, when we could not land at Kiama, to the southern portion of The honourable member for Adelaide has made a good deal of the confidence which honourable members on this side are placing in the present Minister of Home Affairs, but, seeing that the Minister was one of the strongest opponents of the Yass-Canberra site, and an advocate for Dalgety, it would come with a very bad grace from us not to show the fullest confidence in him after his intimation this afternoon of what he is prepared to do. Personally, I have the fullest confidence that, in the interests of Australia, the Minister will use every endeavour to have the matter settled at the earliest moment, on the best terms that he can make for the Commonwealth consistently with the interests of New South Wales. I cannot understand the contention that the Commonwealth might endeavour to obtain the whole of Jervis Bay. I do not know what the feelings or intention of the New South Wales Government are, but, as a member of this Parliament, I am in favour of a Commonwealth harbour being established at that point. I have every sympathy with the amendment, and was prepared myself to move the insertion of the words '""' at Jervis Bay,"" but for the fact that such a proposal would not meet with the wishes of the Minister at the present time. I feel that the Government ought to have the fullest scope in the inevitable negotiations; and, as the Minister of Home Affairs is in earnest, I am not inclined to limit him in any way. I hope that the honourable member for Gippsland will come to the same determination.",44

Ab the same time, all the requirements of the Federal Government must be met, and so long as we have sufficient area for docks, Customs House, and so forth, we can ask for nothing more. The State and the Commonwealth will be as two partners; but I take it for granted that the Commonwealth will be the predominant partner.

If there is an Australian Party it is the Labour Party; and so strong is their Australian sentiment that they have been accused of favouring unification. I ask honourable members to give an absolutely free hand to the present Minister in carrying on the negotiations on behalf of the Commonwealth, because I am sure the right honourable gentleman will safeguard Australian interests.

The honourable member for Adelaide said that the Alinister quite understood what the desire of the House is, and, therefore. I cannot see why we should not accept the amendment. The honourable member for Robertson stated that if we had access to the sea, the land there would not be our property, but we should be, as it were, tenants at will. I do not take that view of the question, because I think that, if we have access to the sea, the territory must be our own. I know of a case in which a State gave a company the right to construct a railway line, ana when the State wished to run a line across, the company refused permission. We do not desire anything of that sort as between the Commonwealth ancl a State; and, therefore, there ought to he a clear understanding of the position. We have no proof before us that the Premier of New South Wales has made the statements attributed to him. I hope that the honourable member for Gippsland will persist with his amendment, and thus ascertain how many honourable members are in favour of access to the sea, and a port at Jervis BayAir. THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [8.25]. - On previous occasions I have opposed the idea that special provision sbould be made for access to ine sea from the Commonwealth Capital. I consider the Commonwealth to be supreme, and to have right of access to any port in Australia. Without such a right, it could not discharge its functions, or adequately did not protect the interests of the people. But those vvho ask that we should claim specifically right of access to a certain port have some show of reason for doing so. New South Wales has not dealt so liberally with the Commonwealth as she might have done. Her public men and newspapers have critimore cised Federal institutions arid this Parliament in such a manner as to make it appear necessary to safeguard Commonwealth rights in this matter. Those who do not know the true views of the people of the State fail to realise that the speeches and actions which they regard as hostile are part of a political purpose, directed against a party, and do not express the hostility of the State to the Commonwealth. The present Government of New South Wales is prepared to treat us generously_ All that we are now being asked to do is to pass a Bill to sanction negotiations between the Commonwealth and the State. When they are concluded, Parliament will be asked to express its opinion in regard to terms and conditions submitted to it , relating to the location and area of the territory, its access to the sea, and the provision of harbour accommodation. The Government will take all steps necessary to preserve the interests of the Commonwealth without doing injustice to the State chiefly concerned, and nothing will be gained requiring now that Jervis Bay shall ceded.",46
352,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the Committee refuses to insert a provision requiring the cession business. of Jervis Bay, or part of it, may not the New South Wales Government say that we do not desire that?",47
353,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That may discussion happen if the honourable member for Gippsous land is unwise enough to press his amendhonorable ment to a division. I have stated opinion that the Commonwealth has an herent right of access to every port in tralia, but have intimated that I am prebers. pared to meet the wishes of the honourable member for Gippsland in asking that negotiations shall be entered upon to secure access to Jervis Bay from the Federal terriclaration tory, and a frontage on'that harbour. Still, I will not vote against the Ministry. action in voting against the amendment might be regarded as evidence that I_ think that the Commonwealth does not need what the„honourable member asks for. Therefore, I tajke this opportunity to state publicly that I wish to see a frontage to Jervis Bay ceded to the Commonwealth, and shall by rail. do what I can to secure the cession, but that I wish to leave the Government free to negotiate in the matter with the Governmittee ment of New South Wales. The honorcause able member will be ill-advised to push this proposal to a division, in view of the fact that the expression of opinion which he has obtained from honourable members has been generally favourable to his posiin tion, and that the defeat of his amendment is likely to create misinterpretation.",47

356,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Such an incident is not likely to recur. The debates on question must have cost nearly as much as it would take to build the Federal Capital.

358,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Not necessarily.,47
359,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The rejection of the amendment may, without a specific deto the contrary, be regarded as the expression of the opinion that we do My not consider access from the Commonwealth territory to Jervis Bay needful. We wish to have such access, but Ministers desire that their hands shall not be tied in the conduct of negotiations, and to do all we can to prevent further irritation.",47
360,Mr HEDGES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What we need is access,47
361,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We need access to the sea at Jervis Bay. I appeal to the Comto come to a decision at once, bewe have a: good deal of business to do, and not much time in which to do it.",47
362,Mr DEAKI N,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Ballarat) [8.40] - The position we have reached is an extraordinary one. The House is unanimously favour of our obtaining access to the sea, and almost entirely in favour of our having, on reaching it, the use of a. seaport which will permit of a proper deof Commonwealth naval interests that there. We are now asked to agree to an a amiendment that, it is true, clearly expresses that desire, but which, as the Minof ister has pointed out, would impose upon him an obligation that might seriously interfere with his negotiations with the GoSome vernment of New South Wa'es. Consequently, those who favour both propositions cut as to access and port are placed in this dilemma-that they must either vote for the amendment, believing that it might the success of the negotiations, or they must vote against it in form, although they endorse it in substance. My honorthis able friend, the member for Gippsland, is, of course, in this matter the sole judge of his own course of conduct. We all feel not the embarrassment of the position. Havor ing to choose between the two evils, after the Ministerial statement, I shall feel justified in voting against making an amendment in terms which I believe ought to be acted upon.

363,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Kalgoorlie) [8.50] - I should like the Minister of Home Affairs to explain the necessity for this clause. I understand from the statement made by him this afternoon that the Bill is designed to authorize a survey of land in New South Wales in order that we may ascertain the territory proper to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. Under subclause 1 of clause '5, power is taken to enter upon land for the purpose of any sur... 49 vey, with that object in view, and, under sub-clause 2, provision is made for the payment of compensation for damage done. That being so, if this Bill is designed merely to authorize certain surveys, and a AVES. further measure must be introduced and passed before the territory can be actually acquired,, why it is necessary to take power under this clause to pay for lands?",48
364,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The clause is merely a warning against land speculation.,48
365,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is only to fix values.,48
366,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Will the Attorney General tell me that the clause is not designed to do something more than fix the value at which the land shall be acquired? Does it not make it possible for the Government to take over all the land to be acquired for the purposes of the Capital without any further reference to Parliament ? Mr HUGHES.""-The clause will bar persons who hold this land from obtaining anything more than was its value on the 8th October, 1908.",48
367,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I agree that it is reaNOES. sonable that land speculators should not be encouraged to take advantage of the increased values that will accrue to land in the district as the result of the Commonwealth proposing to establish the Capital there; but this clause goes much further. It will empower the Commonwealth GoPAIRS. vernment, under the Lands Acquisition Act, to acquire all the land that is required for the purposes of the Capital.",48
368,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It applies only to land to be acquired or to be granted-it refers to the future.,48
369,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will the honourable member say that the meaning of the clause is that the territory cannot be acquired until a further measure dealing with the matter has been passed by this Parliament?,48
370,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The territory has, first of all, to be. defined.",48
371,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have no doubt that the object of the Bill is most admirable, but some of its provisions are ambiguous and others exceed altogether the powers that are sought to be conferred. 1 do not want us to find ourselves at some future date in the position of having!, without the authority of Parliament being secured,, incurred an obligation in connection with the lands which it is proposed to acquire for Commonwealth Durnoses.",48
372,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.56] - Referenc e is made in clause 4 to the extent of the territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. Clause 5 makes provision for' the necessary survey. Clause 6 determines the basis upon which compensation shall be paid in respect of land which after the survey and after the grant or acquisition, is required by the Commonwealth. Without that clause, the compensation to be paid in the future would have to be based on the value of the land at the date when it was taken, or there would have to be a retrospective provision, which would be declared to be unfair to the land-holders.",49
373,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"New England) [8.57] I recently visited this site, and the one question put to me by the fortunate or unfortunate land-holders in the vicinity was as to what valuation the Commonwealth would give them if it took their land. There has been a decided move in the direction of land speculation there. We ought to consider the people who will be interested in the matter by passing some such clause as this. I am pleased that it appears in the Bill as an indication of our intentions, for the information of people who may buv or sell land in the district, and as a safeguard to the Commonwealth against having to pay exorbitant prices.

374,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Lang) [9] - If the present occupants of the Treasury bench had still retained the position that they occupied a little over a fortnight ago they would have been amongst the most ardent advocates of the submission to the House of the recent Papuan appointments before they were actually made. That accession to office and Ministerial responsibility apparently makes a lot of difference is shown very markedly in the changed attitude of Ministers towards this question. Several of the members of the Labour Party, if any other Government had attempted to make these appointments, would have been most clamorous in insisting upon Parliament being first consulted. Now they sit absolutely dumb. If the principle of the House having the right of endorsement of appointments was a good one when another Government was in office, it is no less right ancl proper with the present Government in office.",49
375,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Order ! I have repeatedly called honourable members to order for conversing in loud tones. It is difficult and trying for me to have to be continually reminding honourable members of what is due to the honourable member who is addressing the Chair. I would ask honourable members to try to. conduct their conversations in less audible tones.,49
376,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It would have been fair and proper for the present Government to honour the promise of the ex-Prime Minister, that no appointment of an Administrator or Lieutenant-Governor of Papua would be made without the names being first submitted to the House. That promise was made at the request of some of the members of the Labour Party in the first instance. It has been repeated on several occasions since-the last time quite recently. As shown on page 1140 of Hansard, vol. 31 of 1906, Mr Wilkinson, who at that time sat in the Labour comer, askedCan the Prime Minister assure the House that lie wiil defer the making of appointments to the Executive and Legislative Councils of Papua, and will not fill the Lieutenant-Governorship until the House has had an opportunity to discuss the motion moved by me on Thursday last, and made an Order of the Day for 26th July? and the late Prime Minister repliedNot knowing exactly why the honourable member prefers this request in regard to appointments to the Legislative Council of Papua, I S'hall be glad if he will submit his reasons to me in private. I have already undertaken that no appointments to the Public Service of the Territory shall be made until the House has had an opportunity to discuss the subject. That opportunity may be afforded by the introduction of the Estimates before the honourable member's motion is disposed of, but, in any case, honourable members will be able to express their views on the matter before any appointments are made. The last reference to this matter was made on 2ist May of the present year, towards the close of last session, when the ex-Prime Minister, again in answer to a question put by another member of the Labour Party, reiterated his former statement, addedI hope that an Administrator will be appointed three or four months hence, and Parliament is not likely then to be in recess. That was a confirmation of his previous promise that no appointments would be made until they had been first submitted ro Parliament.",49
377,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The ex-Prime Minister did not make such a promise. He did not promise to submit the names to the House.,50
378,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"How can the Minister of External Affairs make such a statement in face of the distinct words that I haye quoted? He is trying by hair splitting to make white appear black, and vice versa. No other meaning can be read into the late Prime Minister's words than that he intended to submit certaini proposals to the House in reference to the appointments, and that he would not make them until the House had had an opportunity of expressing an opinion on his proposals. No man can read any other meaning into them unless he deliberately wants to pervert their obvious and clear intention. The Minister of External Affairs, if he had been sitting in his accustomed corner, would have been one of the first to insist on the House being consulted before the appointments were made. Yet Ministers have hardly taken the oath of office, and been introduced to their Departments, before there has been an almost indecent haste to make them. this? Had they anything to conceal? Were they afraid that the House would express an adverse opinion, or subject them to criticism?",50
379,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Judg e Murray was originally appointed witliout reference to the House.,50
380,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That may have been, but the ex-Prime Minister distinctly promised that no appointments would be made 10 these positions until the House had been consulted. If the late Government had remained in office the members of the Labour. Party would have been amongst the loudest in insisting upon their being submitted to the House before they were made. Mir. BATCHELOR - The honourable member is quite wrong, so far as I am concerned-it would be ridiculous for the House to attempt to make a selection.",50
381,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That was not the position taken up by the Minister, when members of his partu were making their re-iuests to the ex-Prime Minister. [97] and Mr HUGHES - Mr Staniforth Smith was not appointed in that wav.",50
382,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That has nothing to do with the point. It was convenient for the Labour Party at the time to have Mr Staniforth Smith, as a senator, out of their way. A distinct promise was made by the ex-Prime Minister, and is being ignored by the present Government. It is well known that there is a feeling, amongst a considerable section, if not » majority, that neither of these gentlemenshould be appointed. In the light of the report of the Royal Commission, there seems to have been every reason for avoiding the appointment of any person prominently concerned in the sectarian and faction fights which have done so much to bring the administration of Papua into disrepute.",50
383,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not think that either of these men was in the faction fights.,50
384,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Judg e Murray, if the reports which have reached us are true, was an acknowledged leader of one faction. I am not saying anything against that gentleman or his qualifications. I know nothing of either except from, hearsay, and my criticism is not directed against anv one personally,, but only from the point of view of the undesirability of appointing any person intimately associated with rival factions. It would have been much better to go outside and appoint an Administrator who had nothing to do with the contending Why is parties or their interests. It appears that one of the objects of the action of the present Government was to get out of a difficulty in the easiest way possible for themselves.",50
385,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the hororable member think that to discuss candidates for such offices is likelv to conduce to good government in Papua or elsewhere?,50
386,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall express no opinion on that point, unless the honourable gentleman desires me to give an exhaustive statement of my views. I know that Mr. Staniforth Smith was the candidate of the Labour Party for the position some time before that Party took office. I am under the impression that one of' the main reasons for his not offering himself for re-election as a senator was the understanding, expressed or implied, that he should have some such appointment. If there was no compact, there was something like a mutual understanding between himself and the Labour Party, and their allies in the Government, that a position of the kind was to be offered to him. Mr Smith has been qualifying himself so far as he can for the position, but, apparently, he could not be appointed without raising the question of what had to become of Judge Murray, for whom a position of equal importance had to be found. I am only surmising that that was the train of reasoning of the Labour Party, and, apparently they thought the best way was to give positions to both as nearly as possible alike in social and official status. I can find no warrant in the Constitution for two such appointments at one time. It is true that the Act is somewhat vague as to what is intended, though that is usual in the case of the Acts we pass in this Parliament. Section 10 of the Act charges the Lieutenant-Governor with the duty of administering the government of Papua on behalf of the Commonwealth; ancl yet the present Government appoint an Administrator. The Lieutenant-Governor is the Administrator according to the Act and his duties are speciallv set out in the Constitution. Section 13 of the Act, on which I suppose the Government have relied, provides that the Governor General may, by commission, appoint an. Administrator, who, during any vacancy in the office of Lieutenant-Governor, or when the Lieutenant-Governor is absent from the Colony, or unable by illness to perform his duties, shall administer the government; and throughout the Act all 'administrative duties are coupled with the name of the Lieutenant-Governor, except under the circumstances indicated. There is nothing to indicate that there should be at one and the same time a Lieutenant-Governor and an Administrator to perform the same duties.",50
387,Mr SPENCE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is not ""Lieutenant Governor "" to be read in the section as we read "" Governor General "" in our Acts, as meaning the Government?",51
388,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The positions axe not at all similar. In the case of Papua, the Lieutenant-Governor is an active factor in all the administrative affairs of the country, and is a responsible head, whereas in the Commonwealth the Prime Minister is responsible. In fact, I question very much the legality of the appointment of an Administrator as well as that of a Lieutenant-Governor except in the special circumstances provided by the Constitution Act when a vacancy occurs itii the office of Lieutenant-Governor, or when that gentleman) is absent from the Territory. The Act seems to me to provide for the appointment of an Administrator only in the event of a vacancy caused by the absence of the Lieutenant-Governor. Had the Estimates been brought forward earlier in the session, I should have moved a reduction in the vote. Indeed, I intended to say a good deal more about. the administration of Papuan affairs generally. But when I receive courtesy at the hands of Ministers, I am willing to show like consideration, and, therefore, although in asking last night that progress be reported, I made no definite promise to curtail my remarks today; I shall not now add anything further.",51
389,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Dalley) [9.28] - I am at a loss to understand the criticisms of honourable members. If they object, on the score of expense, to having both a Lieutenant-Governor and an Administrator, why do not they move to strike out one or other office? I am surprised that two capable men, as I know the officers filling these positions to be, are willing to locate themselves in Papua. I would not live there for all the tea in China. Judge Murray is a man of strong intellect, who belongs to a highly intelligent New South Wales family, he and his brother being men of considerable attainments.",51
390,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Physically , as well as intellectually.",51
391,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It has been alleged-al though I have no proof-that , as Judge, he interfered with the religious practices of certain persons, and some months ago certain papers were laid before me in connection with the matter. 1 thought, however, that the case made out was altogether too strong to be likely. As between Judge Murray and Mr Staniforth Smith, I think the former the right man to be Lieutenant Governor. I am not enamoured of the Administrator. As a senator, he took an interest in tropical affairs, and obtained the appointment of Director of Tropical Agriculture in Papua. But I do not like a man who tries to undermine another. If the ' Committee knew as much as I do, it would not be too keen about his appointment. I have waited to see what action honourable members would take; but they have not taken any.",51
392,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What action can we take?,51
393,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have waited to hear distinct charges agtoinst the Lieutenant Governor. If the charges which have been made against him privately can be proved, the Ministry should be castigated for appointing him, because, although they took over the unfinished work of the Deakin Administration, they were not bound to ratify its proposed appointments. To my mind, it is questionable whether the Territory is not over-officered, seeing that there are only about 700 white persons living there. What salaries are paid to the two officers in question?",51
394,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"-,£1,25 0 and £ 8 0 0 respectively.",52
395,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"£ 1 , 2 5 0 is not too much to pay a man who is willing to bury himself in Papua.",52
396,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But there is no need to have two men doing the same work.,52
397,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am ready to support an amendment to get rid of the Administrator if any honourable member will move it, and give good reasons for doing so. We have heard of so-called faction disputes, and i,t has been said) that Judge Murray took sides against one of the factions, and was interested, in a religious order established in the Territory. Some honourable members may think that I can be used as. an instrument against Judge Murray; but I do not attack a man because of his religious beliefs. When I read part of a letter written by the other officer, I said, "" The man who will write in that way to undermine a superior is not suitable for the position. "" I have waited anxiously to hear whether honourable members are in possession of facts to support opposition to this appointment.",52
398,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why does honourable member tell the Committee what he knows?,52
399,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have told the Committee in outline. My information is hearsay, and proof is needed. If no charge can be proved against Judge Murray, he is the right man to make Lieutenant-Govertoms nor. I know which I would select, had I minable. to choose between these officers. Personally, I do not see the need! for an Ada ministrator. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [9.36] In my opinion, the honourable member for Laing made good his> contention as to stationed there. the promise of the ex-Prime Minister that the House would be consulted before these appointments were made.",52
400,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I did not and it was not brought under mv notice:,52
401,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not consider is in force in Queensland. the honourable gentleman bound by it . I was a personal promise, and, I thought [97]- 2 the time, an unwise one, because I did not see how a legislative body could be consulted in regard to an administrative act. I do not know either of the gentlemen to whom reference is being made, but take it for granted that they are qualified for the positions which they hold. At any rate, Ministers are responsible for the appointments. I can understand that the peculiar conditions of Papua necessitate the appointment of an Administrator to take up the work of the Lieutenant-Governor when the latter is absent from head-quarters. As the Lieutenant-Governor is also Chief Justice, public business would be indefinitely suspended during his tours of inspection in districts remote from Port Moresby were not such provision made, because the Territory is practically without postal and telegraphic communication as understood here. As to the legality of the appointments, I express no opinion. In my view, the salaries paid to Papuan officers generally are altogether too small, compared with those paid to officers in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and the advantages which the latter enjoy. The best men can hardly be expected to bury themselves in an out-of-the-way country like Papua, in an extremely unhealthy tropical climate, for the amounts which are given. I understand that public servants are not required to stay in the Northern Territory for more than two or three years.  rangement, so fa r as the Commonwealth is concerned, but there may be a State regunot the lation on the subject.",52
402,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I was assured by a gentleman at Port Darwin fhat there was.,52

405,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The same system There is no t specific rule bearing on the subject, but at when a man has served a few years in the far-distant north he is entitled to be transferred to a district with a moderate climate. It rarely happens that an officer is kept in the far north against his will for a very long period. Now that the revenues of Papua are increasing, this matter might fairly be taken into consideration when next year's Estimates are being prepared, and substantial increases in salaries .granted.",52
406,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I propose to'look into the matter, and to compare the salaries received by the omcers there with those paid to men discharging corresponding duties on the mainland, with a view of seeing whether something cannot be done.",53
407,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am glad to have that assurance.,53
408,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We have already found that good men are leaving the service because of the salaries being insufficient.,53
409,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is most unfortunate, and it clearly indicates that the emoluments are not sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to command the services of the best men. With regard to permits for recruiting, I may say that I was misled by certain remarks made by the honourable member for Nepean, as well as by some interjections made during his speech. I was under the impression that under the amending Act it was possible for a man to receive a permit to recruit natives without taking them before a magistrate. Having investigated the matter, however, I find that it is perfectly clear that, as was stated by the honourable member for Ballarat, under no circumstances can a binding agreement be made without the sanction of a magistrate, who is charged with the duty of satisfying himself that the recruit 'thoroughly understands the engagement into which he is entering.",53
410,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is the recruit in a position to differentiate between what is, and what is not, a binding agreement ?",53
411,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are severe penalties for employing Papuans in certain industries without a permit, and unless that additional provision is most rigidly adhered to, there is great danger of the system becoming what an honourable member has described as a kind of veiled slavery. It is necessary not only that there should be no employment of natives without a proper official engagement, but that there should be a constant inspection of all indentured labour throughout the Possession, in order that the Government, which is, after all, responsible for the natives, shall be satis-, fied that they are being properly treated in their employment. In Queensland, in every district where Islanders were employed, there was an inspector, whose duty it was to see that the men received proper treatment in regard, not only to the supply of rations, but to their housing and general sanitary conditions. Notwithstanding what was said by an honourable member as to his dislike to indentured labour, I do not hesitate to say that it means labour officially sanctioned. It is the only system under which we can allow these men to be employed. If we have no official sanction of engagements, we shall have abuses. That has been our experience in Queensland. There no one is allowed to employ an - aboriginal coming within certain categories, without a permit. That practice has been followed with enormous advantage to both employers and employed. It should also obtain in Papuai. I presume that no native labour is employed there without proper sanction, and there should be constant inspection by Government officials, in order that no native may be imposed upon by an unscrupulous employer.",53
412,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I quite agree with the. honourable member. That system is being followed as far as possible, and will be continued.",53
413,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am delighted to have the assurance of the honourable member that there is a recently-constituted Native Labour Department, which certainly ought to undertake all these duties, and see that they are properly carried out, more especially as we know that at certain times there has been serious mortality among the natives. I have been in New Guinea, although I have not travelled there very extensively. I have also had a great deal of experience in connection with the native population of. the islands in the Torres Straits, as well as on the mainland. There it is estimated that we have something like 25,000 aborigines, whose conditions are very different from what they were a few years ago, in consequence, if I may say so, of legislation for which I was largely responsible. I have only one more remark to make, and that is in regard to some observations by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who appeared to be somewhat shocked at the suggestion that spheres of influence should be allotted to the various missions. That was found to 'be necessary in Queensland and the system has worked with admirable effect. It is rniost undesirable, in the interests of ""Christianity itself, that the natives, whether of Papua or of the mainland of Australia, should be brought face to face with the unfortunate contentions that constantly arise -'between various sections of the Christian ""Community. Such disputes are calculated to lower Christianity in the eyes .of those - whom it is desired to benefit, and it is by - no means edifying to have complaints of proselytising, as we have them made,. by - one section against another. - allotment of spheres of influence, such complaints are reduced to a minimum. So far from the system heing undesirable, I have had assurances from the heads of the various churches that have mission stations in Queensland that my action in allotting these spheres of influence throughout the Gulf of Carpentaria district and the Cape York Peninsula has been most beneficial. The most northerly part of Cape York is occupied by the Presbyterian Church, the missionaries of which are Moravians. They at first had a - station eta the Batavia River, which is not very far south from Cape York, om the Gulf of Carpentaria, - but it came to my knowledge, as Minister administering the aborigines Department of Queensland, that they desired - to extend tlieir missions to the south. 1 also learned that the Church of England desired to establish a. mission station on the Archer River, which is somewhat lower - clown the coast. I refused permission in .the latter case, believing that, as the Archer River was close to the Batavia, it should be occupied by the same church mission. The - Church of England mission then went to the Mitchell River, and with the very best results. I think that there are now two Presbyterian stations immediately south of the Batavia River, one* on the Embley River, and one on the Archer River, - and that all are working harmoniously together. South of that again - come the missions of the Church of England on the Mitchell River, and the best possible relations exist between all these mission stations. .admitted by those in charge that these - happy relations could scarcely have existed had the missions been interlocked, so to - speak, with one another. It was pointed out to me by the Rev. Mr Say, the principal missionary in connection with the Presbyterian Church up there, that some little difficulties were constantly cropping up between mission stations of the same denomination. How much worse would be the situation if the closely adjacent missions belonged to different denominations? I do not know - what steps have been taken in regard to the missions in Papua in this respect, but I can assure the Committee that the system I have outlined has worked admirably in Queensland, and that, if it is not too late to introduce it in Papua, By the its adoption there will have the effect of preventing a great deal of that sectional and religious controversy, which it is veryundesirable to have brought immediately under the notice of the natives themselves.",53
414,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wentworth) [9.49] - I did not propose to take part in this discussion until what I may almost term a challenge was put to honourable members who held that some arrangement other than that which has been arrived at by the present Government should have been made with regard to the governorship of Papua. I have never canvassed this question, I hope, in any personal spirit, and I do not propose to do so now. The appointments have been made in direct contradiction of an understanding that was made with the House. I do not blame the present Minister for that, since he cannot be expected to keep a tally of all the undertakings given by his predecessor; but it is rather unfortunate that this occurrence has taken place. I wish to reiterate that my objection to the appointment of either Judge Murray or Mr. Staniforth Smith to the governorship of Papua rests upon a very serious basis. It rests upon the evidence of very important persons in the island that, however those gentlemen themselves might be acting, they were regarded in the Possession as the leaders of two rival factions, and that, if either were appointed to the supreme position, unrest would supervene in the Public Service there. I pointed out that in that Dependency we could not expect to get It is public officers working together with enthusiasm and co-operating properly, if there were appointed to the headship of the administration an officer who was the object of dislike and suspicion by a large section of the service. In the early part of this year the Bishop of New Guinea was seen by a representative of the Age newspaper, and in the Age of 7th Apri l appears the following account of the interviewThe Bishop, in the course of conversation yesterday, remarked that it was unfortunately the fact that the white population there is practically divided into two camp's, and the aspirants for the important position shortly to be filled are the acknowledged heads of these camps. Should either succeed in getting the appointment the cleavage of parties would most probably become still more marked, and however unjust it might be there would always be the suspicion of partisanship in the decision of ters in which the two camps were deeply interested. What is wanted, therefore, is a strong man who would have no local prejudices, and who would not from the start of his administration have to overcome the feeling that he was a partisan, but who might by tact and firmness be able to reconcile the differences which now exist, and which, if not removed, might easily operate to the detriment of the Commonwealth possession.",54
415,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What is the good of flogging the subject now ?,55
416,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I should not have done so, but for the express invitation extended to us to explain our position.",55
417,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,B y what honourable members ?,55
418,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I heard cheered by several honourable members the remark of the honourable member for Dalley that persons who have objected to the| appointments ought to have come forward and substantiated their objections. reasons I have given actuated me in the belief that the only proper course for the Government to adopt was to appoint some altogether new man to the position. I do not hold the present Government entirely responsible for the appointments, although they are responsible in a way. They have chosen to adopt the recommendation of their predecessors, who, with a commendable desire to be on both sides of the fence at once, have appointed two Governors for Papua. It is most unfortunate for the Territory that it should have two Governors, who are regarded by its inhabitants, on the evidence of no less a person than the Bishop, as the leaders of rival factions.",55
419,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Did the Bishop refer to those two? Perhaps he referred to Captain Barton.,55
420,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Captai n Barton had resigned some time previously, and there were only those two gentlemen.in the field*.",55
421,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Were they quarrelling, too?",55
422,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"So it was stated. I do not place the utmost reliance on all communications from the Possession, but all the information I have received is in the same direction.",55
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Do Ministers know that there is any friction between the two?,55
424,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There has been a certain amount of difference between them. I can remember a report by JudgeMurray on . Mr Staniforth Smith, absolving him from blame in connection with a certain land transaction, but only on the mat- ground that his entire inexperience of public administration mitigated his conduct. That was a somewhat ridiculous reflection to pass on a gentleman who had honourably served his_ countiy in the High Court of Parliament for a number of years.",55
425,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It was a most insulting remark.,55
426,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It was most insulting andi unjustifiable, as was subsequently shown. Here was a gentleman who had some experience, and who was appointed to a very high position in Papua, reflected upon irt this insulting way by another gentleman with whom he is now asked to act as a colleague. The thing is preposterous. Mr.. Staniforth Smith has had a larger experience in a way than Judge Murray has had ; certainly larger than Judge Murray had before he went to Papua. The time is past for canvassing the personal qualifications of the gentlemen who are filling these posiThe tions, but if the Government had wished to strike a blow at the efficiency of the Public Service of the Territory, they could not have done it"" more effectively than by appointing the heads of rival factions to pretend to act together in co-operation and amity at the head of the Service. I deplore, the. action taken. It is of no use now to do more, but the time will come when the House will see that a mistake has been made, and will take, I hope not too late, the good advice tendered by the Bishop of' Papua.",55
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"ParramattaV [10.2] - I also feel that some protest should be made against the action of the Government in making these appointments. I can well understand their hesitancy tc* cancel any arrangements which they found already matured on their advent to office, and there is perhaps some excuse for their action on that ground. But that is really the only excuse I can find for it . Themore one looks into it, and thinks over it,, the more one must regret the deplorable results that must follow. The question cannot rest satisfactorily where it is. We can-not divide responsibility for an important - administration of that kind, and it may - safely be predicted that sooner or later - trouble will arise from the appointments - which have been made. Every one knows that these two gentlemen have not been - working harmoniously together. So far as I am able to judge from reports which have come to hand from time to time, you might as well try to tie a cat and dog together asfeixpectthese gentlemen to work - in harmonious .relationship under existing 'Circumstances. It is well known that one has been trying to elbow the other out in order to make way for himself, and advance his own prospects. The Government have tried to please all parties by giving them an advance in status, salary, and .general emoluments. That is an easy way to settle difficulties if you shut your eyes to the ordinary working of human nature.",55
428,Mr HEDGES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why does not the honduties orable member do so ?,56
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Opposition at least has a duty to keep its eyes open, and not to shut them. I venture prediction that the arrangements which have been made will not prove satishe factory or in the interests of the Corrimonabout wealth and Papua. The Government, howgo ever, take the responsibility for them, I can but hope that they will work - as they should. But it will seem strange to any ordinary unbiased person to suppose that they either can or will. Both .gentlemen have been in frequent conflict with each other over serious matters of kind. administration, and every one knows those difficulties have been so acute phave been felt in this House.",56

Trope all may prove to be well for the sake of Papua, but I venture to say that Government are taking immense risks giving to the Territory practically two equal administrators.",56
433,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Administrator acts only when the Lieutenant-Governor is away.,56
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then he is paid £800 a year to be on the spot in case the other should be absent?,56
435,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is £800 a year too much in the honourable member's opinion for the second man there, who is also director of agriculture, doing the work he is doing?",56
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The question of salary does not enter into the matter so much as does the question of status. There cannot be two responsible Administrators of Papua. One must be supreme; the other must be entirely subordinate.,56
437,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The status is laid down in the Act. "" The Administrator acts only when the other man is away.",56
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What other have been allocated to Mr Staniforth Smith for this increased salary?,56
439,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nothin g else.,56
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is he supposed the to do nothing during the whole time that the Lieutenant-Governor is at home? Is really being paid £800 a year to lie the door-mat waiting for his chief to away to some distant part of the Kingand dom? If the chief Administrator stays out at home during the whole year doing his duty, Mr Staniforth Smith is to get £800 a year for doing absolutely nothing! of these That is the Minister's statement.",56
441,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is nothing of the It is a ridiculous statement. I that said he had nothing else to do as Adas to ministrator. He does not come in until the Lieutenant-Governor is absent, but he I still has his other duties as director of with' agriculture to perform.",56
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The sooner the of these two gentlemen are made perfectly clear to the House the better for all concerned. In the meantime it seems to be an easy way out of the difficulty, but it may prove to be only a temporary setthe tlement. I hope my prophecy will be wrong. I can conceive of no greater inhave justice, no worse calamity befalling the Territory, than the appointment of two temAdministrators with equal status, and with The more strictly we define the responsibility fer the the government of the Possession the more in likely are we to have efficient control. coI raise no question at all as to the salary, because, in my opinion, that should not stand in the way of efficient administration. I should say that £ 1 , 2 5 0 a year in Papua is equivalent to not much more than half that amount on the mainland of 1 Australia; and it is simply playing with language to say that such a salary is more than adequate for a man who is called upon to administer territory containing half-a-million of a native population. If we paid £ 3 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 , a year for the efficient government ""of the Possession, we would not be paying too much. Everything depends on the man and his qualifications. I am not traversing the qualifications of either of the gentlemen, though I regret exceedingly the way in which the appointments have been made. I should be glad to hear that there are some redeeming features in this compromise. The Government seem to have, effected it by promoting officers all round, and thus settling a difficulty which has, no doubt, done some injury to. Papua. hope that, in the future, the duties of the two gentlemen named may be definitely allocated, and that the Government will furnish Parliament with a statement on the subject, so that we may know exactly what is proceeding.",56
443,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Nepean) [10.14] - Las t year we voted an additional £ 5 , 0 0 0 towards the future development of Papua, and I understood that that vote was to continue for two or three years. This money was spent principally in opening up roads and in survey work; and I should like to know why the vote has been dropped in the Estimates before us. Has the increase in the revenue made the vote unnecessary?",57
444,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.15] - This was a special vote last year for roads. The money was sufficient to do the work essential then, and I think it may be necessary next year to have a similar vote. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [10.16] - I wish to point out the extraordinary fact that the exact sum appropriated has been spent. That, I venture to say, has not occurred in the case of any other public works in the Commonwealth.",57
445,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It shows magnificent administration 1 Mr JOSE PH COOK - It does, and something more, I think. It shows either that there is need for further expenditure, or that the money has been used anyhow for some other purposes.",57

448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then why is there no vote this year? May I suggest that it looks as if this were one of the 0 0 0 votes which could be conveniently dropped so as to square the ledger in the way it was squared by the late Treasurer?,57
449,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There may have been an increase of revenue, and the money may have been used in general works. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Surely not so, unless the money has been specially appropriated by the House. The Prime Minister does not suggest that money can be used in Papua without its being taken account of in the Estimates? I Mr BATCHELOR - As a matter of fact., the monev is not all spent yet.",57
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Are we to understand that no more money is required 1 j ust now ?,57

453,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Practically .,57
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Well , that is asatisfactory answer, but I think a great deal more is required for development, in view of the large quantity of land which, according to the late Prime Minister, has been acquired for agricultural purposes. When agriculture is undertaken, there must be development in the way of roads, bridges, and other appurtenances of a civilized comniunity.",57
455,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There must be considerably more expenditure as the development proceeds. Mr JOSE PH COOK - We are told that last year's vote is not all actually expended ; and if it suffices to carry on the work this year, that is a satisfactorv explanation. I should like to see a course of steady development pursued; and, as I have always done, I hope it will have reference to the well-being of the nativesfirstly and chiefly, and next to the interests of such white people as can undertake developmental work with advantage to the natives and to themselves.

457,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.20] - The additional amount is required in consequence of the contract which began last November.

460,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"1 do not wish to see the amount reduced, if the Minister can show that there is some definite system of expenditure in a business-like way. In the past, this vote has been a source of considerable anxiety to members of the Opposition, ano of slight irregularity on the part of the Government. One of the results is that newspaper articles on Papua paid for out of the fund provided for advertising Australia. I do not, of course, expect the present Minister to be conversant with all the facts, but I understand that during the last financial year an article on New Guinea - was bought from a political pressman in Australia, and I hardly think that that can be regarded as advertising our resources.",58

468,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"HoAvever , such has been the practice; and I merely ask the Minister to insist on some system in the expenditure of this money. It is undesirable that political writers should be giA'en little amounts for advertising Australia. If any prizes are to be held out to the journalistic profession, they ought to be by tender; gentlemen Avho haA'e the advantage of making their talents knoAvn to members of the Ministry ought not to receiA'e this sort of commission, and I hope the practice will cease.

470,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No ; I think it was only common gratitude to come to the rescue of the political reputation of the man Avho had given him the commission; but it is not the right that the funds of the country should be put to this use.

Those are the main items. It is not likely that the expenditure during the remaining months of the financial year will be larger than the expenditure to date. Of course, any one can waste money, especially in advertising; but I think it will be impossible for the Department to prepare, before the end of. the nnancial year, a scheme for the judicious advertising of our resources and potentialities which will absorb £15,000 during the next six months.",58

475,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes . Honourable members will agree that we should not launch out too largely until we have decided upon a definite scheme of advertising. Once we have done that, we should continue our efforts systematically. I have not yet had an opportunity to go carefully into the matter, but shall do so during the recess.

I do not wish to delay the Committee, but, having learned for myself how little the people in the Old Land know of 11s, I feel very strongly upon this question. I am not in favour of any systems under which immigration would be forced, but I should certainly favour letting the people of the Old World know what we are and what our country is like, believing that if we do so many of them will voluntarily come to Australia.",60
490,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member think that they would come out here readily if they knew what we were?,60
491,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do. I consider that Australia is the finest country in the world, offering scope for men of enterprise and grit, and that many people in the Old Country will readily come here when they axe made acquainted with its possibilities. As it is, it seems to me that at present people are sometimes induced or persuaded to come here almost against their will. They are told that they will find employment as soon as they land, and they often come here only to be disappointed. We should advertise the CommonAvealth in a wav that will allow people in the Old World to judge for themselves of the scope which it offers for their enterprise, and to come here' voluntarily, instead of being practically forced to emigrate.",60
492,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Robertson) £10.42] - I am pleased to hear that the late Treasurer is in faA'our of spending some money in an effort to advertise Australia in the Old World, because it has come to my knoAvledge that the present GoA'ernment intend to expend A'ery little of the proposed vote.",60
493,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We guarantee spend more than the late Government haA'e done in this direction.,60
494,Mr HENRY WTLLTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They do not appear to have spent much. Judging by remarks that have been made, it would seem that their neglect in this respect meets Will the approval of a good many honourable members, and that the present Government will have the support of many in this Committee if they spend even less on adA'ertising Australia than their predecessors have done. I am satisfied, howeA'er, that it is the wish of the people that Australia should be advertised largely in the Old World. We are told that the publication of news cablegrams from Australia in the English neAvspapers Would do much to adA-ertise the' CommonAvealth, but that the Minister does not hope to be able to spend, during the present financial year, the Avhole of the £20,000 proposed to be devoted to this purpose, since he will require time to formulate a scheme. An expenditure of even £50,000 in this direction Would, in my opinion, be inadequate. We cannot hope to stimulate immigration to Australia by intimating that only people with money are welcome to our shores. Those who come here with money, as a rule, do not Avant work; they desire billets Avhere the work is put out. That is the class of men now being brought to Australia. I have had intervieAvs with many of them, and so can speak with some confidence. In the old days, men Avho Avere willing and anxious to Avork were brought out here. They had little money, but gained a lot of experience, and today some of them are governing Australia,. Honourable members now on the Treasury bench are men of enterprise, originality, and grit, Avho came out here poor but industrious, and haA'e risen to the highest positions in the CommonAvealth. Could we haA'e a better class of men coming to Australia? The ex-Treasurer appears to be far more in earnest Will regard to this question than he has ever been. I haA'e recently heard him pointing out that when in England a year or tAvo ago he found that Australia ""was little known there, and I hope that he wiil take this matter in hand. I trust that some one who is anxious to advance Australia, and is not merely, looking for men with money to come to our shores, will be at the head of the Government of the Commonwealth. What Ave need is the introduction of men who will work Avhen to they come here-me n who, like our forefathers have done, will seek to continue to create wealth. It is idle to talk about putting immigrants on the land if they have no money with which to work it. We need immigrants of the type of the Scotchman, Avho, although he had some funds, would not invest them in Australia until he had gained some experience - of the country by working for a living here. If the Government will push forward a policy such as I have outlined, I shall be loath to vote against them. We need to encourage immigrants who are prepared to do something for the country. If the Government put forward a progressive immigration policy- a policy of spending money to adequately advertise Australia-the y will sweep the polls.",60
495,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is what we want to do.,61
496,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; the honourable member's party favour a short sighted policy. They think that the workers are afraid of competition. I have never met a working man who was afraid to meet another in his own line of business. It is only the dullard, the man who will not work, who objects to any more labour coming here. If the Government bring forward such a policy as I have indicated, they cannot be put out of office. How could we oppose the Government if they brought forward our policy? But what they tell us now is that they will do their best to formulate a scheme, and in the meantime will not spend any money. We must oppose them if they indulge in that kind of talk. The Government should set to work to spend judiciously the sum devoted to the advertisement of Australia, and if they are not willing to do that should allow the ex-Treasurer to come into office again, and do the work. The honourable member for Parramatta would show them how to attract immigrants. He is in Sympathy with labour, and would encourage working men from Great Britain to build homes for themselves in Australia. He would perpetuate the traditions of the race, and make the colonization of Australia a reality. He would look upon the working men of Great Britain as brothers, whom it was desirable to attract to this garden of Eden. If the present Government will not adopt some such policy we must tum them out; but if they will reconsider the subject, and spend the money wisely, we will allow them to remain where they are for the present.",61
497,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bass) [10.54] - It may be well to spend money on the advertising of Australia if we are to get some profit out of it. but provision should' certainly be made for immigrants wben they land in this country. It is all very well for the honourable member for Robertson to compare the working men of the present dav - with those of a former generation, but I have known working men who were quite willing to work, but who, on coming ta Australia, were unfortunately forced toreturn to the Old Country, or to go to Canada. I have had to assist men of that kind.",61
498,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member is not stating the case properly.,61
499,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think that that is a proper remark for the honourable member to make. I object to his casting a reflection upon me. I have not stated anything that is not true, and I ask that the honourable member shall withdraw the remark that I did not state the case properly.",61
500,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am sure that the honourable member will withdraw the remark if it was offensive.,61
501,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When I said that the honourable member was not stating the case properly, I meant that he was not stating the case for labour in the broad sense. There may be individual cases of men who have been unable to get a livingon landing in Australia. I do not doubt the honourable member's statement that hehas assisted such people. I make no reflection upon him.",61
502,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have known several) cases of immigrants who could not get a. living in this country. They were honest, hard working people. I know of a casein Victoria where a man and his wife cameout, and could not get work. The manwent to Canada, whilst his wife remainecV here, and earned her own living, keeping the family until the husband could send foi1 her. She repaid the money they had to' borrow before she went to her husband, and did this out of her earnings. I am. sorry that such things should occur in Australia, but we must state the facts straightforwardly, so that we may meet them. AVe should be doing wrong to encourageworking men to leave situations in the Old' Country unless we could be sure of their earning a living in Australia.",61
503,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member say that there is a smaller opportunity of earning a living ini Australia than in the Old Country?,61
504,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are all the elements for building up a prosperous country here, but the States have been badly governed in the past, and there are thousands of people in Australia today who are crying out for small selections, and can,not get them. The evil requires to beremedied in some way or other. charitable people have had to assist immigrants who were unable to find work.",61

I resent the suggestion of the honourable member for Robertson, that the working people are an inferior class now to what they were some years ago. The majority of working men in Australia are willing to work if they can get employment. There are in all classesamongst mechanics, members of Parliament, and labouring men-som e who are not too fond of work. But the majority are willing to do their best. I see that there is an increase of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 on these External Affairs Estimates as compared with last year's expenditure.",62
510,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The proposed expenditure is £ 8 , 0 0 0 less than that appropriated last year. The largest sum is £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for advertising purposes.",62
511,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On the other hand, there is to be less spent on sending Kanakas back to the islands, and there is no grant for sending people to look for the South Pole. Why are we spending two sums of monev on the investigation of tropical diseases? I should have thought that one vote would be sufficient.",62

513,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If we have an institution of our own, which is doing good work in the tropics, there is no necessity to contribute to an Imperial fund .",62
514,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The arrangement as to the Imperial fund was made before the Australian institution was established.,62
515,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is also an item of £ 5 2 5 for the Commonwealth Literary Fund. Last year £ 5 0 0 was voted for that purpose, but nothing was spent. I see no necessity for voting the money if we are not to spend anything. Many Mr BATCHELOR - The Committee expects to spend £ 4 6 8 this year.",62
516,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is an increase of £ 2 5 0 in the vote for the New Hebrides. We have had no explanation of that increase. A sum, of £ 5 0 0 is asked for the "" investigation as to the shearing of wet sheep."" What have we to do with that subject ?",62
517,Mr ROBERTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If a Commission can settle that, it will be important for both pastoralists and shearers.",62
518,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have no doubt these questions are all important for different people, but I would like to know how we come to deal with them. In a matter of that kind we might be interfering with State rights. Perhaps the Minister can give the Committee information on the various items to which I have referred?",62
519,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Dalley) [n.2] - The item cf £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth is more important than even the figures show. The Minister of External Affairs, whilst admitting that only a small sum was expended last year, pleaded for time during the recess to think out a better scheme in order to spend our money in a more effective manner. That opens up a very large question, and is an intimation from the Minister of the policy of the Labour Administration on the question of immigration. The resources of the Commonwealth must be advertised for some specific purpose, and that purpose is an invitation to the overflow of the population of the Old World to come to Australia. The object of the vote is progressive immigration. It is either that or nothing, as the honourable member for Parramatta suggests. The Minister has stated to the world that we must spend more money, ancl spend it more effectively, in order on ac- to attract more people to Australia, and that is evidence that he, as the mouthpiece of the Labour Administration, is in favour of an active and progressive immigration scheme. I am pleased to _ hear it. But the Minister is putting himself iri a dangerous position, because his announcement is at variance with the utterances of the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, the Trades Hal l party in Victoria, and others. If the Minister intends to effectively advertise the resources of the Commonwealth, and if his idea is to bring the right class of immigrants to Australia, he will have to ask for a larger sum than even that shown in this schedule. I shall not vote for spending a large amount in that direction, unless it is backed up by drastic legislation, that will have the effect of absorbing the people who come here. It is. of no use to employ the best channels, or novel channels, of advertising for the purpose of attracting people unless the various Governments of Australia are able to absorb them when they arrive here.",62
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We are absorbing thousands in our own State.,63
521,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We are not absorbing them. The only two classes of labour New South Wales can absorb today are the farmer with capital and the There are not thousands, but only hundreds, coming, and the limit of absorption has almost been reached, until there radical reform in Australian land legislation.

525,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Victoria , at any rate, not holding them. The big struggle of the near future will be on the question of whether the States or the Commonwealth are going to effect a reform in the land laws. I do not believe in flooding the cities with mechanics when those already to be found in it . here cannot find employment under present conditions, but I am broad-minded enough to believe that an island continent like cannot be held with safety by only Great 5,000,000 of people.

526,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What colour does the honourable member prefer? I do not prethat kind? tend to run with the two colours, as some honourable members do. A vote of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is only playing with this business, while an expenditure of £ 4 , 0 0 0 per num is simply a sop to certain journalists. That is not the way to spend the money in the interests of Australia. If we intend to try to attract population, we shall need to spend nearer £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, but that must be backed up by proper legislation to absorb the people when they come here. I am pleased that the Minister of External Affairs has intimated that the Labour Administration are in favour of encouraging immigration.",63
527,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It will be necessary to amend the immigration laws.,63
528,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am quite satisfied with that them as they stand. The people who can evade the Immigration Restriction Act are farm labourer. not wanted here. Mr - JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member for Brisbane simply meant that the is a present law is a deterrent.,63
529,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is no deterrent to the class of people that we require if it is administered. The Minister of i lExternal Affairs stated that the Standard Empire, the SMpping Index, and the Year-Book were being used as advertising What a splendid advertising medium the Shipping Index is ! What smart paragraphs we can expect to see in",63
530,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is the Shipping.,63
531,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It does not matter much which. Does the Minister think that that paper will reach the people in the provinces or the large cities of Great Britain to show them the resources of Australia ? is The honourable member for Wentworth referred to smart journals, but I do not think a. smart paragraph writer is required on the Shipping Annual. I do not suppose that much humour or novelty is at any time. In the same way, the Year-Book, which is our own production, is only useful for reours ference by men in public affairs in Britain, or by trading institutions. f we intend to advertise Australia in the Old Country we must adopt a more novel method. I saw a copy of the Standard of Empire a few weeks ago, and one item it contained related to the condition of a tramway at Essendon in Victoria. Does ? the Minister mean to tell me that it was not a waste of money to pay for an item of",63
532,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It was not paid for.,63
533,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It was forwarded by the representative of the newspaper as an item anof Australian news, and certainly he would not have been here if it had not beeri subpublic sidized with public funds.",63
534,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The news is not paid for directly.,64
535,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is paid for indirectly. No matter what party may be in power there is bound to be a party complexion given to their articles by journalists. The Fisher Administration will be coloured just as highly as was the Deakin Administration, ancl so it would be if the honourable member for Parramatta were Prime Minister. I do not want to see. a party complexion given to items of Australian news. But I do want to see a large sum voted on the Estimates with a view to the advertising being effectual. We are told ot the large sum which is voted by Canada for the purpose. If we want to compete with that country we cannot do so with a vote of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , of which only £ 4 , 0 0 0 is spent.",64
536,Mr WILSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We clo not want to adopt her methods either.,64
537,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Exactly . Surely we must have enough ingenuity in our midst to devise a more novel, system of advertising than Canada has done. I should like to see the money devoted to sending out persons to lecture.",64
538,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What is wrong with sending the Opposition Home and paying their expenses?,64
539,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If we make as much out of it as the honourable member did we shall do very well. It is time that the Opposition, as well as the honourable member, had a trip to the Old Country. He is a very capable writer, and is contributing to the press some articles on the people he met. think that I could contribute similar articles, but they would relate to persons in humbler walks of life. It will appear from this vote that we are seeking to attract immigrants from Great Britain. If it were backed up by a proper scheme or by progressive legislation in regard to land, I should vote £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the purpose. I am pleased to think that the Labour Ministry are not taking a n irrow view of the question. We certainly do require immigrants, and I trust that during the recess Ministers will be able to evolve a complete scheme.",64
540,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Kalgoorlie) [n..16] - It would seem from the speech of at least one honourable member to-night that our chief responsibility is to get rid of monev. If the Minister has acquired any information that it will not be possible within the financial vear to judiciously expend a vote of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on this purpose, he is justified in asking the Committee to vote an amount which he believes will meet the necessities of the case. I shall not subscribe for one moment to any proposal to expend money on advertising without regard to whether it is spait judiciously or not. I think that the Minister ought to be the best judge as to whether in the limited time at his disposal he could judiciously expend a sum of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . When he comes here, and deliberately proposes a reduction, I am prepared to concur in his view. In the main I agree with the position taken up by the honourable member for Dalley. I believe that it is endorsed by all labour adherents, whether inside or outside Parliament. We have no objection to desirable immigrants being brought here in any number, provided that consideration is first given within the country to the question of meeting their necessities on arrival. But we have a most emphatic objection to State Governments inviting persons, in some cases of a questionable character, to come to the country, and leaving them stranded immediately after arrival. Nothing is more calculated to seriously prejudice Australia in the eyes of old countries than for working men to come here, and find themselves without the means of getting a livelihood.",64
541,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What proportion of the people who have been so brought have been stranded?,64
542,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I cannot enter into the matter of proportion, nor could the honourable member do so, with any degree I of accuracy. Undoubtedly, we have evidence that several enthusiastic, but injudicious exponents of a policy of immigration have done considerable damage by overstating their case in the reports they have distributed to the people in other countries. Misled by advertisements into coming here, persons become discontented almost as soon as they arrive, and depart only to give a> very bad account of the country. That is not what we desire. I quite - agree that if facilities are made available for the utilization of our resources, and information is circulated! amongst the people of the Old World, in all probability a stream of desirable immigrants will, in no far distant time, turni towards Australia. But until that time arrives, what is the use of voting money which cannot be judiciously expended ? Surely our finances are not in such a state that we can afford to be throwing about £10,000 without getting some appreciable result from the expenditure? I feel disposed to support the proposal of the Minister. This "" Miscellaneous "" division of the Estimates is well named, because it includes a variety of items. One matter has been referred to by the honourable member for Bass, and that is the amount proposed to be expended in conducting investigations. I suppose that the vote of £200 for the investigation of tropical diseases is reasonable.",64
543,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is a five years' gation, nearly run out.",65
544,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And I take it that it is in addition to the sum we are contributing to a similar object in Queensland. Then there is the question of an annual payment of £200 to an agricultural institute at Rome, and I should like to know what result is anticipated. There is also the new item of £500 for the Imperial Institute.",65
545,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The character of that institute has changed very much lately. It is an investigation institute now.,65
546,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then perhaps we may be told what is to be investigated, because to me it seems to be a sort of political combination, possibly with a party complexion. I shall be glad if the Minister can give some information, but at present I feel inclined to move that the item be struck out. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT.

550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Parramatta) [11.27] - Of course, we are all anxious to get into that haven of rest we have so .well earned, but very much will depend on what business the Government desire to have done. I presume the choice is between closing the session on Saturday week or the following Saturday, but that can scarcely be done if fresh proposals are submitted.",65
551,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We dealt with a big question very expeditiously today.,65
552,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I think we have done an excellent day's work; but the Government ought to state exactly what business it desires to dispose of in order that the Opposition may help to wind up the session. I suggest that perhaps some of oblithe new proposals might be dropped.,65

558,Mr TOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is perfectly right, and there is all the more reason why our legislation should be carefully considered. Then there is the matter of patent medicines, in which the Postmaster General is so keenly interested. That measure, I diink, has no chance of getting through this session, and I am not sure that at this stage the Government should attempt to pass it. If the Prime Minister will say frankly that the Government will not persist with some of the new legislation which has been proposed, we shall meet them in the fairest possible way, and dispose of the remainder of the business on the paper at the earliest possible moment.",65
559,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [11.31] - No business has been submitted by the Government which was not referred to in the statement which I made in indicating their policy. It was, of course, anticipated that the Estimates would have to be passed, and regarding the other matters referred to it is not, I think, too much to ask the Opposition to give them such consideration as time will allow. Then if we fail to pass them, the fact cannot be helped. Mr JOHNSON. - Will the honourable gentleman indicate when he desires to close the session?",65
560,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If it is convenient for honourable members we hope to be able to close the session at the end of next week, and we invite honourable members'in Opposition as far as possible to assist us to do so.
