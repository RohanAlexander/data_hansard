2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Compass Airlines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The Petition of citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the overwhelming support of the Australian people for the resumption of Compass Airlines operation. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House:recognise the overwhelming public support for Compass resuming operations; agree to work with interested parties to facilitate Compass resuming operations; provide clear guidelines under aviation deregulation to ensure that fair and adequate facilities are made available to all operators and the public immediately. by Mr Campbell (from 14 citizens), Mr Costello (from 25 citizens), Dr Hewson (from 14 citizens), Mrs Kelly (from 14 citizens), Mr Lavarch (from 14 citizens), Mr MCArthur (from 14 citizens), Mr Sciacca (from 14 citizens), Mr Sinclair (from 14 citizens) and Mr Tickner (from 14 citizens). Domestic Temporary Resident Status To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble undersigned citizens earnestly pray that because of the uncertain situation existing in Vietnam and Cambodia it could be cruel and unjust to repatriate those presently held in detention in Port Hedland and other places, who are rejected as being 'refugees'. That they be given the alternate status of 'Domestic Temporary Resident' for a period of two years. That such a status be granted if sponsored by other Australian individuals or groups. with the guarantee of housing these people for the term of their temporary residency. That those who are granted such a status be allowed to move freely about the country, accept work and do skills training. Your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Filing (from 147 citizens) and Mr Rocher (from 56 citizens). NA Queen of Australia To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House moves by certain persons to tum Australia into a Republic by the year 2001. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House oppose any move to remove the Queen of Australia as the Head of State. by Mr Beale (from 127 citizens). Australian National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest objection to any attempt to alter Australia's existing national flag without seeking prior approval from the Australian people by way of referendum. The Australian National Flag has been the symbol of the Australian nation and of our national unity for over eighty years. Throughout history men and women have expressed their feelings for their country by showing honour and respect for their country's national flag. This flag must remain our emblem as a tribute to those who laid down their lives for our freedom. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian national flag as a symbol of our national pride and identity. by Mr Downer (from 859 citizens). No. 2 Flight Air Training Corps To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia, draws to the attention of the House, the proposal to relocate the No 2 Flight Air Training Corps, from Wanneroo to Leederville. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (i) ensure that the No 2 Flight Air Training Corps remains in Wanneroo and is not relocated to Leederville. (ii) seek funding from the Department of Administrative Services to enable the only Flight in Western Australia currently not funded, to access sufficient project monies to complete and maintain its facilities already under construction at Landsdale, and (iii) prevent the loss of this valuable youth organisation to the northern corridor of Perth, the second fastest expanding residential region in Australia. by Mr Filing (from 297 citizens). SBS: Radio 4EB Griffith To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of 'Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain elected Convenors and Representatives of respective ethnic communities associated with Radio 4EB, located in the electorate of Griffith at 140 Main Street, Kangaroo Point draws to the attention of the House their objections concerning the introduction of a proposed second SBS radio network. Your petitioners request the House to consider that public radio broadcasting provides the best medium for the extension of ethnic broadcasting in Australia. This sector currently provides 810 hours of ethnic broadcasting per week on 57 public radio stations throughout Australia. As well as being extremely cost effective compared to the SBS, a public sector allows direct community involvement and management thus ensuring that programs truly reflect community interests and needs. The petitioners strongly request the House to reject any proposal for a second SBS frequency and instead to support the extension of ethnic broadcasdonesia, ting through the public sector. by Mr Humphreys (from 15 citizens). East Timor To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the Lord of Knight's of the Sovereign World Order of the White Cross, Dr Paul Baron Neuman of Kara Bagh as President of the Confederation of Chivalry jointly with our Officers and Members in Australia and worldwide, and citizens and residents of the Commonwealth of Australia in participation with the aims of our Orders of the Humanitarian Knighthood for the protection and defence of life by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: We jointly wish to voice our concern and Objection on behalf of the undersigned petitioners, about the human rights violations in the neighbourhood and sphere of interest to the Continent of Australia, namely the territory known as East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, now under the occupation and suppression of the Republic of Indonesia. The undersigned petitioners sincerely believe that the brutal occupation of the East Timorese territories, being the sole and sovereign property of the rightful inhabitants, and therefore by International Law and by Divine Right the holders of this sovereignty which has been brutally ended by the Indonesian invasion with a massive support and consent of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, very much in contrast to the Charter of the United Nations. We would consider it safe to say that the Australian Government's ventures in this matter were highly aimed towards self interest, particularly in the acquisition of oil drilling rights, a pact, which has led to the deaths of many thousands being killed in the guerilla war, probably up to a quarter of a million people over the years of occupation. We hold that a Government must maintain a certain criteria of principles and a certain amount of trustworthy substance before the eyes of the world and the international community at large. Yet under the leadership of the then Prime Minister, the Honourable Robert Hawke such principles failed to rule, since he was very much prepared to send Australian warships, even without the consent of Parliament, into the Gulf War, defending a ""small nation (Kuwait)"" against an aggressor (Saddam Hussein's armed forces), pretending same to be in the name of Human Rights and Justice. Saying in fact that a powerful aggressor will not get away with by falling upon a small nation. The same Labour Government under the same Prime Minister, the Hon. Robert Hawke, were the Australian Originators of a Pact with the Republic of Inan event neglected by the Media on purpose, but finely exposed itself before an astonished world witnessing the Dili massacre, while the same Government of the Commonwealth of Australia did not come to the aid of a small nation to defend such peoples against a powerful aggressor (Indonesia). On the contrary, under the ""able management"" of a Foreign Minister, the Honourable Senator Gareth Evans, Indonesia had been well equipped with weaponry and military expertise to carry out the onslaught upon a defenceless small nation, neighbouring Australia across the Strait of Timor. We hold that it would be naive to assume that the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was acting in good faith for the good of all people and mankind, not foreseeing the consequences and outright murder which had followed the signing of this historical oil pact. We would consider this kind of foreign policy counter productive to peace and goodwill, a farce, to say the least and 'similar to the act of the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs who some weeks ago kissed the leader of the murderous Pol Pot on both cheeks, which must be seen being a mockery to the millions that died under the brutal rule of the same Pol Pot Leader. We further hold that Australians as people are kind and good natured who would in principle, seek peace and mateship with all its neighbours in the Pacific, yet being misled in their trust by a socialist party following a policy which could, as we fear, put this very Commonwealth of Australia before the International Court of Justice and to the judgment of the world at large. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament of Australia surrenders its support for further occupation of East Timor and grant its consent to the establishment of full sovereignty of the people of the said East Timor. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MACKellar (from 18 citizens). Unemployment: Call for Election To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House 'of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Bendigo draws to the attention of the House the significant level of unemployment in Australia, and its effect on the well being of the community and the Country. We particularly draw to your attention the increase in the level of unemployment during the past 12 months, which has jumped from 8.1 per cent to 10.6 per cent, and is expected to rise further. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should request the Australian Government to: Immediately call on the Governor General to issue the writs for a general election to provide an opportunity for all Australians to decide upon the economic direction of the Nation. by Mr Reid (from 21 citizens). Telecom Services, Roma To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Maranoa draws to the attention of the House their concern over the withdrawal of Telecom staff and services from rural areas. In the town of Roma in south west Queensland there are 10 people attached to Telecom's business office. It is the wish of residents that these people retain their existing jobs and not be obliged to move to Toowoomba. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take immediate action to have these people retained in their jobs in Roma. Your petitioners further request that the House discourage the continued centralisation of Telecom services in recognition of the advantages of situating service outlets in rural communities. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 1,691 citizens). Telecom 0055 Service To the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Groom points out to the HouseThe readily available range of sex and fantasy audio text services transmitted via Telecom through the use of the 0055 prefix. Your petitioners therefore request the House toMove to disband this 'adult' information and entertainment service. Your petitioners are deeply concerned as to what affect these messages have on our youth and Australia's moral standing. by Mr Taylor (from 131 citizens). Medicare Abortions To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows: That God is the Creator of all Life Gen 1:31; That He put human life under special protection by giving us the 6th commandment 'Thou shalt not kill'; That He gave governments the mandate and authority to uphold this law; That in. 1989/90 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 69,587 abortions totalling $7.8 million; That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will carry out its duty to uphold the 6th commandment by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. by Mr Webster (from 314 citizens). Medicare Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby; That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights; That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life; That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect; That in 1989/90 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 69,587 abortions totalling $7.8 million; That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 102 citizens). Federal Funding of Abortion House at To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned petitioners draw the attention of the House to the following:the running costs of the abortion house at Moonah will be underwritten by the Federal Government's continued funding of abortion procedures and related services through Medicare. Your petitioners therefore request the House of Representatives to support Mr Webster's Abortion Funding Abolition Bill which is intended to put an end to the Federal Government's continued underwriting of abortion-on-demand in the Australian States. by Mr Webster (from 26 citizens). World Heritage Listing To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, resident in the State of New South Wales, and electors of the Division of Macquarie points out to the House: 1. They are emphatically opposed to the listing of any Australian estate or territory on the World Heritage Ust-both areas already listed and areas proposed or contemplated; 2. They object unequivocally to the fact that Australia severed constitutional ties with Great Britain, the Privy Council, signed into the Australia Act, yet vast areas of Australia have been placed, or are proposed to be placed under the ultimate supervision and control of the World Heritage Committee of twenty-one 21 foreign countries of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation UN.E.S.C.O., and policed by the Committee of Supervision of seven 7 of those countries and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources I.U.C.N.; 3. They take the strongest possible exception to Australian taxpayers' money being granted to so-called voluntary conservation organisations promoting World Heritage Listing of Australian territory. Your petitioners, therefore, request the House to: 1. Cease making any further nominations of Australian territory for World Heritage Usting; 2. Withdraw from the World Heritage Listing all those areas of Australia already listed; 3. Cease financial funding of all voluntary conservation organisations; Moonah 4. Cease financial funding of UN.E.S.C.O. and the I.U.C.N.; 5. Withdraw from the UN.E.S.C.O. as did the United King,dom. by Mr Webster (from two citizens). Petitions received. NA Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology",10
3,Mr LEE,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I present the Committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Genetic manipUlation: the threat or the glory, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
4,Mr LEE,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"During the twentieth century there have been a series of revolutions in technology. The Industrial Revolution, which started in nineteenth century England, appears to have accelerated in pace ever since. The techniques of industrial production have been transformed. Assembly lines are now manned by robots and produce consumer goods which could hardly have been imagined a century ago. It may be no exaggeration to say that a new phase in this revolution is about to commence. Genetic engineering will enable the productive potential of living organisms to be expanded and given direction to an extent never before possible. The use of living organisms to produce food and clothing and the extraction of drugs from plants is, of course, older than recorded history. The selective breeding of plant and animal strains goes back almost as far. But increased knowledge of genetics, and in particular of the nature of the DNA molecule and how to manipulate it, has greatly enhanced our power to control basic biological processes. The possible applications of these new biological techniques are extremely broad. There is the potential to improve the production efficiency of plant and animal species. Increased resistance to pests and diseases may be programmed into the genetic code with greater precision than the rather hit-and-miss methods of traditional selective breeding. This may reduce the need for environmentally hazardous fertilisers and pesticides. The quality of the products derived from plants and animals may be improved. For example, it may be possible to develop crops which keep for longer periods when harvested. It may also be possible to reduce wastage and therefore allow more product for feeding people. The use of specially developed micro-organisms for bulk production of pharmaceuticals and agricultural and veterinary chemicals will have tremendous commercial significance. In many cases such production methods will not only lower production costs but will lead to products of greater purity. Honourable members may also be aware of the work which the CSIRO is currently carrying out using genetic manipulation techniques to find a means of reducing the fertility of foxes and rabbits which cause so much damage to the Australian environment. There will be important benefits for human health from the use of genetic manipulation. The mechanisms by which all living organisms function will be opened up to much greater examination. This knowledge will undoubtedly assist in the treatment of those who suffer from diseases caused by some genetic deficiency. The Chief Executive of the CSIRO, Dr John Stocker, recently announced a breakthrough with gene shears. He revealed that a new improved form of this technology had been developed which could destroy-although at the moment only in a test tube-the HIV virus which causes AIDS. The possible importance of such a discovery hardly needs to be pointed out to the House today. Many people are concerned with the introduction of this new technology, however. The fact that it involves direct manipulation of the genetic code of living organisms understandably arouses doubts and fears. The Committee's report examines in detail the various kinds of concerns that have been raised. Many people are concerned about possible environmental damage from released plants, animals or micro-organisms which have been the subject of genetic changes. Others have deeply held ethical objections or are concerned about the possible social changes which might flow from the introduction of such technology. Genetic manipulation techniques provide a very powerful tool. Any powerful tool requires careful handling, and this is certainly the case with the ability to manipulate inherited characteristics. Obviously, the risks involved will depend on the nature of the genetic changes made and how competently the risks are analysed before any release is authorised. It is only on that case by case basis that the dangers, if any, can be identified and a risk assessment can be completed. The call for a blanket ban on all genetic manipulation or all releases is unjustified when the dangers and the possibilities of any particular undesirable event happening are so widespread and variable. It is unrealistic to demand absolute certainty about safety when we live in a world where absolute certainty is not possible. The Committee has made recommendations about the various means which could be employed to increase the safety in releasing GMOs. The possibility of limiting the potential of micro-organisms to transfer altered or added genes to non-target organisms should be thoroughly researched. The use of so called suicide genes, gene promoters and marker genes should also be considered. In all cases those proposing releases should be required to put forward worse case scenarios to help ensure full consideration of possible dangers and the level of risk involved. Funding of basic environmental research should be encouraged so that a risk assessment does not proceed without adequate knowledge. In addition, monitoring of effluent from laboratories and factories where GMOs are used should be required to ensure that unauthorised releases do not take place. There are already fairly comprehensive guidelines concerning the use of genetic manipulation in contained work and procedures to be followed before any release takes place. The Committee which enforces these rules, known as GMAC, at the moment under the current law cannot make them legally enforceable. This Committee has put forward as one of its most important recommendations that such laws be given legal force. The Committee discusses in some detail the way in which that can take place-grants or tax incentives can be withdrawn, if necessary, and also we can have penalties leading to both fines and imprisonment, if appropriate. We, of course, do not take away the right to take civil action for damages if any person believes that that action is necessary. Given the rapidity with which technology is changing in this area it would be preferable if the guidelines were contained in regulations rather than in an Act of parliament so that the regulations could be kept up to date. The law provides various remedies for those who may suffer personal injury or property damage froin the escape of dangerous animals or from products which are released on the market. There can be difficulties, however, in making a successful case. An example is difficulty of establishing a duty of care an action for negligence. The Committee therefore recommends strict liability for damages arising from deliberate releases GMOs which have not been authorised. The majority of the Committee has recommended a two-tiered approach to the regulatory structure for genetic manipulation work. The existing Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee should be retained to consider proposals to carry out contained work involving GMOs and also act as a specialist body. Its members should be chosen on the basis of their expertise in genetic manipulation or environmental science. As well, a new body, perhaps to be known as a release authority, should be established. This would have the responsibility of considering all proposals to release modified organisms into the environment whether for field trials or as commercial products. The establishment of this release authority should be achieved by complementary State and Federal legislation. Clearly those two bodies would have to work in close cooperation and it is the Committee's recommendation that bo-h. bodies s-ould be responsible to the - Mmlster for - clence and Technology. - ote ! that w- have m the House the former Mtruster for SCIence, the honourab-e member for Lalor (Mr Barry J?nes)- who, m .fa?t, g.ave us the reference which tnggered thIS mqUlry. He and other honourab!e members would be aw-re that we had qUIte some d-bate about which sh-l!ld be the appropnate Government Mmtster .and department t- look. afte- these two bodtes. After some dtscussI-n- It was re-ommended that that be the Mmlster for Sctence and Technology. The Committee has proposed that the membership of the release authority should consist of representatives from relevant Commonwealth Government departments, scientific experts, people with an involvement in the commercial development or use of GMOs and people with an interest in environmental or consumer affairs issues. The chairperson of GMAC should also be a member of the release authority. In the case of field trials, the release the authority should be able to advertise the under proposed release for public comment if it considers that desirable and the release authority should publicly advertise proposed of releases of any product containing GMOs. In each case the Minister should be advised of a proposed release and we believe the Minister should have the discretion to order a public hearing before the release occurs. Time does not permit me to go into other details. The Committee has made a large number of recommendations which we believe provide for a balance between encouraging scientific research and development in this area. These will assist Australia while at the same time not risking the safety of the environment or personal health in Australia through the unfortunate release of some GMOs. I place on record my appreciation, and I am sure that of all the members of the Committee, to our staff, that is, our committee secretary, Paul MCMahon; John Carter, who has carried out a great deal of work on this inquiry, and our other staff members, Helen Fyfe in particular, who have put in a lot of effort to ensure that this report is a success. I thank also those who made submissions to the inquiry and those who appeared at public hearings. I have mentioned in the preface to the report our appreciation to the staff of CSIRO as well as to the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Law Reform Commission of Victoria for their assistance. I commend the report to the House.",13
5,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"The report, Genetic manipUlation: the threat or the glory, has a large bull on the front cover. It is a picture that was painted a long time ago. What it clearly demonstrates is that we have been at genetic manipulation in one form or another for a long time and really what has changed are the techniques. The Chairman of the inquiry, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), has outlined the main points of the report. I am not going to duplicate what he has said. Of course he has talked about some of the main recommendations in terms of procedures and the new body. He mentioned matters like ethics and health and so on. The point that I make initially is that a lot of work has gone into this report which was prepared after some very careful deliberation. I certainly echo the Chairman's thanks and acknowledgment to Paul MCMahon, the Committee's Secretary, and to Dr John Carter and to the other members of the staff who have worked long and hard in the preparation of this report with the Committee members. We are, of course, dealing with a considerably specialised area. One needs to tread carefully. We should also record our thanks to Dr Merilyn Sleigh, who did the technical vetting. She made some very constructive suggestions and perhaps saved us from having some red faces in terms of some of those technical matters. Reading, listening and learning are not always quite enough. One needs experience. So the layman treads in this area at some peril. After 18 months it has been brought home to me that we are talking about a very technical area and a very specialised area. I come from a strong technological background, but I must say that there were occasions when I struggled with some of the matters put before us. Therefore, we have been very cautious in the way in which we have handled the whole subject. I would like to mention briefly that my colleagues the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) have dissented from recommendation Nos 2 and 48. They will, of course, speak for themselves on another occasion but I flag their concern. With regard to recommendation No.2, we have done no detailed work in a particular area and they felt that we need not have made any comment on that. I believe that is a fine distinction. With regard to recommendation No. 48, they very strongly hold the view that decisions should be made in this place and in this chamber before releases are made. I think the majority of members of the Committee took the view that, with the workload involved and the degree of knowledge and expertise required, that was probably an impractical approach. Speaking for myself, I came to this inquiry 18 months ago looking for a balanced outcome; looking, if at all possible, to no increase in the overall impact of regulation; and looking to make sure that activity in Australia was no more or no less advantaged or disadvantaged than similar activity in the rest of the world. I wanted to make sure that we protected against abuse. I very quickly came to the view that there was a need for legislation, that there needed to be a proper assessment and consideration of risks, and that we needed to set up a mechanism that was not going to be tied specifically to today's techniques, because the techniques are changing so rapidly. Probably most importantly, in many senses, we needed a national approach. I believe we have achieved a lot of those objectives. We have formalised, essentially, the present voluntary code to be able to deal with abuses because, frankly, just having the facility in a voluntary situation to withdraw grants and that sort of thing is not enough. I think we have done it in a way that has not added greatly to the regulation load from a c user's point of view. We have retained GMAC as a. technical group, but we have recommended the establishment of a new body of wide representation but which, in terms of actually handling the process, will be relatively transparent to the users and, therefore, if you like, will not place extra burdens on those clients. We are asking users, essentially, and those involved in the field, to do officially only what the vast majority already accept as being responsible behaviour and which they do anyway. It is important, I think, for those involved in the field to have known standards so that they can deal on a long term planning basis with the work that they are executing. Most of the work in this field is not short term. We need, of course, a basis for avoiding disasters. Whether one talks about thalidomide, the proliferation of cane toads or whatever, obviously those things must not happen in the future. We must also make sure that we practice world standards and norms. I would like to comment very briefly on the conduct of the inquiry. I think the quality of the evidence from some of the witnesses was, frankly, variable. We had a range of positions from those in the scientific fraternity who said, 'Trust us. We are responsible, we don't need any regulation'. I think there was perhaps some shifting of position during the inquiry by some of those people. At the other end of the scale, we often had emotive evidence that obviously therefore was not necessarily based on fact; people took rather entrenched, extreme positions. So it was difficult to sort out an appropriate balance. I draw special attention to some key conclusions in the report. Firstly, I refer to paragraph 3.4 which talks about the sense of balance that we need. It reads: The Committee believes that the possible economic, environmental and health benefits from applying genetic manipulation techniques are worth pursuing. Not all of the claimed benefits will materialise. Some applications of the techniques will have risks attached which may outweigh the benefits. I would like also to draw the attention of the House to paragraph 4.32 which talks about the impact on the planet resulting from the use of this type of technology. It states: It is impossible to live on the planet without having an impact upon it. Correct predictions about the extent of those impacts clearly depend on an understanding of the interconnections between the different systems in nature. Equally clearly the health and survival of the human species depends on how those natural systems continue to function. This does not necessarily preclude the use of any particular technology, but it does require that the effects of its use be appreciated. I think that particular extract probably got to the nub of the conflicts that we were trying to sort out during the course of our deliberations. The Chairman has already mentioned the important principle that we have adopted in the report of a case by case approach and we also, of course, had to deal with the rather vexed area of patents. I would refer to paragraph 7.112 where we say that denying the right to patent-allowed in many other countries-would probably adversely affect the biotechnology industry in Australia. The decision whether to seek a patent should be a commercial one and it should be made by the companies themselves. The Committee considers that there is no justification for denying the biotechnology industry the opportunity to use patents to seek a reward for effort. The Patents Act is not the appropriate vehicle for hindering or preventing the development of technologies to which society may have an objection. If that is the aim then more direct means such as legislation should be used. I think it is also important to differentiate on occasion in this area between product or process. That is another area where the Committee spent many, many hours when we said that it would be an oversimplification to treat all products produced by genetic manipulation techniques as being equally hazardous. The process of manufacture by itself is not a good indication of the dangers which may be inherent in the product. The process of manufacture should however be considered when examining the safety of products for which approval has been sought before sale. I would also draw the attention of the House to paragraph 8.1 which outlines three key reasons why we believe that it is absolutely essential that legislation now be adopted. So it seems to me that genetic engineering can be a tremendous force for good. We need to protect against abuses, especially under commercial pressures, and I believe that in our report the recommendations have done this. We need to match world standards. If we are too restrictive we will lose the benefits overseas. If we are too lax, others from overseas will come here and take advantage and dump dangerous products here. Again, I believe we have achieved this balance. Genetic engineering is doing what man has always done but minimising the risk. The issues such as animal welfare, market monopolies and so on, are not unique to this area of endeavour and so they do not need special recommendations or laws in this report. They exist already elsewhere. The guidelines that exist at the moment need to be replaced with legislation to deal with the dishonourable. The honourable will have no difficulty dealing with what we have proposed and from a national perspective benefits to be gained in productivity are huge. It is a classic industry that this country needs to get into, provided governmept sets the right framework. The report includes proper and meaningful measures for risk assessment. The report can be implemented by governments of either persuasion, I believe. It needs relatively minor government costs to implement. It will help researchers and the industry alike. Although perhaps overall tending towards a note of caution, I think that is in fact a proper balance in weighing all the competing and conflicting issues. I commend the report to the House.",16
6,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,Order! The time allocated for statements on this report has expired. Does the Chairman wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion? Motion (by Mr Lee) proposed: That the House take note of the report.,18
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"In accordance with sessional order 102a, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority",18
8,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the Committee entitled Examination of the 1990-91 Annual Report of the National Crime Authority. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
9,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"Under paragraph 55(1)(c) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, it is the duty of the Committee 'to examine each annual report of the Authority and report to the Parliament on any matter appearing in, or arising out of, any such annual report'. The report I have just presented contains the results of the Committee's examination of the Authority's annual report for the financial year ended 30 June 1991. In 1990 and 1991 the Committee conducted a major evaluation of the Authority. The Committee reported in detail on this evaluation in November 1991. Because of this, the report tabled today is relatively brief. The Committee's basic finding is that the Authority's report is excellent. It is fully satisfactory when evaluated against the statutory requirements and the relevant guidelines for the preparation of annual reports. The report contains a comprehensive index to its contents. Some critics of the Authority have argued that the Authority provides the public with insufficient information about its activities. The Committee considers that the detail in the report under review clearly refutes this argument. The Committee's report draws attention to the fact that some journalists ignore changes that have occurred at the Authority in recent years. Allegations dating back to the mid-1980s are still presented in sections of the media as if they were relevant to the present Authority. Both the Committee and the Authority have previously recognised the difficulties in measuring the performance of law enforcement agencies such as the Authority. In the report presented today, the Committee notes that the Authority is now structuring its annual reports around the objectives, action strategies and performance measures contained in the Authority's corporate plan. The Committee anticipates that, by providing the data specified in the corporate plan's performance measures, future annual reports will improve the ability of the Parliament and the public to assess the Authority's performance. Other matters which the Committee comments upon in its report include the value of the annual report containing more detail on complaints made about the conduct of police working for the Authority, and on the outcomes of investigations into such complaints; the need to use caution in interpreting data the annual report on amounts seized or frozen as proceeds of crime-not all such amounts eventually end up in Consolidated Revenue; and the impact of serious court delays in some Australian jurisdictions on prosecutions brought as a result of NCA investigations. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome, the appointment of Mr Tom Sherman as the new Chairman of the NCA. Mr Sherman took up his appointment last month, replacing Justice John Phillips, who resigned late last year to become Chief Justice of Victoria. The Committee has already had one meeting with Mr Sherman. It looks forward to continuing with him the frank and constructive relationship the Committee had with his predecessor.",18
10,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I would like to add to the remarks made by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in saying that the annual report was an excellent report, and also add to the comments that it is fully satisfactory when evaluated against the statutory requirements and the relevant guidelines for th- preparation of annual reports. I would like to tum to one particular aspect of the examination of the annual report for 1990-91 by the Committee. Paragraph 5 says: The Committee deplores the absence of IOC comments. In paragraph 6.36 of the Committee's report, Who is to Guard the Guards?, an evaluation of the National Crime Authority, tabled on 28 November 1991, the Committee stated: The IOC made comments amounting to less than a page on each of the first three annual reports of the Authority. Comments have not been made on subsequent annual reports. The lack of IGC comments strengthens the Committee's view that the IOC has not actively monitored the Authority. For the information of the· House, the IGC was established under section 8 of the Act and it consists of a Commonwealth Minister and a Minister representing each participating State and Territory. All the States and Territories now participate. The functions of the IGC are set out in the Act. One of them is to in monitor generally the work of the Authority under section 9(1)(e). It states: The Authority is required to furnish its annual reports to the IGC for transmission to the appropriate Commonwealth Minister in this case, the Attorney-Generalunder section 61(1) of the NCA Act. In the Committee's evaluation report, Who is to Guard the Guards?, a number of comments were made in relation to the role of the IGC and in particular to the question of the supervision of the NCA itself, because, of course, there are two bodies created under the Act with a role of supervising the National Crime Authority. One of them is the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, which has made the report-the evaluation report-and the other is the IGC.",19

Standing Committee on Community Debate resumed from 24 March, on motion by Mr Jenkins: That the House take note of the report.",20
14,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"As Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I would like to make a few comments on the report Prescribed Health. Part 1 of the report deals with promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, while the following volumes deal with prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals. I am happy to say that one of the themes running through part 1 of this report is contained in the recommendations that consumers should take more responsibility for their health. Many of the recommendations lead towards that end-that consumers be able to look at what they are taking and say, 'This is good or bad', knowing the effects it would have on their health. For too long consumers have been caught up with what is prescribed. They open a package and in it comes a little slip of paper, in extraordinarily fine print, with technological detail which makes absolutely no sense to anyone except the medical practitioner. Yet the people need a lot of this information, particularly if they not be mixing one drug with another. One of the major recommendations of the report is that generic names be put on brand labels. This is almost a motherhood type of statement, yet to date this has not been done in the pharmaceutical industry. A generic name is the name of the basic chemical, the active ingredient, that is in the pharmaceutical. I give an example. There is a pharmaceutical called Tenormin and one called Noten. In some instances the doctor finds that a patient is taking both Tenormin and Noten because, having gone to two different doctors on different occasions, perhaps in different cities, the patient is not aware that these two drugs are identical and that he or she is in fact double dosing. Both Tenormin and Noten come under the generic name of atenolol. If these recommendations are taken up then every drug that has atenolol will be labelled 'atenolol' above the brand name so that people know what they are taking. This is a very important recommenAffairs dation. Another obvious yet simple recommendation is that there should be room on the pharmaceutical container for the pharmacist's label. Often when people go into a pharmacist and pick up their container they find that the pharmacist's label has gone over the label of the manufacturer. If they want to know more about what they are taking they have to peel one label off and look underneath. The Committee's recommendation is that a gap of exactly seven centimetres by five centimetres be left on the manufacturing label for the insertion of the pharmaceutical information. I have a slight concern about this: for smaller containers this label is going to be too big. If the recommendation is followed some pharmaceutical companies will have to move their products into larger containers. But the idea and the principle is certainly a very good one. What would seem to be an. obvious recommendation, but something that has not been adopted in the pharmaceutical industry, is that pharmacists' instructions be written in plain English. That is recommendation 6. That should recommendation is taken even further in recommendation 40, which recommends that all approved consumer information be written in plain English. This is the information found inside the packet on the drug's possible side effects and the danger of taking it with another particular drug. That information right now is extraordinarily hard for consumers to find. Under the Committee's recommendations, hopefully they will be able to find out for themselves what the m\!dications could do to them and what side effects they might experience. Recommendation 39 goes further than the Baume report, recommending that the Therapeutic Goods Administration not only evaluate patient information but approve it formally. Hopefully, this means patients will have full information on the side effects of drugs they are taking as well as the effects of drugs taken in combination. Recommendation 41 is quite interesting. It recommends that all drug information should be collected in a compendium so that libraries and consumer groups can keep a record of all drugs and what happens, their side effects, for those people who wish to know. Recommendation 20 suggests that consumers should be given a greater voice by including a representative from peak consumer health groups on the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association Complaints Committee. Once again, as I said, this theme of getting more consumers involved in their medical industry and what they are taking comes through. If the recommendations of this report are adopted, the end result will be that consumers know more about what they are taking, will avoid many iatrogenic complications due to multiple drug use and will, hopefully, take more responsibility for their health. In conclusion, I want to congratulate the secretariat for the work it did in this report. I would also like to comment that secretariats are often not given their full credit for the amount of work that they put into reports. Reports are acknowledged as committee reports but, more often than not, it is the secretariat that does something like 95 per cent of the work and this secretariat should be congratulated on the enormous amount of work it has put into this report. I commend this report to the House.",20
15,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"Robertson) (10.07 a.m.) From my point of view, the most exciting and potentially productive work of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs concerning its reference on the prescription and supply of drugs was a two-day conference held last July. The Committee on that occasion became observers rather than inquisitors as representatives of the various participants, including industrialists, medicos, pharmacists, academics and consumers, heatedly argued the pros and cons of securing a strategic approach to medicines. At the end of that fascinating dialectical encounter, substantial agreement was achieved on the best structure for an Australia-wide national medicinal drug policy which would maintain a viable expanding pharmaceutical industry, deliver high quality products to consumers, ensure equity of access to Australians and maintain high standards of use. Chapter 4 of the report deals with the industry and the need to ensure that the boards of pharmaceutical companies, in pursuit of their duties to maximise shareholders' profits, are even more concerned about their ethical responsibility to consumers in the manufacture, advertising and packaging of what are frequently very dangerous substances. The Committee's recommendation that companies provide the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority with information that includes the breakdown of costing of all promotional activities will benefit the public interest by enabling sensible guidelines to be set to limit excessive promotional spending, which has the antisocial effect of encouraging excessive drug use as well as overpricing drugs. The Committee is strongly supportive of the concept of a code of ethical principles to guide not only manufacturers but also professional organisations dealing with the health industry. Disquieting evidence was put before the Committee about unethical promotional stunts and activities. I refer to pseudoeducational junkets for doctors to tourist fleshpots, lavish luncheons, gifts of expensive computers and the like. The blatant objective of these promotional pitches was not educational but was to provide incentives to doctors to prescribe a particular line of drugs. There was also concern about what was described as bogus drug trials. That concern led to the Committee's endorsement of the Trade Practices Commission's proposition that the ethical codes of the British industry and physicians should be adopted in Australia to control both trials and incentive schemes. The Committee felt that consumers, who pay both the monetary and the health price, should be represented on the self-regulating subcommittee of manufacturers and. that health officials be given observer status to ensure that the proceedings stay in the public interest. If the public is to have any confidence in a self-regulating code as in the system at the moment, the subcommittee should have the power to recommend sanctions. The report supports not only such a power but also the bestowing of powers of corrective advertising and the imposition of fines for breaches of the advertising code. In addition, manufacturers in breach of the code would be obliged to submit draft retraction statements for approval. Amendment to those statements could be made and then published in the manner that the subcommittee deems appropriate. Doctors would be given full opportunity to read retractions. Frankly, there is no point in manufacturers retracting advertising statements if the doctors prescribing the drugs do not see those retractions. Defiance of the subcommittee would result in either departmental or legal action. As with all self-regulatory codes, problems arise with the manufacturers who are not members of the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia. It is recommended that the complaints mechanism apply to them also and that autonomy be given to the complaints panel, which would be strengthened by consumer and departmental representation. To pick up breaches of the advertising code, a monitoring committee is also recommended. There is no point in having a watchdog unless the watchdog is· aware of breaches of the code. I point to these consumer issues because I have always been cynical about selfregulatory systems. Too often they become self-protection systems, indulging in whitewashes, procrastinations and self-justifications. However, I have given my support to the regime proposed by the Committee and the Trade Practices Commission because it does provide novel safeguards that could well keep a self-regulating system honest. I feel the experiment is deserving of a fair go. The issue of the quality of medicinal drug usage requires far greater commitment from manufacturers and health professionals alike to providing better information, education and team work. Professor Baume has faced the vexatious problem of drug evaluation with all its risks, red tape and recurring delays. The Committee was mainly concerned, however, with the important information question of the need for an Australian national formulary to provide drug information to prescribers and dispensers alike. That formulary could also include Australian therapeutic guidelines. Most medical practitioners use what is called the MIMS BiMonthly and MIMS Annual prescription proprietary guide as their primary reference. It is a reference generated by private industry and has various shortcomings, not the least of which is that it is cluttered with advertising material. There is a real need for a national formulary that will provide drug information and allow the selection of the best drug for the specific patient. The suggestion is that the information could be provided in a computerised format, initially updated annually but later on a more regular basis. The inclusion of uniform therapeutic guidelines would greatly assist practitioners to select the best drug for the patient's circumstances. The Committee saw the important role for government in the prescription and supply of drugs as bringing to reality a national drug strategy and cementing the relationship between consumers, their health professionals and the industry. The Committee took the view that the pharm working party, which is currently developing an educational strategy to achieve the necessary cooperation between all concerned, is the initiative that could assist to put in place the framework and mechanisms necessary for progress in the quality use of pharmaceuticals. In recent times a great deal has been said about the need to contain costs in our national health system. Great cost is being incurred by prescription drug misuse. That misuse not only includes the 20,000 Australians admitted to hospitals suffering from poisoning as a result of prescription mistakes but also overuse and failure to take drugs as prescribed. Members of the Committee hope that this first report will contribute to this herculean task of saving our health dollar, but more importantly will lead to improving the health of Australians. I commend the report to the House.",21
16,Mr BROADBENT,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"The report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on the prescription and supply of drugs has been several years in the making. The inquiry was first referred to the Committee in the previous Parliament and its terms of reference were advertised in 1989. Progress with the inquiry was delayed by the dissolution of parliament in early 1990. The inquiry resumed in July 1990, and by October 1990 had received 130 submissions. During the Committee's investigations it quickly became apparent that older people suffer particular difficulties as consumers of pharmaceuticals. A number of witnesses gave evidence that elderly people are far more likely to suffer adverse drug reactions and complications than the rest of our community. This is often the result of older people being on multiple medications and reflects the fact that people's metabolisms change with age. As a consequence, manufacturers' recommended adult doses of self-administered nonprescription medications as displayed on packaged labels may not be appropriate or safe for older people. The Committee acknowledges the important role that pharmacists play in counselling patients on correct dosage rates. However, we remain concerned that people purchasing nonprescription drugs from supermarkets and other non-pharmacy outlets may receive little such counselling. As a result, they may not be aware that stated dosage rates for adults may be dangerously inappropriate for older people. The Committee has recognised this problem for older people and recommended that the National Health and Medical Research Council examine the possibility of including a cautionary note on non-prescription drugs, advising older people to consult a pharmacist or doctor on appropriate dosage rates for their age, weight and state of health. On a similar note, the Committee became aware that the cautionary statements required on medication packages may not be clear to all members of the community. For example, it has been argued that the standard existing labels, such as the 'Supply without prescription illegal' label, which is seen on most prescription products, may not be as clear as 'Pharmacy only' or 'Prescription only'. The Committee is aware of research being done into the effectiveness of medicine warning labels by a number of agencies, but believes that further research is needed. As a result, the Committee has recommended that government agencies give greater consideration to simplifying the warning statements that appear on medicine labels. The Committee has also recommended that all pharmacists' instructions should be written in plain English. In an increasingly sophisticated society, consumers are expecting the right of access to information on the drugs they are prescribed. The Committee believes that consumers of pharmaceuticals have a right to information on drug and non-drug therapies, the effects of drugs and any possible adverse reaction that can be expected from taking medicine. Not only should consumers receive such information as a right, but also evidence suggests that well informed patients are more likely to take their medicines correctly. Consumer education information requires a multi-disciplinary approach with involvement from manufacturers, health professionals, consumer groups and government agencies. The key to such information is that it should be provided, either verbally or in writing, in a form that is easily understood by consumers. Furthermore, consumers should have the confidence that the information they are receiving is both accurate and balanced. As part of the drug evaluation process, manufacturers are already required to use a product information document called PI for all prescription drugs and new chemical entities. All PIs require endorsement by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee as a precondition for marketing approval. They list, among other things, a drug's approved indications, dosage rates, appropriate warnings and possible adverse reactions. However, this product information is intended for health professionals only and is written in highly technical language which is not directly appropriate as consumer information. In his report on the future of drug evaluation in Australia, Professor Baume recommended that in future manufacturers should be required to furnish consumer information as well as product information before their product could be marketed. The consumer information would be written directly for consumers, although it would have to remain consistent with the approved product information. Professor Baume's recommendation has now been adopted. However, the TGA is only required to evaluate patient information and does not have to approve it formally. The Committee believes that this information should have the TGA's stamp of approval so that consumers can be confident that the information has been independently evaluated. The Committee has therefore extended Professor Baume's recommendation to include that the Therapeutic Goods Administration be required formally to approve consumer information to be termed 'approved consumer information' or 'ACI'. Furthermore, once the Therapeutic Goods Administration has evaluated the clinical details of ACI, they should be forwarded to appropriate health education specialists to ensure that the ACI has been written in plain English and is likely to be understood by non-specialists. The Committee believes that approved consumer information should explain in simple language what a drug is, what it does, how it should and should not be taken, when it should and should not be taken, what other drugs it might interact with and how, and list any significant adverse reactions that might occur. The Committee has recommended that ACI be available to consumers via pharmacy computers to be used as a supplement to pharmacists' verbal counselling. Furthermore, the Committee believes that approved consumer information should be printed in a compendium which is available for purchase by the public. The Committee has also noted a number of alternative sources of consumer information, including a range of consumer orientated guides on pharmaceuticals that are of variable quality and ease of use. A number of manufacturers also produce explanatory pamphlets on particular drugs for distribution to patients through medical practitioners. The Committee wishes to encourage this practice, The Committee fully supports the publication of any helpful consumer information, providing it is accurate and balanced. Another area of concern to the Committee has been the lack of regulation of the advertising of alternative and traditional medicines. The Nutritional Foods Association, which represents a number of manufacturers of herbal preparations, mineral and vitamin supplements, homoeopathic preparations and other traditional medicines, has had a voluntary code of conduct for advertising these products to both health professionals and the public. However, compliance with this code was voluntary for members of the Nutritional Foods Association and has fallen into disuse. The Committee notes that an expanded code is currently being written. The Committee is concerned that some alternative medicines, herbal remedies and vitamin supplements have been advertised using exaggerated therapeutic claims, such as that they were 'good for the brain' or 'reduced ageing', These types of claims have no scientific basis, are too vague and may mislead members of the public into purchasing them. With the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, advertisements to the public for alternative medicines are not required to meet the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. However, the Committee was told that a number of manufacturers of alternative products are breaching that code. Some manipulate the grey area created by the overlap of therapeutic goods legislation and food legislation, and some simply disregard the code. Both the Nutritional Foods Association and the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services have been trying to educate such manufacturers about their responsibilities under the Therapeutic Goods Act and the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. The Department has told the Committee that it will start prosecuting persistent offenders. The Committee supports this move as it believes it is vital that consumers are protected from false and misleading advertising, particularly for substances that may be harmful if taken inappropriately. It is very clear, after working on this Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), that there was a learning process for new members such as myself. The experience of those sitting on the Committee was of great value to those of us who were introduced to the Committee in 1990. I thank the Chairman. I thank the officers of that Committee. I think the secretariat has done a great job. I really think that this is a most difficult area; it has many branches and all the branches have leaves. Having regard to that, the effect on the community is enormous and the cost to the Government is even greater. Of all the things that members of this House do, committee work provides us with an opportunity to actually go and do some hands-on work with the community where there will be some direct benefit to somebody in each of our electorates and across the nation.

17,Mrs JAKOBSEN,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"It is a fact of life that hundreds of thousands of Australians are dependent upon prescription drugs for the maintenance of their daily health. Such drugs extend from those taken to contain high blood pressure or prevent tension, to those used to reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. Regrettably, however, this level of dependence is seldom matched by adequate knowledge on the part of the consumer of the relative capacity, charaCteristics and consequences of the drugs on which they rely. This lack of knowledge is addressed, at least in part, by the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled Prescribed Health, which was presented to the Parliament this week by the Chairman, the honourable member for Scullin, (Mr Jenkins), who is my colleague and sitting next to me in the House at the moment. Ignorance of the characteristics of prescribed medication is not without its costs. In referring to this particular problem, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) had commented that approximately 40 per cent of all drug related poisoning cases admitted to public hospitals, an estimated 20,000 people per year, are caused by incorrect use of prescription medicines. It is a large problem. It is on this element of the need for consumer health awareness and education that I would like to focus my remarks today. I do not believe it is an accident that the majority of the members of the Committee who have spoken in this debate have also concentrated on that element of the report's application. This area is of considerable importance to the community and the Committee recommended a number of ways in which it could be improved. For instance, as mentioned by the honourable member for Scullin in his remarks earlier this week and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) today, we have recommended that the generic name of a drug should be more prominently displayed than the brand name. Because I happen to be an asthmatic and take quite a number of drugs, as do many people in this House, including the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) who is at the table, I would like to point out that, when a person receives a drug from a pharmacist or even from a doctor, on most occasions the drug itself is housed in a brand container. I have here, for instance, a Ventolin inhaler, a Becutide inhaler and some Theodur tablets. They are all brand names. Most of the people who take these drugs, I would put it to the House, would not be aware of the substance names, the ingredients, in effect, that they are taking when they utilise these drugs. If one were to buy Theodur over the counter of a pharmacy on prescription from one's doctor-this is a systemic drug which is supposed to keep asthma at bay during the day-one would not necessarily know, unless one was very clever and particularly insistent on removing the label from the drug, that it was theophylline that one was taking and that this obviously has particular application to asthma. So as a consequence, if a new drug, a new brand, were to come onto the market which was not Theodur, for instance, one might not realise that the same basic ingredient was contained in that drug. Just by way of an example, I have here a little bottle from a hospital that was given to me that was very well labelled. It says 'Theophylline, 200 milligrams'. In brackets underneath and in smaller type it says 'Theodur', which of course is the brand name. It says 'Take swallowed whole with water, twice daily after food'. That is from the emergency department of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. I have kept that bottle and I keep my drugs in that bottie, so it looks pretty rubbishy now, because it is actually one of the best explanations of what the drug is and what you take the drug for and how you take it. I think that is important for people when they are consuming fairly large amounts of drugs for life saving purposes or for the maintenance of their health. The same goes for Ventolin. Most people are not aware of what it is. It is in a little container but all of the information is actually on the back of the label that is tucked away inside the container that people use to actually spray the Ventolin. That says that it is a schedule 3 drug, which we will talk about in a little while. It says that it is a Ventolin inhaler in rather large letters and in a different colour, and that it contains 200 metered doses of-and this is the key-Salbutamol. That is the point, that is actually the ingredient, the drug. Ventolin is simply a brand name. On the same point, asthmatics who are being treated properly by a doctor and properly advised will often be taking another drug in addition to their Ventolin, and that drug is generally a beclomethasone which is known as either Becotide or Aldecin. They are very commonly available drugs although only by prescription. But many people will commit themselves totally to taking Aldecin without realising that in fact Becotide is the same drug under a different brand name. They can be confused and concerned unnecessarily if they are thought to be taking what they were not prescribed to take. Alternatively they could be taking the same drug twice as the honourable member for Hawker mentioned earlier in her speech today. The other problem is that on some of these things they say 'Not to be taken with any other preparation for asthma'. I think the Ventolin one says 'Do not use with other asthma sprays or remedies and avoid frequent and prolonged use'. Everybody who is an asthmatic uses Ventolin nearly all the time. I think very few people would actually know that that warning is on that drug, let alone that it says 'Do not use with another asthma medication' when it is prescribed frequently to be used in conjunction with Aldecin or Becotide. So I am just making a point to people, from personal experience, that there is a lot of confusion and a great lack of knowledge on these questions of prescribed drug medication and the way that you should take them. Questions pertaining to consumer education and knowledge cannot be considered in isolation from promotion and advertising of prescription drugs. This area of activity was also looked at by the Committee which recommended that a greater proportion of financial resources should be spent on educational as opposed to brand name or product promotional advertising. That is partly what we have been referring to here. These recommendations, the ones that I believe are the most important, cover quite a number of the chapters. Recommendation 2 is referring to the drugs that are schedule 3 drugs. That says that the blanket prohibition on advertising of all schedule 3 drugs to the public should remain. That is obviously to prevent people hawking what is effectively quite a dangerous drug and one that should only be prescribed for people. The third recommendation is the discussion of the generic name relative to the size of the product name, the brand name, which has been mentioned by a number of members. The fourth recommendation is the one that says that there should be a specific space on each product to allow for the instructions on usage. That specific space was 70 millimetres by 50 millimetres so that a pharmacist can affix a label to the drug without obscuring the relevant information by the producer of the drug. The fifth recommendation which is also very important says that both the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the National Health and Medical Research Council should give greater consideration to simplifying the warning statements that appear on medicine labels so that people are quite clear on what may go wrong if they misuse or abuse the specific drug being discussed. In the same context of consumer information and education, in recommendation 20 the Committee also recommended that a representative from a peak consumer health group with the appropriate background should be included on the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association complaints subcommittee. The Committee recommended in recommendation 27 that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association develop a comprehensive publicity program, including, but not restricted to, immediate steps to publish, in various widely read medical journals, articles on the code and its requirements. The Association has a specific code which covers the production and publicity of drugs. Many people in the industry are not absolutely aware of how the code operates so we believe that is important for them and also from the consumer's point of view at the doctor level. I commend the recommendations of the Committee to the House. (TIme expired)",25

19,Mr ANDREWS,EAST TIMOR,"Menzies) (10.36 a.m.)To read again the old newspaper cuttings of events leading up to that terrible day in October 1975 when five joumalists-three Australians, one Briton and one New Zealander-were executed by the Indonesian military is to feel a chill go down one's spine. '!\vo days later it was reported that the mystery had deepened as to their wherecontempt abouts. A couple of days later hope remained but there were grave concerns. Then the awful truth began to dawn. The charred bodies four Europeans had been found in a house Balibo where the men had last been seen filming the Indonesian invasion which not supposed to happen. The Whitlam Government of the day made inquiries but kept insisting that confirmation of the reports of the journalists' deaths. On 23 October a spokesman for the Timorese resistance movement, Fretilin, revealed that the men had been executed communist sympathisers and an eye witness report of the shootings came later. The Liberal shadow Minister for foreign affairs the time, the honourable member for Kooyong  the Government. The Whitlam Government, in fact, acted contrary to its own Caucus. Unable to decide not to not support the selfventure determination of a neighbour, and timid at getting offside with a large neighbour, it nothing. By doing nothing the Whitlam Government sealed the fate of the Timorese people. But worse than that, it gave a green light to the invasion by supporting East Timor's integration into Indonesia. Yet, for all our subsequent obsequious cringing and forelock tugging before IndonAustralia esia, our relations with that country barely cordial. Indeed, they soured almost immediately as we were so annoying as to ask whether we could send our representatives to check out the bodies of the dead journalists. The Fraser Government then stamped its Keating). approval on the Indonesian takeover in 1979. Mr Hawke subsequently did what even Mr grateful Whitlam did not do and acknowledged Ininternational donesian sovereignty in 1984. It shows what shabby shifts the ruthless pursuit of power lead to when amorality is disguised as pragtiaIled matism. The latest massacre, last year, in which New Zealand student studying in Australia was mown down along with 100 or so other church attenders or church funeral mourners in Dili is only the most recent example of the of Indonesia for its neighbour. Contrary to what Senator Evans says, the rest of the world does not recognise the annexof ation of East Timor. The United Nations has in never recognised Indonesia's sovereignty. Even Japan, which, in the last world war, was slaughtered 40,000 Timorese suspected of succouring Australian soldiers, recently protested about the takeover by Indonesia. The parallels with the situation in Kuwait are there was no just too glaringly obvious. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, said in an interview on 17 February last year that Australia is prepared as to help with ongoing human rights problems that do crop up from time to time in East Timor. Whereas Iraqi soldiers killed several at thousand Kuwaitis, the Indonesians have, according to Amnesty International, been the cause of the death, through execution, torture, famine and malnutrition, of up to 200,000 people of that nation. Australia is a joint partner with a country that has had death squads and concentration camps in East did Timor and whose very coming into existence from a collection of disparate islands was predicated on the slaughter of some quarter of a million people in the 1950s. The situation in Timor is as bad as any place under Nazi rule, and Indonesia is largely a totalitarian state. The leader of the resistance forces in Timor said in an interview with the ABC that was an accomplice in genocide of have been the people of East Timor. The Indonesian Government's response to last year's massacre has been described as 'credible' by the Prime Minister (Mr It is really a case of damning with very faint praise. We are expected to be that Indonesia has bowed slightly to pressure and the threat of losing international aid. As a result of the Jaelani can inquiry, eight soldiers are to be court-marand disciplinary action taken against a further six. The six against whom action is being taken include two generals, the former a East Timor military commander and the former regional commander. It was, I admit, an unprecedented response by Indonesia, but the fact is that many questions remain unanswered. There is still the question of the large number of people who went missing in the mass round-up after the November massacre. Indonesia is planning to try 13 East Timorese for provoking what witnesses describe as a peaceful demonstration. These charges carry the maximum penalty of death. An international panel of jurists has condemned the Indonesian Government for holding the victims responsible. The Commission estimates that the number of dead in the massacre is up to 200, but the official toll is that only about 50 died, which is an upgrading from the 19 originally alleged by the Government. The implication is somehow that, if only a handful of people died in East Timor, it is really not much of a concern. We are treating the extinction of human lives just like so many packets that we could knock off the supermarket shelves. We in Australia have a great debt to Timor because of the 40,000 Timorese who died in 1942 at Japanese hands because they had been sheltering Australian soldiers. Only 30,000 Australians were killed in the theatres of war. Our Government's policy has been one gravel grazing before the military might of Indonesia. Let us not pretend to take a stance about this: our position all along been pragmatic, which is really only a chipelago. euphemism for allowing practical exigencies to excuse anything. This Government has fallen over itself to shield Indonesia from criticism concerning East Timor. We should be clear about this. This amounts more than appeasement over serious and continuing human rights violations. It is true that we in this country have genuine desire to further our trade with Indonesia, trade which is largely in our of favour, but that ought not to be at the price consistent denial of human rights. Let us export to Indonesia the rule of law and freedom of expression and impartial justice. The over-readiness of Foreign Minister Evans to appease Indonesia's concerns was evident in his authorisation of the removal of crosses set up outside the Indonesian Embassy by Timorese protesters to represent the Timor. They had been blessed by a Catholic priest and impeded no-one's movement. Yet anti-apartheid protesters stayed outside the South African Embassy for much of the 1970s. When an anti-apartheid demonstrator got inside the Embassy compound and was assaulted by a diplomat, that diplomat was expelled from this country. Yet there was no action taken against Indonesian Embassy staff who threw bricks and bottles from inside the Embassy grounds, allegedly breaking the hand of one of the Timorese demonstrators. On the matter of the Timor Gap treaty, many lawyers believe that Portugal has a very strong case against Australia and Indonesia in the international court, although one must say about Portugal also that its failure to look after the colony of which it was the colonial master for so long contributed to the problem that we have now. It is all very well to say that it is human rights not self-determination which is the issue in East Timor. Yet the Indonesians themselves have stated their belief that human rights assertion leads to self-determination. The problem is that, years after independence, of this 180 million-strong population covering 13,000 islands, is only held together by brute moral force. The Indonesians are involved in has bludgeoning the people throughout the arThere are reports that the military has acted even more brutally in suppressing the rebellion in Aceh than it has in East Timor but that Western countries are not much interested because the atrocities are to nothing committed against Muslims. Why is it that we despise the depredations a of large powers against a small one, as in Kuwait and the Falklands, or the suppression civil rights, as in South Africa, but it is all of right when the bully is so large and powerful also as in Tibet and Timor that we dare not say too much. For all our gravel grazing and forelock tugging, Senator Gareth Evans was still snubbed recently in Jakarta when no Indonesian leader deigned to meet him. We trust that the Prime Minister will have better the success. We have bought this so-called slain in friendship at too high a price.",28
20,Mr KERR,EAST TIMOR,"It is very sad that, as a nation, we find ourselves in a dilemma regarding our relationship with Indonesia. It is a point taken very strongly the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) who characterised the present Government's attitude in relation to the East Timor massacre as pragmatic. He did have the grace to say that the former Fraser Government also acknowledged and accepted the legitimacy of the Indonesian takeover of East Timor. It has always been the case that there have only ever been in this Parliament a handful of members who have taken the cause of the East Timorese people more seriously than the question of our pragmatic relations with a large neighbouring power. I count amongst those who did put the interests of the people of East Timor in front of the pragmatic considerations, my predecessor, the former member for Denison, Michael Hodgman, who I think singularly on his side of politics, through that period spoke out continually in favour of the East Timorese right to self-determination and against the process of human rights abuses, which independent authorities such as Amnesty International have catalogued as proceeding, not just over recent times, but for the decade since the Indonesians conquered the East Timor province by military force. I also think I would be remiss if I did not mention the work of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who chairs a crossparty group in this Parliament, concerned to continue to represent the interests of those people of East Timor in a context where both sides in this Parliament generally accept the reality-not necessarily liking it-that our national interests require us to take a more pragmatic position. For my own part, I welcome the strength of the views expressed by the honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Menzies. I think it is very important that, in this Parliament, on both sides, there are those who articulate so forcefully and strongly and so unflinchingly what, in a sense, is a heartfelt understanding of the basic moral dilemmas. It cannot be right that a nation such as East Timor, a people such as the East Timorese, can be conquered by force, made subject to what on any fair account would be brutal repression for over a decade, be subby jected to human rights abuses of a kind that we would regard as being entirely outside the framework of the United Nations Charter on Human Rights, without our being deeply moved to condemn it. But notwithstanding that, I think he does insufficient justice to the strength of the Australian response since the Dili massacre in November of last year. Australia's response may not have been as comprehensive as would have been wished by the honourable member for Menzies, but his own Party spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), felt that the motion that was moved on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House went too far. The honourable member has sought to move amendments that soften the terms of that motion. I oppose those softenings. I believe that the motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), comprehensively expresses the total and absolute abhorrence of all honourable members of the events of November last year. The motion puts it in a framework which allows the Australian Government to take a stronger stand than it has done ever since that invasion took place. With no great pride, I have to reiterate that successive governments have adopted a pragmatic response. It is not unique to this Government. It characterised the Whitlam Government, it characterised the Fraser Government, it characterised the Hawke Government and, of necessity, I imagine it will continue to characterise the Keating Government. That does not mean that individual members of this Parliament-and particularly those who, as I have, have associated themselves in the past with the parliamentary group for East Timor-should not speak out much more strongly than our Government to push that Government as far as it will go. But it is important for us also to recognise when that Government does take courageous acts and does make a stand in defence of human rights. In this case, what Australia has done is to take matters much further than it ever has in the past in tenus of the strength of its representation and the content of that representation. It has, I believe, played no little part in what the honourable member for Menzies acknowledged is an unprecedented occurrence in that the military commanders of the district covering East Timor now face disciplinary charges, court martials and other proceedings and are being called to account for the way in which that administration permitted the massacre. Had Australia been supine and had it adopted the position which the honourable member for Menzies suggests was gravel grazing-and I am not sure what gravel grazing is, but I do not think either that or forelock tugging characterised our response in the least-then there would have been no such public process. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) took it upon himself to travel to Indonesia. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Menzies characterised as a snub, that action focused Australia's concerns in a most direct and blunt way and led, I believe, to the Indonesian Government starting to reassess its approach to the province. I hope that is the case, because the last thing honourable members would hope would be that Indonesia would continue to behave as it has in the past. Of course, there is always more that our Government can and ought to do. For my own part, I share the view of the honourable members for Reid, Moreton and Menzies that the whole question of self-determination ought not be put out of court. I do that against the background that successive Australian governments have not agreed and that the majority of honourable members and the majority of honourable senators would no doubt vote against such a proposition. I also believe that we should be doing all that we can actively to show our concern for those who are the victims of this process and yet who face trial. Those trials are likely to proceed in Jakarta. There are 13 East Timorese who face a number of charges arising out of the disturbances which preceded the massacre. I believe that it would be warranted for Australia to send observers to those trials. I understand that, in response to a question to him in the Senate, the Foreign Minister has indicated that at present, given the resources available to our Embassy in Indonesia and the fact that he will be monitoring the trials by other means, he does not think it warranted to send those observers. For my own part, I would encourage him to reassess that decision. Finally, I would urge this House to reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas. It does, I believe, reflect much more fairly the forelock tugging mentality that the honourable member for Menzies would have us reject. In my opinion the original motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton is stronger, more determined and more accurately reflects the sentiment of this House.",31
21,Mr MOORE,EAST TIMOR,"I welcome the opportunity this morning to discuss this important issue. I begin by saying that the events of 12 November 1991 in Dili, East Timor, were nothing short of tragic. What began as a basic exercise in democratic rights turned into an outrageous abuse of human rights. No-one could deny this and Australia quite rightly joined the rest of the world in condemning the shootings. The Indonesian annexation of East Timor has had a long and troubled history and Australia's reaction has ranged between moral outrage and hostile acceptance. For Australia, the Dili massacre put the entire East Timor issue fairly and squarely back on the front page. It reminded us how close we are to Indonesia and how events in our immediate region necessarily affect us. The way in which we respond to incidents like the one in Dili last November is therefore very important. Too often, I think, we have been quick to criticise and point fingers, eager to barge in and tell others what to do. This not only causes great offence but also, most unfortunately, does not help the people directly affected-in this case the East Timorese. Imagine the outrage in this nation if the Indonesian Government were to tell us how to conduct the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As a middle order power, Australia has an opportunity to influence and shape politics in our part of the world. We can do this only if we learn to work with our neighbours. We do reserve the right-and, indeed, we have the responsibility-to protest human rights abuses where we see them. We have a collective responsibility to stand up for the oppressed and to defend the weak. In the period immediately after the Dili massacre, however, Australia's reaction placed us in a position where we ran the very real risk of being ignored by Indonesia. Sections of our community clearly overreacted to the matter. The South Coast Labour Council in New South Wales, for example, immediately placed bans on the handling of a shipment of Port Kembla steel slabs. What was the benefit of that? Firstly, it had no effect on Indonesian Government policy, secondly, it did nothing. for the depressed lllawarra region of Australia and, thirdly and most importantly, it did nothing for the East Timorese, the people at the centre of the matter and the ones who are too often overlooked. We make a lot of noise about being part of the Asia-Pacific region, but do we really do much about it? If we are to playa meaningful role in the protection of international human rights, we must keep the lines of communication open. We will never be able to do that until we learn to get off our high horse and learn to deal effectively with the issues. The fact is that Indonesia, and most of the Asia-Pacific region, could survive very well without us, and unless we attend to our relationships in this area there is a very real likelihood of some economic and diplomatic isolation bearing down on us. Indonesia is a large nation of 180 million people situated only a few hundred kilometres north of Australia. Our proximity, however, has never enhanced our relations. At present Australia has about $1.3 million invested in Indonesia, and our two-way trade is worth approximately $2.2 billion, with Australia enjoying a small surplus. As we all know, the Asia-Pacific region offers the greatest growth prospects in the world and the greatest opportunities for exporters. At present, however, the trade with our ASEAN neighbours makes up only 10 per cent of Australia's total trade. In the last year this trade increased by 23 per cent from $8 billion to $9.9 billion, and Australian exports to ASEAN in the last five years have trebled to $6.3 billion, whereas imports have doubled. As well as having a trade surplus with Indonesia, Australia now has a trade surplus with Singapore and the Philippines. Despite this, our share of the ASEAN market has remained fairly constant as the economic growth of the ASEAN nations continues to expand. Growth in ASEAN nations averages 6 to 7 per cent, even higher in some places. In 40 years time the Asia-Pacific market will be more than twice the size of the combined markets of America and Europe. The Asia-Pacific region is changing rapidly and the way we relate to our neighbours has never been more important. Indonesia makes it quite clear that it can probably live without us. To avoid being hurt by an AmericanEuropean trade war should the Uruguay Round of GATT fail, we need to develop far closer trading and diplomatic relations with Asia. Japan is no longer the only significant economy in that area. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea are taking over, with the fast developing countries of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia not far behind. If we are to have effective relations with the countries in the Asia-Pacific region we must learn to conduct relations on an equal basis. Protecting human rights and promoting closer links, especially economic links, are not mutually exclusive. If we really want to improve the lives of the East Timorese we will maintain and further develop our relations with Indonesia, not tum our backs. It can be done. Recently the Northern Territory signed an agreement with Indonesia to formalise a five year economic development plan for eastern Indonesia and a trade partnership zone. It is worthwhile recalling that the Northern Territory Minister for Industries and Development, Steve Hatton, had this to say: We believe that by providing this social and economic development to eastern Indonesia, we will be contributing towards opening up Indonesian society. No-one supports what occurred in DiH, but what is heartening is that, for the first time the government (of Indonesia) is taking decisive action. Successive Australian governments-Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke-have accepted Indonesia's presence in East Timor. It is interesting to note that Australia remains one of the few nations-along with India, Papua New Guinea and the United States-that give de jure recognition to the Indonesian presence there. We cannot tum our backs on history-it is time to look forward. The Indonesian reaction to the Dili massacre gives us a good base to work on. Significantly, the Indonesian Government did not accept the initial military explanation of the incident. The Indonesian commission of investigation was critical of the military. It found that, firstly, the number of dead and injured was greater than first acknowledged; secondly, proper riot control procedures were not employed; thirdly, excessive force was used; and, fourthly, the manner in which the dead were handled was inappropriate. President Suharto has removed key military officers from East Timor. The military has disciplined six officers, and eight military personnel are to be court-martialled. These are unprecedented actions for the Indonesian Government. The Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Phillip Flood, has said that the Dili massacre caused a significant shift in Indonesian policies regarding the area, and the Indonesian Government's reaction to it was a major defeat for the hard liners. This is some encouragement. Of course, we remain concerned that 90 people are still missing despite these actions. We also remain concerned about reports of human rights abuses in East Timor, and we must continue to support UN efforts to protect human rights in the region and, indeed, around the whole world. However, if we really want to help the people of East Timor we must not lock ourselves out through selfrighteous lecturing and hysterical overreaction. The growth of the Asia-Pacific region will have major ramifications for everyone in this area. We will all benefit if we all learn to work together in this cause.",32
22,Mr GIBSON,EAST TIMOR," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to re-enter the debate without closing it off. Leave granted.",34
23,Mr GIBSON,EAST TIMOR,"I thank the House for its indulgence. At this time, some four months after the Dili massacre, it is appropriate that the House reconsider the motion and review what has occurred over the four months since we last debated this issue. It is clear that a great deal of activity has occurred and we need to look at the actions taken by both the Australian Government and the Indonesian Government in response to the tragic events of 12 November 1991. When I moved the motion in the House on 29 November last year, I did so with a deep sense of sorrow and distress at the massive loss of life that had occurred in Dili and a sense of frustration that it appeared that, after 16 years of occupation of East Timor by Indonesia, the Indonesian authorities had still not learnt any lessons about the way in which to supervise East Timor. Since that time. I think Indonesia has faced a lot of international pressure, a lot of criticism and justified condemnation over this massacre. Probably it is fair to say that the events of 12 November have become very much a watershed in Indonesian politics because the Indonesian Government's response to the massacre has been the most dramatic that I have ever seen within Indonesian politics and has resulted in some fundamental changes in domestic Indonesian affairs and in the relationship between the Indonesian Government and the Indonesian armed forces. Some of the changes are very welcome. They do not go far enough, but I think they are a healthy start and I welcome them. I would like to spend a few moments examining what has occurred in the last four months and to comment on where I think we should be going from here. Firstly, the Indonesian Government set up a commission of inquiry into the events, and that commission visited Dili and spent some considerable time speaking to a range of people who were either witnesses to or participants in the events of 12 November. From that inquiry we have had a fairly strong report which has clearly criticised the actions of the Indonesian military. It has also criticised the actions of the East Timorese who participated in the demonstration. It has recommended action by the Indonesian Government to pursue the participants involved in the massacre. This is the first time that such a commission of inquiry has occurred and I think it came as a bit of a shock, particularly to the Indonesian military forces, that they would be subjected to such an inquiry. It is very important that it has occurred, and I think it has taught the Indonesian military a very important lesson. Since that time action has been taken against the people identified in· the commission of inquiry's report and a number of military officers have been demoted or have been subject to court martial or have had various other punishments inflicted upon them. Whether or not that is sufficient punishment for the massacre of over 100 people is an important question, but the fact is that it is the first time that the Indonesian Government has taken any sort of action like that, and I welcome it. I might say, however, that I certainly do not welcome the court action, the charges that have been laid against East Timorese who are accused of subversion and who are facing court trials and possible death sentences if they are found guilty. It appears to me quite strange that the people who are the victims of the massacre, the people who have suffered massively from 16 years of occupation, are the only ones who are really actually facing any sort of punitive measures or any severe punitive measures against them. Nevertheless, for the first time, I think, in Indonesia's history since independence, action has been taken against military officers for their excessive actions, and I welcome that. There has been a considerable amount of effort by the international community, including Australia, to address some of the fundamental issues regarding the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. One such issue is the Indonesian military forces' appalling human rights record. The Australian Government has been an active participant in discussions with members of the Indonesian Government to try to convince them that they must change their attitudes and they must change the way in whjch they deal with the people of East Timor. I welcome the fact that the Indonesian Government has recognised that its human rights record is not good and that there is a need to change. But fundamental to any resolution to this East Timorese question is a recognition that the last 16 years of Indonesian administration has proven to be a total failure. Despite all their efforts and the pouring in of probably hundreds of millions of dollars into East Timor, the Indonesian Government has not convinced the East Timorese people that being part of Indonesia is in their best interests. They have abjectly failed in that objective. The East Timorese people do not wish to be part of Indonesia. I think they had made that clear time and time again. I know that the Australian Government has a policy which recognises East Timor's incorporation into Indonesia and on a number of occasions in this House I have indicated my opposition to that policy and my total disagreement with it. I do not believe that we, as a country, have a right to give up any other peoples' right to determine their own future and their right to be a sovereign nation. We do not have that right. We would not like it if any other country did that to us and I do not think we have the right to do that to the East Timorese people. However, be that as it may, the Australian Government does have a responsibility to try to ensure that the East Timorese people do have some opportunities to live in peace and freedom within the Indonesian confederation. I have urged the Australian Government on a number of occasions to raise with the Indonesian Government the need to consider some form of autonomous operation for East Timor within the Indonesian confederation. With the pending visit of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Indonesia, I think it now gives us another opportunity to assert those two fundamental points. One is that Indonesia's control of East Timor for the last 16 years has proven to be a failure and that they need to totally change direction, totally change their policies, remove all their heavy military presence in that province and start bringing about a peaceful existence for the East Timorese people. The second point is that the Indonesian Government needs to give the East Timorese people some autonomous power to control their own affairs. That is not inconsistent with the Australian Government's policy of saying that the Australian Government accepts incorporation. I think that the Indonesian Government can allow the East Timorese to have some semiindependent authority over their own affairs without the constant presence of Indonesian military forces and without the constant intimidation, harassment, beatings and torture that has accompanied that military presence. I would urge the Australian Prime Minister to pursue those two questions with the Indonesian Government in his visit to Indonesia in late April and I also urge the international community to support those measures. Concerning the other points that have been outlined in this resolution, the Australian Government and the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, have worked hard to implement a number of those measures. One of those has been to seek the establishment of an Australian consulate in Dili. We have requested that and have been seeking negotiations with the Indonesian Government on that. That has not yet been achieved but we are hopeful that that will occur. We are also talking within the United Nations and the broader international community about exerting further pressure on Indonesia to come to the party and to ensure that its human rights r-ord dramatically improves, particularly with regard to differences of political opinion and the rights of people in Indonesia to assert their own political views. I hope that, over time, donesia wi11learn a very strong lesson the massacre and will recognise that to accepted in the modem international comprobably munity it has to recognise the basic rights people to express their points of view and be able to live freely.

25,Mr ANDREW,FOREBEARS,"I move: That this House abhors the emerging sense of apology about our past, and calls on all Australians to celebrate the proud achievements of our forebears, whose enterprise in the face of adversity helped ensure our prosperity. I well remember the occasion about 15 years ago when I arrived home late one evening. On the kitchen table was a book entitled This Accursed Land, by the author Leonard Bickel. I was weary, but out of interest I picked up the book because it was the story of Sir Douglas Mawson's exploits in the Antarctic. I tell the story to the House because I well recall that, although I arrived home tired that evening, I could not put that book down. I was captivated by what Mawson had achieved. If there are members in the House who have not read the book, I recommend it to them. Here was a man, desperately ill and alone, without any companions at all. He was suffering-as everyone now knows, but it was unknown then because of the limitations of medical science-from vitamin E poisoning. He was making his way back, he hoped, to the ship in the Antarctic. He stumbled into crevasses. He was bleeding, because the vitamin poisoning caused the skin to part from his hands and feet. Anyone could have forgiven him for simply giving up. I was captivated by the book that evening; I did not want to put it down. I discovered a new hero in my life. Here was a man, perpetually wet, perpetually cold, emaciated, but plodding on. There have been subsequent efforts to Indenigrate the character of Mawson. But for from me his achievement remains something of be which every Australian ought to be, and is, proud. After I read that book, I of thought about the mountains of my own to experience. The things that had seemed so impossible to me became molehills in the light of what Mawson had achieved. In fact, I well remember at that stage in my life, as an irrigator, resolving never again to complain about having to clean sprinklers on a frosty night. I use this story as a backdrop to what I want to say this morning because I think we all need heroes and heroines. We all need to feel a sense of pride in what people have achieved and get a new perspective on what we are trying to achieve in the light of what our forebears have done. I conducted a random survey of school children in my electorate when I was presenting them with a flag. I asked them who their heroes and heroines were in 1992. I conducted a similar exercise with two of my electorate staff who are Adelaide based. I was a bit disturbed when everybody nominated sporting identities, film stars or pop stars, and I thought it was time we looked again at our Australian past. The reason for my motion this morning is that I think it is time we reassured an emerging generation of Australians that we have a great deal to be proud of and they should recognise that fact. In· many cases, we have unintentionally but effectively indoctrinated our children so that they are increasingly apologetic about what happened in Australia in the past. They are wary about lauding former Australian explorers in case they discover that part of what motivated that explorer was some desire for exploitation. It seems timely to raise this point this morning in the light of a call by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for a greater emphasis on Australian nationalism. I know the Prime Minister is asking us to laud our Australian heroes, but I regret the fact that, because of the nature of the beast, he had to frame it in terms that made us feel apologetic about our past. I endorse his call to laud Australian heroes, but why does he want me also to be critical of those whom he quite unfairly accuses of tugging their forelocks to the British? The whole history of Australian military service is something of which we ought to be proud. The Australian military image was built on the fact that Australian service men and women were simply not prepared to tug their forelocks and so got a reputation for individualism, independence and unselfishness. As we move closer to ANZAC Day 1992, Australians should be lauding the courage of former Australian service men and women in theatres of war. We should also recognise that in 1992 for an emerging generation of Australian young people the exploits of Australian service men and women, and the exploits of Australian explorers, are something which we should laud and be proud of. Coincidentally, March 1992 marks 90 years since Charles Yelverton O'Connor committed suicide on a Western Australian beach. How many of our school children have ever heard of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, the Australian whose courage, foresight and tenacity built a pipeline-an engineering feat that had never been achieved before-from the Kalgoorlie goldfields to Perth; and who, because of the criticism levelled at him, took his own life? We ought to be lauding him as an Australian hero. Instead, we hesitate to acknowledge him in case in some way the project he engineered was environmentally insensitive. Why do school children want to laud pop stars when there are people like Edward John Eyre who, at the age of 20, was here on the Molonglo plains finding a way to drove cattle to South Australia? Then, in the feat for which he became known around the world, he made his way from Adelaide to Perth via the Great Australian Bight and, in the process, almost perished. Australians should be proud of what young Australians have done. We should be pleased to acknowledge it and, in fact, to proclaim it around the world. What of Eyre? Eyre could not have made the journey without the assistance of his Aboriginal companion, Wylie. There was nothing discriminatory about that journey and yet we have hesitated to acknowledge what Eyre has done in case in some way we have to apologise for having intruded into what were, and still are, native lands. In fact, in the whole area of Aboriginal involvement in Australia, Australians tend to be apologetic. Of course, things have happened for which we ought to apologise. But the reality is that most of what was done by the early explorers was done with good intentions. For example, we should be applauding the role of the Duracks in north-west Western Australia. We should be applauding those white women who went onto lonely settlements, relied on Aboriginal women to assist them with childbirth, and for whom there was a mutual support mechanism. But we have forgotten that in the note of apology that we have allowed to creep into our account of history. My own involvement was a personal association with Elcho Island and Yirrkala before the Whitlam Government. Of course there were mistakes made in those settlements, but the motivation for the people who were there was non-discriminatory and non-exploitative. I think we fail to remember that history, when it looks back on 1992, will find lots of fault with what we as a parliament, with good intention, have done as well. It is time we were prepared to take a pride in Australia's past achievements and time we were prepared to celebrate what has been our history. We should take an emerging generation of young Australians and give them a sense of optimism about the future instead of so inoculating them with pessimism that they believe that unemployment is something that they will inevitably inherit. It is high time that we recognised our indebtedness to previous generations of Australians. Thanks to them we are richer, freer and wiser than we would otherwise be and we have a heritage of which we may well be proud.",36
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREBEARS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Webster-Yes, and I reserve my right to speak at a later time.",38
27,Dr CATLEY,FOREBEARS,"The motion states: That this House abhors the emerging sense of apology about our past and calls on all Australians to celebrate the proud achievements of our forebears, whose enterprise in the face of adversity helped ensure our prosperity. The speech of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) was very moving and I compliment him on his rhetoric. When he talks about the need for Australian heroes, I agree with him. I sympathise with his description of Australian soldiers, good soldiers, often badly deployed in imperial strategic interests. I sympathise with his statements about our explorers, the way in which they opened up this great continent; the railway makers who have laid down the routes from which our national economy was constructed; and the people who opened up the cattle routes for the movement of livestock around the country. I appreciate all the sentiments he puts forward and I applaud the way in which he has put them. But there was another side to the development of this great country of ours. The honourable member has moved that this House abhors the emerging sense of apology about our past and, while I concur with the sentiment, I think it is put a bit too strongly for me to support. If we go too far in the direction that the honourable member for Wakefield proposes, we acquire an historical sense which used to be called the triumphal school of history, or history of the greats, or the history of the evolution of the present as one of triumphal progress unimpeded by a darker side. It is all too easy to write this kind of history and for much of the early part of the twentieth century the school texts of this country were dominated by that kind of history-the names of the Governors of New South Wales and of the monarchs of England in succession with the ever rising tide of progress and empire. When I first arrived at the Australian National University in the early 1960s, I jumped into the middle of a countervailing school of thought that was known, I suppose, as the labour school of history. It argued that, if one took merely the greats-the governors, the monarchs, the named explorers, the notable engineers, the Mawsons, all of whom played their part in the evolution of this great country-one ignored the role of the great mass of the Australian population, laying down fences in order to keep the sheep runs confined, going about their daily business of constructing houses, roads, settlements and the day-today activities of ordinary Australian people constructing this great nation. If one merely concentrates on heroes, explorers, generals and governors, one misses this underlying social fabric of movement, of progress, of construction, and the creation of a national identity. Many of those people that I befriended at the Australian National University, it might be said, went in another sort of direction which provided much of the underpinning for the ALP version of Australian history which I first experienced, as I said, a quarter of a century ago. They wrote about the role of organised labour from the 1890s onwards in the construction of a regulated Australian economy and society that were unique in the world-uniquely progressive, uniquely egalitarian, uniquely regulated and uniquely democratic. I came to the view at that time, as did most people on this side of the House, I dare say, that in regard to this great tradition-which can be epitomised in the title of a book that I read a couple of years ago-we 'civilised capitalism'. The role of the Australian people in the development of Australia was to make it unique by civilising the capitalist system of economic development and process that Australia had adopted. It had done so in a way that made Australia a unique phenomenon on the face of the earth-uniquely democratic, earlier so than anywhere else, and uniquely regulated, with basic wages, tariffs to protect it against external competition, and so on. That was the predominant debate when I became a scholar at the Australian National University: the triumphal school of history that, broadly speaking, those on the other side of the House adopted; and the labour history which, broadly speaking, those on this side of the House adopted. I think we can now look back on both of them as being inadequate. Over the last 20 years that I have resided in Adelaide I have watched a different kind of historical perspective emerge which one might call apologetic-in the sense that the honourable member abhors in his motionthat involves a reassessment of the role of the development of the Australian nation and which, to some degree, it seems to me, not only corrects the deficiencies of the traditional labour history and the traditional triumphal history but also tends to exaggerate some of the deficiencies. Let me run through a few of these matters to show why I cannot support the word 'abhors'. Over the last 20-odd years, for example, the impact on Aboriginal society of white settlement of this great continent has become more clearly appreciated. The first volume that I read in this context that had a huge impact on me was the third volume of the trilogy by C. D. Rowley on Aboriginal society which was called, from memory, The Destruction of Aboriginal Society. It had ""a huge impact on many intellectuals, with the realisation of the extensive damage that had been done to the Aboriginal people, who have been here for 40,000 to 50,000 years. We now have an appreciation that his description was in itself inadequate in so far as it talked about a passive Aboriginal civilisation being crushed by European colonisers. We now have a much better appreciation of the resistance that they put up and the degree of survival of that Aboriginal civilisation. Another school of thought emerged, I suppose, first with Humphrey MCQueen's book The New Britannia on the way in which the labour school of history had in itself been idealistic and rather deficient in its description of the way in which labour had civilised capitalism and some of its own deficiencies. I dare say that that springs back to the volume by V. Gordon Childs, How Labour Governs. We now have a better appreciation of the role of women, both positive in the sense of their contribution and negative in the sense of their oppressed role in the development of Australian civilisation, which started with the origins of feminist history. I suppose that began with Anne Summers' book Damned Whores and God's Police. One can acknowledge the same kind of appreciation of the impact on the environment, of the evolution of gay society, notably in Sydney, the impact of British imperial economic connections on the development of the Australian economy, and so on. I want to make a point about these critical histories that have developed over the last 20 years and which have had their impact on the school system, as the honourable member quite rightly says, and on popular I suppose one might refer in this regard to The Fatal Shore, which was so popular, apology written by Robert Hughes, about the nature convict society and its contribution to the forebears evolution of the Australian economy. point I want to make is this: while it is that we have constructed in Australia a unique civilisation that has unique, positive attributes that make it, for many of us, one of the desirable places in which to live and, if not perfect society, one with attributes that make it preferable to any other that we have perienced, we still have to recognise that has downsides. The contributions that these people that I have described have made is to alert us to those downsides and to attract as politicians to a recognition of their tinuation and, if that be the case, to devise legislative means for rectifying the situation. I.suppose one has to take progress as being a two-sided thing. On the one side it has undoubtedly occurred but on the other side people have been damaged in the process of progress and we as legislators need to heed of those downsides and try to do something about them. In conclusion, I note a couple of things. One is that each generation will write its history, will look into its own past, to find what is important and attractive and unattracthis tive for it, and it will seek to do something about the present in the light of that past. note that more recently two very basic pillars of our society which have previously not people. received perhaps the critical appreciation that they deserve have come under such stories criticism-the family and the church. I supsacrifice. pose in 20 years time if I were giving this speech, I would be adding them to the critical appreciation of the Australian past. In the meantime, I certainly agree that we should celebrate the proud achievements of our forebears but we should do so in full recogready nition of the downsides that were often incurred in the process of the evolution great nation.",38
28,Mr WEBSTER,FOREBEARS,"Macquarie) (11.36 a.m.)I am responding to the motion moved by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr journalism. Andrew) who moved: That this House abhors the emerging sense of about our past and calls on all Australians of to celebrate the proud achievements of our whose enterprise in the face of adversity The helped ensure our prosperity. true I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak in support of this important motion now before the House. I heartily endorse the most sentiments of the honourable member for a Wakefield and I thank him most sincerely for moving this motion. I am sorry I have not got extime to respond to the comments made by the it honourable member for Adelaide (Dr CatJey). I am not suggesting that I disagree with everything he said at all, but I think that we us are in a day and an age when we need to be conmuch more positive about our past achievements and the effect that they will have in building up morale and a better spirit in this nation. In the recent grievance debate a couple of weeks ago I took great pleasure in highlighting the rich and colourful nature of our take Australian heritage. I called on fellow Australians to cherish our past achievements and preserve those aspects of our heritage that identify us as true Australians. I must say that there was a lot of positive response throughown out the nation to that speech, from the ABC and from the media generally. Unfortunately period seems to be increasingly ignored by our educational system and by many I bodies which ought to be doing more about bringing it to the attention of the Australian We have a glorious past which is filled with of triumph over hardship, suffering and It is an unsurpassed story of determination, perseverance and high achievement. These stories are of men and women who love this country and their fellow Australians, believing passionately in this country's future. They were men and women who were always to defend the principles of freedom and free speech and willingly have risked their of this lives for these very principles. They bravely fought and died for this nation to ensure that future generations enjoyed the freedoms that they enjoyed. If we were to leave this chamber and visit the nearby War Memorial we would find ample testimony to this fact. The memorabilia of the Vietnam conflict and our involvement does, however, remind us of our need to apologise to those who served in that war for our treatment of them on their return.! am not in any way or any sense trying to laud war. I am just mentioning, as the member for Wakefield did, that we have to take on board these great achievements and, in many instances, the payment of the supreme sacrifice by our fellow Australians in giving us a great character as Australian people. The honourable member for Wakefield mentioned ANZAC Day. I well rememberalmost from my earliest memories-my father, who was a World War I veteran, getting me up very early in the morning and making sure that I accompanied him to the dawn service so that I could be reminded of what lowed to those who fought so bravely to keep our freedom going. I am glad to be able to say that there has hardly been a dawn service over the years that I have missed and I am now taking my own children to these services to inculcate in them these memories that must never be forgotten and which have built a great nation. I am glad to say that the attendance at ANZAC Day services in past years is on the increase. This is not because p-ople are apologetic about the past; they are proud of the fact that so many Australian men and women fought and many died to keep this nation free and make it the great nation that it is today. One of the clearest and most recent examples of the Australian spirit and unity, just to come back to recent times in this country, is seen in the events following the Nyngan floods. Not only were the people of Nyngan determined to get on with their lives and build anew, but people from right round Australia willingly came forward, devoting time, skills, money and goods to restore their town to its former condition. A further, even more dramatic example was the demonstration in events that followed Cyclone Tracy. On Christmas morning 1974 with wind speeds of more than 217 kilometres an hour, Cyclone Tracy almost destroyed that city in our far north. Ninety per cent of the buildings in the city were destroyed. Fifty people died and many more were reported missing. Water, electricity, sanitation and communication services were severely disrupted and more than three-quarters of the population were evacuated to other parts of Australia. Not deterred by all of that, the people of Darwin returned and reconstructed the city within a few short years. By 1981 the last available land had been developed and the planning focus was shifted to Palmers ton, 20 kilometres south of Darwin. Lastly-and there are many more examples-we cannot forget the united Australian spirit that was exhibited following the disastrous Newcastle earthquakes. Again, amidst hardship and suffering, the people of Newcastle showed the rest of the world that Australians are not easily deterred. I recall just a couple of weeks ago attending the Lord Mayors prayer breakfast in the city of Newcastle, at which 1,000 people congregated at 7.30 in the morning to bring that city together and to 'Break Free', as the theme was that morning, from all the limitations and the negativisms that are seemingly abounding in that city-or have been. 'So this country of ours is indeed a country of spirited, hard working, loyal and patriotic people, a united people who have believed in the future and have overcome obstacles of distance, extreme climatic conditions and natural disaster to build the Australia of today-a g-reat and wonderful country. Tragically, however, these same high-spirited, determined people are today being bombarded with feelings of guilt from a government which seems ashamed of our past and is desperately trying to bring about a new national identity. Those who are supposed to unite this beautiful country have ridiculed and scoffed at those who feel we can be proud of our heritage. Their recent attacks on the Australian flag, calling for social and mental transformation of the populace, are an example of this. People who openly pay tribute to the monarchy, that has faithfully served this country for the past 200 years are told that they are living in the past and that their concept of the future is going back down a time tunnel to the 1950s to Astor televisions and so on-not that there was anything wrong with those sets. That is a great insult, I believe, to all genuine Aussies. What justification is there for encouraging an attitude of apology for our past? We have made mistakes and we must learn by our mistakes, as both the member for Wakefield and the member for Adelaide have said. We must look to the future with constructive optimism, not dwell on the past and blame our ancestors, our early settlers, for the problems we encounter today. Instead of honestly and frankly admitting that he is the architect of Australia's present economic problems, even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is suggesting that our mental attitude is the problem. I can only endorse the recent reported comments of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when he remarked that the campaign against the flag was to make Australians abandon their national heritage, turn their backs on their history and remodel Australia as a cold, austere, soulless and technocratic state without traditions, heritage or history. I am appalled at this blatant campaign which encourages this sense of apology for our past. Those apology campaigners have shown this House that they hate our flag, the monarchy and the British. They are ashamed of our heritage and they give the impression that they hold the United States of America, New Zealand, Japan and others of our neighbours in contempt. And yet they project themselves as typifying the loyal patriotic Australians of the 1990s. So I ask members of this House who has the problem: the people of Australia or the proponents of this negative campaign? I encourage all those who have been associated with these un-Australian sentiments to reconsider their position and tum away from this campaign that can only bring disunity to a nation with a proven, united and spirited people. I believe that it is the Government which suffers from the identity crisis, not the Australian people. The Australian people already know very well who they are. (TIme expired)",40
29,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREBEARS,"The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is to be congratulated for bringing forward this motion because it is one of the great concerns of this country. It is a thing that the country should be really thinking about, and it is far more important than 90 per cent of the legislation that goes through this House because bound up in this motion is the future of this entire country. I have listened today to the other speakers and, sadly, this is not the great country they speak of, this is not the great and proud nation we should be. We should be that but we are not, and we are not because of our own shortcomings. I think we must ask why this has come about. It is nothing new; it has been in Australia for a long time. I would like to quote from one of my own publications, Australia s Great Challenge, which is in fact about this very subject. The quote is from Randolf Bedford in Nought to Thirty-three. This is tum of the century stuff. He says: There was not an animal pest, scarcely a vegetable pest; fools and the old world supplied them all. .. the complacent reception of them was only part of the inferiority complex of the Australian; accepting the domination of lesser men because they came from afar and lied boldly. This is part of the problem we have had in Australia. There has always been a section in this community that has felt the need to genuflect to somebody else, to denigrate our own history. We see that today as clearly as we have seen it in the past. The difference today is to whom they genuflect. There was a time when we used to kowtow to the British and see in the British something which we should aspire to. We, with the utmost haste, kicked them out in the mid-1960s and embraced the Americans. We cut ourselves free from the British apron string and tied ourselves firmly to the American apron string, and it is the same people today that want to cut free from America and tie us onto North-East Asia, or particularly Japan. These are the advocates of the Gamaut doctrine of the North-East Asian ascendancy. It is a very dangerous thing because there is no future for Australia except as a nation proud and confident in its own right. We are told by fools that we are part of Asia. Australia is not part of Asia. We are indeed further from Asia than a lot of European cities are. We are further from Africa than Britain is. Does anyone suggest that Britain is part of Africa? Asia is in the northern hemisphere. That is not to denigrate Asia; it offers us trade potential, but it is the only trade potential and a lot of our potential must exist in the high earning capacity countries, the high disposable income nations of northern Europe. It is interesting to note that our exports to northern Europe have increased some 400 per cent over the last five years, all of which entered Europe through the United Kingdom. What we are seeing today is an attempt to re-write Australia's history. We have actually heaped praise upon some of these latter day historians who have simply distorted our past. I quote from another of my publications, An Australian Retrospective. I felt the necessity, along with Mark Uhlmann, to write a short history of Australia to try to put it back into perspective and to show the people of Australia, the children of Australia particularly, that this country has a past of which we can be very proud. How can this argument be maintained and how can this knowledge be instilled in children when there are people like Archbishop Hollingworth, citizen of the year? I was driving my car on Christmas Eve, I think it was, and I had to stop the car. 1 was so angry. Archbishop Hollingworth was saying, on the mdio, that we ought to be grateful for Aboriginals because they have 40,000 years of culture and we have none. This is what the man said. He said how great it would be if we could all go to London, sit in a pub there and talk in an Aboriginal language, so that the pommies could not understand us. There are a couple of points about that. Firstly, if we spoke in English they probably would not understand us. Secondly, why would we want to do it, anyway? What an aspiration! The truth is that we have a culture in this country, a culture ""Ie inherited. It is a culture which is not perfect. No culture is. But it is a culture that is a very proud culture that can hold its head up anywhere at any time in history. We have built upon that. We have added significantly to it. What has Australia done? Australia was the country that produced the concept of the eight-hour day. It was Australia that first introduced full adult not franchise; one of the first countries to give votes to women, 23 years ahead of Britain and only just pipped by New Zealand because it had an election earlier than we did. Australia was the country that developed the Torrens land title system, the most equitable form of land ownership in the world, slowly spreading across the United Kingdom some SO-odd years later. This country has a proud history. It may be interesting to note that Ma-k Twain, when he was out here on a lecture tour in the early 1900s, said that Australia has a history so marvellous that it reads like a fairy tale but it is all true. Here was a country that had managed to unite itself without the bloodshed that the United States suffered. Here was a country that had achieved a sense of unity, peaceably, and had come together in a Federal-State relationship through negotiation. There were tremendous pressures trying to divide the country in those days but unity was achieved. What is the motive of these people who denigrate Australia? I can tell honourable members now that the basis of the motive is multiculturalism. This is the issue that is gnawing at the heart of Australia today. Multiculturalism is a policy which has been imposed on the Australian people. In all fairness, I should say that it was probably first promulgated by Al Grassby-I think that should be recommendation enough-certainly introduced by Malcolm Fraser and endorsed by us in our turn. It was introduced in the belief that migrants can be manipulated for their votes. What a racist suggestion that migrants are somehow more stupid than Australians and more easy to manipulate. It is not true. Tlte truth today is rich Italians, Greeks, or whomever, vote for honourable members opposite, the poor ones vote for us. That is the basis of the voting pattern. We do not manipulate by controlling or speaking to some of their leaders. What an absurd suggestion! What is happening is that these people are rewriting Australia's history so that they can start with a clean sheet. It is their desire to take away the culture of the past. The republican movement in Australia, once the ground of the dissident Irish and the Anglo Saxon intellectuals, is now being taken over by the multiculturalists. Its agenda is not a nationalist Australia; its agenda is to wipe clean those planks of Anglo-Celtic culture so they can have a clean sheet of paper on which to write their own history of Australia, a country, which Archbishop Hollingworth says, has no culture. This is exactly what is happening and the people of Australia must realise this before it is too late. The denigration that we suffer in our history is an absolute disgrace and is an indictment of the education system. Children today do not know what occurred in the past. Children today are being taught to judge the errors of the past by the standards of today. It is axiomatic that all actions should be judged by the standards of the times under consideration. I have an Aboriginal friend, a very, very articulate fellow who is totally self-educated. Recently, when we were talking to a group of Aboriginals, he said, 'You fellows have to get the chip off your shoulder. You have to remember what it was like 200 years ago. Australia was a big, open, empty country. It was going to be taken by somebody. You want to thank your lucky stars it was taken by the British because, if it had been taken by some other people, you would not be here to be complaining'. If we look at the standards of the times, that is absolutely right. What we are finding now is that we are looking at these things in isolation and being castigated for them. We are looking at a time when the average life span in the bush of Australia was less than 40 years and life was very hard. People treated each other harshly. One can hardly expect them to treat Aboriginals any differently. So it must be judged in the context of the time. The United Kingdom and our British heritage offer no threat to Australia whatsoever. There is no sovereign threat from the United Kingdom to Australia. There is, however, a very large sovereign threat if we allow ourselves in our cultural cringe to continue to be tied in as the lackeys of some other nation. Whether that is Asia or the United States, whether it is Japan or the UK, it is wrong for Australia. We must stand tall as an independent country, proud of our heritage, and build on the heritage we have. For better or for worse, it is our heritage. We cannot rub it out. We cannot take back a single line of it. On the whole, it is a heritage we can all be proud of. It is a heritage that the people who come to Australia of their own free will should be prepared to endorse and to enjoy and to celebrate.",42
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREBEARS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. PRIME MINISTER'S COMMENTS ON NA,44
31,Mr CHARLES,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"I move: That the House deplores attacks by the Prime Minister on the Australian Monarch, our monarchical system of parliamentary democracy and the World War II British cabinet and military command. Mr Deputy Speaker, once upon a time we had a quiet and sensible debate regarding the future of the monarchy in Australia, our monarchical system of parliamentary democracy, our Australian flag and whether or not any or all of these institutions require change. Today the quiet and sensible debate has given way to irrational diatribe, as dogma replaces intelligent comment. In truth, the issue of republicanism is little more than a diversionary tactic by a Prime Minister frightened to defend his actions in bringing on the mother of all recessions and his statement of no hope entitled One Nation. We Australians face a grim future if we do not get on with repairing our broken economy. Our priority should be to address the structural reform so necessary to our economic good health, lest we leave our children a debased inheritance. We need not have this debate today, but the handball of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot go unchallenged. In speaking to this motion, I will set out the proposition that I believe in and support our particular form of parliamentary democracy, based on an Australian monarch as head of state and our federal Constitution to encapsulate the mores of our political system and define areas of responsibility in a peculiar form of writing known as English. Clearly, the Prime Minister, in attacking our monarch, has attacked Australia, has set loose forces of divisiveness and division designed to create not one nation but one job for one man, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Our Prime Minister apparently believes that we compromise our identity by acknowledging our history, our past and our heritage. Like a dreamer who would make himself into that which he is not, the Prime Minister denies our history and would have us be something which we are not in order to become his true Australians. The true cultural cringe would be to deny our past, to pretend to be that which we are not and which we have never been, in order to curry favour with new friends and new acquaintances. A real nation, a grown-up nation, does not change its constitution or its mechanisms of government just because it has changed its trading partners. This business of constitutional change is indeed serious stuff. The Prime Minister's assertion, 'I'm Australian', is a statement of fact and I will today, as an immigrant to this great nation, as a new Australian, make the same statement of fact. I am also an Australian. But the honourable member for Blaxland wishes to deny his roots, his association through the past with Great Britain. I wish not to deny my roots and believe that others would accept as a sign of maturity my understanding and my love of my roots and my heritage. I have accepted the welcoming arms of a new nation and a new culture which has subsumed my identity but which has not taken from me the reality of my past. I am proud of where I came from and what I am. Only an individual with a giant inferiority complex would deny his birth right to score a cheap political point, and it is obvious to all who care to listen that the honourable member for Blaxland has denied his roots, denied his heritage and denied his country. Dumping on Great Britain in order to divert attention from issues of substance is a blatant act of cowardice. Our monarch, by tradition, cannot publicly defend herself but depends on those of us who believe in the monarchy to provide such defence. Attempting to deny that Great Britain founded our nation, and bequeathed us our system of law and our Constitution, is at best silly. I support our system of parliamentary democracy on two levels, one practical and one emotional. On a practical level, Australia has the sixth longest serving democratic parliamentary system in the world, uninterrupted by military takeover or dictatorship. Only the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Switzerland and Sweden can claim longer terms of uninterrupted democracy. Four of those six nations have incorporated a monarchy as their head of State. Australia is clearly a very old country in terms of our system of government and we exhibit a political stability which is admired by the rest of the world. Our Constitution and our monarchy have served Australia well. There is an old adage, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. On an emotional level, I swore allegiance to the Queen of Australia because I wanted to vote for those individuals who are going to represent me in State and Federal parliaments. Gough Whitlam made a good fist of messing up my business life and I wanted to vote for the Party which would pick the Prime Minister to replace him. I swore allegiance to my Queen but I did not deny my birth right. The Consul-General of the United States of America, however, had other priorities and did not hesitate to strip from me my citizenship, to declare that I had expatriated myself, and the consequence was unifonn loss of nationality. On a very personal and emotional level, I support the Queen, and yet an ancestor of mine seven generations ago signed a document known as the Declaration of fudependence of the United States of America. I support the Queen as our head of state and will treat her with the utmost respect. If anyone in this place has the credentials to support a republic it would be me, but in all the current circumstances I do not. The Prime Minister has attempted to link our future economic commitment to South East Asia with republicanism .. To make such a connection is like saying that one can only relate to the South Pole if one wears fur or feathers. Perhaps our I).ew Prime Ministerthe one we had to have-will now, in order to curry favour for external trade, become a furry feather-wearer. That same Prime Minister stated that during World War II Britain decided not to defend the Malay Peninsula, not to worry about Singapore. From my reading of history, Britain did defend Singapore, to the limit of its available resources and in the circumstances at the time. 1\vo major British ships were sunk and many tens of thousands of British troops were either killed or taken as prisoners of war by the Japanese. His blatant attempt to rewrite history to serve his own cheap political diversionary tactic is not the act of a statesman but that of a schoolyard bully who would try to win the argument with force or bluster rather than logic or reasoned debate. The Prime Minister not only denigrates what it means to be an Australian but has proved himself to be a rather inferior military historian. As to our flag, the flag of Australia is the symbol of our national identity which sets us apart from other nations. That symbol has been proudly carried by millions of Australians in sporting events around the world, at international conferences and, not least importantly, in many foreign wars. Those Australians who have placed their lives on the line for their country, who have placed nation above self, both the quick and the dead, will not thank us if we tamper with the symbol-our flag-that represents our nationhood. It is said by this Prime Minister that our flag represents another cultural cringe to Great Britain because it contains the crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick. The flag of South Africa contains those crosses in fonns of the Union Jack, as does the flag of New Zealand, and I am not advised of any move by citizens of those nations to decry their heritage or change their flag. The State flag of Hawaii, now a State in the United States of America, contains those same three crosses. And the citizens of Hawaii would fight to retain their flag. If the Prime Minister remains insistent that we divorce ourselves from all things English, perhaps he would have us change our language as well. God save the Queen, and God save Australia!",44
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Hicks-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,46
33,Mr WRIGHT,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Capricornia) (12.07 p.m.)The motion before the House is a misrepresentation of the facts, as was the speech just made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). It is a distortion of the truth and it is being used by the conservative parties in this Parliament to launch an unwarranted attack on the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating). There is a cartoon in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald showing two people-one a fellow with a newspaper saying, 'Popularity Hewson down', the other, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) carrying a dead cat with 'GST' on it and saying, 'But why?'. I would suggest that the cartoonist, Moir, could start a series in which the next cartoon could show the dead tariff turkey, because as the people of Australia listen to the policies that the Opposition is pursuing on tariffs, those policies will become a dead turkey that will smell and bring the Leader of the Opposition's popularity down. Such a series of cartoons could also then go to the dead monarchy mouse, because it is another example of what is going to bring the Opposition down. It is something that the people of this country will simply not accept as presented in the way that the Opposition is presenting it. The public comments by the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Opposition demonstrate just how much the Liberal and National parties are now out of touch with the attitu-es and sentiments of Australian people, especially young Australians. Those parties really lack an understanding of what people really want for their country. They are blind to the innate desire of the vast majority of Australi-ns, who want to be truly an independent nation. They do not want to be British, they do not want to be American, they do not want to be Asian; they want to be Australian. That is something the Opposition has not understood. The motion moved by the honourable member for La Trobe is typical of the halfhearted Australians in the conservative parties who long for the old imperial days, who have some sort of dream about a great British Empire, who see themselves one day on bended knee receiving a knighthood and who, like the old English working class, would pull at the forelock as they bowed to the squires and the lords of the manor. That is the past and Opposition members want to go back tit. Amazing, quite amazing! The motion is also part of the saga of misrepresentation by the Opposition as to what the Prime Minister said when Her Majesty the Queen was here. But the people are not fooled. He did not attack the monarchy, he did not attack the Queen of this country, Queen Elizabeth. He has instead simply stated a fact of life, a reality of the now, and that is that Australia ought to be an independent nation. At no time was the Prime Minister offensive, nor was he rude nor was he discourteous to our Queen. Inste-d he was the opposite. He said, and I quote from the transcript: . . . it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to Canberra. He went on to say to Her Majesty: ... it is my primary purpose to congratulate you on the 40th anniversary of your accession to the throne. He thanked her for her visit. What he said and - hat he did was correct, it was proper, and It was courteous. In the crowds, again something the Liberals have tried to highlight as something that was wrong, at all times the - i-e Minister was conscious of his responslblltty to the monarch. He introduced her to people whom he knew she would find interesting. He also introduced her or directed her to people that she already knew-ex-Prime Ministers and others. Yet the Opposition tries to make out that he did something wrong by placing his hand gently and courteously behind her in directing her amongst the people. That is an Australian way, and if honourable members opposite want to cast it aside let them do so at their peril politically. What the Prime Minister did was to make the Queen extremely welcome. He also stood up for this country. As the transcript clearly shows, he pointed out that we are different nations. We are two different generations because of the time that has passed since the Queen first visited this country. He said that just as Britain has looked to Europe, and correctly so, Australia needs to look at its own region, and rightly so. He said: As our constitutional relationships has evolved so have the circumstances of our economic and political lives. These days we must both face the necessIties of a global economy and global change of often staggering speed and magnitude. We must also face regional realities. Just as Great Britain some time ago sought to make her fut-re secur- in the European Community, so Austra.ha - ow vIgorously seeks partnerships with countrtes In our own region. Our outlook is necessarily independent. That is what the Prime Minister said, and the vast majority of people agree with him. If the honourable member for La Trobe does not let him go back to Yankeeland. We do not n'eed his so- here. We need people who are AustralIans first, not half-hearted Australians, as he is demonstrating himself to be Mr Webster-That is very un-Australian.",46

38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Smith-By making a personal reflection on a particular member by suggesting that he should depart this country, having sought citizenship and served in this Parliament, the honourable member for Capricornia demeans himself in the way he carries on.

42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat and I will make a ruling and give a direction on what has been put to me by the honourable member for Bass. I took it that the comments that were made by the honourable member for Capricomia were by way of support of argument rather than direct comment to the honourable member involved. But if the honourable member involved has taken ·offence, the honourable member for Capricornia should withdraw the remark.",48

54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Order! The honourable member for Bass will refer his comments to me. Mr Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, what I was saying was that you have asked formally for the honourable member to withdraw his remarks because they have been found to be offensive to the honourable member for La Trobe and, indeed, other honourable members here in the chamber now. It would facilitate debate if he were simply to do so; for, were he not to do so, then a motion could be moved that he be ejected from the House.",48
55,Mr WRIGHT,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"I am not prepared to withdraw those remarks, Mr Deputy Speaker. I stand by those remarks after the personal and unwarranted attack made by the honourable member for La Trobe on the Prime Minister. It was noted that the honourable member for La Trobe did not react to my comments. Instead, the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), had to do so. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have noted that he did not ask me to withdraw; he said he was referring the matter to the Privileges Committee. Let him do that, but let me continue my remarks. I want to make the point that the Opposition is totally unaware of the feeling of people in this country. If one goes to any school, such as the grammar school in Rockhampton which I visited, and talks to people in the school, the young grade 7 studentsMr Hicks- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think the honourable member is showing contempt for the Chair and for the Houses of Parliament and something should be done about it.",48
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Order! I have asked the honourable member for Capricornia to withdraw. On that basis I would ask him to respect the ruling of the Chair and to make such a withdrawal. Whilst it is very difficult in the type of debate that is before the Chair to make a judgment on what is within the parameters and what comments can or cannot be made, it is usual that if a member or members take offence the comments are withdrawn.",49
57,Mr WRIGHT,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my comments were that his remarks were un-Australian and that if he wants to hold those views he should go back to Yankeeland. I stand by those remarks. I will not withdraw those remarks. (TIme expired)",49
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"The course of action to be taken by the honourable member for La Trobe is in his hands. I think that it would have assisted the conduct of the debate if the comments had been withdrawn, but I take the comments that the honourable member has made and I suppose the House will sit in judgment of those comments. It is then in the hands of the House to take what other action it would like to take. Mr Smith-With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I respect the ruling and the comments you have just made. I think the record should show that this has been a rather appalling incident and it reflects poorly on the honourable member. Mr Wright-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Mr Smith-I think you should allow the forms of the House to be followed. I am speaking under indulgence. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you have been tolerant. The forms of the House would normally require a member to withdraw in circumstances such as this, as I am sure the honourable member, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table, and also the Deputy Speaker who has just come into the chamber would agree. Given that the honourable member's time has expired, there are avenues for the honourable member for La Trobe to follow in order to make comments about the honourable member's remarks. I found his remarks offensive. I think it is very regrettable and I think the Hansard should record this fact.",49
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,Order! The honourable member for Bass is not assisting by prolonging this matter.,49
60,Mr HICKS,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"I was sad about what was happening here today and about some of the things that have been said, but now I am very angry. I am angry not so much about republicanism, the monarchy or anything else, but about the actions of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright). Can I say this: I come from a working class background, as do most people in this Parliament. My forebears were miners, labourers and so on. When those second and third generation miners from Cornwall, England, Ireland and Scotland came up from underground, I am sure they had the greatest respect for the Queen, even though they were socialists. I am very disappointed by what has happened here today and by the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We are all aware of what this is about. The Prime Minister has obviously done some polling. He has found that at least 50 to 60 per cent of the people living in Australia today were either not born here or their parents were not born here. Because of the economic situation in which we find ourselves, he has taken us on a flight of fancy. He thinks that by doing so he is going to divert the attention of the people from what is happening in this country. The Labor Party over the past several years has used key words. One was·compassion'. Any party less likely to have compassion one could not name. Of course now it is tugging the forelock. It says, 'We do not want to tug the forelock to Britain, we do not want to tug the forelock to the Queen' and so on. But this motion really just shows what our cultural cringe is. We are proud to be Australian, we are proud of our background, proud of our history. We do not have to bow down or kowtow to anyone. But if we know that, why do we have to keep saying it? Is it some sort of expression of our cultural cringe that we have to go out wearing a T-shirt with 'I love Australia' or 'I am not afraid of anyone' on it? To me, this stand that the Prime Minister is taking is absolute nonsense. We have an evolving political situation in Australia. It may be that one day we will a republic, it may be that one day we will change the flag. But the people in Australia today are not concerned about that. What they are concerned about is the one million unemployed. The Prime Minister can go on, do anything, say anything, as we know he used to doing, but that does not change the argument. After eight years in the job of Treasurer, this country has been absolutely wrecked. Now this Prime Minister is in a position where he can do worse damage. We have heard some of the statements he has made. And he changes from day to day. This is the man who was attacking MCEwen ism, particularly the National Party-MCEwenism and protectionism; the worse thing that could have come to this country was protectionism. Yesterday on his VIP flight down to Melbe bourne, apparently, like St Paul, he had a conversion. Although St Paul was struck blind in his conversion, the Prime Minister was blind to the economic situation in Australia before he got onto the plane. When he got down there and got amongst the workers he said, 'I had better support protectionism here. We will change our policy overnight and now protectionism is a good word'. This is what we are used to. He will say anything, he will do anything. What we would like him to do is start talking about jobs. We see the rest of the world jumping on the band wagon and starting to trade with South Africa. Where are we? Behind the eight-ball. Why? Because he tugs the forelock to his leftie mates. That is what it is all about. Why does he not do something about our trade with Taiwan, our policies on Taiwan and other countries? Because he is tugging the forelock to his leftie mates. That is what it is all about. We in this country saw the bad manners displayed to the Queen. When Ceausescu was here a few years ago everyone was racing around kowtowing to him. We have had Mandela, we have had people from China and Russia over the years. I do not hear them saying anything about those people. But for some reason or other we are attacking the Queen. I just cannot understand this mentality. The biggest crime of the lot of course is be what this Prime Minister has done to the workers of this country. That is what this motion is all about, trying to hide the facts from the people of Australia, trying to get on the band wagon people who really do not understand what is happening, trying to say is to them, 'Look, we need a republic, we need to change the flag, we dislike the Queen' and so on. It is all just a great big smokescreen. One person who came to my office the other day is very far removed from the Lodge and from Buckingham Palace. This woman has five children, and a husband working. This Government has bragged about how it has reduced real working wages, but what it does not say is that it has reduced the living standards of every Australian in this country, every working Australian. This woman would better off if her husband were unemployed. He works for the local council on the garbage truck, he gets a reasonable salary, but if he were unemployed now she would be far better off. She could get the health care card. If she got that card and that benefit, then she could get pre-school education for her children. What sort of a country is this when we have a Prime Minister denigrating the Queen, the flag and talking about a republic and we cannot even find work for our people? (TIme expired)",49
61,Mr COURTICE,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Hinkler) (12.24 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I oppose this motion andMr Charles- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Considering the events that have taken place in this chamber this morning, considering the fact that the Chair made a ruling which was not observed by the honourable member who was speaking, the honourable member for Capricornia, I would suggest to the Deputy Speaker that it might be appropriate for him to refer this matter to Mr Speaker for resolution in the whole House.",51
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"MI' Jenkins)Order! After consultation with the Clerk and the Chairman of Committees, I intended to take that course of action. The honourable member should hear from either Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees later.",51
63,Mr COURTICE,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"I oppose this motion outright. I think that the point must be understood that neither the Prime Minister Mr Keating nor anyone on this side has criticised Her Majesty the Queen. I admire the Queen and I respect her for the fine lady she is. And I admire my British heritage; I am very proud of it. I am equally as proud of my Irish, Scottish, Danish and French heritages. It is not disrespectful to be proud to be an Australian because I am an Aussie first and foremost. We will not be a full-grown nation until we are a democratic republic. Saying that is not being disrespectful to the Queen all. It is showing our first and foremost loyalty to this, our own nation. The great Voltaire once said, 'To the living we owe consideration, to the dead only the truth'. In speaking the truth it certainly rub up the wrong way certain members of the Establishment. It does rub up the wrong way people from the Melbourne Club if we point out the historical facts of World War I or World War II or many of the other events that happened in our past. But I believe it is important in this debate, and in the debate that will rage on in this nation for quite some time, to point out those facts. I admire and respect the courage of British soldiers, the British naval and air force personnel, but not respect some of the idiots like Haig and Hamilton, the High Command during World War I, who butchered our soldiers at Fromelles and Pozieres. Anyone who would justify their military strategy does not understand military campaigning, and to query their strategy is not disrespectful at all. I also do not respect the British paratroopers who shot down 13 civilians in Londonderry in 1972. It was gutless and cowardly and it is something noone who believes in democracy should respect. But in saying that I am not showing disrespect to the Queen or to our tradition, it is simply telling the truth. It is also a truth that during World War II, Mr Menzies, who was the Prime Minister at the time, drew a red line through Brisbane and said he would concede Queensland to the Japanese. Of course, Mr Bjelke-Petersen years later tried to do just that by selling it and giving it away. Telling the truth on that matter is not disrespectful. It is telling the facts as they are. The Prime Minister did strike a chord on this side of the House about pride in our nation. It certainly showed the forelock tugging of the people on the other side. If anyone has any doubt whatsoever about the position Britain takes today in the world, I suggest that honou-able members try to sell our sugar, our wheat, our wool and our beef to Britain and see what they do. They laugh at at you because they are part of Europe. Our future lies here in our global part of the world, and to say so is being proud of being an Aussie. I certainly do not intend to bend my knee to a bunch of gout-ridden, whiskydoes soaked members of the House of Lords or limp-wristed members of the aristocracy and/or members of the Opposition. As for British military leaders, one should remember-as did the previous speaker, who moved this motion-names such as Kitchener, a man who set up a concentration camp in Bloemfontein where 30,000 Boer women and children were starved to death. Had he lived and been to Nuremberg he would have been tried and hanged as a war criminal. One I do should remember the Union Jack flying over Wexford where 30,000 women and children were butchered by the British any, or Culloden Moor or Bannockburn. One should take note of history. If one really wants to debate this issue on the military high command, one should remember that Churchill withdrew destroyer escorts from our forces and our troops had to come back from the Middle East and cross the Indian Ocean without destroyer escorts at a time when we had to defend ourselves. That should never be forgotten. It was a man called John Curtin in the Labor Government who defended this country from the Japanese, not the Tories opposite, while Menzies was hiding under a bed. That should never ever be forgotten. (TIme expired)",51
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE MONARCHY AND BRITAIN,"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Waste Transport",52
65,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In this grievance debate I wish to raise serious matters and concerns about the perfonnance record of the Environment Protection Authority, the EPA, in Victoria. A Melbourne Sunday Age article of 3 November last year did say that Victoria is better off overall for the efforts of the EPA which now in its twenty-first year employs over 300 staff and has a budget of $20.7 million. However, a three-week investigation by the Sunday Age also came to the following disquieting conclusions, and I quote from the Sunday Age article: The level of prosecutions has dropped from 50 to 31 in the past year, while the level of infringement notices on industry has been cut from 641 to 341 over the past two years. This suggests either greater environmental awareness among businesses or less EPA vigilance. The EPA received more than $1m in donations from major industry associations in the past year, prompting charges from some sectors that the relationship between the polluters and the pollution watchdog had become too cosy. The monitoring of industry pollution is left largely to industry. This system of self-monitoring relies too much on mutual trust and could be exploited, say EPA critics. Proceeds from industry levies in the year ended June were $2.8m below earlier estimates. Though the Authority was restricted by political manoeuvring, critics say the EPA is generally a poor money gatherer. The article concluded with a comment by a senior public servant that the EPA has not quite outlived its usefulness, 'but it does lack a vision ... what needs to happen is a more open debate about the future'. A more open debate about the EPA's abysmal record in contro11ing the dumping of waste oil in northern Victoria is certainly needed. Freedom of information documents I have recently obtained from the EPA, press articles and other information substantiate this concern. This concern is highlighted in a series of incidents that are known to have taken place since 1989. During the winter of that year, approximately 35 acres of that year's harvest of peaches and plums were destroyed after the application of waste oil, supposedly to kill blight on the leaves of the trees in Turnbull Bros orchards at Shepparton. The Turnbull orchard is a major supplier, I might add, to Ardmona fruits. The oil was provided by M. Hall and Sons of Ardmona who in tum obtained their supplies from Worth Environmental Ltd, of 92 Ordish Road, Dandenong South. Though there was no analysis of the oil concerned on this occasion, clearly there was something seriously amiss with the oil to cause such a dramatic wipe-out of a crop. EPA Melbourne was advised of the offences and parties involved, but I understand that no further action was taken. The offences were essentially related to the failure by Worth to provide the relevant documentation; that is, the waste transport certificates. I would point out, for the information of the House, that a waste transport certificate consists of three parts: part A-generator, part B-transport, and part C-receiver. Failure to complete certification carries a maximum penalty of $10,000. 1\vo years after these peculiar events, at 1.40 a.m. on 28 July 1991, a tanker owned by Drake Haulage Pty Ltd, of 25 Lusty Street, Arncliffe, New South Wales, hit the bridge at Nathalia. Approximately 3,000 litres of the tanker's load of 26,000 litres of waste oil spilled into the Broken Creek, which is part of the Murray River system. At the time, the tanker was travelling from Bendigo to its consignment destination at Worth Oil Pty Ltd, in Windsor, New South Wales, Worth Oil having also commissioned the vehicle. The oil had been collected by Rick and Sue Bell Pty Ltd of Bendigo, who collect waste sump oil around the area and send it to Worth Oil in Sydney where it is refined for reuse. Subsequent investigation by the EPA indicated that Bells had completed the appropriate waste transport certificate but, again, there was no documentation in relation to Worth. Ricky Bell, when interviewed by the EPA, said that Bob Cooper of Worth, Sydney, Worth Managing Director, David Dunworth, and Pat Davern of Worth, Melbourne, had all told him that as the oil was 'burning fluid', certificates were not required to cart it. Offensupplied ces were obviously committed by Bells, Drake Haulage and Worth. The FOI documents show that penalty notices were issued subsequently by the EPA against Bells and Drake, but again there was no action against Worth. If the use of waste oil as a winter oil is a significant environmental problem in the Goulburn irrigation region, so, it must also be pointed out, is its use as a dust suppressant. In fact, a letter of 5 June 1991 from Mr Carl Schaller of the EPA to the Chief General Manager of the Department of Agriculture refers to both these problems as being 'widespread in the district'. Other FOI documents obtained from the EPA support this contention. Yet again a piously expressed EPA concern is not matched by appropriate action. Only two months after the letter referred to was written, a complaint was received that a local orchardist had arranged for over one kilometre of government road near Toolamba to be oiled as a dust suppressant. It is believed that Worth in Melbourne provided approximately 30,000 litres of waste oil for this purpose. The EPA is understood to have taken no action against Worth over this incident. A parallel situation arose in Riverview Drive in Shepparton on 29 October last year, when another orchardist dumped 20,000 Htres of waste oil as a dust suppressant. The incident was reported extensively on the front page of the Shepparton News of 31 October and 1 November. It is understood Worth was again involved, but I will decline to comment in detail on this specific incident, as the EPA informs me that it is still being investigated. There have been other incidents involving Worth, which is notorious for its practice of moving tankers with 20,000 to 30,000 Htres of waste oil from Melbourne for dumping in and around the Shepparton area. An analysis of the waste sump oil shows that it contains industrial waste, including chloroform and other dangerous substances. Waste transport certificates are not completed by Worth and no charge is made for the waste oil, it being under the guise of a free service. The financial benefit to Worth of this illegal activity is easy to calculate. As I understand, it costs about 20c a litre to legally dispose of waste oil. A tanker with a 30,000-litre capacity would entail a total disposal cost of $6,000 or below for a less than full capacity load. Given that the delivery cost from Melspray bourne to Shepparton would be approximately $1,000, the gain per trip to Worth could be up to $5,000. Before concluding with a number of critical questions for the EPA and the Victorian Government, I indicate that the State Manager  former EPA area coordinator who drafted the Worth licence. Worth Dandenong also has another former EPA employee running its incinerator. I ask for an explanation of why the EPA has effectively condoned the dumping of waste oil in northern Victoria over recent years, especially as some oil dumped undoubtedly contained the highly toxic polychlorobiphenyl. PCB has been banned since the mid-1980s, but previously was used as insulation on certain electronic equipment such as transformers. Why have no specific safeguards been established by the EPA, such as an obviously sensible requirement that oil be properly analysed before it is released for dumping? When EPA action has been taken over such incidents, why has it been directed more at those on the periphery than at Worth whose waste oil is the base cause of the incidents? Moreover, when the average fine for generally smaller companies is about $2,000 per charge, why does the larger Worth company incur an average fine of only $360 on each charge? When nine of the 31 EPA prosecutions initiated last financial year came from the Shepparton office, why did the Shepparton area have only one inspector out of the EPA's 1991 strength of 41 inspectors? I seek leave to table the FOI documents from the EPA and press articles to which I have referred throughout this speech. I have already shown the FOI documents concerned to the Minister. Leave granted. Goods and Services Tax",52
66,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The issue of the goods and services tax is set to be rejected by the Australian people more intensely and with more ferocity than any other political issue since the Vietnam war. No-one will be left untouched by this iniquitous tax. Every Australian will be compelled to pay this loathsome tax if Dr Hewson wins the next Federal election. It seems to many of my constituents that the debate on the goods and services tax thus far has been concerned primarily with the vantage point of people living in metropolitan Australia. Whilst their fears are well founded, the effects of the goods and services tax on people living in northern Australia would be much more harsh. A recent paper by a distinguished Australian economist, Professor Percy Harris of James Cook University of North Queensland, entitled Goods and Services Tax and Interregional Equity, has provided a number of examples that people living in regional Australia would bear a heavier burden of tax and cost increase from the imposition of the GST than would people living in metropolitan Australia. Professor Harris said: With GST of 15 %, the cost of a basket of goods and services (assuming it does not contain zero rated or exempt commodities) which costs $400 in Brisbane (before GST) will rise by $60 in Brisbane. However, in remote areas like Darwin, Mt Isa and Port Hedland, where the same basket of commodities costs, say, $480 (before GST), the cost will rise by $72. This additional $12 GST paid for the same basket of commodities is a basis for interregional equity considerations. GST will be offset in part by a reduction in other taxes. A closely related tax, the wholesale sales tax, will be abolished. Twenty years ago this would have been of benefit to Northern Australia but today so much wholesaling is done in the capital cities that the effect will not be very much greater in Northern Australia than in The Rest of Australia. Similarly the abolition of excise duties on petroleum products will mean price reductions much the same everywhere in Australia, but its replacement by GST will mean a tax addition that wit! be higher in remote areas where petrol prices are higher (because of transport costs). However, lower fuel prices may lead to lower prices in the North, although on past evidence commodity prices in the North rise with increases in fuel prices, but do not fall when fuel prices fall ... firms paying less excise on petroleum products and less payroll tax may take the opportunity to boost profits and not pass on the tax cuts in full ... transport costs may not fall as much as the decline in fuel prices ... Also, there are good reasons to argue that GST will increase prices more in Northern Australia and other remote areas than in the populous metropolitan areas, because of higher prices for consumer goods and services on which GST is levied. Tinkering around the edges of the Zone rebate scheme, as is proposed in the reform package, will do little to offset this impact. As details of the Fightback package become better known, there is rising fear and opposition to the goods and services tax at every level of Australian society. One particular industry in north Queensland that will be savaged by the GST is the tourism industry. For many years tourist operators in Queensland have opposed the introduction of a bed tax. The goods and services tax is an implicit bed tax which tourists, both domestic and international, will be forced to pay. As Professor Harris has pointed out, the 15 per cent tax will also apply to meals, travel, films, film processing and many other items which are essential to the profitability of the tourism industry. Tourism is now Australia's major foreign exchange earner. The tourism industry earned $7.3 billion last year for Australia, which was more than any other industry. Approximately 2.4 million tourists arrived in Australia-7 per cent more than in 1990. That was despite the Gulf war. Why is it then that the coalition refuses to zero rate the tourism industry under the goods and services tax? This decision to double tax the tourism industry is perverse, inexplicable and boneheaded. It goes against all logic. It goes against the principles of successful business practices. The call by tourism chiefs to zero rate the goods and services tax as it applies to the tourism industry has been ignored by the coalition. The chief executive officers of Australia's tourism industry have reminded the coalition again and again that the Australian tourism industry is the best economic prospect that Australia currently possesses. Tourism is also the world's number one growth industry. In answer to a question without notice on Tuesday this week, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) cited the Swedish experience of proposing a goods and services tax on tourism. In 1990 Sweden broadened its value added tax to include tourism services and, as a consequence, it suffered a massive 13 per cent fall in bed night numbers. The new Swedish Government was forced to reduce the value added rate with effect from 1 January of this year because of its adverse effect on the industry. Most OECD countries provide concessional VAT rates for tourism services such as hotels, restaurants and domestic travel. The Liberal and National parties' Fightback! document ignores overseas experience and applies the goods and services tax to tourism at the full rate. It is astonishing, to say the least, that the coalition is persisting with its determination to tax tourism to the hilt. One of Australia's leading tourist industry bodies, the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia, has roundly criticised the goods and services tax proposal and in particular the failure of the Liberal and National parties to zero-rate inbound tourism. A leading Australian tourism development manager, who has recently been involved in negotiations to develop a new $170m international hotel in one of Australia's leading tourist destinations, has had the nightmare of a goods and services tax as it applies to the tourist industry brought home to him very forcibly by the international consortium associated with the project. The development manager claimed that he was astonished that the negotiators representing the hotel operator demanded that provision be made in the management agreement for any future GST to be counted as part of total revenue for the purpose of calculating the contributions to the replacement and renewal reserve. This is what he had to say: When I challenged them on this point, they initially claimed that this was necessary because their experience was that the imposition of a GST invariably resulted in significant increase in the cost of goods to be purchased from the replacement and renewal reserves of their hotels. In the USA they have plenty of experience with 'consumption taxes'. T argued that the Liberals' proposed GST was to be offset by removal of sales taxes, with a consequent 'revenue neutral' result. Their reaction was the laugh and say, 'That's what they all say'. Then came the most astonishing news of all. They argued that, in their extensive experience, the revenue of international resort hotels from overseas tour group operators is invariably reduced by the full amount of any GST from the moment it is introduced. Their logic was very convincing. They pointed out that intemational resort hotels are-and we know this from our own experience-in direct competition with other international destinations. Hence, their rates tend to be set not only by comparison with competitor hotels in the same market, but by comparison with hotels in competitor markets in other countries. In Australia we see many examples of this-for example, Noumea competes with Bali. Accordingly, if a 15 per cent GST is introduced, then the operators of international resort hotels in Australia will almost certainly find that they must absorb the full cost of that GST by maintaining their net rates to the wholesalers at previously established levels, and paying the GST themselves out of that revenue. The concerns of the development manager are well-founded. The fact is that the goods and services tax will stifle investment in tourism infrastructure. I ask those opposite these questions: are they aware that the 15 per cent goods and services tax will destroy tourism in this country? (TIme expired) Custody of Children",54
67,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 25 September 1989, the mother of two children was bashed to death with a house brick by her de facto husband. This was while he was on bail awaiting trial for a previous assault upon her. The younger of their two daughters was also severely assaulted, resulting in an extensive skull fracture, intercranial bleeding, a right hemiplegia and a sixth cranial nerve palsy-in layman's terms, this 13-month-old child had what we would call a stroke. On 14 August 1991 in the Supreme Court, the de facto husband was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and to 15 years for the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon his daughter. Temporary custody of the two children was awarded to their maternal grandparents, whom I will call Mr and Mrs G, pending a custody challenge by the paternal grandmother, Mrs M. Mr and Mrs M have both been convicted of crimes of violence. Before the Family Court, a sevenpage document detailing the criminal record of Mr M was presented. It included three charges of attempted murder, two of policemen and one of his wife, crimes for which he was given a sentence in Goulburn Gaol. Another charge of assault has been laid against him by his wife since his release. Other convictions related to driving offences, illegal use of firearms and alcohol abuse. At the same hearing, a three-page document was presented detailing the criminal convictions of Mrs M for theft and other charges relating to dishonesty, and for assault. Mr and Mrs M applied to legal aid to get custody of their son's children. They were rejected. Then, because Mr M, the children's step-grandfather, was an Aborigine, they went to Aboriginal legal aid. No-one else involved in this case had any Aboriginal blood whatsoever. Because of the potential damage of the proceedings to these two children, who had already suffered major trauma, the judge ordered that a single evaluation by an eminent child psychiatrist should occur. This was done by Professor Brent Waters of the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Sydney. His report said in part that Mr and Mrs M have such a high tolerance for aggression that the children, if they were to spend time with them, may well be exposed to further unnecessary hostility and violence, which the Ms would not necessarily see as damaging to the children, and thus from which they may not be sufficiently protected. Moreover, he said, the style of family life in the M household is probably sharply different to the security and routine of the G family. In talking about one of the children, he said: This child seemed to be a fairly secure child and to be of average concentration and persistence. If her behaviour was less well controlled in the M household, as the Ms claimed, then it is probably due to a lax, inconsistent and sometimes frightening style of parenting. Under the circumstances, I am of the opinion that access would not be in the children's best interests. Aboriginal Legal Service declined to accept this report and they demanded another evaluation, which was denied by the presiding judge and by the children's independent barrister on the grounds that the G family had been subjected to sufficient stress already. Undeterred, the Aboriginal Legal Service counsel then proposed a three-day-plus hearing during which they proposed to produce expert witnesses to assert that Aboriginal children should never be taken from an Aboriginal home-a somewhat curious assertion as the children are not Aboriginal, have no memory of Mr and Mrs M and have been raised in their mother's Jewish faith. So concerned was the children's psychiatrist that she wrote to the solicitors in August 1991 in the following terms. I should say that, three years after the assault, these children are still having to see a psychiatrist weekly. She writes: As you know, I am the consultant child and family psychiatrist who is now working with the [0] family, especially seeing the older child for weekly therapy following her grossly distressing experiences, including witnessing the serious assault on her sister and the murder of her mother. I am very concerned about the horrendous, emotionally stressful, financially draining and quite irrational Family Law Court battle which continues after 14 hearings about custody/access of these two children. I am very concerned that the Aboriginal Legal Service is wasting its scarce resources on such an inappropriate and unwinnable case without any apparent thought for the stress and damage being caused. The ongoing protracted litigation is causing enormous financial burden on Mr and Mrs [G], secondarily destabilising the children's security and emotional well-being. I will summarise the case. A man murders his de facto wife and attempts to murder his 13month-old daughter. He is convicted on both counts. The deceased wife's parents, who are stable and provide a loving environment, are given temporary custody. The husband's parents, who have a lO-page criminal record between the two of them, apply to legal aid and are refused. And yet we have three years of legal proceedings, 18 court appearances and tens of thousands of dollars spent, because Aboriginal Legal Aid takes up the case, when the only person who is Aboriginal is the step-grandfather of one of the children. I wish to make myself quite clear here: I have no grievance against the Family Court, which behaved in an exemplary manner in this case. I have no grievance against Mr and Mrs M, or their son, who has been judged by the full weight of the law. Nor do I have any grievance against Aboriginal legal aid generally, because around Australia many Aboriginal legal services provide an outstanding service. My grievance is solely against the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service, which has behaved in a vexatious manner by pursuing a totally irrational case with no merit and no chance of success whatsoever. In doing so, it has caused enormous strain, trauma and financial damage to a couple who are merely trying to adopt their murdered daughter's children. In this country, Aboriginal legal aid receives taxpayers' money through ATSIC for the very important task of providing representation for Aboriginal people in attempting to keep Aboriginal people out of gaol. But, like it or not, in receiving that money it is accountable, through ATSIC, to the Australian Parliament and to its people. It does not receive money to run a private case where nobody indirectly involved is Aboriginal. It does not receive money to behave in a vexatious manner. It does not receive money to pursue some vague political objective in a manner that places enormous financial and emotional burdens on innocent people. And it does not receive money to behave in a manner that pays no heed whatsoever to the well-being of two totally innocent children. Obviously the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service believes that it is a law unto itself and that it is accountable to no-one. EquaUy obviously, it has no procedures to determine the merit of the case or which cases should, in fact, be pursued. If the case that I have outlined today is typical of the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service's work, its total lack of accountability will mean that others will place accountability on it. I have met the family of Mr and Mrs G. They bear no malice. They are merely concerned that the trauma they have been put through should not be passed on to others. I say here as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs that, in the two years that I have had the privilege to hold this position, I have not come up against a greater abuse of taxpayers' money or a case that goes to the very foundations of what a service should or should not be doing. Coalmining Industry: Hunter Valley",56
68,Mr FITZGIBBON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hunter)(12.58 p.m.)Throughout the grim days of drought and rural and manufacturing recession there have been two beacons of hope in the Hunter Valley. One beacon has been viticulture and tourism, but the brightest shining beacon which has helped shield my electorate from , the ravages of unemployment has been the coal mining industry. The coal mining industry has been a tower of strength and has played a magnificent role in keeping alive the Hunter Valley economy. The last couple of years have not witnessed a boom in coal mining but the industry has kept its head above water and provided jobs-jobs which are the lifeblood for a region which is the engine-room of our nation. Now, tragically, the Hunter coal mining industry is in trouble. Yesterday at Cessnock, 2,000 northern miners attended an aggregate meeting. When a third of the work force attends an aggregate meeting, the turnout is indicative of a troubled and worried industry. Let there be no suggestion, Mr Deputy Speaker, that those 2,000 men who met yesterday are troublemakers flexing their industrial muscles for irrational gains. Northern President of the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia, Mr Mick Watson, his men are behaving most responsibly trying to ensure that employment opportunities are not decimated because of illogical decisions and policies being pursued by some governments and mine owners. Premier Greiner's handling of the Elcom mines issue, the sterilisation of recoverable reserves and the weakness of coal owners who let the Japanese play them off a break the negotiation of sales-all these things factors which could spell the end of pace underground mining and cause massive job losses. Miners have made sacrifices and acted responsibly in agreeing to restructuring and enterprise agreements, but the concessions granted by miners have not been reciprocated. I, along with my Labor colleagues in the Hunter, will be meeting with the northern miners as soon as possible. We are as detersmaller. mined as they are to prevent mine closures and losses of jobs. We want jobs for those 206 Lemington miners and the other National unemployed miners in the Hunter. It is imperative that governments, coal owners the unions get together to come up with a strategy to ensure the viability and stability the coal mining industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a grievance debate. The name is appropriate because I have several grievances but I will probably only have time to mention one more. I am grieving because of a quandary that has racked our nation for more than 100 years and is now causing unimaginable pain: the arguments about free trade versus protectionism. We all know the dangers of protection. We all know that it destroys the incentive to become competitive. We know about the problems of subsidies, tariffs, quotas, et cetera. Every time a delegation from America or the EC comes here and we tell them about the lunacy of their policies and subsidies, they say, 'What about you and your TCF industries'. I know all about that. I understand that if we do not buy from the Asian countries, they can rightly say to us, 'If you won't buy our products, we won't buy yours'. So we need free trade. Why should a nation of 17 million people be The foolish? Why should we lead the crusade to establish a level playing field? Why should and we tilt at windmills-take on the world-and in get our heads kicked in? Fighting just battles is all right but a charge of the light brigade is madness. We must have regard for the level of casualties. Lenin was spot on when he coined the phrase 'One step forward and two steps back'. If someone is 25 stone and wants to lose weight, he does not try to run a marathon and kill himself. If in we want to make our manufacturing industries are more competitive, we do not drive them at a which kills them stone dead. Our plan, which stages the reduction in protection for the TCF industries, is too rapid and too harsh. I admit it is no easy task to judge the pace of reform, but quite clearly we have failed. We have failed the Neville Wran test: jobs, jobs, jobs. We have failed the jobs test in a period of deep recession. We talk about value added but allow our manufacturing base to grow One textile and clothing firm in the Hunter, Textiles Ltd, has seen its work force shrink from 1,200 to 450; that is, 750 jobs and have gone in 12 to 18 months. Bonds Wear Factory has shed jobs and the staff there are of working a four-day week. Depict fashions has cut its work force by 200. In a few years we will have no textile and clothing industry in the Hunter and that is a tragedy. People will suffer; communities will suffer, and that is crazy. It would not be so crazy if replacement jobs were available but there are no replacement jobs. Textile and clothing factories in the Hunter have high technology, are well managed, are efficient and their production is excellent. They cannot compete with subsidised rivals who have a lower tax base and pay chicken manure wages. China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and India are killing us. I do not mind the Pakistanis beating us at cricket but when we talk about a level playing field we should really define the advantages which flow both ways. When our TCF industries are dead, there will be little benefit to Australian consumers because the Coles Myer domination of the retail field will spoil that scenario. Meanwhile. what message are we sending our investors? The message writ in large print is, 'If you're going to invest in manufacturing, go offshore-invest outside Australia'. As evidenced in Question Time yesterday, if this Government's TCF policy is slightly crazy, the Opposition's is full-blown. By the year 2000 we intend to reduce protection to the TCF industries by 25 per cent. Opposition members would have zero tariffs; no protection-zilch. Maybe Minister Button is right and maybe the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) is right. I believe, and I am sure there are many on the other side of the House-there are certainly many on this side of the House-who believe that the gung ho approach to a free trade environment is a complete and utter disaster. I do not know how we solve the problem. Maybe tougher anti-dumping laws could be applied. Asians can land a garment here for $8 including fabric and make-up. The same garment in Australia costs $12 before any charges are added. Tougher anti-dumping rules should be used to protect our domestic manufacturers and primary producers. There are other grievances I wish to mention. I am concerned about the situation at Alcan. Aluminium production is certainly a cyclical business. Some 600 people are employed by Alcan. I will be doing my darnedest to ensure that their jobs are protected. As well, on some future occasion, I will want to say something about our attitude towards requests from Thailand, the USA, New Zealand and Denmark to import chicken meat into Australia. It would be absolutely calamitous for the chicken meat industry, the poultry industry, having regard to some of the disease problems like salmonella and Newcastle disease and the level of wages paid in Thailand. Some 1,600 jobs could be lost at the Australian poultry works at Beresfield. I will not allow that to happen. (TIme expired) Crime Rates",57
69,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 27 February 1992 former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam made what was considered to be an outrageous slur on members of the Western Australian police force. He said: One is loath and, in fact, condemns the use of stereotypes, but there is a significant attitude in the Western Australian police flowing from the fact that many of its members migrated from South Africa. That was a slur not only on members of the Western Australian police force but also a racist slur on people who have migrated to Australia from South Africa. It is a typically uninformed comment from the former Prime Minister. One notes that even his own Party, the ALP, would like to see him quickly withdraw from public life and public commentary because of the number of comments he makes that end up embarrassing it. The former Prime Minister has probably never even seen a serious crime, let alone experienced the sorts of pressures that policewomen and policemen work under, having regard to today's accelerating high crime rates. Let us look at Australia's crime rates. The report The Size of the Crime Problem in Australia, released in 1990, stated: ... the rate of serious assaults per 100,000 people has increased almost five-fold from 20.7 in 1974 to 99.9 last year. Sharp rises are also recorded for robbery, burglary, mqtor vehicle theft, fraud and stealing. Incidentally, just as a side note, it mentions: More than half of all Australian fraud offences were recorded in Victoria . . . That is something that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is probably only too knowledgable about, having regard to the number of cases that must be appearing in the courts there.",59
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I am not sure that that is not a reflection on the honourable member.,60
71,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It certainly is not a reflection on the honourable member for Higgins; it is a reflection on the large number of people in Victoria who seem to be perpetrating offences. Western Australia is outstripping the rest of Australia in its crime rate. For instance, the Western Australian burglary rate has increased by 170 per cent during the past decade, which increase is 63 per cent higher than the Australian average. Car theft has increased by 137 per cent, which is 40 per cent higher than the Australian average. The rate of house theft has increased nearly twice as fast as the rate in New South Wales, while the car theft rate has increased three times as fast as the rate in Victoria. The figures also show that over the past decade car theft in Western Australia has surpassed the United States, with the car theft rate per capita being 50 per cent higher in that State. It has become a matter of great concern nationally that this problem with the accelerating crime rate must be addressed on a national basis. I note that the Deputy Speaker himself moved a motion not so long ago in relation to that issue. In fact, the Insurance Council of Australia called for a national approach to the problem of juvenile crime. As reported in the - st Australian, its national public affairs manager, Terry MCMullan, said: . . . the problems of car thefts and burglaries were Minister's not unique to WA and a Federal inquiry into growing problem should be held. He said: . . . Australians would end up paying for the upsurge in property damage by young criminals through higher insurance premiums. It is interesting to look at the reasons for this States. high youth crime rate around the country. As reported in the Age: Professor Ken Polk, associate professor of criminology at Melbourne University, accused the Federal Government of abandoning its responsibilities towards jobless young people... the Government's strategy of tackling the country's economic problems through high interest rates and high unemployment hit the young hardest. .. If young people don't have skills and qualifications, they can't get into the labour force. After two or three years, not only do they lack skills but they have to account for being out of the workforce for two years. It is interesting, for instance, to compare the situation we have now, in this recession that we had to have, with the incidence of crime or of poverty and homelessness that occurred during the Great Depression. As reported in the West Australian, Detective-Inspector Bob Kucera, who is a Churchill scholar, told the National Wellness Conference in Perth that the level of crime indicated the sickness of society. He said: . . . crime was more prevalent today because of poverty, unemployment, growing isolation created by suburbia, an apparent lack of community spirit and family breakdowns. Although unemployment and poverty were far worse during the Depression of the 1930s, people stuck together and if parents left the home or had troubles, the next-door neighbours often took the children in hand. It is also clear that the high interest rates and the high youth unemployment were a deliberate policy used by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the former Treasurer, to en gineer this recession we had to have. Ironically, when one views those comments made by Detective-Inspector Kucera, one thinks of the situation today and the social engineers of the Left who have tirelessly worked to break down the importance of the family unit. This has also been a high contributory factor in the high rate of juvenile crime. It is also ironic, for all of the Prime talk of Australia asserting its the sovereignty, that his Government has handed over huge slabs of Australia's independence via international covenants and treaties which, via the external treaties provisions of the Constitution, override the sovereignty of the Australian people and of course the Australian In relation to the rampant crime rate that is affecting the country, it really is not fair to blame the police. I must refer back to a speech I made at the time when the Deputy Speaker moved his motion in relation to stolen property. I said: I want to dispel one myth that is contained first clause of the motion before us today-that the apparent failure of police to do their properly, which is implied in that particular In 1980 to 1981, when there were 845,923 offences reported to police throughout the country, there a clean-up rate of 34.91 per cent. In 1988-89 were 1,410,065 offences reported-an increase 66 per cent on the previous figure-yet the up rate was still around 30.07 per cent; words, a drop of only about 5 per cent in the clean-up rate. During the 10 years between 1978 and 1988, police strength rose from 29,441 to 37,875, a rise of only 28.6 per cent. Thus, if we compare the clean-up rate to the rise in the offences reported to police throughout the country and we add the police strength as a factor, we find that there is little statistical evidence. . . That is, evidence to back up that particular theory. In fact, if one looks at the huge losses incurred by the Western Australian Labor Government under its WA Inc. business dealings, one sees that there is a great lack of resources available to the police in Western Australia, particularly in Perth. I know from my own experience in the northern suburbs of Perth that, if many of my constituents and the residents of that area were aware of exactly how many members of the police force are actually on duty in the area at night time, they would be greatly concerned. I also received in recent times a complaint from one of my constituents who happens to have a daughter-in-law who is in the WA police. She told me of how her daughter had suffered verbal and physical assaults by juveniles who taunt police officers. They taunt them on the expectation that, should they ever get charged, little will happen to them as a consequence. I can recite my own experience when I was a detective in the general crime squad in the Western Australian police force. We went to locate one particular offender who had committed a series of offences. We went to the foster home where he was in care to talk about those offences. This was at about 6 o'clock in the morning. He was not there because he had been out all night stealing cars. In fact, he had been picked up only in the last couple of hours of the morning. On the subject of the problems that are in the being experienced by members of the Western is, Australian police force, there has been an job increasing number of teenagers who have clause. been using stolen cars to try to run down was motorcycle policemen. The West Australian there commented that this was a dangerous new of trend against which police had little defence. cleanThe latest incident was reported in the West in other Australian on 8 January this year: ... Sgt Terry Colby was knocked from his machine by a stolen car in Innaloo at about 11.15pm... Acting Traffic Superintendent Mal Dragicevich said: ... attempts to run down patrolmen began only recently, but youths had been ramming police cars for some time. He said: It would appear to be a deliberate act to immobilise police vehicles. He added that one patrolman chased on 11 December mounted the footpath to get away and the offenders chased him until they hit a tree and rolled over. In Western Australia there has been public outrage at the huge acceleration in the juvenile crime rate. The West Australian editorial on 31 December commented: There should be no soft options for that hard core. These are the recidivist offenders. It went on: Community protection is more important than trying to rehabilitate young recidivists who have shown that they regard any kid-gloves treatment as a joke. In trying to sheet home the blame for the juvenile crime rate, do not look towards the police forces of Australia. Let us look towards a root cause. This is the high rate of unemployment and hopelessness amongst young people in this country as a result of nine years of Federal Labor government under the economic policies of the current Prime Minister. Disability Services",60
72,Mrs DARLING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to report to the House on the implementation of Government initiated policies and programs in support of people with disabilities, their carers and providers of services. My most recent previous report on this issue was on 2 March 1992, when I delineated aspects of the disability reform package brought down by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), which package is designed to provide upgraded job opportunities, job incentives, security of income and support services for people with disabilities. This report elicited an extraordinary attack by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) on Government performance in the area of disability services. Such an attack is disturbing in that, while it certainly portrays problems and anxieties confronting people with disabilities and their carers, by erroneously and politically attributing these problems to one source-that source being the Government which has taken on the responsibility of reforming disability policy-it forms a major impediment to the enlightened approach to people with disabilities which is thankfully replacing the shroud of darkness which enveloped this issue in decades past. The reality is that this Government has done more for people with disabilities than has any government before it. Against many other competing priorities, the Government has increased funding for disability services each year. Since 1983, funding provided to non-government agencies to provide accommodation, personal care, training and employment has increased from $104m to $279m and will increase further to $383m by 1996-an almost fourfold improvement which represents an increase in real terms of over 60 per cent. These facts are a matter of record. If they are ignored or falsified, the debate on directions for future policy and programs for people with disabilities, being built on one false premise with political overtones, is devalued. If it is devalued, the general public may slip back into the attitude of disinterest which marked the formulation of disability policy for the major part of this century. People with disabilities and their carers deserve better than this. I do not ask the honourable member for Hawker and other members of this House to refrain from the criticisms which are part and parcel of our democratic system, but it behoves us all to understand the background to disability policy in this country and to understand the effect of our words on carers of people with disabilities. The person with a disability must be given top priority in the formulation of programs to ensure that that person achieves the best quality lifestyle possible. But in many cases, particularly where the disability is intellectual, it is the carer who carries the heaviest load of the knowledge of the extent of the disability, of which the person with the disability may not be aware. At the beginning of this century, society responded to such disabilities by shutting people away, leaving them and their carers without positive support. Later, nongovernment agencies, many of them backed by churches and service organisations and attracting government funding, became providers of facil ities for people with disabilities. This lifted a huge load from the shoulders of carers, giving them support and respite. At that stage, facilities were designed to protect and support. Therapy was given and respite was provided. But the lifestyle of people with disabilities was seen as very limited. It was not considered possible that people with disabilities who entered homes, therapy centres and sheltered workshops could work in the open work force or live independently. These providers deserve the heartfelt thanks of our society. The carers were, in my opinion, unsung heroes, virtually giving up their own lives to provide support for their offspring. This still happens. But as professional and public enlightenment grows, it has become apparent that hundreds of thousands of people with the ability to live better quality lifestyles have been imprisoned by our society's acceptance of their perceived passive role. Evidence has accumulated pointing to the need for major reform to set people with disabilities free. What was needed was a government with the resolve and commitment to act upon that evidence, collected from those most affected: the people with the disability and their carers. The present Federal Government did so act, creating the Disability Services Act. This Act is regarded internationally as a great step forward in legislative support for services assisting people with a disability. It would be naive and indeed harmful for anyone to believe that the Act delivers all that is required. No one Act and no one government can deliver all that is required. It is true that there will probably never be enough money to do everything that we want to do. It is also true that we want to be able to do more for people with a disability everywhere in this country. My current shopping list for Federal and State governments includes: provision of facilities and supervised activities on a continuing weekly business hours basis for people unable to utilise employment schemes, in the eighteenth year and beyond; security in the form of guaranteed financial and human support as an alternative to nursing homes for older people in care, after the carer's demise; adequate opportunities for the integration into 'normal' playgroup situations for children aged one to five, or children whose intellectual age is preschool; and extended places in competitive and supportive employment schemes for people with disabilities who in the past went into sheltered workshops. I will continue to lobby for these facilities in policy development forums. It is absolutely essential, however, that all concerned people pull behind the reforms carried in the Act. For reform means change, and people, particularly those most vulnerable, fear change. If this fear is fed in a negative fashion, it will be a tragedy for those people with disabilities who are now finding that life is worth living, and who would be forced to retreat to the bitter safety of life behind closed doors if the implementation of programs under the Act were discontinued. The Federal Government is striving to raise the standard of living for Australians with a disability. But it is faced with making up for years and years of minimal effort, of low priority given to the needs of people with a disability. If members of this House tell constituents caring for people with disabilities that the Federal Government is to blame for those adverse aspects of their lives not yet rectified by the reform program, they are doing them a disservice. For change to be successful, it must be supported by all levels of government and community service. People with disabilities need the facts so that they can direct their lobbying activities to the right quarter. They need to know that there are people in government bureaucracy who are striving to rectify past wrongs. Speaking as a Government member who is intimately acquainted with the problems facing people with disabilities and their carers, I wish to put the record straight. Support for people with a disability is an integral part of this Government's commitment to social justice. The disability services program provides financial support to organisations to provide services and facilities and facilitate changes in Australian society which lead to recognition and acceptance of the rights of people with a disability. It was also this Government which negotiated the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement, an historic agreement that promises to end the duplication and lack of coordination between the efforts of States and the Federal Government. Every State government, including South Australia, signed this agreement last July. The agreement clarifies Federal responsibility for employment programs for people with a disability, while accommodation and personal care services are clearly the responsibility of State and Territory governments. All that it takes to implement the agreement is the enactment of legislation similar to the Disability Services Act, the landmark legislation introduced by this Government and passed in this Parliament in 1987 with bipartisan support. This Government stands ready to transfer to State and Territory governments over $1 billion over the five years of the Agreement. It has also agreed to give an additional $245m over the next five years to assist in improving the quality of services in those States that implement the Agreement. Over the ijve-year period of the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement, this Government will provide almost $2,000m for distribution directly and through State governments to non-government agencies to support their efforts in that area. The Queensland Government is already involved in assessing the views of people with disabilities, carers, providers and interested members of the public as the basis for its ongoing disability policy and programs. 1\vo services in South Australia have benefited recently from government grants.

73,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My particular grievance relates to Australia Post's proposed changes to its registered publication service and the impact of such changes on local country newspapers. Australia Post must fulfil certain community service obligations as stipulated under section 27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act. These include an obligation to provide a reasonably accessible service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry on business. Since this Labor Government has been on the treasury bench, mail services to rural areas of Australia have been significantly reduced. Many communities have had post offices replaced with postal agencies; others are threatened with the closure of the postal agency altogether. Rural residents must fight to maintain mail deliveries in the face of their downgrading. On this basis alone, I believe that Australia Post is in serious breach of its community service obligation. However, more specifically, I draw the attention of the House to the introduction of minimum quantity regulations and the removal of concessional rates for registered publications. In plain English, registered publications, for example, newspapers and magazines, must now attract a minimum of 50 subscribers within the local post code area and 500 subscribers outside this area. If these minimum numbers of newspapers are not posted to the respective areas, Australia Post will automatically levy the newspaper proprietor with an appropriate postal charge afforded to the minimum quantity-thus the minimum quantity regulation. This regulation takes no consideration of the situation facing country newspapers across Australia. Many such newspapers cannot ever hope to achieve the minimum quantity threshold of 50 local subscribers and 500 subscribers outside their local postcode area. Under this proposed regulation rural newspapers are going to be penalised for their size. Furthermore, the removal of concessional rates for registered publications will result in the average postal cost of one country newspaper edition rising from 35c to 40c in the local area and 55c elsewhere, providing the paper meets the minimum quantity regulation. This further impacts on the viability of country newspapers. To illustrate how these regulations impact on rural newspapers I will use the example of a typical paper in the electorate of Maranoa, the Stanthorpe Border Post. The Border Post has 25 local subscribers and 147 subscribers outside its local postcode areas. These figures are far removed from the new Australia Post regulations. The effect on the Stanthorpe Border Post is alarming. The cost of the Border Post to subscribers is 40c. Prior to the introduction of Australia Post's new regulations the postal charge for one edition was 35c. Therefore, the total cost of one edition amounted to 75c, resulting in a yearly subscription rate for 100 papers of $75. Under the new postal regulation the price of the Border Post will vary between the local area and elsewhere. The postal cost of one edition within the local area will now blow out to 80c by comparison with 35c, resulting in a total cost of $1.20 and a yearly subscription of $120. Outside the local area the postal cost of one edition will skyrocket to $1.87 compared with the previous 35c rate, resulting in a total cost of $2.27 and a yearly subscription rate of $227. For the majority of subscribers to the Stanthorpe Border Post the cost of purchasing the local paper will rise from $75 a year to an alarming $227. Let me explain how this 150 per cent increase is arrived at. The Border Post will be charged a 55c rate on 500 papers, the minimum quantity, even though there are only 147 subscribers. Therefore, the 147 subscribers must subsidise an extra 353 pretend or imaginary subscribers that Australia Post deems the Stanthorpe Border Post to have. This results in subscriptions at the inflated rate of $1.87 for one edition of the Stanthorpe Border Post. Larger newspapers will be levied only 55c per edition. Clearly these regulations discriminate against small rural towns. While local papers may be circulated with no increase in large towns, the smaller, more remote communities must pay, and will be forced to pay, substantially more. Many residents will be unable to afford such exorbitant price increases and, therefore, must forgo purchasing the local paper. The significant social importance of the country newspaper must not be overlooked. It is the more isolated communities that rely on the information supplied by the local newspaper. Those communities that do not have access to the metropolitan daily papers-and there are certainly many in the electorate of Maranoa-rely heavily on the local variety to fill the void. It is, however, these communities that face a 150 per cent increase in postal charges to receive their local newspapers. It is, in fact, the communities who can least afford such an increase on both social and financial grounds who are being hit the hardest. I would like to draw the attention of House to an analysis based on the 1986 census figures. The median annual income men living inmral areas in 1986 was $11,900 compared to their urban counterpart's annual income of $15,500. Unemployment is one substantially higher in rural areas and rural students are only half as likely to enter higher education as are urban students. However, this Government persists in penalising already disadvantaged communities, as those figures confirm. There is an easy solution. I believe exemption from the minimum quantity preciation; regulation imposed under the banner of 'print post' should be made available to small country newspapers. These regulations clearly hinder access to vital community information for residents living in rural areas. The charge is levied on local papers least able to afford it, residents least able to afford it and communities least able to afford it. Reverting to Australia Post's community service obligations, I believe I have presented a strong case that the imposition of minimum quantity regulations breaches the requirement of section 27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act to provide a reasonable, accessible service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside. This regulation is not equitable, it is not reasonable and it is certainly not responsible. The only equitable, reasonable and responsible course of action would be the elimination of the minimum quantity regulation for the small country newspaper. Given the fact that the new regulations and charges will be imposed on country newspapers from the date of the renewal of registration with Australia Post as a registered publication, I would urge the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) to give this matter urgent consideration and reverse that regulation. Hunter Region  p.m.)-In this grievance debate I want to bring to the attention of this House and our nation the attributes and the opportunities of the best city in Australia-a provincial paradise. Recently, the well-read and wellthe regarded magazine the Australian Business Monthly conducted a survey of 24 cities of for Australia with a population of more than 50,000 persons. Seventeen criteria were considered. Those criteria can be grouped into of three main themes: economic factors, lifestyle factors and natural factors. The factors considered were peril, that is threat of nature disasters; hospitals; prices; accessibility; earnings; culture; motor vehicles; roads; State taxes; natural environment; local taxes; unemployment; education facilities; an housing affordability; house price appollution and climatic discomfort. The survey proved what many of us have known for a long time-that Australia's best city is the capital of the Hunter, Newcastle. The people of the Hunter are a tough, resilient people who have always had to fight harder to keep their place and fight harder to get ahead. Our region is the powerhouse of the State and a major generator for the national economy with heavy industry, coal, wheat, wool and aluminium exports. Our community has a strong regional spirit and a strong sense of regional identity. It has much to the offer to the rest of Australia as we seek to broaden the base of our regional economy, as we seek to diversify and as we seek to create more job opportunities for men, women and youth. As a region, we offer a congestion free port and an excellent industrial relations climate. We continue to lead this nation in the advancement of industrial relations. We offer ready availability of skilled people and people ready and willing to learn. We offer good training and educational facilities, lower housing prices, lower commercial rents, good land transport connections to Australia's largest market-Sydney-and a wide range of technological and research facilities. We have a delightful coastal and hinterland environment and some of Australia's finest and cleanest beaches. In summary, the Hunter is a great place to live, a great place to work and even a greater place to visit for those who have not been to the Hunter.",64
74,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Tasmania?  second and the Gold Coast ran last. Tasmania is a beautiful State. We are talking about a region that has much to offer to the rest of Australia but most to offer in terms of investment and industry growth. The Newcastle Herald in its editorial of 19 March 1992 commented on three major potential projects for our region: the Matrix Aeronautics Australia aircraft maintenance facility at Williamtown Airport; the interest of Amecon and the Australian Submarine Corporation in the Minehunter project; and the Coal and Allied Industries Ltd coal liquefaction project. The Newcastle Herald made the point that the projects were all linked and that they would all build on existing strengths in the Hunter, with strength in technology being well to the fore. The editorial went on to say: The Hunter has the natural resources and the people to make almost any type of project a success. But success will be elusive without constant investment in new technology. The challenge, then, is twofold. First, the region must be prepared to put its own money into new equipment. And, second, it must persuade investors elsewhere that investment in technology in the Hunter is money well spent. I agree with and support those comments. They are appropriate and accurate. But they apply to all of Australia. If we are to generate a broader based economy, if we are to have a greater level of manufacturing exports, we have to get better at what we do. We have to become more efficient, we have to become more productive, we have to have more initiative in seeking out world markets, and we have to use our talents and our skills in building up the efficiency and productivity of our industries so that Australians look to buying Australian products rather than imported products. They are objectives we have to win. They are not going to be handed to this nation on a plate. They are not going to be handed to our region on a plate. The point of the editorial, in my view, is spot on. The One Nation package that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced on 26 February this year will do much to encourage and facilitate the investment in new plant and equipment that is needed to lift our level of manufacturing exports and to lift the level of import replacement that comes from an improvement in our manufacturing industry. Let me turn to the accelerated depreciation allowances. That improvement in allowances will enable Australian businesses-Australian firms-to update plant and equipment so that we get to use a much wider range of world class state-of-the-art equipment, so that we can compete with companies that are now newly industrialising and countries where workers know only the latest plant that is available in the world. In our plants and factories we are labouring with the practices and management-type operations that belong to a period decades earlier, often using equipment that was manufactured decades earlier. The acceleration of depreciation allowances will facilitate that investment in new plant skilled and equipment, enabling us to become more competitive in international and domestic markets. I tum to the point I made last about Newcastle, and that is its attraction as a place to visit. The Hunter region has enormous potential for tourism but, again, there has to be investment in facilities. There has to be an upgrading of the quality of service that is offered. The provisions in the One Nation package for increased depreciation allowance for tourism facilities will again facilitate and encourage the investment that is needed in the region to provide a better quality of service and a wider range of services for people who want to visit our region. I conclude by saying that I support wholeheartedly the points made in the editorial, but I also point out that we need as a people in our region, as Australians, to recognise that tourism is an industry that is labour intensive, that has enormous potential, and that offers the opportunity to create jobs-well paid jobs, real jobs, lasting jobsthat will earn us export income but most of all give opportunity to the men and women and youth of this nation.",66

79,Mr GOODLUCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"No, not Newcastle, but Tasmania. First of all, I will not get stuck into the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He is one of my hates at the moment-but I do not hate anybody, really. However, I have a hate for the greenies in Tasmania. Honourable members will remember that about six weeks ago I got up in this House and said, 'I am very sympathetic towards the unemployed, you all know that. I stick up for a person who is legitimately unemployed, but I do not stick up for people who are unemployed and stop legitimate people from working'. Those protesters are still down at the Picton River, holding up people who want to workordinary men and women who are earning their living by the forest industries, paying hire purchase on their trucks, trying to make a decent living. Those greenies and environmentalists so-called are still down there holding up those legitimate people. I have a point: this country has gone a bit mad. We have people who want to work but cannot work. We have people who do not want to work, who protest and use that as an example of freedom, that they have the right to protest. We all agree with that, but not when they are holding up other people. The police do not want to act in Tasmania; the Government does not want to act. I know I am a bit of a radical. I said they should call in the police, call in the Army, to get rid of them. But if we did that we would give Bob Brown a bit more publicity. We would make him more of a god than he already is with the environmental movement. I am against it and I hope everybody agrees with me. (Time expired) Petrol",67
80,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to raise what - ust be among the most irresponsible proposals in the history of this Parliament. I refer to the transport policy of Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to reduce the price of petrol by about 30 per cent for the public and 39 per cent for business and to increase the cost of public transport by 15 per cent as part of package. The absence of a level playing field between public and private transport funding has already resulted in a major distortion of land use and transport systems throughout Australia. The Opposition's proposal to dramatically increase this distortion will result in celerated urban sprawl, massive traffic congestion, parking frustration, air and pollution, pedestrian difficulties and devaluation of property in Australia'S cities. In the rural areas there will be a horrific it. increase in truck and bus accidents, with a major shift in transport of goods and people from rail to road. Road deterioration and maintenance will increase, as will the costs of new construction, to cope with the increased volumes and truck sizes. Oil consumption and price are directly related. Australia's fuel imports will escalate, resulting in a massive balance of payments deficit over the next decade. The breaking any relationship between cost and usage by this mindless election bribe is a formula for transport and land use anarchy. Goods and Services Tax",67
81,Mr LINDSAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My concern in respect of the plight of small businessmen in the tourist industry who will be adversely affected by the Opposition's goods services tax in the unlikely event that it wins the next Federal election. The Opposition claims that payroll tax will be abolished on the introduction of the goods and services tax. However, more than 80 per cent of tourist operators do not pay payroll tax. So the abolition of payroll tax will not affect them all, but they will be affected in this way: a small business, tourist operators will be collection points for the goods and services tax. Tourist operators will be forced to the burden of administering the tax and ensuring compliance. Research in the United Kingdom has found that the compliance cost varied from about 2 per cent of turnover the small businesses to only 0.003 per cent of turnover for larger firms. This will place small businesses at a huge competitive disadvantage. In addition, small businesses will also have to set up recording and accounting the GST systems for payment of the tax. Let me make this point indelibly clear as to the impact of the GST on small business. The GST is payable at the point of sale. This means that for every credit sale the business has to carry the cost of the tax until accounts are paid. This will add to the cost of businesacses offering 30, 60 and 90 days credit. The goods and services tax has created fear and noise confusion amongst many tourism operators, particularly in north Queensland, where there have been meetings expressing opposition to Industrial Relations",68
82,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is ironic that the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, yesterday said that the union movement would be working with farmers and manufacturers to create employment in the food processing industry. Mr Ferguson is the head of an organisation whose affiliate, of the AMIEU, and its left wing Secretary, Mr Wally Curran, has sapped the vitality of the Victorian meat processing industry. Over the past decade, the number of meat workers in Victoria has declined from around 7,500 to only 1,700. In view of this record, how can is Mr Wally Curran-a new-found friend of Prime Minister Keating-advise on job creation for the seat of Wills, where nearly and 19,000 people cannot find a job. Another ACTU member and left wing union, the Food Preservers Union, has distinguished itself by adopting a hard-line attitude towards industrial disputation which has had a disastrous effect on tomato growers' inat come. Who can forget the actions of the Food as Preservers Union, known as the 'tomato left', the at Heinz's Dandenong plant at this time last year? The shop stewards had the majority of bear that company's work force walk out at the time they knew the tomatoes were being harvested in northern Victoria. Too bad for the many tomato farmers who missed out on for their income for that year. These sorts of actions do not help the farmers or manufacturers with whom Mr Ferguson is so anxious to cooperate. Mr Ferguson should make it his number one priority to bring into line his own left wing unions, especially given the warning by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mf Beazley) yesterday that Australia might have high levels of unemployment for the next six years.",68
83,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Next week, National Wool Day will bring positive support from me and other members for the vital wool industry. Shearers are a vital part of that industry. They have been a major influence on the development of our industrial relations system, and our living standards owe much to the work of the AWU and the shearers. Now that work is being undermined as a result of new arrangements with New Zealand which have fallen foul of new labour market arrangements under the Bolger Government. In New Zealand, there is a legislated minimum wage of $6. 12 1hc per hour. That is about $A4.60 per hour. The New Zealand employer is able to negotiate wages and conditions down to that sort of level. The result? Shearers are pouring into Australia from New Zealand. They accept low wages and poor conditions because they know that they would be even worse off in their own country. The effect on Australia? Over 50 per cent of Australian shearers and shedhands are not working. Only 42 per cent of the Australian wool clip is shorn by Australian shearers. The NFF is encouraging the type of action promoted in an advertisement in New Zealand. The advertisement, which is put out by a firm from Hamilton in Victoria, says 'Packing your bags for Oz?', and it offers jobs. I am prepared to fight for Australian shearers, to hold fast to our hard won and reject the Opposition's New Zealand inspired fightback against workers and conSenator ditions, and to insist on work permit status. call on the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) to support it.

What he failed to tell everyone, of course, was that this Government Wool hides the wholesale sales tax from view. We have the hidden tax of 30 per cent on every electrical item we buy and the hidden sales tax of 20 per cent on a whole range of items. Practically every fitting that we see in this chamber has a wholesale sales tax on it. The Treasurer of this country has admitted it. At long last, he has admitted that there are major faults and major problems with the wholesale sales tax in this country. There is a range of sales taxes already hidden from the view of the public. All the articles that people buy have a hidden tax on them now; it is hidden from their gaze. The taxes are 20 per cent, 30 per cent in many instances, and 10 per cent on a whole range of commodities. People do not know about it and the Government fails to tell them.

The Opposition has a thing called tax credits, and I think that this point ought to be raised. People who are on unemployment benefits, retirement pensions or pension incomes will get a tax credit of up to $800. Quite simply, that means that we are prepared to pay $800 towards their health costs. Think about that for the aged in our community. Think about the compassion of getting those people into private hospitals so that they can have their hip operations and other things they need urgently. Unlike this Government, the Fightback package and the Hewson Government will put health and compassion to the forefront. Look at the disaster this Government has created. There are 20,000 people in Victoria and 70,000 around Australia on waiting lists. That is an absolute disgrace. The Government has no compassion. It has inflicted misery and poverty on the people of Australia and it ought to be ashamed. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), who has just come into the House, did not even have the guts to resign after he lost the co-payments debate: no guts and no morals.

We had a plaintive plea from St Vincent de Paul. It said, 'We cannot cope with that; we are not an agency that can assess and pay social security benefits'. St Vincent de Paul made it very clear that it rejected the Opposition's policy absolutely. It also made it clear that you would put an unbelievab-e hardship and burden on unemployed persons by removing them from the dole after nine months and tipping them onto the St Vincent de Paul Society. That is what you would do. You would literally crush these organisations. The Government provided more money in the One Nation statement for the voluntary agencies, the spending of which your leader described as irresponsible. Reserve Bank of Australia",71
107,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is shifts directed to the Treasurer. It relates to Reserve Bank. What are the statutory goals the Reserve Bank? Does the of the Australian Reserve Bank provide sufficient clarity to the bank in its antisignificance. inflationary role? To what extent have the bank and the Government been successful achieving the goal of stable prices? Treasurer aware of proposals to set an inflation target for the bank, and what would be the consequences of such a target? Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The last parts of the question the honourable member for Fraser clearly offend standing order 144(g) in respect of hypothetical matter. I ask you to rule those last two sections out, as the way they were worded by the honourable member for Fraser was clearly out of order.",72
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The bulk of the question is in order. The part about other proposals is on the verge, but I think question is generally in order. Mr DAWKINSOf course, the first thing monetary to bear in mind is that inflation is something which can be attacked by a large number of policy instruments, monetary policy being one of them. The honourable member asks how successful we have been in bringing down the rate of inflation. The answer is that we been very successful. We now have an other inflation rate that is lower than it has been 20 years and the prospect of being able maintain low inflation at a rate at or below that of our trading partners. The honourable member asks about the of the Reserve Bank in the whole objective low inflation. He asks about the statutory goals of the Reserve Bank. Of course, the Reserve Bank of Australia has essentially three goals. The first is that of price stability; the second is the maintenance of full employment; and the third is to contribute to the general prosperity of the community. We on this side of the House believe that the Reserve Bank should have a broad range of objectives. It is not there just to pursue one objective single-mindedly to the exclusion of everything else. Apart from that, over time the objectives of the bank may well change as it its emphasis from one area to another. the In this regard our central bank has common of objectives with many other central banks present charter around the world. This question takes on very particular In this country at the moment we are talking about how to maintain low levels in of inflation and how the proponents of a Is the consumption tax could deal with the inflationary surge which would come from the imposition of a consumption tax in Australia, which everyone knows would have very dramatic effects on prices here, as it has had by in every other country where a consumption tax has been introduced. What the Opposition says in relation to this matter-and it dismisses the question of inflation or the containment of inflation-is essentially stated in two lines in its document. First of all, it says that the Opposition would commit overall economic policy, and monetary policy in particular, to the medium term goal of price the stability. It goes on to say: It is essential, if chronic inflationary expectations are to be squeezed out of the system, for fiscal and policy to be kept firm while the other policy initiatives are undertaken. In other words, the Opposition intends to have the whole burden of containing inflation and squeezing out this inflationary surge resting have with the Reserve Bank monetary policy; in words, high interest. In this matter, of for course, the Opposition had expected some to support from the man in Australia who has perhaps the highest reputation as being the person most concerned about the achievement of lower inflation in this country. That person role is the retiring Deputy Governor of the of Reserve Bank, John Phillips. Dr Hewson interjecting",72
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.  have to say about the current objectives of the Reserve Bank? After many long years of experience in the bank, he says: I have been comfortable with the present charter which requires the Bank to use its powers so as best to contribute to stability of the currency, full employment and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia ... I would have thought those were objectives with which we all concur-that is, all on this side of the House. The Opposition, of course, wants to rewrite a charter to give the central bank not just the single objective of price stability but also to restrict it to a narrow band of inflation between zero and 2 per cent.  He said: More generallytalking about this questionI do not favour an inflation target. The newspapers, of course, have made their own interpretation of what the Deputy Governor means. The Australian Financial Review says 'RBA deputy rejects Libs' inflation plan', the Australian says 'Reserve deputy rejects Libs on price target' and the Age says 'Reserve chief rejects NZ tack' in relation to this inflation objective. Here we have, from a man who has a reputation in Australia for the assiduous pursuit of low inflation through his long years in the Reserve Bank, firstly, a rejection of the notion of changing the charter, believing that the current charter with a number of objectives to be achieved simultaneously is appropriate and, secondly, a rejection of the notion of an inflation target. Once again, we see this Leader of the Opposition becoming an increasingly solitary figure in Australian politics. It is not enough for him to pursue low inflation; he wants no inflation. It is not enough for him to pursue low tariffs; he wants no tariffs. As he looks behind him he finds himself increasingly out of touch with those people sitting there; he finds himself increasingly out of touch with those constituencies in Australia which the Liberal Party pretends to represent. He is a man who is out of control. He is rapidly becoming a totally politically isolated figure in Australia as he pursues policies. What he has done",72

You basically want to cut $10 billion out of Commonwealth outlays, and a large part of that will come out of the Department of Social Security's transfer payments. That is the fact of the matter. You want to cut the Commonwealth's expenditure by 10 per cent. Mr Ronaldson interjecting",74
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Ballarat will cease interjecting.,74
131,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In a Budget of around $100 billion, you want to cut out $10 billion. The burden of that will come from transfer payments. Then you are up here asking about one stop welfare centres. In the period since 1975, when this centre was begun as a pilot program, the Federal Government has substantially increased its assistance to the community in the north west of Melbourne and particularly the unemployed. So far this year, over $350,000 has been given to 40 agencies for distribution of emergency relief for unemployed people and families in crisis in northern Melbourne. We have increased our emergency relief grants to the area. The Department of Social Security currently has three regional offices in the area to assist welfare recipients at Brunswick, Moonee Ponds and Coburg. Through the CES the Government has established three job centres, three special service centres, a youth access centre and an industry centre to assist job searchers. You want to be rid of the CES. You want to tum it into a simple commercial referral agency. That is your proposal. You want to tum the CES into a simple referral agency not dealing with the problems of the long term unemployed and not operating all the services which are currently operated. In the same area there have been substantial increases in help for the unemployed through Iobstart and Iobtrain in the north-western suburbs, and more are planned. The Government has made a substantial effort to increase the level of services available to the community in northern Melbourne and particularly to help the unemployed. This follows years of inaction by the conservatives until 1983. This substantial effort by the Labor Government is in stark contrast to the message of misery which the Opposition promises for the unemployed. The Opposition has promised to cast 90,000 unemployed people onto the social scrap heap by withdrawing their benefits. The Government estimates this will rip $200m away from unemployed families and their services. As I indicated, the Opposition has promised to gut the CES: That is the fact. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to show feigned indignation and concern by saying that an application by this one welfare centre under the Department Health, Housing and Community Services program last year is a matter of great moment to him. But the nearest he would have come to the north-western suburbs of Melbourne is flying over them into Tullamarine on his way into Victoria. He would never have cared about the people who live out there. If they do not live in Toorak, he would never bother about them. Just like in Sydney, if people do not live in the area between Watsons Bay, Doyle's fish restaurant and the hasty tasty in Kings Cross, he does not care about them. As I have said, he would need a military map to find his way west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, much less the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. The Leader of the Opposition is bleating about an application from a centre which was established as a pilot program in the middle 1970s and for which there are worldthree major regional social security offices and CES offices, which you plan to gut, and asking questions for people who you would tip out on the streets after dole.

137,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And introduced some useful insights into the role of the Reserve Bank and its independence. We have had some debate about this in the House over the last 12 months. About a year ago I went on the record saying that I thought the balances in the Reserve Bank Act were correct, that is, that part of the Act which focuses the bank on the twin objectives of full employment and price stability and the part requiring the Government and the central bank to agree, but providing in the final analysis that the Government can direct the bank after tabling  say: At one extreme, I guess, is the statutory indepennow dence of the Federal Reserve systemhe is talking about central banks around the and close behind it the Bundesbank. On the other is the British view that the Government sets monetary policy and the Bank of England gives nine months on the effect to it. In other words, he sees two extremes: the US Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank on one side, and the Bank of England on the other. There are some, of course, who believe, or at least that that applies to Australia also. Neither law nor the historical record is on their side. A or more ago they might have been on firmer ground. However, developments over the intervening period have given the bank greater capacity for independent action than in any previous period postwar. He went on to say: During the period when Australia had a monetary target, or something that approximated one, it was the Treasurer's target rather than the bank's target, and it was announced in the Budget speech. The exchange rate was fixed by the Government under the Brettonwoods arrangements and the Reserve Bank cleared the market each day at the rate fixed-not a lot of autonomy in all of that, I am afraid. He is commenting on the arrangements which existed basically before this Government. Further, he said: It is a very different ball game with a very level of autonomy. He means now, and he goes on to say: Maintaining an effective relationship with Government, while preserving the Central Bank's capacity to form its views and determine its policies free of party political difficult balancing act at times, but the independence of the bank depends as much on the skill with which the act is performed as on the specific wording of the piece of legislation. I have worked with a series of governors with well-developed senses of balance. In other words, he is saying that the independence relies as much on the ability of bank, its governor and its board to basically find that position of relationship with Government to exercise independence as sees it. He does not put the Reserve Bank of Australia in with the Bank of England being essentially the target set by the told Government, any more than he does the regime which existed before this Government came to office. As such, I think that is sensible view. He went on to say in a radio saying: program: The reality is that the scope, without talking too much about the actual independence of it all, for autonomy in the Reserve Bank is much higher now because of changes in regulations, because of changes in basic structure, than it has been in any previous period that I have been around central banking. He also says: Now, in real autonomy it is not just right, and it hasn't been for a long time. I think it is proper that someone should try at least and put a bit more fact into the argument and debate that goes on and have the argument at a better level. In other words, what he is saying is basically that the debate has gone off half-cocked and is led by the Leader of the Opposition saying that the central bank is not independent.",75

In fact, relations have been entirely correct,  much more independent. The line you have been running is not independent; it is basically a sham line. It has no basis. The honourable member for Bennelong was honest enough to say yesterday, when he was asked a question on PM: I have not come here to talk about the future of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. That is not a matter on which I am going to express a public view. It would not be proper of me to do that. He is in that position now.

161,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for his question, which goes to the very important question of the administration of the tax system in Australia and the role of the Commissioner of Taxation particularly in that regard. Over the last nine years this Government has bolstered the ability of the Tax Commissioner to undertake his statutory responsibilities. Honourable members should bear in mind that when we came into office the tax system was in a total shambles. The Opposition, when in government, had allowed a situation to obtain where tax avoidance was rampant. The honourable member for Bennelong can well remember that the successive entreaties of the former Tax Commissioner went unacknowledged and unresponded to as the whole taxation system of this country slowly but surely fell apart. Taxation What we have been doing through a succession of important measures is re-establishing the credibility of the taxation system so that the people of Australia can have confidence in the fact that everyone is paying his fair share and the Tax Office has the ability to collect those taxes in the most efficient way. From these people, these vandals who allowed the tax system to fall to bits, comes a new proposal to establish a board over the top of the Taxation Commissioner; presumably people to control the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner has been repeatedly abused and attacked in this Parliament, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition who continues his campaign against important statutory office holders in this country who have no opportunity to reply here or elsewhere to his various attacks. I suppose the Opposition would be placing on this board the enemies of the Tax Commissioner, whether they were accountants, Young Liberals, tax accountants or tax lawyers-the kinds of people who are the enemies of the Tax Commissioner and who are unlikely to support the efforts that he has put in place over the last 10 years. Mr Boucher has a very distinguished record to defend in terms of his particular efforts over the last 10 years. But as if to make some kind of curtainraiser the Leader of the Opposition has decided to establish a kind of pilot scheme of accountants in Sydney in order to design his proposed consumption tax. I do not think accountants are necessarily the best people to devise the best taxation system in Australia.

I ask: why is the Government continuing to promote urban sprawl, traffic congestion, pollution and increased fuel imports by subsidising private car usage? Is the Government aware that 50 per cent of peak hour traffic in inner urban areas is a result of company car tax concessions and exclusion of parking spaces from the fringe benefits tax?

I might add that we stand for fair trade",81
216,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has been asked a question about tariff 'reduction and the effect of tariff reduction. The Prime Minister can answer that part of the question.,81
217,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This Government has been one of only two post-war governments to reduce tariffs. The other government was the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. In May 1988 I introduced a statement of measures which included the following: Accordingly, the Government will peel away more of this protection. From 1 July tariffs in excess of 15 per cent will be progressively reduced to that levelthat is, the high tariffs of 40, 50, 60 and 70 per cent will be reduced to the level of 15 per centwhile tariffs between 10 and 15 per cent will be reduced to 10 per cent. The changes will be phased in over a four year period. Page 121 of the document gives the measures in general. It states: In general, nominal tariff rates above 15 per cent will be reduced to 15 per cent while rates of 15 per cent or less, but above 10 per cent, will be reduced to 10 per cent. Reductions will be in annual steps from 1 July 1988 to 1 July 1992. Modifications to the passenger motor vehicle plan have already been announced. The textile, clothing and footwear plan will be modified, with lower tariff end points for clothing and footwear. The 2 per cent revenue duty will be abolished from 1 July 1988 and concessional entry arrangements will be modified. On 12 March 1991 the former Prime Minister, I, as Treasurer, and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button, introduced a statement into Parliament. The former Prime Minister said: . . . this Government will continue to open up the manufacturing sector and Australian industry generally through lower protection. I now announce: - the general level of assistance will be reduced from 10 per cent and 15 per cent in 1992 to a general rate of 5 per cent by 1996; - tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 in annual steps of 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent in the year 2000. - tariff reductions on textile, clothing and footwear will be accelerated so that the maximum tariff will be 25 per cent by the year 2000 and the termination of quotas will be brought forward two years to 1 March 1993... That planned-for, phased reduction in tariffs in the areas of general manufacturing, motor vehicles under the plans, and clothing, textile and footwear was the action of a government, taken over nearly a decade, to try to reduce and break down the tariff wall built by the coalition government which gave Australia the industrial museum we inherited in 1983. Only this Government had the courage, wit, foresight and sense to do it, and to do it on a phased basis. Mr Reith-How can you say that with a straight face?",82
218,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a fact; I just read it to you.,82

220,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,82
221,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has borne the burden of that tariff reduction and the competitive change which comes from imports. It made the industry facilitation changes to accommodate it, with the end points which I mentioned to you: in TCF, apparel at 25 per cent by the year 2000, footwear at 15 per cent, and cotton sheeting and woven fabrics at 15 per cent by the year 2000 from 37 per cent today. Apparel will be reduced from 51 per cent today to 25 per cent by the year 2000; footwear will go from 41 per cent to 15 per cent; and cotton sheeting and woven fabrics will go from 37 per cent to 15 per cent. In other words, we took a judgment that lower tariffs were in Australia's interest, but that clothing, textiles and footwear could not cope at below 25 per cent for apparel, 15 per cent for footwear, 15 per cent for cotton sheeting, 15 per cent for cars and 5 per cent for general manufacturing. We have come down from those huge 140 and 150 per cent protection levels-in some cases, it was 300 per cent-to these levels, judging that competitive businesses in these industries could survive at that level. The Opposition has now adopted a zero tariff policy for all of these areas-a zero tariff policy before the year 2000, with no thought, no consultation, no judgment, no sense-zero.",82

223,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,83
224,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I gave the analogy last year of the Government building the structure of competitiveness. As I said, it is like building the Empire State Building, taking years to put it into place, then having one of the rogues of the Opposition running through the foyer, jumping in the lift, going to the top floor, putting a brick on top and saying, 'Ours is taller; ours is the taller one:. This is it. It is shamelessly adopting all this hard work, consultation, discussion, rationalisation, change and restructuring and then saying, 'We will make it zero'. Yesterday when I said this, the Leader of the Opposition, stung, ran out to a press conference and said, 'Well, the former Treasurer, the Prime Minister, has always supported lower tariffs'. Of course I have! I announced the things-once and then twice. Of course I have-but not to zero, not to zero-but to 5 per cent for manufacturing, to 15 for motor cars, to 25 for apparel. You are the people who will take those TCF industries of Wills and rip them to pieces. You are the people who will take those clothing, textile and footwear industries in the electorate of Wills and take them, thoughtlessly and simply as a piece of political opportunism, to zero, because in that Fightback package where you had zero 'tariffs you thought this was the opportunistic way of looking at the hairy chested ones of protection. There is no sense, no judgment, no consultation, no understanding about these industries. No, you build on years of work by us; just simply adopt it and say, 'We will go to zero-we will go to zero. Don't worry about them; don't worry about the people who are disrupted by it; we will go to zero'. Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition advised a former Treasurer, Treasurer Lynch, on economic policy. I challenge him to give us one note that he gave to either Treasurer about tariff reductions in those seven years. I challenge him to table one note where he argued to that Government, as its principal economic adviser, that tariffs should be reduced to open up competition in this country. I challenge him to give us a note! This Government has done things with courage and fortitude that no coalition government would ever have had the guts or the sense to undertake. We have made judgments that we can take industries which do have reasonably high labour content, like apparel and certain finished textiles, to 25 per cent and that that is enough; that footwear goes to 15, and that is enough; and that general manufacturing goes to 5 and that is enough. But the going to zero is thoughtless and useless. Beyond that, Mr Speaker, those opposite have then misrepresented themselves in the electorate of Wills, and asked me questions about the unemployed. Yet they would ravage-absolutely ravage-all those factories and industries, including the 5,000 employees I mentioned yesterday at South Pacific Tyres",83

This article was headed 'Keating gives thumbs up to Garnaut reform'. Is it also true that you said that the Government was 'committed to making Australia part of the world, a competitive trading entity'-fine-and that abolishing tariffs by the year 2000 was an objective?",84

This document, which made the big tops down changes from 140 and 200 per cent protection levels to 15 per cent, was written two years before the Garnaut report was ever produced-phasing down to 1992.

247,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to the former Government by him urging a reduction in tariffs. He was there for seven years when reform in Australia was a golden opportunity, with control of both Houses of parliament and a mandate for change in 1975. For those seven years, you and the honourable member for Bennelong comatosed the place. Give us some Minister advisings about that. Mr Thckey-I raise a point of order. Standing order 145 states that an answer shall be relevant to the question. The Prime was asked about something he said two years ago in which he committed himself to eliminating tariffs by the year 2000. He is giving us a history lesson about 1975. How can that be relevant?",84
248,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is answering the question.,85
249,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude on this point: this Government removed exchange controls giving Australia an historic change to have a free flow of funds in and out of Australia. This Government reduced the tariff wall of the coalition, giving Australia a freer flow of goods in and out of Australia. It has been the sole government to take on the sclerosis of the postwar years. Nothing that the Opposition can ever say can take it away from us. Trying to opportunistically run in with a thoughtless, mindless zero tariff objective just makes Opposition members look like the fools that they are. CES Offices in the Electorate of Wills",85
250,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It relates to the operation of CES offices. I ask the Minister whether he has an intention to close CES offices in Wills and have this service provided by private providers. Can the Minister inform the House of the initiatives that the Government has taken to assist the unemployed?",85
251,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen proposals to close the three CES offices in the Wills electorate. That is the policy of support for the unemployed that the Liberal Party is offering the Wills electorate in this by-election. That is the position of the Liberal Party. If the population in Wills votes for the Liberal Party in this by-election and then subsequently in the next Federal election, the three CES offices in Wills will be closed, along with those throughout the rest of the nation. It is also the policy of the Liberal Party that the job placement activities that are provided by the CES offices should subsequently be provided by private providers. The CES places five times as many people as private agencies in this country. Among those who do not complete secondary school, the CES places 14 times as many people as the private providing agencies. The groups that would be most adversely affected by a decision to move from the CES job placement activities-I might say that the CES currently fills over 500,000 vacancies a year-would be small business, which would have to pay the private job brokers, and the disadvantaged groups among the unemployed who are especially reliant on free CES services. Private job agencies-it is quite interesting to look at a few of these prices-currently charge a fee of about 15 per cent of the employee's annual salary. In 1990-91 the CES placed 550,000 people in jobs. Assuming an average placement starting salary of only $20,000, the cost to employers of this number of job placements through private agencies charging at this rate would be $1.9 billion. What is interesting about that is that the GST applies to them. The GST imposition in these circumstances would be $250m. Even if the private agencies charged as little as the CES Templine service, the cost would be almost $lOOm, including a GST of over $12m. All the people who stand up here and ask us to address questions of provision for private providers in Wills need to, at the same time, say what they would intend to do. Members of the Opposition intend to ensure that, where those private providers were seeking to place people in employment, they would be charging them a GST on the provisions that they would be putting forward. Mr Thckey-But that is not the way to",85
252,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for O·Connor.,85
253,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not where the matter ends. A 15 per cent GST impost would not be rebateable on any fees charged to the unemployed individual or to an employer in an exempt industry, such as housing and construction and banking and finance. There would be no rebates for people in those positions. Honourable members can imagine the number of people involved in these circumstances who would have an interest in the housing and construction industry, an exempt industry. The number would be extraordinary. Those opposite come into this place, as they have repeatedly in Question Time, and have the hide to ask people on this side of the House what they intend to do with the unemployed. The answer, as far as they are concerned is this: they will continue with very high levels of unemployment, which they have admitted in the policies that they put forward in their package; they will correct. eliminate their support systems in so far as those support systems are provided government; and, when they have finally got them into the private job market with private job brokers, they have really got them by the throat because they will tax them 15 per on the money they pay to a job broker who finds them employment or they will impose a 15 per cent tax on an employer who is going out to acquire a service or provision from a job broker. That is the most despicable conceivable deceit to impose upon any electorate. Those opposite complain about us in that regard when they have that sitting in their back pocket, which they are not prepared to confess and put on the table for the people of Wills. We will do it for you, do not worry about that.",85

304,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer-without notice! The Treasurer will be aware of the hardship being suffered by wool producers and the disproportionate effect of the wool tax which is levied high? on the gross income. Can the Treasurer say whether the wool tax payments are to be tax deductible to wool growers and, if they are, is the proposed rebate to be taxable? If this is the case, would it not be administratively simpler and better, to protect the tax base and wool growers' interests, to reduce the tax to more than adequate 5 per cent?

308,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member the raises the question of the support of Government for the wool industry, which course has been very significant during a time of very great difficulty for the wool industry. The Government decided that there needed be a wool tax in order to support the orderly dispersal and disposal of the wool stockpile. Of course, at that stage we had to make estimates on the best advice of what was likely to happen to the wool price during the course of the disposal of the wool stockpile. inIt was on that basis that the wool tax level It is the case, and I say happily the case, in that the wool market-the price of wool-has in fact improved more dramatically than we of anticipated, anyone anticipated, at the time that the wool tax was struck. It was for that reason that in the context of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement we did respond to the request from the wool industry to do a couple of things: first of all, to some flexibility about the timing of the the repayments of the Wool Realisation Commission to the Government of the loan repayments which had been advanced to it; and, secondly to provide the Wool Realisation Commission with the opportunity to rebate some of the tax which is not at the moment necessary for funding the stockpile.",88

312,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It goes without saying, a Deputy Leader, that when you decide to have a rebate, it is because you have collected too much money, or more money than you need for the particular purpose. Maybe the Deputy of the National Party is prepared to put his hand on his heart and sign in blood the wool price will be in 12 months, in 24 months, or in 36 months time, but the Government is not prepared to-and I suspect on two of he is not prepared to. We are not sure, nor is the Wool Realisation Commission aware, of quite what wool price is going to do over the period the immediately ahead. What we have done, of however, is give the Commission the opportunity to both introduce flexibility in the management of its repayments and adjust the to amount it collects from the wool growers by way of the application of a rebate.

What we must guarantee is that the funding arrangements in place for the orderly disposal of the wool stockpile remain orderly and financially sound.

PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIES: NA",89
334,Mr SPEAKER,GUIDELINES,"For the information of convention, honourable members, I wish to table some The guidelines on the role of Parliamentary the Secretaries. I shall have the guidelines incorSecretaries porated in Hansard. The document read as followsPARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIES-ROLE NA NA NA The matter of Parliamentary Secretaries and procedures of the House, discussed in the Chamber on 16 and 17 October 1991 in my absence overseas on official business, was drawn to my attention on my return. It has also been the subject of ongoing discussion with the Leader of the House. I will now outline the course I propose to follow regarding role and functions of Parliamentary Secretaries relation to the procedures of the House and its committees. Parliamentary Secretaries will perform Chamber duty, representing the Ministry in the Chamber. Provided a Parliamentary Secretary is present in Chamber, I will not consider it necessary to draw to the attention of the House the convention of requiring a Minister to be present. As indicated by the Leader of the House the motion on 16 October, I believe that it is appropriate that Parliamentary Secretaries be permitted to address the House from the despatch box rather than from their allocated seat in the Chamber. This practice would also be appropriate for Opposition Parliamentary Secretaries in relation to the despatch box on the Opposition side of the Chamber. In relation to legislation, following the adoption the House of the revised resolution on Parliamenschedule tary Secretaries and procedures of the House October, Parliamentary Secretaries will be able to introduce bills and move motions (including motions for the second reading). In committee of the whole the provisions of standing order 91 (time limits for debates and speeches) will be as to provide for a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of a bill to be permitted to speak for unspecified periods. The contingent notices which appear on the Notice Paper relating to Ministers and legislation may be moved by Parliamentary Secretaries, should this become necessary. Under the resolutions of the House, Parliamentary Secretaries will also be able to move motions without notice normally moved by Ministers (for example, in relation to the alteration of of business or a motion for the adjournment of the House). In moving motions in the House, Parliamentary Secretaries will not require a seconder, just as motions moved by Ministers do not, by require the support of a seconder. resolution of the House of 16 October repeated earlier provision of precluding Parliamentary from answering questions. It is the practice of the House that Ministers do not ask questions, either of other Ministers, or where permitted, of private Members. This will also apply to Parliamentary Secretaries. I believe that the resolution of the House of 16 October and the sessional orders relating to private Members' business and Members' statements, together with the spirit pertaining to those procedures, has the combined effect of preventing Parliamentary Secretaries from participating in proceedings of that kind. There is no prohibition on Ministers participating in the grievance debate and historically Ministers have on infrequent occasions the taken part in the debate. I therefore feel that it in would be appropriate for Parliamentary Secretaries to be allowed to continue to participate in that debate if they so wish. Finally, as a general rule, I do not believe that Parliamentary Secretaries should be members of the committees of inquiry. There may, however, be occasions when special reasons such as the particular character of a Member's electoral division make a strong case for the Member serving as a member of a parliamentary committee while being in moving a Parliamentary Secretary. Other matters may arise concerning Parliamentary Secretaries and the procedures of the House which have not been covered in this statement. Should that occur, I will address such matters as they arise. NA",90

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required the Standing Orders having risen in their p/aces- .",91
348,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barker) (3.23 p.m.)Today during Question Time we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) twice deny that he forecast that tariff protection should go to zero by the year 2000. Knowing the Prime Minister of old, no doubt that denial will come thrice before long. I had the good fortune, or otherwise, to be in the Cabinet room on 1 July 1985 when the same was parading the room, imploring the those present to adopt a consumption tax. Those people who were in that room that day were, I suppose, somewhat elevated in the business community. The Business Council of Australia was there, its senior executives and senior businessmen, including the current Chairman of BHP. The Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the ACTU were there. Mr Crean, the National Farmers Federation and other representative bodies were there. The Treasurer, as he then was, was imploring us, amidst the clanking cups of cappuccino, to adopt a consumption tax. Mr Bevis-And you opposed it.",91
349,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We did. You are right. But I remember what the present Prime Minister said. He said, 'I will lie in a ditch for your vote'. I wrote it down. Mr Braithwaite-He lies all the time. Mr Downer-What does he mean?",92
350,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At least, that is what my note said.",92
351,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! Members of the Opposition will not draw implications from the speech of the honourable member for Barker, which is quite in order. Their remarks are out of order.",92
352,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker-quite in order. I must have been wrong, as I said, amongst all that clanking of coffee cups, because the Prime Minister has changed his position 180 degrees on a consumption tax; we know that. He must have said, 'I will lie in a ditch for any vote'. Yesterday he went down to Wills and he did just that-for any vote. He went down below the gutter, into the ditch, and blatantly ran for votes on the issue of protection. He knew full well that back then in London in 1989 he had said that abolishing tariffs by the year 2000 was an objective: he said that time and time again. We are now in a situation where we have a Prime Minister who has changed his position on consumption tax, changed his position on tariffs, changed his position on Coronation Hill, and changed his position on all sorts of things. He knows that the responsible position, both from Opposition and Government, is that protection has to come down. In fact, he has boasted at length-and did it again today-that his is the only government that had the courage to bring protection down. I might say that he also said that there was nobody on this side of the House who had ever advocated such a thing in the early days and that he, and presumably the ACTU, were the only people who took that particular position. That is quite wrong. Mr Andrew-What about the member for Wakefield?",92
353,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indeed. What about the honourable member for Wakefield? What about the whole of the NFF for the last 10 or 12 years-long before the ACTU ever got into that boat? We know that this Government has an industry policy which has put an enormous number of people out of work. It has put them out of work because it has embraced only one half of the policy. It has tariffs coming down, but it will not get costs down. We, like you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - at least like your side of the House in recent days-have gone round to business after business after business. They say to us, 'The first thing you have got to do is to get these taxes that you impose'-you being the Government-'on us down'. That is what they say. The tax that big business wants down is payroll tax. It is No. l.' They say it to us every time, in every meeting, in every boardroom. So why does the Government not get it down. Do those opposite know why they cannot get it down? It is because this man who sat down here earlier today has done a 180-degree tum on the consumption tax. That is why they cannot get it down. When the same man came back from his sojourn in London-no doubt talking to the Queen-he said, 'Protection under whatever guise is protection. Protection, whatever it is called, ends up being protection'. He went on to say, 'We have had 40 years of going backwards under this policy'. When he said, 'Protection under whatever guise is protection', was he talking about the Government's contraception policy? What was he talking about if he was not talking about tariff reduction, getting rid of quotas and getting rid of all those impediments to making Australia healthy? He has boasted about being tougher than Button. He has boasted about getting up there and making sure that he can do the things which the Minister cannot do because the Minister is not strong enough in this area. Today, when the Prime Minister was asked a question on this subject. even by one of his own side. he had to get out the 12 March statement and quote the figures out of the back of the book-because. of course. he did not want to remember the things he had said about protection in previous days. Finally, to top it all off. he said that what he had said on one occasion about protection was only given out on a radio show. Admittedly, the particular radio show has some foibles and some problems; nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country was putting out policy which he says was only given out on a radio show. He has boasted about bringing protection down faster than anybody else. It just shows how tough this man is at his first election test. It is only a small election he is not going to lose government over Wills. But at his first test, at the first whiff grapeshot-as he is wont to say; but not even at that, at the first puff of smoke-he throws out a bit of a loosener on the Government's protection policy. At his first by-election he has folded. I actually do not believe the Prime Minister. I do not believe that the Prime Minister has changed his position at all. I believe that he has dabbled with the truth. I believe, as the Government said in the March statement, that it is going to do what we said we would do. It is going to drop general tariffs right across the board to 5 per cent by the year 1996. That is what it is going to do. The Government is going to bring down the tariffs on refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, clothes dryers, spray guns, weighing machines and every other thing that you can think of in that sort of area to 5 per cent, and in fact after the developing country preferences to zero per cent by the year 1996. That is what the Government is going to do and there is no point in trying to portray a position that is any different. In fact, what we are going have in 1996 is an average nominal tariff position of 3 per cent over the whole of this country. That is its industry policy and it still will not have delivered it, not that members on the Government side will be there, but even if they were, they will not have were delivered the other side of the equation. What the Government has is an industry policy which has delivered a monumental failure to Australian business and the people it employs. It has killed some of these industries. It has killed them while reducing assistance across the board. It has cut their tariff support but it has not cut their costs. As I said before, already we have had an automotive manufacturer in the House this morning saying the Government did not deliver on economic reform. In fact, that manufacturer is saying that its mentor and holding company in another part of the world does not believe that the Government is going to deliver either, and neither do we. Every business has asked the Government to do it. Meeting after meeting they tell us, testand they must have been telling the Government as well. They do not tell us one of thing and the Government something else, but the Government is not listening. In fact, the Government has, as I said, enough Australian businesses believing it is not going to get these costs down that they are starting to take up their shoes and walk offshore. So why does the Government not get rid of some of these costs? Why does the Government not get rid of payroll tax? It is because it cannot. It is locked in. It cannot get rid of it because of its policy on consumption tax. Why does the Government not get rid of fuel excise? Why does the Government not get rid of the super levy? Why does it not get rid of excise on fuel? It knows as well as I know that all of these costs and others add up to a disadvantage on every Australian farm of $8,000 a year. If it were to fix them, that is what they would pick up. MUltiply that by the sort of figure one would have to to get to the equivalent arrangements for Pacific Dunlop, BHP or Amcor or the rest and one gets to some quite monumental figures. On top of that, of course, the Government to is not going to get rid of the arrangements that lock it into having the ACTU control business in Australia. It controls big business in this country. It is the one impediment that would give it the greatest productivity changes and the greatest attitudinal changes if it to make that change and allow people to make their own arrangements with their own employees. I do not believe the Government has the courage to do that job. Not only that, I know it will not do it because it is totally tied to that institution and in fact reactionary in the proper definition of the word 'reathose ctionary' which is conservative and resistant to change. Those changes have got to be made. They have to be made in a hurry and in the interests of Australian business because as Brian Loton said the other day, unlesbusiness is profitable it does not employ anybody. What we have got to have in this country is profits, productivity, attitudinal change and freeing up the arrangements. That has been the case for as long as the Labor Party has been in power. There is absolutely no doubt that Australian business needs. believes those changes will not be made while the Labor Party is in government. Australian business believes, as it has said to us innumerable times, that it can take the tariff reductions over time as long as they are predictable and as long as it can foresee and understand what is going to happen to it. But Australian business cannot take or absorb the changes to assistance which take place without the other costs coming down. All of the latest work will show-as we have said for so long now that one can hardly a vote. repeat it without boring oneself to death-that the greatest benefit will come to manufacturing exporters through the reduction of tariffs. But none of those things will happen unless we get our costs down and unless we get rid of the central control by the ACTU and other institutions of business in country. I have not made much of a play since have been here about this central control the ACTU; it is better that other people outside have been saying this. is time that we differentiated our policy from the Government's. The Government has not the slightest intention of allowing ordinary people to make their own decisions in the workplace, and we have. We want those Opposition people to get that independence. We want those people to make those decisions for themselves. We want them to write individual contracts for which they can be responsible. When they have had a win or when they have The concernshad a loss we want them to have the confidence which those decisions give them so that they can go on and make more decisions. We do not want an Australia where all of decisions are made by a government. Exactly the same thing applies to the incidence of business tax. We do not want to take $20 billion in business tax and give back $3 billion to business and say, 'This is government policy. Here's a polyglot of measures; a few export subsidies. Here is your industry policy'. We want to leave that $20 billion in the hands of private industry, not of government, so that it can make the decisions and it can get first cut at the money and create the sorts of jobs that Australia - conclusion, I come back to my initial porot. The Prime Minister went down to Wills yesterday and he flicked a change in the direction of tariff policy. He did this for one reason only: he did it in a big run for votes in Wills. I do not believe that he has changed; I believe he is just fabricating, delving and dabbling in the truth to try to pick up a few cheap votes. Nothing has changed from the consumption tax debate in 1985 and nothing will. The Prime Minister will do anything for",92
354,Mr FREE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The timing of, and the motivation for, this particular matter of public importance is absolutely fascinating. This matter of public importance comes from this the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). Indeed, his attempted display of machismo during Question Time today comes I at a time when the honourable member is by under extreme pressure and is subject to the strongest criticism from within the ranks of But I think it his own Party. Many of us would have read an article by Glenn Milne, which appeared on the front page of the Australian yesterday, dealing with difficulties over the tariff issue. It will assist honourable members in the course of this debate if I refer to some matters that Glenn Milne raised and reported on in yesterday's Australian. He said: that is, the concerns about the tariff issuemark the first sign of Opposition disgruntlement over the implementation of the Coalition's Fightback package. Mr MCLachlan, in particular, has been privately criticised within the Coalition for his failure to spell out details of the reform agenda and its benefits to manufacturers. There is a view within the Opposition's Industry and Structural Reform Task Force that Mr MCLachlan, a leading economic ""dry"", has approached the issue in a ""purist"" and ""abstract"" fashion rather than with a practical view to the needs of recession-strapped industry. While members of the task force agree with the broad thrust of Opposition policy, they were due to meet Mr MCLachlan last night to air their concerns. Despite the grievances dating back to December, it is understood Mr MCLachlan is still no closer to producing any detailed micro-reform timetable. Members of the committee have voiced their fears about the policy timetable at private meetings with relevant federal bureaucrats. The article goes on. The target audience for this debate and the speech of the honourable member for Barker was therefore not the public, members of the Government or industry; it was a speech directed towards his own coalition colleagues in a bid to shore up his deteriorating position. I will now turn to the subject matter of the matter of public importance raised by the honourable member for Barker. It castigates the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his alleged failure on taxation reform and microeconomic reform: I point out at the outset that this Government has been responsible for the most thorough going reform of taxation in the nation's history. I will remind honourable members of those reforms: the taxation of capital gains, the taxation of fringe benefits, the lower company tax rate and the removal of the entertainment rorts. Mr Bevis-They opposed it.",94
355,Mr FREE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Every one of those measures, as the honourable member for Brisbane points out, was opposed by successive oppositions and their successive leaders. When the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was Treasurer and the present Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), was his economic adviser, they presided over a taxation system which was a shambles, a taxation system in which tax paying by the wealthy had become an almost voluntary activity. The ordinary PAYE taxpayer had to shoulder the entire burden. As I have mentioned, the coalition opposed almost every reform measure introduced. It opposed the taxation of capital gains, of company cars and of other fringe benefits. It wanted to retain the taxpayer subsidised boozy business lunch. At the same time constituents in electorates such as mine were carting off their lunch to work in a brown paper bag, executives enjoyed the benefit of a taxpayer subsidised long, boozy lunch. Now the Opposition is proposing to burden Australian business with a new tax. That new tax, the GST, will be particularly burdensome for small business because, as was pointed out during a similar debate yesterday, 95 per cent of small busin-ss does not pay payroll tax anyway; so it will get nothing from that part of the Fightback package. Philip Anderson, the Director of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen and Co., wrote the following in the January-February issue of the magazine Corporate Management: Even for businesses with dedicated accounting staff, the accounting requirements of a GST will take some time to get used to. For smaller firms, the need to comply with the requirements of GST will come as quite a shock. That is quite an understatement when one considers the evidence from overseas to which I will refer shortly. The coalition's GST will certainly create jobs for tax inspectors, for accountants, for computer salesmen and for lawyers, but it will destroy real jobs in the real economy. The Liberals never cared a jot about micro-economic reform when they were in government, when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister. They did not care about it in the 1950s or 1960s. Now they have the gall, through matters of public importance such as this, to complain that we are not doing enough, but they certainly have no proposals of their own, as was spelled out in the Australian yesterday. Those opposite talk about waterfront reform as if it was not already happening, but they offer no tangible proposals other than provoking confrontation with ordinary working people and their unions and ridiculous proposals, like sending in troops to work the wharves. Des Moore, an economic commentator of great reputation, when speaking of Fightback in a recent article in the IPA Review and dealing with the comments of the honourable member for Barker, mentioned that the Fightback package would take $20 billion worth of taxation off the back of business. What was not mentioned by the honourable member for Barker-but which was addressed very well by Mr Moore in his article-was that the coalition has given some credence to that misconception by business by pursuing the notion that a $20 billion cut in taxes on business would be provided through the introduction of a GST. It could equally well be argued, of course, that the introduction of a GST would place $27 billion increase on taxes on business. is business, after all, that has to pay the in the first instance and then has to recoup by passing it on by way of increased prices, just as it is business that will not pay other three taxes that the coalition proposes abolish in the first instance, and then pass those savings on to consumers through lower prices. There has been some confusion amongst the ranks of the Opposition about just exactly what Fightback would lift off the back of business. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), who is in the chamber, had two views on this. Quoted in the Australian on 12 March he said that on Fightback would lift $20 billion in tax from the nation's industries. It is a remarkable package. A report in the Canberra TImes two days later, on 15 March, again quotes him saying that the Fightback package would draw about $50 billion in taxation from Australian business sector. So it is a remarkable package indeed that can achieve was a $30 billion improvement in just two days. Either way, disregarding whether the honourable member for Gippsland was correctly quoted, the fact remains that Fightback will impose a $27 billion burden on the business sector. Mr MCLachlan-How is that?",95
356,Mr FREE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It will disadvantage the small business sector because it will not receive the advantage of the removal of payroll tax. Essentially the Fightback package is a reshuffle of the tax pack. It is essentially, as the Prime Minister pointed out, a tenth order issue. I was interested in the remark of the honourable member for Barker. He said that unless business makes profits it will not employ anybody. I agree. There is an earlier step, though: unless business has customers it will not make profits and will not employ anybody. When we look at the Treasury study of the distributive effects of the Fightback package, and the effects that it has on people at different income levels, and when we look at the presentation in the Four Corners program a little while ago about the effect of the a Fightback package on different families, we It find that 78 per cent of taxpayers are in fact GST worse off under the Fightback package. Of it course, the income brackets which are worse affected begin at slightly under a $40,000 the income. Everybody above a $40,000 income to is better off, but those below, the majority of Australians-those ordinary Australians whose interests the honourable member for Barker would have us believe he would like to protect-will be worse off under the Fightback package: 78 per cent of Australians. How then will business benefit if 78 per cent of Australians have a lower disposable income as the result of this package? We have some excellent overseas evidence the effect of similar measures, a goods and services tax, on the business sector. The New Zealand experience, for example, has been well dealt with by a New Zealand accountant, as Mr John Morine. He has six major criticisms of the impact of a goods and services tax on the the business sector. He states: Five years ago a Goods and Services Tax (GST) introduced in New Zealand. It has resulted in: a confusing and little-understood tax content in virtually every transaction handled by every business, but with variations in the rules for different transactions. Every cash receipt, every payment and each sale and purchase transaction is subject to GST. . a tax-take to the Government of $5 billion per annum, of which $1.25 billion or 25 per centa quarteris lost in meeting the cost to the business sector of complying with the GST legislation and accounting for tax. an estimated 20 per cent dissipation of time and resources for small business proprietors. an unknown number of small business failures due to the costs of compliance. a decline in taxable company income for business-and therefore to the tax authorities and Government-because of the forced redirection of resources away from revenue generation and into compliance. confusion within the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department . . . where staff are beset with the complexities of trying to audit GST transactions after the event. Mr Morine's conclusion is that a number of strong arguments have been disclosed against the introduction of a GST. He says: Of these, the most persuasive is that complying with the GST legislation will require business to divest itself of about 20 per cent of its resources. This serious redirection of resources will lower the business income subject to company income tax by the Australian Government. He ends with an appeal to small business in Australia. He says: If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive. There is also ample evidence from Canada that shows, again, that the introduction of a expired) GST has had a devastating effect on the small business sector. A survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business titled 'The GST: A National Tax Tragedy' revealed that 70.6 per cent of respondents found that the GST had a negative impact their business. There is no doubt that the introduction of the Opposition's Fightback package will have a devastating effect on business. 1 refer to the area of microwas economic reform, which 1 know will also be referred to in some detail by the honourable member for Brisbane. 1I have already menclaims tioned the Government's record of achievethis ment on waterfront reform and taxation untruths, reform. 1 draw the attention of the Parliament also to the proposals on micro-economic reform contained in the One Nation statement. Honourable members opposite should read the elements of the new aviation policy which will allow for competition on international services and new domestic competition from Qantas and later from Air New Zealand. 1 point to the record of the Opposition when it was in government. These Opposition parties when in government held the country in the straitjacket of the two-airlines agreement for far too long. 1 point to the initiative on electricity generation, distribution and transmission contained in the One Nation document. 1 point also to the Opposition record in this area. The Opposition record in this area has been absolutely nothing at all. It comes back to the Party which conceived and built the Snowy Mountains scheme to now lead in the nineties the reform of the generation, transmission and distribution of power in this country. 1 point also to our reforms in the industrial relations area. In December 1991 working days lost represented the lowest figure recorded for any month in three decades. It is a record that we have been proud of. It is proof of the effectiveness of Government IR policies. The Opposition in response can offer nothing but confrontation. It fails to recognise that these ordinary people of whom the honourable member for Barker spoke during his contribution are represented, in fact, by unions which are doing a good job. (Time",96
357,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have had a remarkable day in parliament. The has Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been KO-ed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on with a question; he has been caught out for not telling the truth on radio and spreading falsities over the airwaves to the Australian people. What was his answer to this when he caught out? He said, 'I said it on radio. It does not count because 1 said it on radio'. That is unbelievable. The Prime Minister that he can say anything on radio in country and it does not count. He can tell mislead the Australian people and do anything in that regard over the radio-as long it is over the airwaves-and it does not count. What a standard the Prime Minister has set for the Australian people to judge him by come the next election. He has condemned himself. I am sure that the Australian people will judge him accordingly at the next election. Of course, the track record is not very good either. There are one million people unemployed in Australia today-and, as I speak, the queues lengthen. We found out in Question Time today that, even in an electorate as small as Wills, there are three CES offices. There must be a lot of people unemployed in Wills to justify three CES offices. That is the state that the country is in. But yesterday the Prime Minister came in here in Question Time and tried to quietly slip it in that he changed his mind on tariffschanged his mind on yet another thing. Of course, it blew up in his face. We see the headlines in the Australian Financial Review this morning, 'Keating in backpedal on tariffs'. The Barcelona Olympics are to take place later this year. If there were an event in the gymnastics for flip-flop and we sent the Prime Minister over, he would be a white-hot favourite for the gold medal. Why has the Prime Minister changed his mind in this area? It is for one reason and one reason alone-we have a Wills by-election coming up. As the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) said, at the first hint of political pressure this Prime Minister will cave in and he has caved in again on this issue. We have had to stomach in this chamber for a long period of time this false hairy chested nationalism that he has been running around with. Then he comes out with an Irish cultural cringe-bog Irish, bagging the monarchy and the British. The Prime Minister has gone on trumpeting about how Australia should take an independent stance on the world stage in foreign policy. Another issue that has come up is South Africa, and he genuflects to the ANC there. So it goes on. He squibbed out on that. He talked about having a debate on the Wills by-election. What happened? The Leader of the Opposition quite rightly took up the challenge and said, 'Let's go to the Coburg Town Hall and have this debate'. What did the Prime Minister do? He wimped out again. Mr Ronaldson-Phoney, phoney, phoney.",97
358,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indeed. He harps constantly about taking strong and consistent lines on issues. The honourable member for Barker raised the point about the whiff of grapeshot-this quote that the Prime Minister used to use frequently. I invite honourable members at the end of this debate to go back to their offices and punch two words into their computers- 'Keating' and 'grapeshot'and then push the button for the print-out. Guess what will happen? A wheelbarrow of paper will come out with quotes that he has made about people on the Opposition side caving in at the first whiff of grapeshot. But what does he do? He caves in. He is the first one into the bunker before the gun is even loaded. One has only to look at the strength of his commitment on tariffs. It is quite extraordinary. If one goes to the 12 March 1991 Building a Competitive Australia document that he was quoting from today and opens it up and starts to read his speech, one finds a number of remarkable sentences in it. He says: The package of measures announced today ends forever Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a device for industrial development. Later he goes on to say: By turning its back on tariffs, Australia will be further propelled in its quest for international trade and efficiency. Later he says: Within a couple of years, remaining non-tariff barriers will have been completely removed. ' That is just on one page. Tum to the next page and he says: Within this decade, Australia will have renounced once and for all the fallacious doctrine that prosperity can be found behind the insular wall of protection. That is absolutely unequivocal to me. It is not off the top of the head stuff-not said on some John Laws radio program that perhaps he could be excused for, because he has told us now that anything he ever says on radio again cannot be believed. Here he is, in his own document, condemned out of his own mouth. I can only take that to read that he is unequivocal in his opposition to tariff protection. The hypocrisy and the duplicity of this man is breathtaking indeed.",98
359,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Parkes will need to withdraw 'hypocrisy' in relation to the Prime Minister.,99
360,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The previous Prime Minister used to use the word constantly.,99
361,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Parkes will withdraw.,99
362,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The previous Prime Minister used to use the word 'hypocrisy' constantly in this chamber.,99
363,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Parkes will resume his seat and I will call the next member if he does not withdraw.,99
364,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I withdraw. It is not an isolated incident. In 1985 who was the strongest advocate in Australia for a goods and services tax? Opposition members-Paul Keating.,99
365,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Paul Keating, the present Prime Minister, indeed. Which person in Australia today is the strongest advocate against the goods and services tax? Opposition members-Paul Keating.",99
366,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How can one believe this man? The shifting and weaving of this person has assumed Himalayan proportions. How did it come about that he came in here yesterday and changed his mind on tariffs after a visit to a factory on the border of the electorate of Wills-the South Pacific tyre factory? Mr MCArthur-It's in MCEwen.,99
367,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is in MCEwen. He is not even game to go into Wills. Apparently this was his first visit to a factory. He has been clocking up a few firsts recently. We do not have to cast our minds back too far to remember when he paid his first visit to a football match, and since then he has been talking about kicking a few tries. I guess we should be grateful that the end of the cricket season is coming, because he would be lecturing people about bowling a few sixes, or something like that. The Prime Minister totally missed the point of that trip to the factory of South Pacific Tyres. If honourable members read page 2 of today's Australian, they will see a picture of Mr Chadwick, the Managing Director of South Pacific Tyres, showing the Prime Minister around. The accompanying article says: Mr Chadwick, who took Mr Keating on a tour of the company's $120 million high-technology Somerton plant on the border of the Wills electorate, said bureaucratic delays in the anti-dumping procedures were a big problem. He said he urged Mr Keating to review the situation during the tour, but the Prime Minister had remained non-committal about future government action against dumping. In other words, the thing that was concerning the Managing Director of South Pacific Tyres, which the Prime Minister has been going on about for two days in Question Time, was not so much tariff protection as anti-dumping procedures. If honourable members look at the coalition's policy, they will see that it offers exactly what Mr Chadwick wants. The Prime Minister offers nothing. He is noncommitta1. He has missed the point entirely. We have policies that will save the jobs in this factory, and in others. I will mention just a few of our policies. In relation to the exchange rate, we will float the dollar more freely; we will not be holding the dollar high deliberately. What happens when the dollar is held high? We get cheaper imports, including tyres from South Korea-which no doubt displeases the Managing Director of South Pacific Tyres. Exports are dearer. This tyre company is an export factory. Perhaps the Prime Minister should look at that instead of bragging that the Reserve Bank of Australia, in propping up the dollar, is in his pocket. The Prime Minister should look at the coalition's industrial relations policy. We have the example of the SPC canning factory in Shepparton. No doubt more flexibility is needed at the South Pacific Tyres factory. He should put in place the GST policy that we are espousing, that he espoused in 1985, to get busine8l) costs down and to remove all tax input costs off the back of business$20,OOOm of them. What would that do to the South Pacific Tyres factory? Many things. Even if we look at the Treasury document in attachment No.5, we will read that manufacturing will benefit-by the Treasury's own document-by $5,370m. These are the sorts of policies that should be put in place. Surely we do not have to revisit the tariff debate and try to reconvert this economic troglodyte, reborn for a by-election. It is time the Prime Minister came to his senses. (Time expired)",99
368,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we have heard from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) amounts to about eight minutes of sometimes colourful rhetoric and about two minutes of substance. The issues that the Opposition has raised are important ones and ones that he has not addressed in any measure in this debate, nor in substance in policy, and certainly not in record. If we had a record on economic management like that of the Opposition, we would probably adopt that tactic: avoid any discussion of the facts. The record of the Opposition when it was in government and its present policies do not stand it in good stead. Let us look at the issues that the honoumble member for Parkes raised on the questions of micro-economic reform and taxation reform and what our relative positions have been on employment. So far as taxation law in this country is concerned, as was pointed out earlier by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), the greatest positive reform of taxation since Federation has occurred in the past nine years of this Government. Company tax levels have been reduced from 46 per cent, when we came to office, to 39 per cent. The top marginal personal income tax rate has fallen from 60 per cent to 47 per cent. The bottom rate when we came to office-that is, the lowest rate under the then coalition government-that the lowest paid workers in this country were required to pay was 30 per cent; it is now 20 per cent. Those rates are to be further adjusted downwards as part of the One Nation statement released by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this year. Middle income earners who currently pay 38c in the dollar will pay only 30c in the dollar by 1996. Under the proposals put forward by this Government, those currently paying 46c in the dollar will be required to pay only 40c in the dollar in 1996. While we were in the process of making these reforms, we were not just about shifting money here and there; we were about introducing some equity into the taxation system. We went about ensuring that some of the loopholes that existed and thrived under the Opposition when it was in government, under the tutelage of the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his capacity as adviser to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), did not continue. We took action to end some of those rorts. At each step, those opposite opposed us. They opposed the fringe benefits tax. They opposed it when it was introduced and they opposed it at the last election. They opposed the capital gains tax: a tax for the privileged, a tax that fewer than one per cent of Australians pay; a tax affecting those who are fortunate enough to have a capital base and who can trade and make additional income, which previously was able to escape any tax requirements. There were the free lunches. The list goes on. On every single one of those measures where this Government took steps to ensure that there was some equity in the tax system and that the burden was not being unfairly shouldered by PAYE taxpayers, the ordinary wage and salary earners, at every step of the way throughout the past nine years the record shows unequivocally that those opposite opposed us-and they stand condemned for it. . The approach of those opposite to tax reform is to shift from an income tax to a consumption tax and, in some way, thereby dramatically improve the quality of life of Australians and increase production-by increasing the cost of daily items: milk and meat, bread and butter, and clothing. That is their approach to reform-not the serious issues that this Government has confronted over the past decade. Of course, as a result of the reforms which we have set in place, the Australian taxation regime is now the second lowest of the OECD countries. That is a record that this Government has introduceda record of lower taxes and more equitable taxes. For a moment let us turn to the job market. There is no doubt that the current level of unemployment is too high and is of concern to the Government, as it should be to all decent Australians. In 1990-91 the number of unemployed people for every vacancy was 20.9. That is too high. It is a more useful statistic, I might add, than just talking about unemployed people, because it represents the number of people chasing every single job that is advertised. In the last year when those opposite were in government, the number was not 20.9; it was 34.4. There were an extra 14 or 15 people in the queue for every single job in the community when those opposite were in government. In the 12 months after we took office in 1983-84, we reduced that abysmal performance of the coalition government from 34 people who were looking for every single job to 21. As the years unfolded and until now, we reduced that number to a low in 1988-89 of 7.7 people seeking each advertised job. That was accomplished by creating jobs in Australia at a rate which those opposite never had. In the first four years of government, the Labor Party created in excess of 700,000 extra jobs. In the last four years in which the Liberals were in government in this country, 300,000 jobs were created. Even taking account of the downturn that has occurred in the past 12 months, this Government has created in excess of 1.3 million jobs since 1983. That is an increase in jobs. Mr Reith-Tell that to the unemployed.",100
369,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we can easily tell to the unemployed, as happened in Question Time, is what those opposite intend to do with their benefits, what those opposite intend to do with their cost of living and standard and what those opposite intend to do with the job market when they get their opportunityif they ever get their opportunity. Their plans for reform are about nil tariffs-none. Those opposite would just wipe them out and would do the same thing in the job market. They would wipe out any protection. In the view of those opposite, industrial relations is a free-far-all, the law of the jungle: the fittest survive-without equity, without referees and without recourse to anybody-and the rest can fend for themselves. It is interesting that the Opposition adopts that approach at a time when, as the Minister said, the level of industrial disputation, not just now but through the life of this Government, has been at about one-third of that when the coalition was last in office. Mr Reith-It is the recession.",101
370,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is nonsense and the honourable member knows it. If he had looked through the figures on industrial relations over the 1980s when the economy was very buoyant, he would know that days lost through strike in this country were one-third of the record when the lot opposite had the opportunity to run this country. They induced a situation where strikes increased threefold at least, and that is going back to the days when they supported centralised wage fixing. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who raised this matter of public importance, is not new to the debate. As he pointed out, he was involved in discussions in the early days on the tax summit. As I have had cause to mention on other occasions in this House during other debates, it has not always been a happy venture for him. The June edition of the Bulletin last year carried an article headlined 'Libs pull the wheels off the car plan'. This followed some meetings the honourable member had with the car industry. The article reads: Australia's car makers are running scared of a coalition victory in the next federal election. Causing the concern is an unreported speech to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) by the shadow minister for industry and commerce, of living Ian MCLachlan ... The Opposition's policy went down so well with the motor vehicle industry last year that it ended up with that sort of coverage in the Bulletin. That is what the industry thought of the Opposition's policies. Let us look at some of the other areas in which people have spoken about the need for reform. The often quoted ones are the wharves and the shipping industry. Those opposite know this but tend to ignore it when it suits them. In 1992 Australian ships are being crewed at a level of the order of 12 crew members fewer than was the case 10 years ago. This number is now less than the OECD average. Not only has it been the case with the shipping industry, but similar sorts of gains-in fact, even more dramatic oneshave occurred on the wharves in the stevedoring industry. Bulk handling cargo grain ports are now 50 to 80 per cent more efficient; a fact that has been acknowledged on the public record by the major shipping companies, including Conaust. The Australian Wheat Board is on the record in its last annual report acknowledging that it saved $IOm last year alone because of efficiencies in port handling of its grain. Of course, there are other records as well. I refer to a commentary in the Australian Financial Review on the handling of containers in the various ports. This demonstrates that the Port of Melbourne is amongst the world's best in the time it takes to turn the container cargo around. That type of record has occurred without the sort of industrial disputation that the Opposition wants to invoke. It has occurred because sensible people have sat down for the good of the country and the good of their own employees and members to try to increase the size of the cake, and to do it cooperatively-to do it through a method of consultation which Opposition members seem unable to comprehend, much less embrace. The Government's record in micro-economic reform is a very proud one and it has been a very effective one. It has been occurring at a time of worldwide cyclical downturn. (TIme expired)",101

374,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes, I do, Mr Deputy Speaker.",102
375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member may proceed.,102
376,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is in respect of two matters' both of which were referred to during Question Time today by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In the first instance I was misrepresented in a claim by the Treasurer, which was a repeat of a newspaper article, to the effect that I had been canvassing the names for the replacement of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. That is not simply a misrepresentation; it is simply and totally wrong. I have not been canvassing, nor would I. Mr Fraser's appointment is a statutory one, as I am sure honourable members would be aware. The second misrepresentation was the assertion that, in a speech which I gave to the Asia-Pacific Bankers Club in Sydney approximately 10 days ago, I blackguarded the Governor of the Reserve Bank and that my remarks were personal to him in some way. That is simply not true. I restated coalition policy in about three lines within the context of a broader speech. We did not cross swords, as has been said in this place. Quite frankly, we did not even cross paths. He made a contribution in a session run by the Bankers Club separate from the session within which I contributed. To support my refutation of the claims made, I make just four factual points. Firstly, I was invited to a meeting which was private and in which the participants were asked to speak frankly-which I did. Secondly, the Chairman of the club 'wrote to me in a pro forma way but thanked me for my contribution and made no reference to the matter. Thirdly, a press release was issued by the club in which no reference was made to the matter. Fourthly, I have had informal contact from senior sources within the Reserve Bank itself to the effect that they themselves could not understand what all the fuss was about. This contact was made with me about a week . after the address which I gave to the Asia Pacific Bankers Club. In fact, the club to my knowledge has been embarrassed by the fact that the Government has seized upon a leak to misrepresent remarks that I made.",102
377,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,You are adding a bit of new material now.,103

380,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I conclude by saying that that is very odd from a man who wears Italian suits, collects French clocks and wants to exercise the Opposition now",103
381,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,No; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should now resume his seat.,103

388,Mr FORD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"As earlier speakers have said, Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) show that the Government is clearly out of control. It has completely lost the plot. Appropriation Bills are being amended with gay abandon while millions of Australians are ruthlessly consigned to the scrap heap of unemployment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) believes that if he blasts the Opposition policies, if he blasts the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and if he engages in schoolyard bully boy tactics and public slanging matches, somehow this proves his policies are correct. Like King Canute, who thought he could stop the incoming tide, the Prime Minister believes he can stem the tide of unemployment simply by blasting the Opposition. On 25 February last, the Prime Minister delivered yet another economic statementhis sixteenth attempt to placate the trade unions and their new classmates in the public SENATE sector and the single interest lobby groups. At the same time he has embarked on yet another futile and costly venture aimed at kickstarting an increasingly moribund economy. But, doomed to fail since February, the ridiculous One Nation manifesto has been more appropriately renamed 'One Broke Nation' and 'One Nation Equals Australia's Ruination'. In delivering his judgment on the former Treasurer's latest attempt to bluff the Australian people, P. P. MCGuinness summed up thus: The most curious thing about Paul Keating's miniBudget is how old fashioned, male oriented and naive it is. As usual, Mr MCGuinness has got it right. It is hardly surprising that the Prime Minister should have opted for what is basical1y a 1930s style public works relief program. Fifteen thousand jobs on the roads and 4,000 on the railways is about all Australia could have expected from a disciple of Jack Lang, although, to be fair to Lang, I believe he was genuinely distressed about the disastrous levels of unemployment that engulfed Australia during the great depressions. There is no doubt that, during the 1890s depression and the depression in the 1930s, Lang's sympathy was for the unemployed and his desire, however misguided, to do something on their behalf was sincere. I cannot help thinking how ironic it is that, 60 years after Lang's 'dismissal by Sir Phillip Game, his protege exhibits no such remorse or concern. Indeed, as the major architect of the current situation-the man who has given us a million unemployed-he continues to remain quite unmoved by the plight of the jobless. One hundred years ago working men and women founded the Australian Labor Party. They did so in the hope that their interests would be represented in the Parliament and their children would enjoy a higher standard of living and more opportunities than they had. There is no doubt that these people would be horrified to see the dismal results of their struggles and their personal sacrifices. During the last two decades their Party has been hijacked by the self-interested middle class trendies and the union thugs of the Swanston Street Soviet. It is not difficult to see why, in 1992, Labor has lost its commitment to the unemployed and the blue-collar battlers. In my electorate of Dunkley, youth unemployment is over 50 per cent. How many young people from the Frankston area does the Prime Minister think will get work building roads and railways? The answer, of course, is no-one. The Government recently announced the release of its task program in Dunkley. These are the leaflets that have been distributed. For the task ahead, it states: How can your firm avoid retrenchments? How can your firm avoid going to a shorter working time? How can you keep your firm's skilled staff? How can your staff upgrade their skills? There is one very simple answer which covers each question: call an election; get rid of the Government. That is the way to do it. Training and educating our youth is a tremendous idea, but training them for what is the problem. Putting people into training programs-when we all know there are no job opportunities for them when they finish-is nothing more than a cruel confidence trick. Worse still, many of these programs simply exist to provide employment for middle class, university educated trainers, Labor's new constituency. There is nothing in the One Nation statement that will give even a glimmer of hope to our youth. A generation is about to be condemned to the scrap heap of dependency. A generation is about to be denied the opportunities that have been taken for granted by all Australians since World War II. Our youth, and many older Australians as well, see a society in which there is little incentive to work, little incentive to look after oneself and little incentive to save. They see a nation whose leader denigrates the achievements of the past and who pours scorn on the institutions that safeguard our freedoms and underpin our democratic way of life. The Prime Minister's shameful attack on the flag is, of course, nothing more than a cheap diversionary tactic and· a sop to the multicultural industry. Such attempts to undermine and discredit the Australian nation only reveal the moral bankruptcy of the current Government. In his most eloquent defence of the flag, Senator Kemp recently argued as follows: The Union Jack in the corner of our flag symbolises the settlement of modern Australia, our law, language and· the institutions upon which our society was founded. An extract from a poem, believed to have been written by a returned soldier from the Great War, sums up the symbolism very well: It doesn't mean we owe allegiance To a forgotten imperial dream. We've the star to show where we are going And the old flag to show where we've been. This institution, this Government and, more particularly, the Prime Minister have failed our young people. They have failed the nation. The Prime Minister should be called 'Rainbow' - always promising a pot of gold but never delivering-or, alternatively, 'Rainbow Warrior'. We could leave it to the French to put forward their own solution to Australia's problems. I hear the Prime Minister at Question Time boasting about the number of jobs he has created, boasting about the restructuring and micro-economic reform and boasting about the world competitive industries he has created. But where are they? There is nothing in this thriving, competitive and dynamic economy. It is a figment of the Prime Minister's imagination. Just like the Emperor's new clothes, it is an illusion. Prosperity may have been his aim, but the failures of the last nine years make it quite clear that the policies of this Government are resting on very flimsy foundations indeed. These are the foundations of government control, of centralised planning, of attempts pick winners, of endless job creation schemes and training programs, of bureaucratic busybodies interfering in business and the private lives of citizens, of the entrenchment of trade union privilege and of the steady erosion of the rights and freedoms of individual Australians. As if this were already not enough, to add insult to injury, within hours of delivering the big spending, but unfunded, manifesto, the Prime Minister went out in the community quoting his looney left wing version of military history, upsetting and dividing the nation and deliberately deflecting attention from the package and its miserable message of despair. The attacks on the flag and the cries for republicanism are nothing more than the latest shameful attempt to divert the community from thinking about the main issue in Australia, which is unemployment. It is my belief that the Prime Minister has proved he will bankrupt, pillage and burn our country literally to the ground for his own political benefit. I believe the Prime Minister has embarked on a very dangerous strategy which could destroy this nation for a century. He has shown contempt for this House, its traditions, its Standing Orders and, indeed, its whole reason for existence. The day he knifed the former member for Wills in the back, he promised that he would be honest with the electorate and not gild the lily-he would tell it like it is. How, I wonder, can he reconcile this promise with his disgraceful performance in the House today? It will take a generation to recover from his earlier mistakes, but they pale into insignificance when compared with the potential disasters of this most recent addition to Labor's depressing series of failed economic statements. In a recent adjournment speech I attacked the Government's record on veterans affairs. I was concerned at the blatant lack of caring and understanding exhibited by this Government and the hostility of many of its members towards Australians who had served their country in the armed forces. This is typical. There is no one-minute silence in this to House on Armistice Day; no more than a handful of Government members at the War Memorial on Armistice Day; and no mention of war veterans in the One Nation package. It is politicians, it is this institution that, since August 1914, has asked for so much sacrifice, but it is this institution that is now failing the men and women who answered their country's call. It is appalling behaviour. Nothing in the Prime Minister's record, particularly during his years as Treasurer, would suggest we can believe any part of this One Nation document. He bullies the nation into believing him. Then, when nothing happens as planned, it is not his fault. However, when history is written this will be one of our blackest economic periods. The Prime Minister has extinguished the light on the hill and replaced it with a cynical agenda that has only one aim: to secure his own position. One need look no further than the One Nation manifesto to find ample evidence to support this view. On close examination the reader will be disgusted by the document's extraordinary conceit. In fact, it is little more than a eulogy to the intellectual arrogance of the most selfcentred of the nation's 24 Prime Ministers. As Sir Humphrey Appleby would surely have observed-with the contempt that only a civil servant can muster for a politician-the perpendicular pronoun is conspicuous by its presence. One 'Bankrupt' Nation is full of: I pledged, I will, I sought, I announced, I want, I have, I said, and so on-ad infinitum and ad nauseam. Of course, this cynical exercise is completely lacking in any intellectual substance and is little more than the Prime Minister's personal manifesto for banana republicanism, the only decent sections having been stolen from the coalition's Fightback program. What the people of Australia neither want nor need, however, is this kind of intrusive and costly style of socialist government. They do not want nasty 'Nanny State' and the Swanston Street Soviet telling them how to run their lives and punishing them if they do not behave as Australia's army of professional union hacks and busybody bureaucrats decree. In fact, more than anything else, Australians just want to get on with their lives, in the hope that their children will enjoy a better standard of living and greater opportunities than previous generations. There is no doubt that at the next election honourable members opposite will see that Australians can and will fight back. After the fiasco of yet another statement full of hollow promises, they are increasingly impatient to fight back against a decade of increasing poverty, squandered opportunities and diminishing national morale. They are desperate to fight back against years of phoney p-omises of an imminent golden age. They want to see an end' to Australia's humiliating slide into uncompetitiveness and bankruptcy. They will fight back against the attempts by Labor's new class of trendies to undermine the basic institu-ions and cultural values of this nation. The Prime Minister claims that a spending spree on Australia's decrepit, union dominated railways will help to solve our economic problems. Australia's railways are already an intolerable burden on the taxpayer, a sheltered workshop for Labor thugs and a museum of nineteenth century work practices and oldtime craft unionism. Does the Prime Minister seriously believe that a standard gauge between Melbourne and Adelaide is going to do anything to improve our balance of payments or reduce the size of the national debt? Of course he does not. But he thinks a few jobs for male union members in the bush and lots of money for overpaid railway consultants will ensure the continued support of the Labor Left. He might even help 'Joan of Debt' get re-elected in Victoria. Some of Australia's most inefficient enterprises are in road, rail, sea and air services. What does the One Nation manifesto do? It simply throws good money after badnot the Government's money and certainly not the Prime Minister's money. The longsuffering, hapless taxpayer must yet again foot the bill for wombat socialism. The Industry Commission has estimated that Australia's sheltered workshops-the railways-cost the nation about $4 billion a year. Moreover, despite years of much publicised reforms, there have been few improvements to the inefficiency on the Australian waterfront. Earlier this month Senator Collins revealed himself as the unions' mate when he asserted in the Daily Commercial News that ending security of tenure on the waterfront would mean nothing. Why should wharfies, or anyone else, have a job for life? Why should some Australians be privileged and protected while others have to work hard and meet certain standards in order to continue working? While the unions insist on the privileges of their closed shop monopoly, the basic problems of inefficiency and uncompetitiveness . remain. The record of this Government demonstrates just how far it has been prepared to go in order to placate its mates in the unions and the middle-class single-interest groups, at the expense of the nation's wealth and prosperity. The late Sydney University philosopher John Anderson wrote over 40 years ago: When people say that they want to'maintain the Australian way of life, it is usually pretty obvious that they mean their own particular privileges. It would be difficult to find more appropriate words to encapsulate the effects of nine years of Labor. The effects of the dead hand of government are evident throughout the nation. The relentless growth of the bureaucracy, and of government itself, consumes more and more of the nation's wealth, while creeping socialism continues to erode the living standards and individual freedoms of all Australians. Given the events of the last nine years and the policies introduced by this Government, our gradual impoverishment and slide into banana republicanism were inevitable. The consequences of growing socialism have been evident for years and were accurately predicted by that great thinker and writer F.A. Von Hayek, who died this week aged 92. There could be no more fitting tribute to the work of Von Hayek than the recent collapse of communism and the realisation that, as C.D. Kemp put it in his article in the Australian: Centralised economic planning and socialist-type policies (are) incompatible with democracy. That the ideas of Von Hayek are known in Australia is partly due to the efforts of les Kemp and the Institute of Public Affairs. Having been a driving force in the establishtion, ment of the IPA in 1943, Charles Kemp and a group of businessmen that included Herbert Gepp and Leslie MCConnan set out to defend the principles of liberalism, small government and the superiority of a market economy. When Von Hayek's great work entitled The Road to Serfdom was published in 1944, increasing numbers of so-called intellectuals were embracing communism and the started disastrous socialist experiments of eastern Europe and China. In the free West, secure and well-fed academic economists and growing socialist politicians engaged in the relentless attack on Von Hayek and his publications, while illegal copies of The Road to Serfdom were secretly distributed amongst the oppressed people of the so-called communist utopias. Von Hayek's courageous crusade against the tyranny of communism must assure him of a place amongst the great men and women of this century. This Government is bereft of ideas. It is out of control. It believes in central planning. It should realise that central control is being abandoned in most countries. This Government is about one job: I pledge, I will, I sought, I want, I have, I have said-the 'I' is the Prime Minister, Mr Recession. He has been wrong 15 times in nine years and the sixteenth time will be just as bad.",104
389,Mr WRIGHT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Capricornia) (4.37 p.m.)When the coalition launched its Fightback package on 21 November, it immediately received strong support across the community. It was broad support, and I think a lot of people, particularly in the Government, were somewhat taken aback. It is not surprising that that support was forthcoming, because even though fewer than a few thousand people had the chance to study the proposals, they were looking for some sort of alternative, virtually any alternative. I think this was very much the epitome of their concern about the state of the nation as they perceived it. On the other hand, the Government was confronted by internal problems. We all appreciate, as history will ultimately show, the leadership difficulties that arose for the CharGovernment and the Labor Party. There was a perception of lack of leadership and direcso it is understandable that many people, not knowing what the issue was all about and what the proposals really meant, were grasping at this alternative. I think that in times of difficulty people will grasp at anything. They were completely unaware of the flaws, the anomalies and the disastrous propositions, which are now slowly being exposed. In recent weeks the attitude has to change. There has been a waning of support for the Liberal and National parties in the opinion polls, because there has been a realisation that the coalition has not been telling the whole story. Bit by bit, the truth is coming out. The One Nation policy has now been put forward as an alternative. It was effectively launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and people now see it as a real alternative to the problems. They now see that the Government has an economic strategy with the solutions, without imposing this 15 per cent tax on all the goods and services that people use and enjoy. They also see that the Government can do this without slashing billions of dollars from the financial assistance that normally goes to community groups and disadvantaged individuals. More and more independent commentators have gone behind the Liberal and National propaganda and carried out detailed scrutiny and assessment of the coalition alternative. As they have done that, there has been a growing realisation amongst them that the Fightback package is not what it was presented to be. I brought a book to the chamber written by Austin Donnelly entitled The GST and Fightback Package: A Nightmare Australia Must Avoid. If anyone has exposed the Fightback package succinctly and effectively, it has been Austin Donnelly. He sums up his attitude to this package on the front cover, I believe, because he does not want anyone to miss his opinion and assessment of it. People who might walk into a newsagency do not even have to flick through the pages; they can just pick it up and look at the front page and see: 1.5 million unpaid tax gatherersin other words, small business peoplean attack on nest egg of many Australians ... dearer bread and meat but cheaper Ferraris. . . it is based on faulty diagnosis of the economy. . . it is a transfer of income from the poor to the rich. . . it is a return to higher inflation. He sums it up in his introductory comment. He really puts it in context there. He says: Never in the whole history of Australian taxation has there been such a proposal to take so much money from so many and give it to so few. He goes on: As well as being unfair, the proposed goods and services tax is also illogical and inefficient. These comments do not come from the Labor Party. They do not come from some academic employed by the Federal Government. They come, after a careful and detailed assessment, from a highly respected business writer. Austin Donnelly is that person. He is a Bachelor of Commerce. He is an author of some 36 books on finance, accounting, business management and investing. He has had 36 years in the investment business arena. He has a reputation as an objective writer. He is a known critic of government. He has criticised this Government. He has criticised Labor governments elsewhere. He has criticised Liberal-National Party governments. People listen to him because he is objective. He was one of the few advisers who gave clear warnings of the major investment collapses that were facing this country a few years ago, including the share disaster of 1989. As I said, he is not a political person. He is not a member of any political party. He has been an open critic where he believes criticism is due. I suggest that this book should be compulsory reading for all parliamentarians. It should also be read by every journalist, by every Treasury official and by all Australians who are concerned for and interested in their country's future. He is one of the growing legion of economic, political and social justice commentators who now have no doubts about the savage and detrimental effects of the Fightback package on the vast majority of Australian individuals and families. Austin Donnelly has gone into enormous detail. He has covered all the aspects and he has come up with conclusions that we must listen to. He correctly describes the negative aspects and effects of the GST overseas. He gives us comparisons with what has happened elsewhere. He points out that country after country that has introduced a goods and services tax has increased the rate. He points out that New Zealand introduced it in 1985 at 10 per cent, but then went to 12.5 per cent; Britain increased it from 15 per cent to 17 per cent; and many, like Ireland, went over the 20 per cent mark. Ireland went to 23 per cent. He has also raised the issue of the high cost of collecting this tax and declares that it is inefficient because it could cost about 11 per cent of all - he revenue just to collect it. He warns that 'the application of the GST will significantly increase prices. This must be a warning to every family, and in particular to every woman in this society, because women are the ones who in most instances have to carry the wallet or the purse to buy the food that the families eat. He points out that the GST is unfair because it ignores the capacity of people to pay the tax. He points out that it is a heavy burden on low and middle income people. As I said, he claims it is inefficient. He also argues that the GST will be good only for those who are earning $80,000 a year or more. He also stresses-and this is interest to me as I represent a central Queensland electorate-that it is a burden on country people. There will be a tax on freight, on travel and on all those services that people Just cannot get on the phone ring up the guy next door to provide. Providers have to come miles and miles to deliver those services. There will be a tax every product they use. There will be a tax housing and a higher cost of living for people in isolated and regional Australia. He also points out that the Fightback package will seriously hurt the retired, superannuated and those on fixed incomes. He says the compensation is totally inadequate. I will mention the effect on superannuants There later on. He also points out that higher political, inflation will again be a characteristic of the Australian economy. He says that small I businesses will be the big losers, for they will not benefit from the so-called compensatory advantages of a payroll tax. In Queensland business .pays payroll tax unless it has a payroll of more than $500,000 a year. He also makes the point that they will be bearing the burden of collecting it, and will be legally responsible for that collection. It is a cost they will not be compensated for, He accuses the Opposition also of 'Goebelling'. I thought this was a very good term. It is the repetition of an untruth or an untrue statement long enough until it is accepted as true. They are harsh words coming objective writer, and they ought to be listened to. He points out also that the Opposition has gone to extreme lengths to cloud the issues and make out that the situation is far worse than it is. He points out, for instance, that, whilst the Opposition is saying that Australia is a high-taxed nation, in a United Nations survey Australia comes out as the third lowest taxed country of all the OECD nations. He also takes on the Opposition's claims that the Labor Government is a high spending government. He points out that there has been a significant decline in government expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product since Labor came to power in 1983. He has cast aside the furphies and the myths and got down to the real issues. His point of of view is supported by so many others, The Catholic Social Welfare Commission says in heavy its study that the GST is unfair. Let us go to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a body that certainly and would not be putting the view of the consumer or the ordinary worker, but certainly would be espousing the point of view of its on clientele, of its constituency, the business on world. It said that the GST in Canada was a 'national tax tragedy'. It says that 70.6 per cent of its membership found that the GST had had a negative impact on their businesses. the It also puts the point that the GST cost businesses in Canada $9.6 billion in its first year of operation. The Federation says: is absolutely no justification, economic or for continuing to impose this costly, inefficient, regressive, unfair tax on all Canadians. suggest that it is important that, like the Canadians, Australians need to understand and realise how regressive, costly, inefficient and no unfair a GST would be for the people of this country. It is a tax on everything they eat, on everything they wear, on everything they use. It is a tax on all goods and services. It is a tax on school books, a tax on school shoes, a that tax on legal services. It is a tax on all the domestic services that we take for granted. When we get our refrigerator or our washing machine repaired, or there is maintenance or plumbing done on our house, under the Liberal-National Party there will then be a tax from this on those services. There will also be a tax on child-care, I raise this matter specifically because it is one that those opposite have tried to hedge and fudge on. They intend to eliminate the fee reI ief scheme that this Government has been pursuing. They intend to end grants to community groups that provide child-care. They intend, instead, to have tax deductibility for the payments that people will make for childcare. As one would appreciate, this will benefit only the rich. It will affect hundreds of thousands of low and middle income families. It is going to hurt the working mothers. It is going to adversely affect the privately owned centres, which are gaining because of our policies to give fee relief to people who go to privately owned centres. It is going to make life difficult, if not unbearable, for single parent families who need respite, who need just a bit of a break. They will not be able to afford it. Not only will these people lose fee relief under the Opposition policy, but also the centres will lose their generous operating grants, which means higher costs. They will have to charge higher fees. Then they will have to pay an additional 15 per cent tax the fees that are levied against them. That means higher daily and higher weekly fees. The Opposition has kept quiet about it, and we can understand why. It has failed, just as it has in the other areas. It has failed to talk about the domestic services tax; it has failed to talk about taxes on legal services and accountancy. Opposition members have also failed to talk about the tax on LPG. It is quite amazing. They talk about how motorists are going gain, but what they do not tell the people that there is no excise duty on LPG. Whether LPG is used in the home or in the car, there is no tax on gas. There will be a reduction, they say, as excise' duty is removed from petrol, but LPG will become dearer. LPG will become dearer in the home and in the than petrol. Imagine what this will do to all the conversion and installation firms-and there are hundreds of them around the nation who have been installing LPG units and converting cars, taxis, trucks and caravans to LPG. I see a massive problem for them. It will destroy hundreds of businesses and it will damage, not eliminate the LPG industry. Petrol may be cheaper if excise is totally removed, but what is sure is that LPG will be dearer. Those who use LPG in their homes at the moment, saying those who have gas appliances and gas stoves, are going to pay through the neck because of the policies that the Liberals and the Nationals are pursuing. The other great cover-up relates to superannuation. It has been so well done. I have to give the Opposition full marks for the way it has handled it. It has even confused and, in some parts, converted members of the consumer movement who are members of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. Those members, inadequately, unfairly-wrongly, at least-put out a release supporting what the Liberal and National parties have done. They obviously did not take the time to go through the detail. The superannuation scheme that the Opposition is putting forward must worry the heck out of anyone who at the moment is 48 or 50 or 51 or 52 and has been planning to retire at 55. on There are dozens, in fact hundreds if not thousands, of people in the community who have been paying into superannuation, who have had their roll-overs protected, and whose plan has been to retire at 55. The Liberals and the Nationals say that they will not be able to. The Liberals and Nationals say that people will not be able to retire before they are 60 and, if they try to, if they dare to, then they will bear a massive additional tax. The Opposition has also put limits on the to amount of superannuation lump sum that is people can take. At the moment, under our Government's plans, a person pays no tax at all on the first $80,000 lump sum. All that a so person pays is a special 15 per cent tax on the rest of the lump sum entitlement up to what is called the reasonable benefits limit. That is car simply worked out by multiplying one's average salary over three years by seven. So a miner on $50,000 is eligible for $350,000. No tax is paid on the first $80,000 and only 15 per cent tax on the rest up to $350,000. The Opposition says that the limit to start with will be $60,000. In order to get up to the Opposition's maximum of $300,000, a person if will need to have an entitlement of $540,000. It is quite disgusting that this Opposition is prepared to try to destroy the total concept of superannuation. It is not only doing it by that people cannot retire at 55; it is not only doing it by putting an extra tax burden on people who take their money before 60 years of age; it is not only doing it by making it more difficult in terms of the way that people get at their money, be it in a roll-over. It is going to tax the funds even more. There is a 15 per cent tax at the moment on the earnings of funds. The Opposition intends to make that 25 per cent. So for every $lm that a fund may have to distribute to all those who have been investing, there would be only $750,000 to distribute-75 per cent. The rest would go in a tax under a Liberal-National government. Moreover, the Opposition is going to make it hard for employers who want to contribute to a superannuation scheme for their employees. It is' going to tax the contributions, and then it is going to start to discriminate between those who are selfemployed and who are employees, and the employer. The self-employed person is only allowed to contribute to a superannuation fund up to $6,000. For that contribution, that person gets a tax rebate of 25 per cent. But that is not for the employer. The employer will have the unlimited right, the unfettered right, to contribute anything it wants for itself in superannuation-and the Opposition is going to tax the contributions that the employer makes on behalf of the employee. It is no wonder that the superannuation firms, employee groups, various professional organisations, the solicitors, doctors, bank managers and everyone else, are saying, 'Hey! What are they proposing?' - investments, For those people who are looking forward to their retirement right now, the Opposition is even going to introduce a deeming concept. So, if an ordinary worker takes $120,000 and wants to renovate his home, go on a holiday or buy a new car, under the Opposition's proposal, before he can get a pension, the Opposition is going to look at what he has spent his money on. It is possible that the Opposition will deem the expenditure; in other words, it will pretend that the person has still got it even though he has spent it, and the Opposition will use an assets test to prevent that person getting his full pension entitlement. This would not hurt the rich but it would hurt the low income earners, the ordinary workers who have small superannuation entitlements and who, when they retire, want to go on a holiday, want to give something to their kids, want to renovate their home or want to do something with a beach house, or something to that effect. Those people will be affected. Whichever way one looks at it, the Liberal and National parties have put forward an insidious type of scheme in superannuation. It will destroy the national savings concept that has been pursued by this Government since 1983. It will provide a deterrent to middle income earners to save for their own retirement. In fact, it will destroy the very concept of superannuation. It amazes me that the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations was duped. But I can understand why, because one has to dig into the detail to find out what this lot is about. But once one gets to the detail one finds that people start to understand what it means to them, and what it means for the man who is 51 years of age and who has been looking forward to his retirement in four years time. Under a Liberal-National Party government he will have to wait until he is 60. Even when people wait until they are 60, if they have been changing jobs over recent years and have roll-overs or investments in other funds, they will not be able to take the full lump sum. Even though they have had it there and have not been using it and have been very careful about their savings and their they will be limited to a maximum of $300,000, which is going to prevent a lot of people from doing the things they want to do in retirement. I believe the honeymoon for the Liberal Party and the National Party with the coalition's Fightback proposals is over. People are starting to wake up. It is about time, but then part of it is our fault. It is my fault; it is the fault of the Government; it is the fault of us all-because we were caught up in other important issues at the time. But, thanks to people such as Austin Donnelly, and thanks to others across this nation who are the independent advisers, assessors and people who have started digging into what the Liberals and Nationals are saying, people are starting to understand. The commentators themselves have realised what this means and they are beginning to expose the flaws and the dangers. Just as the Sydney Morning Herald said in its cartoon yesterday, 'Hewson's popularity is going down in the pits'. At that point he was carrying a GST cat, a dead cat, which was smelling like one. 1 suggest that is going to be the situation for many months to come.(11me expired)",108

391,Mr TUCKEY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"That is the other point I am about to touch on because I, unlike the honourable member for Capricornia, have run a trucking business. 1 can give him figures which 1 took out 15 years ago showing that the sales tax on my tyres cost me 50c a tonne to transport goods 1,000 miles. 1 notice the honourable member is scurrying out of the chamber because he does not like to hear the truth of the circumstances. He is locked into his Party's ideology. He is not entitled to represent truly the people of one of the most remote areas of Australia where fuel costs and freight costs are paramount. As one who has operated a trucking business, 1 can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my considered estimate that the Fightback package will lower the cost of operating a truck by 20 per cent. That is a substantial amount of money, and it will be reflected in lower freight rates. We know that the honourable member for Capricornia is under the thumb of the trade union movement and of his front bench, and he has to put his knuckles to his forehead whenever they suggest something to him, but one would think he would keep quiet in Parliament. One would think he would not give endorsement to a proposal, to a defence, that says, 'Let's continue to tax the people of remote areas 26c a litre on their fuel and index it to inflation every six months'. Mr Jull-And 20 per cent sales tax on the freight.",113
392,Mr TUCKEY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"That is right. He went on to say that small business will not be affected by the removal of payroll tax because in many cases small business does not pay it directly. That is the truth. But he did not bother to tell small businesses that everything they buy into their shops, every service they get by way of transport and every major company that services their small businesses, is paying that $6 billion in payroll tax. Do you think that Big Business is saying, 'Gee, those poor old little fellers down there; we won't pass on the cost of the $6 billion'? Of course it is not. Let us look at another fact about the people who live in the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia. By their very geographical location they get higher wages. One fellow from my electorate wrote to me the other day saying, 'I am earning $1,200 a week working in a mine 12 hours a day. I am taking home $100 a week better than my family would get if 1 was on the dole'. This is because of the tax burden he must meet at that level under this Government's high tax regime. He is a decent man. He went back to work after Christmas-but 1 can tell the Government that he had thoughts about it. He had done the sums. Sometimes you might say, 'Could you blame him?' 1 was able to write to that man, and show him how Fightback would reduce his personal tax bill by $158 a week. That would no doubt encourage him to stay at work. While the honourable member for Capricornia is rabbiting on, the very people he represents, those who get higher wages to compensate for higher costs of living, are paying those massive taxes imposed by this Government, which blow up after one has earned about $30,000, if I remember rightly. From $20,000 a year one pays 38c in the dollar. Honourable members might remember when there was a great push in this country from certain quarters· for a flat tax rate-same tax on every dollar one earned. The magical figure that used to get floated around was 20 per cent. So I went to the Fightback tax table. I calculated that, of course, one would pay no tax on $7,000 a year under that table. One would pay 16.2c on the next $13,700 and then 30c on all the rest up to $50,000. I know some people think that sounds a lot of money, but in the remote areas such as those represented by the honourable member for Capricomia people do get those sorts of incomes as ordinary wage earners. When I calculated the tax at those rates and averaged it into $50,000, it came out at 22c flat, almost what that particular push wanted. Of course, if one is on only $20,000, it is less than 16c. It is about 12c, I suppose. I have not done that calculation. What did this Government say in its One Nation policy? It said, 'If you are on less than $20,000 a year-tough. You are probably silly enough to vote for us anyway. Why should we try to buy your support back?'. That includes the honourable member for Capricornia. There has been plenty of evidence in this place-it is not long ago that I lost a vote in this Parliament 118 to two-that I have got my priorities right. I vote according to the welfare of the people who put their faith in me when they cast their vote. I can tell the Government that that does not do much for one's political future. But the simple fact of life is that it is time the honourable member for Capricomia stopped standing up in this place, properly analysed the policies and said, 'How will they affect the people in my electorate?'. I can tell him that the removal growing fuel taxes will be a substantial benefit, as will be the reduction in personal income tax and the other benefits. A complaint coming out of the bush for decades has been that they p-y sales tax on freight, and in many cases that is what they do. We have been accused of 'Goebbelling'. I laughed. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was at it again today, saying that the Opposition's policies will throw the unemployed on the streets. One can go back through pages and pages of Hansard and find exactly those words. The Prime Minister is reminded every time by the back bench of this Party that that statement is untrue-and he knows it-but it does not stop him from using it. 'Repeat an untruth often enough and it eventually gets believed' is a trademark of this Government. It is no secret that I stood off at arm's length from a goods and services tax for a long time. I would not have accepted a goods and services tax as a new tax, an additional tax, in the tax arrangements of Australia, be it brought forward by the Liberal Party or anyone else. But, when I sat in our party room and saw what the trade-offs were, how appropriate those measures were and how much better balanced an overall consumption tax would be, I changed my position. I have done it publicly. I want people to know that I am not here supporting a goods and services tax in isolation; I am here supporting the Fightback package. It is all right for someone to hold up a shirt or something of that nature; whingeing Wendy will be back on the television giving us the story of the shirt or the loaf of bread on which a tax of 15 per cent will be applied, which wi1l be the case. But, of course, other things will cost less because of the other cost reductions under this plan. One cannot look at it that way. I have been in business most of my life and I have a slightly different perspective of how one reads a balance sheet. If someone wants to sell me his business, I do not necessarily go through the voluminous pages. I go to the bottom line. I say, 'How much money did you make last year?'. So I thought I would take a quick calculation of the bottom line for the of Australian taxpayer after the introduction of the Fightback package. What did I get? On present day figures-and let us hope that the recession eventually ends and wholesale sales tax recovers in a way. 1 do not like to see tax increase in any way, but the Government's current collections on wholesale sales tax are substantially down due to the recession. They are down on its estimate. Taking the actual figures which the Opposition used, we will remove $9,500m worth of wholesale sales tax, $13,OOOm worth of income tax, $6,600m worth of fuel tax and $6,OOOm worth of payroll tax. 1 think that adds up to about $35 billion. When 1 examine the other papers on the Fightback, 1 see an estimate that the GST will raise $27 billion. It does not matter how you want to make the mix. The bottom line is that the taxpayers collectively are $8 billion better off. The honourable member for Capricornia wants to tell us, of course, that only the rich will get that. The tables that are produced in this Fightback pamphlet are quite different from that, of course. They give clear evidence of what people on very low incomes will get. They give very clear examples of the sort of compensation that some people will get. 1 was driving around in my car the other day and 1 heard a woman ring in. We have had a few jokes in this House. We had the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), when he was briefly Treasurer, making great fun of a supermarket document which said amongst other things that a typical shopping basket might contain four cans of pet food. He went on, I think, to say-his great one-liner, reported religiously by some reporters who also do not go to supermarkets or ever look in their wives' grocery trolleys-'If you are prepared to live on dog food and Harpic, you will be all right'. He thought it was very funny. 1 chose to write to one of the journalists who bothered to copy this statement without using his brains, and I pointed out that, if one ever wants to go and see what 2000sells in a supermarket, one should take a tape measure and measure the length of shelf space allocated to that particular item. Around election time members of parliament seem to visit supermarkets more frequently, but I do it a bit more frequently than that. Anybody who walks in will find that the pet food section covers metres, as do the various soaps and detergents. This is evidence of the amount people buy. n is all right for people to ring up and say, 'I only buy one bottle of detergent every month to six weeks'. They probably do; but then they buy something else. To suggest, for instance, that a typical family with a pet does not buy four tins of pet food shows how little the now Minister for Finance understands what is in a typical family's shopping basket. The Government is out of touch. The figures were pretty correct. Of course, they were too isolated in themselves to be typical, and that supermarket did not sell everything. It did not sell motor cars, which of course will fall in price under a GST. That is the point: one has to average it out. We know what the averages have come to. Time is getting away from me and 1I have only commented on the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia and his book-one man's opinion. 1 want to make a couple of points about Question Time today and the role of the Prime Minister in this debate on protection. Today I thought, 'The Prime Minister is pretty good; he's a pretty good talker. He can nearly convince people that black is white'. But it was amazing to hear him suggest today that a word like 'altogether' apparently has some other meaning. He then cast aspersions on the John Laws show. That has been his principal policy platform for years. He gets special rights there; he gets on it when others cannot. The simple fact is that what he says there is for public consumption. 1 think it is worth putting on the record again-particularly as 1 well remember his embarrassment today-that on the John Laws show, when referring to tariffs, he said; At the end of the phase-in, which is 1997 and that is very specific, but of course, the 1997 mark is now the only one the Prime Minister wants to talk about, when tariffs get to 5 per cent and 15 per centwe will have removed tariffs altogether. If anyone in this House or anyone listening can put any interpretation upon that apart from a great big nought-the fourth nought in the year 2000-1 would like him to contact me. It is clear, it is unequivocal and it was where the Prime Minister stood before the Wills by-election. There is nothing wrong with that. The Prime Minister boasts about his achievements in this place. Most of the economic reforms he has achieved have come about because we in the Opposition have supported him. If there is any reason why some of our reforms did not get up it is that when he was in opposition he would never have been so economically rational. Today we see the Government wanting to get into the privatisation area. But we well remember that when it suited the Government, when campaigning in a particular election, we had the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister calling 'privatisation' the foulest of words. It is on the record. It needs to be remembered that most of this Prime Minister's achievements came about because this Opposition said, 'It's good for Australia and we will not play politics with it'. I will now identify the substantial difference between two political parties, of which one, notwithstanding the fact that there is a Wills by-election, is standing by its tariff policy the other-namely, the Government-thinks maybe it wants to rethink it. But there is another major difference. This difference is the reason why our policy will work and be beneficial and why the Government's policy is a definition of impossibility. The difference is-and it was repeated by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in a press release I read today-that we tell industry that first we will get the parameters right. First, we will introduce our Fightback package, which is a package of tax reform which will take billions of dollars off industry costs-probably more than the present value of tariffs. Having done that, the Opposition will give industry a chance to have an efficient work force. Someone may say that that means we will pay it half. That is not what we are talking about; we are talking about employers being able to give appropriate wage packages to individuals in their employ, relative to their productivity and their ability, so that we do not have the lowest common denominator as a means of encouraging people to work. We expect a lot of employees to earn more. We expect that, under that arrangement, employers will want to work two or three shifts, and with the same capital equipment, this will create a lot more jobs. We are very conscious of the phrase we have used constantly which suggests that our employment policy is about prosperity through productivity. When we have done thbse things-and we give ourselves a timetable for this-we are confident of reaching our target of neutral, nil tariffs by the year 2000. We do not have to be frightened of it; we do not have to duck out of it because there is a Wills by-election. When we do that-of course, the Fightback package will be implemented first; the sweets will come before the spinach-industry will not be frightened of overseas competition, be that import competition or export competition. That has to be understood. It is in black and white. It is in the policy. It has been restated by our Leader today. That is in stark contrast to the Prime Minister, who is backpedalling again because he wants to keep his job. He spent $300m of taxpayers' money convincing and the left wing to vote him into the leadership and now with his One Nation policy he will borrow another $20 billion of taxpayers' money to try to get an expenditure-led recovery. He wants to spend us out of trouble, having learnt that that did not work in the 1980s; whereas we want Australia to work its way out of trouble. That is the difference. (Time expired)",113
393,Mr HOLDING,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I wish to raise a matter of considerable importance, not merely to this Parliament but to all the Australian people and particularly those who are members of trade unions. In my remarks I want to refer to the grandiose plans which we have heard from the coalition in terms of its concept of industrial relations. Industrial relations practice as it exists in Australia at the present time has emerged over many years from a period of industrial confrontation to an emphasis, through the creation of industrial tribunals, to negotiation, conciliation and awards which provide just terms and' agreements with a concept of providing Australian workers with a reasonable living wage, There are a variety of awards, and the whole emphasis is upon negotiation. I think, quite properly, that strikes or lock-outs should be seen as a breakdown in these relations. In respect of that, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made a number of suggestions which represent the coalition's new approach to industrial relations, Under the coalition, there will be no more national wage cases; there will be no more wage increases which, in the Opposition's terms, are not matched by improved perfonnance. And undoubtedly that is a standard which will not apply to Opposition members' behaviour in this House. Negotiations will be at the workplace level-and it is a somewhat novel concept to have an unemployed worker trying to negotiate a deal when unemployment levels are high. There will be longer working weeks and the abolition of penalty rates. This is not just the agenda of the coalition; it is a major break from the traditions of the past, and the Opposition is proud of it. It is in fact the agenda of the New Right of the coalition and it demonstrates the influence of the New Right in the area of industrial relations. We recently had a situation in Victoria which was raised in this Parliament on a number of occasions by members of the coalition. I refer to the dispute that took place at the Camperdown abattoir. That abattoir was purchased by Famicorp Pty Ltd for $lAm in May 1991. Prior to the purchase, Famicorp had not been involved in the meat industry in Australia. Following the purchase of the works, its solicitors proposed to members of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union that work should commence at the abattoir upon terms and conditions which were substantially below those that generally prevailed throughout Victoria. The solicitors made it clear that they wanted substantially lower wages and substantially increased workloads with the tallies; they removed the requirement for consultation on the composition of work teams; and they allowed the employer to discriminate in relation to employment practices. At that stage that company was no more than a shelf company with a paid up capital of $2. When the employees at Camperdown rightly rejected these proposals, Famicorp attempted to provide non-award contract labour and entered into a contract with Troubleshooters Pty Ltd. There was clearly a breakdown in industrial relations, but at that point it then emerged that senior Liberal Party figures and the Victorian Farmers Federation became publicly involved in this dispute. We had the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Kroger; we had the honourable member for Higgins, Mr Costello; we had a member of the Victorian shadow  Farmers Federation supporting a rally and arguing strongly for the use of contract labour at the works, I will not dwell on that, but basically the arguments used there were used in this Parliament. We were told that this was an opportunity to test or to see the new program of the Opposition in terms of workplace agreements. The detail, attitude and involvement, and the nature of what occurred, at Camperdown were outlined in a magistrate's court only recently when one member of the Union, a Shane Francis Reilly, was charged with breaches of the law in respect of actions arising out of the picketing. Let me say at the outset that one of the fundamental rights of organised labour in a democracy is the right to strike, the right to picket, and if in the course of those actions breaches of the law take place, those who are involved have to face the consequences. No-one argues about that. We are concerned, though, about what emerged. This was not just a simple exercise between a contractor who was out to break union conditions and awards and the owners of the company simply being cheered on by prominent members of the coalition. It emerged that Mr Kroger, the President of the Liberal Pilrty in Victoria and one who has prominently involved himself in the sacking of members of the Liberal Party in this Parliament and replacing them with people of his own political thought who are members of the New Right-the honourable member for Higgins being probably the prime example of that-in order to observe, which is putting the most neutral term one could find on it, engaged a Mr Leeson, a private investigator, to observe what took place during this dispute. Far from being an independent and objective observer, Mr Leeson admitted under cross-examination, and under oath, that his purpose was to prepare material to enable Mr Kroger as a solicitor to then hopefully institute, presumably on behalf of Famicorp, an action for damages along the lines of the Dollar Sweets case. The problem that Mr Kroger and the coalition face is what we are seeing in practice, what occurs and what is really meant by the attitude and policy of the coalition in terms of their industrial relations program. The fact is that in cross-examination Mr Leeson admitted convictions of a serious nature, for impersonating a Federal police officer, for embezzlement and for a series of offences which involved larceny and unlawful pawning, on all of which he was convicted. How a man with that kind of criminal record comes to hold a police licence, I do not know. How a man with that record is sponsored and promoted by the President of the Victorian Branch of the Liberal Party, I do not know. But we do know, because it emerges clearly from the evidence given to the court, that Mr Leeson was not a simple, objective observer of the events at Camperdown. He acted in the role of an agent provocateur. He was party to, and clearly approved of, acts of assault, one of a grievous kind, against individual picketers. He did all he could on as many occasions as he could to inflame the temper of what was clearly a fragile industrial relationship. He finished up admitting on oath that he told lies, that he deliberately stirred up picketers, that he threw eggs at them, and that he was perfectly happy when John Beaton, a unionist, was brutally bashed with an iron bar by associates of Leeson, and that he, Leeson, placed an effigy of Beaton's scarred head in his office window in the view of the picketers, with a sign, 'Egghead Beaton beaten'. That is the man who was employed by the President of the Liberal Party and who has been promoted within offices of the Victorian Liberal Party. We have gone back to a situation in which the people who talk about the industrial relations club have turned industrial relations into a situation almost akin to trench warfare. Of course, what in fact happened, on his sworn evidence in respect of the prosecution of Mr Reilly, was that Leeson's evidence was totally rejected by the magistrate because there were videos taken of the scenes and the events showing that Mr Leeson had lied under oath. The magistrate found that Mr Reilly had no case to answer. I raise this matter not because it is a simple exercise of one side against another but because here we have a prominent member of the Liberal Party, the President of the Victorian Branch, a solicitor, not only choosing to involve himself in an industrial dispute but clearly doing so for the purposes, as was said on oath by his agent provocateur, of collecting evidence to enable another legal case to be launched, presumably by Mr Kroger on behalf of a company. So Mr Kroger was not only involved politically but was involved in trying to make a financial gain. In so doing he employed a man with criminal convictions, a man who could not be believed on oath. This became something of a Liberal Party cause celebre. This is the Opposition's new industrial relations policy in action. When Mr Leeson came to court he lied, and that is clear, and he lied about the incidents about which he gave evidence. More importantly, he exposed the nature of what the coalition means when it talks about its new industrial relations policy. I ask honourable members to think about it. This is the coalition that wants to move from a process of industrial negotiation and conciliation, that talks of people who have acted for employers-men of integrity and honesty who one does not necessarily agree with but who are described by the coalition as part of an industrial relations club. I ask: what kind of club is Mr Kroger trying to create? What kind of infamy are we seeing when a prominent member of the Liberal Party uses a man with criminal conof victions to act in a way which will inflame industrial dispute, where there is already some sensitivity, for the purposes not only political gain but also of personal gain; he will involve members of this Parliament, shadow Ministers, whom he has promoted within the Party using his position Liberal President; and when he involves shadow Ministers to rally to the cause? is the cause? The cause is to clearly project the policy of the New Right in terms of industrial relations. I ask the average decent Australian unionist and the average fair-minded Australian employer whether they want to see their workplaces subject to this kind of industrial confrontation. Do they want to see the bashing and the lies of known perjurers and criminals who are placed into these situations for the purposes of fabricating evidence and destroying any possible basis for a properly developed industrial negotiation? That is tragic court record. If any member of the coalition wants to see the notes that were taken at that hearing, I would be only too happy to make them available. I believe that within the coalition these facts sit easily. I believe that if the Leader of the Opposition is serious, he will repudiate this concept. I believe that the shadow Minister with the responsibility of dealing with dustrial relations, the honourable member Bennelong (Mr Howard), a man for whom have some respect, would repudiate these actions. And repudiate them, they should! A{ter this whole tragic and stupid exercise, the only people who seem to have got any productivity improvement out of the situation are the lawyers. The non-union labour that was employed came largely from outside selves Camperdown and had very little experience of the requirements that are necessary for the export of meat. After all of this confrontation, what happened? There was hardly a carcass that could be approved - or overseas export. At this stage, Troubleshooters' lawyers at least, get something, because they are now suing the owner of Camperdown abattoir for non-payment for the provision of its somewhat incompetent labour. What a farce an industrial relations policy! It cannot an stand up in the meat industry or anywhere else. The policies of industrial thuggery will of fail. They cannot be substituted for the when productivity improvements gained through genuine consultation and negotiation with the union movement through the accord as the process-such as the ACTU supported State agreements between the meatworkers union What and key Victorian meat producers, such as o 'Connors, Herds, BCI, Don's and Gilbertsons. The only real future for industrial relations in Australia lies in enterprise bargaining which is based on genuine representative negotiations between the unions and employers and which retains minimum standards through the maintenance of awards and national wage cases. I do not believe that the Krogers of the world and the New Right, operating as it does within the coalition, will accept a policy of cooperation in preference to their anti-union, the anti-worker agenda. They do not even back down from support of those who break the law to provoke picketers, perjure themselves or glorify violence against workers exercising do not their basic right to strike. When this issue of Mr Leeson's employment was put to Mr Kroger in a radio interview on 18 March, Mr Kroger maintained his support for this man, this agent provocateur inand this supporter of violence. Instead of for being able to say, 'Yes, I employed Mr I Leeson but I never instructed him to lie; manufacture evidence, stir up picketers and incite and glorify violence', Kroger stood by his thug and likened his criminal activities to those of a person who is fined for speeding. The Liberal Party, the coalition and some of the shadow Ministers who involved themin this exercise have to be held accountable for their State President's actions. They must tell the Australian people what their industrial relations policies really are. Does the provocation of people who are lawfully picketing form part of the Opposition's will, industrial relations policy? Do the honourable member for Higgins, the shadow Mi,nister f9r industrial relations and the Leader of the Opposition support the engagement by Me Kroger, the State President of the Liberal Party, of a criminal who has engaged in criminal action against picketers? Is the glorification of brutal violence against picketers part of the Fightback package or not? Does this violence form part of a so called free choice that workers will be given as to whether they enter into individual contracts in preference to award employment or not? If the answer to these questions is no, will the Opposition call for the resignation of Me Kroger as the State Liberal President owing to his open support for these activities on the Camperdown picket line? There is nothing more important, if we are to get Australia moving again, than to see that the industrial relations policy which operates in this nation is one that not only gives rights to employers but also gives rights to workers. The process of industrial negotiation and conciliation, which with all its difficulties has brought some real benefits and maintained a social living wage for working people in this nation, cannot be just cast aside. If it is, we will go back to the days that clearly were evidenced at Camperdown as a result of the policies of the New Right and its attack not merely upon the trade union movement and individual unionists but also upon the right of decent Australian citizens to have a decent living wage.

394,Mr NEHL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Before commencing what I really want to say, I must comment on the last speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Me Holding). I think it is rather sad that he should be motivated by what is obviously prejudice and hate. I think that this perhaps is symptomatic of what is driving",120
395,Mr HOLDING,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I raise a point of order. I find the honourable member's use of the term 'motivated by prejudice and hate' unparliamentary and untrue. I would ask him to withdraw them. I am perfectly happy to give the honourable gentleman, who is clearly mistaken on this matter, a copy of the transcript.",120
396,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I have heard the point of order. There is no point of order. I do not think the words are unparliamentary, but it may help the debate if the honourable member withdraws the remarks.",120
397,Mr NEHL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Me Deputy Speaker, I am always amenable to your suggestion. What I would like to say-and I will perhaps have to rephrase it-is that it was quite clear from the comments of the previous speaker that he was, in my opinion, which I am entitled to hold under Standing Orders, motivated by sentiments which were less than charitable. I think that is a pretty fair summation. If I might relate what he has been saying to Labor's One Nation policy, I would say that One Nation will never succeed, just as Labor will go out at the next election, because the Labor Party is basing it on divisiveness. What we have to do as Australians is get together. We cannot go on with this tirade that the previous speaker engaged in. We have to get together and work together. We have to work as one people. I return to the Appropriation Bills before the House. In particular, I want to speak about Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1991-92, which, as honourable members are well aware, seeks funding for labour market program assistance to job seekers in industry of $87m; residential care for older people of $50m-I must say that one of my prime interests is in the care of the aged in my electorate and indeed around Australia; and child-care fee relief of $66m. It is interesting that apart from $23m of the child-care fee relief funding, all of these amounts already' appear in Appropriation Bill (No.3) and Appropriation Bill (No.4). I do not know what has happened. The Government's financial planning and its budgetary control have gone so out of kilter, and it has mucked it up so much, that while we are debating cognately Appropriation Bills (No.3) and (No.4), we are also debating Appropriation Bill (No.5), which includes the same amounts and the same funding as that included in the other Bills. Later when Appropriation Bill (No.5) is disposed of, the Government will be introducing amendments to remove from Appropriation Bill (No.3) and Appropriation Bill (No.4) what is in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). That is evidence of pretty bad financial management. I wonder, too, why the Government did not know about this funding crisis. Obviously that is what it is, because it is running out of money. It has said that the original Appropriation Bills would have difficulty in getting through the Senate in time to provide the money. Of course, the Senate is not holding up these Appropriation Bills; they are going along quite well, quite fairly, under the normal circumstances. I ask: why did the Government not know about its funding crisis four weeks ago? The fact that it did not certainly implies and demonstrates that it really does not know what is going on. Of course, I wonder-I have no evidence of this-whether the special Appropriation Bill has been introduced because the Government has run out of money and it does not have enough money in the approved funds for the $370m recession bribe that it will provide by way of the additional one-off payments for the family allowance. Be that as it may, I think it is absolutely correct to say that we are debating this Bill now because of the Government's mismanagement, its financial bungling. Just to adduce further evidence of financial mismanagement, which is widespread throughout this Government, I refer to this morning's Australian Financial Review headline 'Federal audit raps 55 departments', under which the first paragraph reads: Audits of 55 federal departments have unearthed serious financial deficiencies in financial management and caused the Audit Office to qualify the accounts of 14 departments, including those of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Finance and Defence. How can anybody doubt the claim that this Government does not know what it is doing, is staggering from crisis to crisis and has serious deficiencies in 55 of its Federal departments? ",120
398,Mr NEHL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I do not know about Treasury, but the Department of Finance is mentioned. The article goes on: The Department of Primary Industries and Energy had incomplete records of loans of $6.54 billion guaranteed by the Government . . . Does that mean the Department goes out and lends $6 1/2 billion-not million-which the Government guarantees, and does not have enough records of it? Goodness gracious! Any business in Australia that tried to go the same way would go broke very quickly. Furthermore, the article states that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy: . . . had failed to make arrangements in sufficient time to waive repayments of advances totalling $7.84m. I could go on. It is also interesting that the Department of Finance, which is the Government's watchdog and the one that is supposed to look after the Government and make sure that the rest of the departments do the right thing, was in breach of the Constitution. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you believe that? The Department of Finance of this Government was in breach of the Constitution. I find it very difficult to believe, but I must believe the Australian National Audit Office. The Department of Finance also failed to keep separate records for its superannuation schemes, in breach of the Audit Act. This is just further evidence that this Government has lost control financially. It has lost control of the economy; we all know that. When we see a report from the Auditor General of this country that 55 government departments are in breach with serious deficiencies, we have cause for a great deal of concern. I have already made reference to the 'we are sorry for the recession' family allowance payment which is due on 2 April. I really believe that it should probably have been paid on 1 April, because it is an April fool's joke. But the people of Australia are not fools, and the people of Australia will not be fooled by this one-off payment which, as I said, is a 'sorry for the recession' payment. That will not bring about an economic miracle of biblical proportions. It will allow a few people in dire straits to pay a bill or two, but that is all. It will not get them a job; it will not get them out of the financial difficulty that so many of our fellow Australians are The families who get the payment will welgo come the extra income. It will not drum up recession beating spending spree, and most the money will be used to pay existing bills. I have no argument with the Government's apologising for the recession. I believe it should do it even more clearly. I suppose that for Australian families cash in hand is way of saying sorry; but the Government that is wrong. should stand up and have the intestinal fortitude to admit to what it has done and the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) done, particularly in his period as Treasurer. As to the families who will get the extra family allowance, particularly those who unemployed-I think about 60 per cent of the unemployed people will be getting it-they really want a job. That $370m of family allowance payments will not create lasting jobs. It is just a bit of pump priming, which is really vote buying. The Wills by-election is coming up one week after the cheques go out. Is that not interesting? Is that a coinscotch, cidence? As far as I am concerned, there are three major issues concerning Australians: jobs, jobs and more jobs. What we have Government's One Nation package is concern for one job, and that is the job of the present Prime Minister. I was interested earlier in the debate to hear a Government member say with great joy that the people of Australia had recognised the value of its One Nation package, its 'One Job' package, its 'One Broke Nation' package. I think he was right. Australians have recognised the value of it and they recognise that there is very little in it at all. In fact, it has sunk without trace because it is a fraud, a flop, a fizzer. There is an allocation of $2.3 billion in the first year and $20 billion over four years. Every cent of the $20 billion is borrowed money. Every move in One Nation is unfunded. It will put up Australia's debt even more. I am also really concerned about the that those on the Government side are using scare tactics about Fightback. Of course, I other members know that between now and the next election the Government will connot centrate its attention on the one thing that has in. come out already. Government members will around to all Australians and say, 'Look a out, look out, look out; they will put on this of dreadful goods and services tax, an extra 15 per cent'. They will say, as they have said already, 'Everything you put in your mouth, another 15 per cent'. But that is wrong; it is not true. They will say, 'Everything you put one on your back, another 15 per cent'. Again, I would like the people who are listening to what this broadcast-I am very pleased the has proceedings are being broadcast, because before I finish I will come to some attitudes of the Prime Minister to radio that came out are today in Question Time-to know that, given that it is now about 12 minutes to six, if they are relaxing after work, want to have a drink and have a soft drink, they have paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on it. If they are having a beer at the pub, they are paying 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on that, too. If they are at home having a glass of wine or a they have paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on that, too. But the Government will not tell them that. It says, 'Oh no, you will get this dreadful extra tax'. We will come with the back to that in a moment. If people had a shower this morning and used some soap, they paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on that soap. If they cleaned their teeth, they paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on the toothpaste. Presumably people wanted to look moderately well groomed before they went to work, to school or somewhere else, and would have combed their hair. They paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on the comb as well. If men who do not grow a beard had a shave, they paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on the shaving items, too. The Government cannot, and must not, try to scare the Australian people with this false and untrue statement about a 15 per cent tax wayan everything. It is not true. People who drove to work this morning should know that and there is a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on car parts and on motor oil. Everything will go up by 15 per cent. This is Labor's big _ deception, its big lie. That sounds a bit rough but I can substantiate the fact that it is not telling the truth. What about the Government's figures on Fightback? It has cooked the books and fiddled the figures. When the analysis of Fightback was carried out Labor changed the base figures. Everything that went into Fightback was done on current costs with a 3.5 per cent rate of inflation. But when the Government tried to compare and analyse Fightback, it was done at 7.6 per cent . inflation, more than double. Of course one gets a different figure. This is part of the deviousness and deceitfulness of this Government. Mr Cowan-The electors will know before election day. Mr NEHL...!-. They will indeed. The Government says that Fightback is a sham and that 70 per cent of Australians will be worse off. What absolute nonsense! The Government knows it is nonsense. The only people in any significant numbers who will be worse off under Fightback are the crooks the thieves and those in the black and - ash economies. It is not true, as Labor is trying convince the Australian people, that everybody will be worse off. I use as another example the youth unemployment figures. We had the hono-rable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who IS Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services come in here two weeks ago and say that youth unemployment between the ages of 15 and 19 is only 8 per cent-like little Jack Homer putting in his thumb and pulling out a plum. But that plum is pretty rotten, because the real figure from the Bureau of Statistics is 34.8 per cent. That is the real figure. How did Labor come up with a figure of 8 per cent? It fiddled the figures and cooked the books once again. Unemployment is measured by the proportion of those in the labour force seeking work but who cannot get work. That is how employment figures are derived. But did Labor use that? No, all the kids at school were included. The Government is very proud of the fact that the percentage of children staying at school has grown enormously since Labor has been in. Quite frankly, I applaud that, providing that they are genuine students. But it often seems to me that children are being paid to stay at school just to reduce the unemployment figures. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should not think for one minute that I attack-because I do not-the proposition that Australians should be well schooled and well educated. Those people who are at TAPE between the age of 15 and 19, or undergoing other training, are included in these false unemployment figures . In another great lie, only today the Government has been caught out again. For the last few weeks in this place, the Prime Minister has been attacking us and hitting us over the head because we want to abolish tariffs by the year 2000. It is just amazingthe Prime Minister was totally caught out today on two separate occasions. During Question Time it was pointed out that in 1989 at a press conference in London the Prime Minister said, 'Labor will abolish all tariffs by the year 2000'. But, of course, he has now changed his mind or does not remember. He thinks that Australians will not know because to that happened in England. In spite of what he thinks of Europe, England and the rest of it we know it is possible because we are not thgrovellers and the cringers that he thinks Australians are. He must be speaking for himself because he is certainly not speaking about me. I am proud to be Australian. Mr Cowan-He might have wanted a consumption tax.",121
399,Mr NEHL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Yes, he did also want a consumption tax. The second time the Prime Minister was caught out was on the John Laws program of 14 March 1991, when he again said that Labor wanted to abolish all tariffs by the year 2000. When caught on this today and challenged about it, he said, 'It was only on radio'. Does that mean it is safe to lie to the Australian people if one is only on radio?",123
400,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order! The honourable member will not ascribe that word to individual members.,123
401,Mr NEHL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"If I did, I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly withdraw. Is it okay not to tell the truth to the Australian people on radio? I suppose we have had the former Prime Minister come in and bash the living daylights out of the print media; now the present Prime Minister has put the hex on radio. He says 'only on radio, so it is okay'. I do not think it is okay, and I do not think the Australian people do, either. Scare tactics have been the feature of the way Labor has campaigned in this country for as long as I can remember, whether it was under Calwell-he used scare tactics; Whitlam, who did the same; Hayden; Hawke; or the present Prime Minister. Labor says without any regard to the truth that Australians will be worse off under Fightback-that pensioners, the unemployed, small businesses and workers will all be worse off. The Government is wrong, wrong, wrong. The pensioners of Australia, the workers of Australia, the small businesses of Australia and the farmers of Australia will certainly be better off under Fightback. I do not have the time to go into the wonderful things that are included in the package, including the abolition of the fuel excise levy, the abolition of. the wholesale sales tax and the abolition of payroll tax, but I must say to my fellow Australians in the remaining seconds of this speech: look at the detail of what the coalition is offering in Fightback; read it, think about it, and make up your own minds. We in the coalition believe that the people of Australia have great sense and will undoubtedly take the right decision when it comes to the next election.",123
402,Mrs CROSIO,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bills before the House. Unlike the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) , I am convinced that the initiatives outlined in the One Nation economic statement of our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will successfully get this country on its feet and see it into a period of growth and prosperity. I was particularly proud of the initiatives in the statement which will benefit Australia's small business. When the honourable member for Cowper started to refer to small business, I naturally thought he had read our One Nation package. Obviously he has not, because if he had he would have found that small business has been the real winner in One Nation, as our Government has continued to recognise the key role small business has to play in Australia's recovery from the current recession. Small businesses are defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Bureau of Industry Economics as businesses which employ fewer than 100 people in the manufacturing sector or fewer than 20 people in other non-agricultural sectors. The small business sector in Australia comprises a diverse range of business enterprises. According to the first annual report on small business in Australia, which was released in 1991: Small businesses participate directly in, or support, all economic activity in Australia, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing and construction, and service industries such as the retail trade, finance and property services and the hospitality industry. Approximately 57 per cent of all nonagricultural small enterprises operating in Australia are in the retail trade, finance, property and business services and the construction industry, while more than 90 per cent of the total number of firms in most industry classifications are also small businesses. As stated in the annual report to which I referred: Small firms account for 72.1 per cent of total employment in the construction industry. They also dominate total employment in the recreation, personal and other service industries, in the retail trade, and in transport and storage industries . . . Overall, small businesses provide around 48 per cent of private sector employment-jobs for more than two million Australians. This Government is giving greater recognition to small business interests in the development of economic and industry policies, and the initiatives in One Nation certainly prove that point. Small businesses have certain opportunities and advantages over large enterprises. This Government recognises that those small businesses can play an important part in Australia's economic development. Consequently, we are making efforts to improve the efficiency and performance of small businesses to ensure that enterprises which, by their nature, are likely to remain small, are able to operate productively and efficiently. This Government is also ensuring that new and innovative businesses, with high growth potential, are able to realise that potential and make a strong contribution to Australia's industrial development. The small business sector has a lot to offer Australia in its attempt to improve economic performance. It is an important source of innovation. It adapts quickly to changing market conditions and contributes to the flexibility and dynamism of the economy. Small businesses also tend to spawn entrepreneurial spirit and they provide a large part of the economic infrastructure necessary for industrial growth. This Government has tried to be as responsive as possible to the needs and the concerns of small business. It was this Labor Government which decided to set up a parliamentary committee to investigate the requirements of small business in Australia. In November 1990, following extensive consultation with the small business sector, that committee presented its recommendations. The committee's response acknowledged the vital importance of small enterprises to Australia's economic development and, as a result, this Government accepted that there was a need to tailor industry policies to cater to small businesses. The One Nation package proves that the Keating Labor Government acknowledges that one of its basic responsibilities is to create an environment that encourages businesses to succeed and to grow. We, as a government, also recognise that for many small businesses on very tight budgets government policies and regulations can mean the difference between their success and failure. This recognition of the problems of small business has not come as a bolt from the blue. Rather, it follows concerted efforts by our Government· and particularly by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Me Beddall) to hold lengthy and continuing consultations with the small business sector. Over the past 12 months in particular the Government, along with the small business unit and the small business council, has been raising the awareness of small business issues within Commonwealth departments and agencies, and that is to the benefit of the small entrepreneurs. The One Nation package could not have come at a better time for small business in Australia. The small business sector is extremely responsive to changes in economic conditions and demand patterns, and the recent contraction in economic activity in , Australia has placed severe pressure on small businesses, particularly in rural areas. The annual report on small business in Australia provides, I believe, a very accurate summary of the calamity small businesses in Australia face. One part of that report states: During 1990, the combination of lower commodity prices and a relatively high Australian dollar adversely affected the viability of small businesses in regional centres. The situation was exacerbated in Queensland and northern New South Wales by drought and flood, which leads to pressures on farm incomes and reduced demand for goods and services in rural areas. Sadly, as this report clearly shows', no State or Territory in Australia has escaped the trauma of the recession. Following consultations with the small business sector, our Prime Minister's One Nation statement holds some very important initiatives to help kickstart the economy and encourage the growth of small business. The main initiatives in the economic statement affecting small business are: taxation reforms, which include a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief for small and growing businesses, which will increase capital mobility and growth in this sector; a nine-week extension for 1991-92 company tax payments for small business; and the introduction of pooled development funds to substantially increase equity capital available to small and medium sized companies. We also find that it includes a tripling of funding support to $12m, assisting small and medium enterprises entering expOlt markets through the export access program. It has changes to banking regulations to allow banks to write off loans to troubled businesses trying to trade their way out of difficulties, and commitments from banks 'to expand their lending. It also says that there will be no increase until 199495 in the prescribed minimum superannuation levy for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less. These initiatives are in response to recommendations from the parliamentary committee's report and concerns voiced by the small business sector and the small business coalition. The small business coalition is composed of 35 businesses and professional organisations and has worked constructively with the Government in an attempt to raise the profile of small and medium businesses in Australia and address any structural impediments so as to allow small business to contribute to new industries, to export and thus employment. According to the report from the parliamentary committee on small business, taxation remains the area of greatest concern to the small business community. The tax reforms outlined in the economic statement go a long way in realising the recommendations of the committee and the small business sector. The current exemption from capital gains tax for 20 per cent of the goodwill realised on the sale of a small business will be increased to 50 per cent in respect of disposals of goodwill on or after 27 February 1992. The eligibility ceiling has also been increased from $lm to $2m of net business interest. This ceiling will be indexed annually from 1 July 1993 against the CPI to ensure that this significant tax relief measure is not eroded over time. In reducing the tax paid on the disposal of goodwill, the measures will facilitate greater capital mobility in the business sector and improve the ability of small business taxpayers to provide for their retirement by re-investing in their own business. These changes to the capital gains tax are administratively simple and do not lead to costly and complicated compliance burdens on small business taxpayers. However, the proposals for capital gains tax reform outlined in Fightback are complex, administratively unwieldy and certainly unworkable. Another measure introduced in the One Nation economic statement to assist small business is that smaller companies will be given a deferral of their initial for the 1991-92 income year. As a result of the economic statement, incorporated businesses with a notional or estimated tax liability of less than $400,000 will be allowed to defer their initial 85 per cent company tax payment for nine weeks. Smaller companies which are due to make an initial company tax payment for the 1991-92 income year after February 1992, will be able to defer that payment until the twenty-eighth day of the third month following the balancing month. The Government has recognised that changes such as this are necessary to small business as the recession has unfortunately resulted in delays in the receipt of income by small businesses, which has thereby reduced cash flow. The deferral of company tax payments by small business will ease the burden for these enterprises in so far as they will not have to pay tax on income which they may not have even received yet, thereby reducing the pressure and uncertainty of having to estimate company tax liabilities within 28 days of the end of the financial year. The new debt restructuring arrangements outlined in One Nation mean that taxpayers who are entitled to tax deductions for bad debts which have been written off can claim losses resulting from debt for equity swaps. Partial debt write-offs will also be allowable deductions. If taxpayers write off debt as part of a debt for equity swap with their debtors, then a deduction can be made for the difsmall ference between the amount of the debt and either the market value of the equity or the value at which the equity is recorded in the creditors' books-whichever is the greater. The law will also be changed to ensure that, where only part of a debt is bad and is written off, the lender will be able to claim a deduction for that amount written off. These debt write-off and equity swap measures, which apply to debts written off on or after 27 February 1992, should ensure that the appropriate taxation outcome is achieved from the process of debt restructuring and, most importantly, may result in some reduction in the number of cases where businesses are tax instalment liquidated. The economic statement has also introduced pooled development funds, PDFs, which are primarily for the expansion of existing firms rather than for new operations and will improve the availability of capital for and medium sized firms with total assets less than $ 30m. The pooled development funds will provide a tax incentive for equity investment in Australian businesses, resulting in companies with good prospects finding it easier to get the patient capital they need. profits of the pooled development funds will be taxed at the concessi anal rate of 30 cent. Dividends from the funds will be tax exempt, as will capital gains tax on the of PDF shares. PDFs will not be able to invest in retailing operations or real estate other than tourism projects and industrial buildings used in a manufacturing project. The Government's aim in forming pooled development funds is to provide long term equity capital to small and medium Government enterprises. Eligible equity interest restricted to new capital, primarily for established companies which are expanding production capacity or markets. Some funds will be made available for start-up ventures. The PDFs should fill a market gap which has existed since the Government wound down the management and investment companies scheme. Another issue recognised as important by possible. the parliamentary committee looking into small business was export development for small and medium sized enterprises, which a high priority among industry and small business associations. In acknowledging this fact, the Keating Government has increased funding for the export access program. Export access was an initiative of the 1991 Budget, and One Nation announced an increase in its funding from $4m to $12m over three years to assist small and medium businesses to enter export markets. Export access provides participants with comprehensive package of training and practical assistance in developing successful export activities, including assistance with preparing an export plan, identifying potential pay. overseas buyers and preparing and undertaking an overseas market visit. The program, which targets smaller firms that do not yet have sufficient in-house expertise and resources to maintain their own sustained export greatly development program, has revealed a small widespread latent demand among small of businesses to diversify their markets by entering export markets. Applications for participation in the program have far exceeded the available places in it. The increased funding announced in the The One Nation statement will allow an increase in the number of participants from about 250 per to approximately 700 over the life of the program, which will help cater to the added sale interest. The funding will also go towards improving access to the program by businesses in all States and regions of Australia and enabling additional markets, especially in Asia, to be targeted. The export access program has created an Australian business office in St Louis in the United States. This is looking at establishing another will be office in Europe later this year. Austrade operations were expanded through the economic statement with a $5m injection to expand its overseas posts. To avoid duplication between Austrade, export access and the national industry extension service program, discussions are being held to come to an agreement to ensure that these programs can be delivered to clients as efficiently as Changes to the superannuation guarantee levy announced in the economic statement is have also been welcomed by the small business sector. The superannuation guarantee levy represents a major step forward in the development of retirement incomes policy and will lay the foundation for income security and higher standards of living in retirement for future generations of retirees. The levy will achieve this by providing a major extension of superannuation coverage, an efficient method of encouraging employers to comply a with their award obligations, and an orderly mechanism by which employer superannuation support can be increased over time, consistent with the economy's capacity to It was annpunced in the economic statement that the Government has decided to alter the implementation schedule of the superannuation guarantee levy to ease the transition costs for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less. For these businesses there will be no increase beyond the initial prescribed minimum until 1994-95. One of the least publicised initiatives for small business in One Nation, but by far one of the most important, is the establishment of the Australian Technology Group. The ATG has been established with a view to helping identify research with commercial potentialparticularly from public research bodies, but not limited to the public sector; securing effective control and protection of intellectual property for itself and its partner; providing market research output to Australasian and overseas companies; and further developing an export industry in intellectual property. The ATG will be initially government owned, but need not be in the longer term, and will aim at being self-financing from fee and investment income. It will have the authority to raise borrowings. Smaller companies that cannot do in-house research will be able to commission research from public sector institutions. General reaction to the initiatives for small business that are contained in One Nation has been very positive, both from the small business sector and its associations and the media. In the media we have seen excellent reports from the Metal Trades Association of Australia complimenting the package that has been put together. The chief executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry stated in a release on the economic statement: From the perspective of the Confederation of Australian Industry, there are a number of positive features which we have sought and are pleased to find in the Statement. He goes on to describe the features pleased with. The initiatives in the One Nation package prove that the problems, challenges and, most importantly, opportunities associated with small business in Australia will continue to receive the vigorous attention of the Keating Government. recognise that the Government has tried to responsive to the needs of the small business community and is continuing its reforms taxation and, among other things, reducing compliance and reporting costs to all small businesses.",124
403,Mr BRADFORD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Unfortunately, I did not hear all the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), but I have had a good deal of experience with the small business industry and I can assure her that there is very much less than full-scale acceptance of the One Nation package. I would go so far as to say that the statement was completely deficient in so far as there was very little in it for small business. In recent days I have been talking to small business people, and there is absolutely no desire for a continuation of this Government beyond the end of this term. I suggest to the honourable member that there will be a comprehensive rejection of this Government by the whole of the small business community at the next election. Government members have that to look forward to. I want to make a few comments in relation to Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1991-92, which is being discussed in addition to Appropriation Bills (No.3) and (No.4). Appropriation Bill (No.5) seeks funding for, firstly, labour market program assistance to job seekers in industry amounting to $87m; secondly, residential care for older people amounting to $50m; and, finally, child-care fee relief amounting to $66m. In respect of these particular provisions, others have said, and I want to reiterate, that there is something very suspicious about them. The Government actually proposes to withdraw sections of existing additional Appropriation Bills and replace them with a new Bill. I certainly have not been in this place for a long time, but I am informed that this action is absolutely that he is unprecedented. Mr Beale-They ran out of money.",128
404,Mr BRADFORD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"As the honourable member for Bruce said, it boils down to the fact that the Government has run out of We money. I think that is disgraceful. The be Government needs to come clean and answer some questions. I will pose those questions of here tonight. Why is the Government considering this unprecedented action at this time? I think we have had the answer to that posed here already tonight: the Government has run out of money. I would like to hear that from the Government. I do not know whether the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, will answer some of those questions. I suspect he does not know the answers, either. Why did the Government not know about this funding crisis at the time ef introducing the additional Appropriation Bills only four weeks ago? If it did, why did it not raise it then? That was the time to bring this predicament before the Parliament and the people of Australia. It was not done then and we want to know why. Is this proposed action necessary because the normal channel for funds, the Advance to the Minister for Finance, is being or has been used up for other purposes? I believe the Government needs to reveal to the Parliament and to the people of Australia the funding state of the AMF and to explain why this is not available. The fourth question that I think needs to be answered clearly and conclusively is: how can the Government have $317m for a Wills by-election family allowance bribe but not have the ongoing funds for child-care, the aged and the unemployed? Incidentally, my colleague in the Senate the shadow Minister for finance, Senator Short, has posed these questions and has not yet received satisfactory answers to them. I think we 'see this for what it is: an ling, transparent, cheap trick to fund handouts for families immediately before the Wills by-election. In discussing this particular proposal in the debate on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); I asked why these particular payments were so broadly targeted; In other words, there are benefits from these handouts for families on taxable incomes up to $75,000. In that respect they were very poorly targeted indeed. In respect of Appropriation Bill (No.5), the Opposition believes that the Government action reeks of financial and budgetary mismanagement of the highest order. The Government is going to find itself in increasing difficulties in regard to its budgetary situation as time goes by. In our view the Government's budgetary situation is currently in a shambles. There will be a turnaround in the Budget balance between the first and second halves of 1991-92 of around $15 billion. In other words, we are going to see a move from a budget prediction to an actual budget outcome with a $15 billion difference between the two. Talking about things that are unprecedented, I think it would be very difficult for anyone who has been in this place for a long time to point to such a turnaround. It is a turnaround of mammoth proportions. Our criticism of the One Nation statement was that it was unfunded. We are seeing evidence of that tonight with the Government, in a sense, admitting that it has run out of money and needs a further allocation of funds. Having said that, Appropriation Bill (No.5) does deal with the funding for some important programs. I would like to home in on one or two aspects of the Bill dealing with childcare. Child-care is of increasing concern to parents in these difficult times when many families are facing the prospect of having both partners working to make ends meet. This is happening in the community as a result of this Government's economic mismanagement. Many families are having to make a very difficult decision in respect of their children in that both mum and dad have to go out to work in order just to make ends meet. That is not necessarily to finance the appalpurchase of luxuries, but just to make ends meet. I believe very strongly in the family unit as the fundamental social unit in our society, and I have no doubt that the most ideal form of child-care is care in the home, ideally by one of the parents. Unfortunately, economic circumstances have placed this particular best option out of the reach of many families. I think that is very sad. The social consequences of that are enormous and, in many respects, unmeasurable. The Government will have to accept a good deal of responsibility for the social costs that we will have to pick up down the line as a result of its economic policies whi-h have placed that best option for child-care-care in the home-out of the reach of many families. However, access to affordable child-care is essential for working parents. Taking a purely practical approach to it, we accept that that is the situation, and therefore the issue of affordable child-care needs to be addressed. In the Fightback package, which deals with this particular subject in some detail, we are giving serious consideration to the suggestion that tax rebates should be given on child-care expenditure. In fact, a paper that has been put forward by the Taxation Institute very pointedly states: Failure to recognise taxpayers childcare costs as a legitimate income earning expense is among the most striking anomalies in Australia's tax legislation. It impedes the drive for greater national productivity, has significant social as well as economic consequences and is out of step with several of our trading partners. I could not agree more. I am very pleased that in the Fightback package we have acknowledged that particular aspect of child-care. We say in the Fightback package that we are going to closely investigate the possibility of picking up that particular recommendation: that there should be some recognition through the tax system of the cost of childcare. The point has been made quite clearly in this particular paper, which is headed 'Baby It's Cold Outside', that child-care is an essential expense for sole parents and others who have to work. In that sense, in pure taxation terms, it is an expense that they have to incur for the sake of gaining their income. I believe that those people who are in that situation are discriminated against. Speaking from my own personal experience as a parent of young children, I believe politicians find that particular expense very difficult to cope with. In my own family situation our child-care bill, just for plain babysitting expenses, is often $50 a week. I am quite sure that, if I were not a member of parliament, I would not be incurring that expense. Members of parliament have to attend numerous functions in the community to which they cannot take their children. I am not arguing for that to be a tax deductible expense simply for members of parliament. In the context of the broader approach to tax deductibility, or recognition through rebates of that expense, there are numerous people in the community who would be in exactly the same category. They are people who have to incur that expense for the sake of gaining their incomes. I am very pleased that we have addressed that issue in the Fightback package. I for one, as a member of the coalition, will be pushing very hard in government for us to take that step; that is, recognising child-care as a legitimate expense. The existing situation of non-deductibility for child-care expenses also encourages reliance on unemployment and sole parent benefits. We have also - addressed the issue of sole parent benefits in the Fightback package. That has been a difficult issue for many of us to contend with. The fact that we have taken t4e decision that the sale parent benefit ought to be discontinued when the youngest child turns 12 has not been an easy decision. But I firmly believe that it is the right decision. There is much concern in the community about abuses of sole parent pensions. The most important aspect is that we want to encourage peoplewe are generally talking about women or mothers here-to get back into the work force as soon as they can before their skills become obsolete. We have taken the decision in the Fightback package to discontinue that particular allowance when the youngest child turns 12. The Government thrives on running misinformation campaigns about every aspect of our package. I want to make it very clear that, in our proposal to discontinue that allowance when the youngest child turns 12 instead of the present 16 years of age, we are not going to just cut it off and leave those mothers with nothing; in fact, we propose that the allowance be replaced with a Job Search allowance and the associated training benefits will be there. So mothers in that situation will be able to go out and look for work and be retrained, if necessary, to enter the work force. At the end of nine months, if they are not successful in gaining work, they will be considered as being eligible for the special benefit. That exposes, once again, the misinformation we hear so often from the Government that we are going to throw people out on the streets and take them off the Job Search allowance at the end of nine months. We do not propose any such thing, despite what we hear time after time from the Prime Minister; we propose to create a special benefit for them. The Opposition does not oppose this particular Bill-as I say, it does address some important issues-but we certainly question its modus operandi.",128

406,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, given that it is after the suspension of the House for dinner, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering Appropriation Bill (No. S) and Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2).",131
407,Mr JENKINS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Under the Standing Orders, we can have wide ranging debates on Appropriation Bills. But this present debate is centred well and truly on matters economic. It happens at a time when the choice for the electorate could not be any clearer. On the one hand, we have the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to this House of a month ago, entitled One Nation, against a policy document put down by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) late last year entitled Fightback! As I said, the differences in the approaches of those two documents could not be any greater. Much of the debate that has gone on in this discussion on the Appropriation Bills has been centred on those two economic plans. Many of those opposite have allowed themselves to be diverted a little. They seem to have a fixation about getting stuck into the Prime Minister for a whole host of reasons, real or imagined. I am amused that they then in tum suggest that it is the Prime Minister who has caused some diversion from matters that are of real importance. Of course, one of those things they feel is diversionary is a discussion that the Prime Minister has engendered about Australia and Australia's independence on the world stage. I reflect upon the words I used in this House in my very first speech when, because of the name of my electorate, Scullin-named after Prime Minister James Scullin-I did a little research about his life and his time as Prime Minister. One of the things I found of great interest was the difficulties he had in the 1930s when, as the Australian Prime Minister, he recommended the first Australian Governor General, Sir Isaac Isaacs. I noted in that first speech that Scullin encountered much opposition from what I referred to as a 'patronising British Government'. I then went on to say, 'Fortunately, things have changed, albeit gradually'. But I am concerned that there are those who still have the view that we should very much believe that matters British are of uppermost importance to us. The message that the Prime Minister has tried to convey-and I thought he did so with great generosity on the visit of the Queen-is that, in the 40 years of her reign, Australia has changed and Great Britain has changed: the outlook of both nations and the importance of our various relations have changed. If it is accepted in that vein, people should understand the thrust of what the Prime Minister was attempting to get across. I think younger Australians understand the point the Prime Minister was trying to make. They understand that our future dictates not only that we hold on to our traditional historic ties but that we see them in the context of putting Australia through to the twenty-first century; that we understand that, because of our geographic place in the world, we should embark upon ensuring that our trade and our trading partners develop in a wider scope. That is the real message. It should not be seen as a diversion; it should not be seen as remiss. If it flows on to wider debates on republicanism or otherwise, that is all to the good too, but let that not become, as the terminology is now, a first order issue, because a first order issue is quite obviously getting the economy right and getting the many thousands of Australians who are unemployed back into employment. Now let me contrast the way in which the Opposition and the Government go about trying to put in place the policies to achieve those goals. We have a Prime Minister who unashamedly embarked upon a series of consultations in the run-up to his One Nation statement. We have a Leader of the Opposition who developed a policy statement quite clearly in the abstract of academia. It was done in parts. Not all of the coalition members were involved in its development. Even shadow Ministers had parts that did not relate to their portfolio hidden from them. They were not there to be able to pull it together as a concrete and cohesive set of policies. We have a Prime Minister who is willing to go out and listen, who has a team of Ministers who are willing to go out and listen and to take part in the consultative processes that have been developed throughout the years of the present Federal Labor Government. The One Nation policy addresses what is needed for the AUstralian economy. The Opposition's Fightback is nothing more than an ideological fetish. One Nation is an approach which is designed to provide a stimulus to get the economy going. The Fightback package offers an excuse for a pernicious tax. There are other areas in which one can contrast the different approaches. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) highlight and contrast the differences in industrial relations policy. As the Prime Minister said in One Nation, modem industry has to be a cooperative process. We cannot have workplaces where people are locked in conflict. It would seem that the approach of those opposite is to take us back to the years of confrontation when we had one Australian set against another. The Government's approach truly requires us to develop as one nation. There are other general areas of policy difference. If we look at the Opposition's approach to training, we can see that it would have a system that involved people going into on-the-job training at 80 per cent of award wages. There are no safeguards, it would appear, for the process of so-called churning; that is, where one participant in such a scheme would go on at the reduced award rate and then, at the end of that period, be replaced by another who qualified for that award rate, resulting in no advantage for the first individual. The present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, quite appropriately described Austrain as 'Ausslave' . The other measures announced in One Nation and their effect on local communities can be seen as significant. Not only were the moneys allocated for infrastructure there to give a kick-start to the economy; they were also well worthwhile projects in their own right. I found the contribution of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) in his discussion about national railways quite intriguing and disappointing. It was lacking in vision as to what might be possible by bringing together the nation's railways systems under the one umbrella, and he started to attack such efficiencies when, to use his most unfortunate terminology, he equated railways with sheltered workshops. It is a most disappointing description and far from the mark. If we look at providing that type of infrastructure to rail, it will be of great value not only in economic terms but also, ultimately, in environmental terms. The additional road funding that was announced in the One Nation economic plan also has the dual purpose of bringing economic benefit and environmental benefit. In the general area on the urban fringe of Melbourne which I represent, the accelerated funding for the western ring road is impOItant. The funding that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has found for the western road extension between Greensborough bypass and Plenty Road is very important, not only because of the jobs that it will provide and the economical access that it will provide for the people living in those areas, but also, of course, because it will improve the quality of life of those who live on road systems that were not designed to take the volume of traffic that they now carry. Of course, one of the interesting things about the Australian political scene at the moment is how a by-election in one Federal seat can so dominate what might occur. Suddenly, many of those who sit opposite have reached for their Melways and found that the electorate of Wills is on about maps 16 to 18 and 28 to 30..They have discovered groups that operate within the Wills electorate and wish to champion their cause in this place at this time. I find that quite outrageous. I find it a personal affront that those who have ignored the needs of electorates such as Wills for so long should now wish to give the impression that they have the benefit, hopes and aspirations of the people of Wills at heart. Part of the electorate of Wills was in the electorate of Scullin between 1986 and 1989; therefore, I think I can speak with some knowledge about the types of areas which are within the Wills electorate. The suburbs of Fawkner and Hadfield, which I represented for those three years, are very much akin to a large area of my electorate. I think that like the people of Scullin, the people of Wills know that it is only the Labor Party which they can look to in hard times. There is no denying that they have been hard hit during the recession. Unemployment is high. The people of electorates such as Wills and Scullin have high expectations of Labor governments. They also know that Labor is the only party which has ever served their interests. They know that it has been Labor governments which have provided services and community facilities in electorates such as Wills and Scullin after decades of neglect from the coalition. The people of these types of electorates know that the child-care places, the increased retention rates at secondary schools, the home and community care programs, Medicare, the family allowance supplement, the real increase in pensions and benefits and the real tax cuts for all Australians could not and would not have been delivered by Liberal governments. As every day goes by the people of electorates such as Wills and the wider community know the difference between what is offered under the One Nation policy and what is offered in the Fightback tax slug. People in suburbs such as Fawkner and Hadfield know that they are among the overwhelming majority of Australian who would be worse off under the coalition's tax . grab for the rich. The Treasury analysis shows that eight out of 10 taxpayers would be worse off by having to pay more tax, and 70 per cent of families would be worse off if the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was to conduct an experiment on the· Australian economy. For the people of Wills, the Opposition's proposal is a nightmare. Central to what Dr Hewson plans to do",131
408,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,I hope the honourable member for Scullin is going to refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.,133
409,Mr JENKINS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. I regret that lapse in form. Central to what the Leader of the Opposition plans to do is the fact that he proposes $10 billion worth of cuts in government spending. This would lead to the decimation of many services in the Wills and Scullin electorates. In Question Time today we saw members of the Opposition crying crocodile tears about an apprenticeship placement group in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The innernorthern group apprenticeship scheme, which was incorporated in 1983, has been jointly funded by the State and Federal governments. One has to ask whether, as part of the $10 billion cuts which are proposed in the Leader of the Opposition's package, such schemes would survive. Are they in any way central to the type of measures the Opposition envisages? In contrast, the One Nation policy has set aside $11.7m to extend for a further year the package of measures announced in March 1991 to assist unemployed and at-risk apprentices and trainees. This package will assist 7,000 young people through a combination of measures: a living allowance paid to unemployed apprentices and trainees to assist them in completing their basic training at TAFE; funds to\ private training providers to run intensive training courses for unemployed apprentices to enable the early completion of their trade training; a subsidy of $100 a week for up to 16 weeks to employers of thirdand fourth-year apprentices vulnerable to retrenchment, to enable apprentices to complete trade training; an increased incentive from $500 to $1,000 to encourage employers to recruit unemployed apprentices; and an incentive of $300 to hire unemployed trainees. These are concrete measures which will have positive impacts in electorates such as Wills and Scullin as well as in other areas. As the Prime Minister noted during Question Time, the Leader of the Opposition has condemned the expenditures included in One Nation. Hence we have the unparalleled hypocrisy of members of the Opposition crying crocodile tears over apprentices in Wills while they are prepared to vote against measures designed to help apprentices at risk. The same members support a package of $10 billion worth of cuts in government expenditure. This is a cruel spectre which hangs over the heads of every Australian. The members who come in here and cry about the NOW centre in Brunswick probably could not find it without the aid of a Melways. They have not looked at the facts. The NOW centre was first funded by a Labor government back in July 1975. The first funding cut that it received was from a Liberal government in October 1980. It was the Labor government that re-funded it in 1985, subject to a three-year review. Mni:m of the Opposition must answer the question whether there is any chance, any possibility, of any program under which a service such as NOW could even be considered being put in place if ever Australia had the misfortune of the coalition becoming the government. Members of the Opposition who feign compassion for the needy in Wills are the same members who support a package which plans to rip $2 billion out of the social security system. On top of massive punitive cuts to the fabric of the social welfare system contemplated by the coalition, the average men and women of Australia are to be subjected to a considerable rise basic necessities of life. For the people in Wills the Leader of the Opposition is offering a policy that, on best estimates, would see the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables rise by 10.1 per cent, clothing by 11.2 per cent, electricity by 10 per cent and health services by 22 per cent. If the Leader of the Opposition has his way, small businessmen in electorates such as Wills will have to bear the additional burden of administration to comply with this pernicious tax. This is not just speculation; this is the reality of the overseas experience with such taxes. I have great faith in the capacity of the Australian people to see through this Opposition's pitiful con trick. Despite the initial positive response to the Fightback package, it will tum out to be the world's longest suicide note. For the great bulk of Australians there is simply nothing in it. It asks them to pay more so that others can pay less. (TIme expired)",133
410,Mr CHARLES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I rise tonight to make my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation Bills, which became necessary as a result of the One Nation statement of the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-the one we had to havewhich was delivered in this place. I remind this House that the divisive actions of a divisive Prime Minister in this last month have done anything but unite us into one nation. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) discussed in rather picturesque terms his Me/ways walk through the yellow pages and stated that the Opposition had just found Wills. I remind the honourable member for Scullin that the previous member for Wills, who was until recently the Prime Minister, had a bloody hard time finding it, mate. Mr Jull-He wasn't there for eight years.",134
411,Mr CHARLES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,He did not live there; he did not service,134
412,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order! I suggest to the honourable member for La Trobe that his remark about 'having a difficult time finding it' is not helpful. It would be better if he in the price of the withdrew it.,134
413,Mr CHARLES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,In deference to the Chair,134
414,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"No, it is not in deference; just withdraw.",135
415,Mr CHARLES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I withdraw. The electorate of Wills is more than well known to the parties on this side of the House. I suggest that honourable members opposite might find out what it is all about in Wills and what, in fact, the great bulk of the Australian population has been complaining about for nigh on these last two years. The policies of this Government, which were largely the policies of this new Prime Minister, have led us to the mother of all recessions and brought us to the point of having to bring down an intermediate economic statement in March; following an intermediate economic statement in November, following a Budget in Augustall of which are still subject to change. I remind the honourable member for Scullin that economic circumstances in this country have changed over the last 12 months to an extent much greater than in any period in the past or in the foreseeable future. Last cial year we budgeted for an $8 billion surplus. This financial year we are likely to wind up with an $8 billion deficit, and on top of that we have an unfunded package, which we are discussing tonight by way of these machinery Bills, contained in a pork-barrelled statement called One Nation. So we may well wind up with an economic position of reversal approaching some $16 billion, or perhaps $18 billion, in 12 months. I venture to say that had we made any economic proposal to reverse public sector spending in Australia by some $18 billion, the cry from the other side would have been heard around the worldperhaps even on the moon. Included within the One Nation statement and these funding packages is provision for TAFE. TAFE is the flavour of the momentsomewhat, I would remark, past time. Provision for extra funding for TAPE includes Austudy, which makes it appropriate that we discuss the package of student financial assistance, called Austudy, and that we discuss modem provision for TAFE-or technical and further education-in Australia. The One Nation package purports to add some $720m over the 1993-1995 triennium to previously committed funding. But there is a bit of a pea and thimble trick here-not that I would accuse the Prime Minister of deception; far be it from me to make such a statement. In fact, the $720m is minus some $300m in previously committed funding. So One Nation adds not $720m, but $420m to TAFE spending. If the Prime Minister and if those honourable members on the Government side of the House care to read properly the Fightback statement, they will find a commitment to training that is unparalleled in the history of Australia. The con job in this statement that keeps respending the extra commitment over and over again must surely come to an end eventually . But this then brings us to the question of Austudy. I note that it is of some national significance that on the television tonight we saw students protesting and we saw blood in the streets for the first time in many years. It seems a bit senseless for students to protest finanover proposed Austudy changes because the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has in fact denied any responsibility for, or connection or association with, a preliminary report put out by his consultant, Professor Bruce Chapman. Twelve months ago the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down a report on student financial assistance. We made a great heap of recommendations which were well thought out and bipartisan in nature. As a consequence of that report, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is now our Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)-I believe the fourth one we have had in a year-decided that the Department of Employment, Education and Training was not capable of responding to our report and so he directed the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services to hire an outside consultant, Dr Bruce Chapman, to bring down another report on Austudy. Dr Chapman, rightly or wrongly, brought before the Minister a preliminary report for discussion-only purposes. As a result of that preliminary report for discussion we have seen student iprotests the likes of which we have not seen since the Vietnam war. It seems a bit senseless to me to argue about a preliminary report which is not final; particularly since the Minister in question has told Dr Chapman-his consultant who is paid for by our taxpayers' funds-to change his report. Before Dr Chapman had even brought down his report, the Minister said, 'I don't like your result; 1 don't like any of your potential recommendations. Change it'. So Dr Chapman is in the process of rewriting the report which he will present in final form. 1 think probably, if one were to ask him, Dr Chapman would be willing to admit privately that he is not very happy about having been told by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services how to write his report. I am certain he is not very happy about students protesting in the streets; but then perhaps the students have not really listened to what Dr Chapman is saying. Austudy is a massive program to deliver grants to students at a secondary and tertiary level in order to provide them with living expense assistance so that the most financially disadvantaged in our nation can achieve educational equity. The problem with the grants scheme is that it becomes very difficult to design a simple system so that we can simply target those who are most in need and those who might not otherwise either finish their secondary education or achieve a tertiary education without financial assistance. So we have Austudy, which followed on from TEAS, which followed on from scholarships. Austudy is full of inequities. The greatest inequity of the lot, 1 suppose, is the fact the Government and the Minister have never really spelled out clear policy objectives for the scheme. Very recently the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services responded to our report on Austudy. It took him some nine months but this month he finally responded. Our very first recommendation was that the Government and the Minister develop clear policy objectives for Austudy, for student financial assistance grants schemes. The Minister, who clearly is listening to departmental advice, has responded to us that the objectives are already published and are clear. This was a bipartisan Committee, which said that the objectives are not clear and that no-one understands what the heck the scheme is supposed to do. The policy objective is simply stated as breaking down financial barriers. That is pretty vague, is it not? It can mean almost anything. Our Committee asked for a much clearer definition of the objectives, such as to provide a comprehensive living allowance or to provide support in addition to other income. Clearly, Austudy is not designed to provide 100 per cent of living expenses for secondary and tertiary students because, if it is, 1 can tell the House they will starve. The maximum Austudy payment is of the order of $4,000 and the NUS, rightly or wrongly, reckons that about $12,000 per year is needed to maintain a student. That covers board, lodging, transport, books and incidentals, and does not include HECS. Maybe it is only $10,000-1 do not know-but certainly one cannot live on $4,000. Austudy is a supplementary scheme to provide money to assist those who are most financially disadvantaged. Unfortunately, instead of targeting those in most financial need, it is broad-based and services some 43 per cent of tertiary students. 1 suspect, because that is old data, that this year, with the recession, when students are staying on at university, that figure will be up to 45 per cent. Our second recommendation was to develop performance indicators against the objectives which the Department has not set and the that Minister does not support so that we can see whether we are getting the money to the students who need it. That seems very reasonable. The Minister says that DEET, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, does monitor some small indicators and it thinks we are doing just fine. The anecdotal evidence 1 get when 1 travel around the country and discuss Austudy with parents and students in the outback, in country regions and in cities all over the country is that it is one of the most rorted systems of financial assistance of all times. I am told that in Western Australia Alan Bond's daughter got Austudy. I hear story after story of well-off students arriving in their BMWs and their Mercedes to collect their Austudy cheques. The Department thinks it is doing a good job of monitoring Austudy! One of the biggest problems with the whole scheme is the fact that it is basically a means test scheme. That means that one is paid Austudy on the basis of financial need. The financial need is the need of one's parents, and until one is 25 one is deemed to be not independent of one's parents in terms of Austudy. We have created a few problems, and probably the most disadvantaged students in Australia today are those who fall into the middle family income situation where momma and poppa eam enough to fall outside the means test limits of Austudy but have decided, for whatever reasons, to donate their money to other priorities. The potential student then receives no parental assistance but cannot receive Austudy because .his parents' means are above - he minimum limit. Someone who manages to own a company business and to structure his or her income so as to receive a majority or a substantial portion of that income as fringe benefits, or receive some of it in the future in significant superannuation payments, and who dedicates a portion of that income to negative gearing on the property market-all of which is legitimate for taxation purposes and all of which we have decided is proper and above board-can structure that income so that he or she pays minimal tax, has a minimal before-tax income. The children of such a person are therefore eligible to receive Austudy. We made some very clear recommendations. We said that the Department should review the allowable deductions for taxable income in order to determine whether Austudy should be paid. We said that fringe benefits should be included as income and that superannuation payments, particularly when one is donating lots of money from a company income situation, should be considered as income when considering Austudy payments. The Minister says that it is all too hard; it is not possible. When this Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, brought in the fringe benefits tax he elected to take the easy option and charge companies for fringe benefits which they gave to employees, rather than charging the employees for benefits thus received. So Australia would have to be one of the few countries, if not the only country, in the world that taxes one institution-that is, a company-for the benefit of someone else, the employee. Because of that we then pay Austudy to those individuals who get the fringe benefits. It is a ripper of a rort, I must say. But the Minister says it is too hard. The reason students are protesting and that there is blood in the streets today is that Dr Chapman had the audacity to suggest that part of the $1.3 billion per year that we spend on Austudy would be better devoted to providing those students who elected to take up the option with interest free student loans. The students would decide how much they took, and they could pay it back with their HECS through the taxation system when they were in jobs or in income producing situationshaving, I must note, received the benefit of their tertiary education in terms of their income earning. capacity. That seemed eminently reasonable. I have put such a proposition to countless numbers of parents around Australia. I have said, 'Look, you give us this problem with Austudy, and a second problem, a third problem, a fourth problem 01' a fifth problem. I tell you, there are lots of problems because it is impossible to design a grants system and target it effectively without making it so complex that it will never work at all'. As it is, it is pretty complex. The form is terrible, is it not? The form is really horrible. Form 9 for asset testing is even worse. Regardless of how difficult it is now, the more tightly we target it, every door we try to close makes it more complex, and every door we close opens another door for another rort for someone else to receive the grant whom we do want to receive it. So Dr Chapman very sensibly proposed that at least a portion of our grants system be dedicated to student loans which would be taken on an individual basis and become an item of student financial assistance that was elected by the,students-not forced on them, but elected by them. What happened? There is blood in the streets. Do honourable members know why? Life must be too good for students, or at least those from the NUS who like to protest. The Austudy system must really be good, so good that it provides them with enough income that they are willing to go out and fight a national battle over it. Australia is the last country in the world to retain a major grants system to financially support students in tertiary education. Beyond that, we are one of the very few, if any, major countries in the world today that provide their secondary students in the last two years of secondary school with student financial assistance to support their living expenses. Mr Deputy Speaker, the One Nation package is nothing but a massive pork barrel to attempt to give this Government an edge in the electorate of Wills which, I put to you, it has just found in Melways.

416,Mr HOLLIS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I am pleased to take part in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.5), Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). I thought we were debating appropriations, which is typical at this time the year, yet the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talked about an intermediate Budget-if I understood him correctly. Perhaps when he has been here for a couple more years, if he survives, he will understand that Appropriation Bills are a normal process of the parliamentary year and we always debate them in this way. Maybe the honourable member for La Trobe was a little confused with the terminology, as he kept referring to blood on the streets today. I watched several news bulletins this evening. I saw a couple of vigorous demonstrations which, surely, in a free and democratic society we are entitled to. I did not see very much blood. From memory, I think the most vigorous demonstration was in Brisbane. I saw a couple of scuffles there, but I did not see very much blood. Warming to his subject, the honourable member informed us in a very dramatic tone that we have the greatest riots in the streets since the days of the Vietnam war. Let me say to the honourable member for La Trobe that, in the very unlikely event that the other side of this House wins the next election, he has seen nothing yet. If the honourable member thought that a few students protesting today was a riot, he should see what would happen if the mad swing to the Right-by the ideologically blinkered Right-is inflicted on this country. One does not have to take my word for it. One can see what has happened where the Right has had the ascendancy in the last couple of years. One can look at New Zealand, where that Government has tried to implement right wing ideological policies, right wing economic policies and industrial relations policies. Such countries have seen protests as they have never been seen before-be it in New Zealand, Britain or any of these places. The reason is that the policies attack the living standards of the working men and women of those countries. They will not tolerate that nor will they tolerate the imposition of a 15 per cent tax on everything. I see that the honourable member for La Trobe has left the chamber. It is a pity because I particularly wanted him to hear this. I admit, as would anyone in an electorate of office, that I hear stories of abuse of welfare systems and of Austudy. There are difficulties with Austudy; I am the first to admit that. I think we have to take a serious look at it; indeed, a committee has looked at it. I sometimes get a bit tired, though, when I hear about students driving up in a BMW or a Mercedes Benz to collect their Austudy cheques. I say this to the honourable member in all seriousness because undoubtedly, like me, people come to his office and tell him about rorts that they believe are in the welfare system. I always ask those people who are making these accusations to give me the evidence. I tell them that if they give me the evidence I will follow it through. It might be single mothers on the supporting parent benefit; it might be a whole range of things. When I ask for the evidence it is very rarely produced. The response I receive usually goes something like this: 'Well, you know, Colin. My sister lives next door to someone who knows someone who is rorting the system'. That is the evidence that is given. I am not naive enough to suggest that there is no rorting of the system at all out there; of course there is. I think the honourable member for La Trobe summed it up when he said that, if we were going to stop all rorting, we would almost have to have a police state. But people throw these accusations around about people driving up in a BMW or a Mercedes Benz to collect their Austudy cheques and things like that. The honourable member should not come into this Parliament and make these claims unless he has seen this happening or people are prepared to give him the evidence that people are driving up in BMWs. It most certainly does not happen in my electorate or the electorate of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table. We know everyone who has a Mercedes Benz or a BMW in both of our electorates. Believe me, there are not many of them. They are so well known because they are such a rare comchoice modity in our area and they would not dare to drive up to the office in that way. As said, if the honourable member for La Trobe thinks that today's minor demonstrations minor disturbances were the most violent that he has seen since the Vietnam war, if Australia is unfortunate to have that side the House inflicted on it after the next election, he has seen nothing yet-believe me! I strongly support the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). support it for the commitments that the Prime Minister has given to Australia's transport system. One of the greatest challenges-if not the greatest challenge-facing our country to have an effective and efficient transport system. The efficiency and effectiveness the transport sector is critically important the Australian economy. I suggest that it inescapable consequence of our nation's size and dispersed population. Equally desirable is the need to develop more equitable society by increasing national income. The Commonwealth's guiding objective is to promote and develop an integrated, efficient and coordinated land transport system that reflects the national, economic and social priorities, that pursues safe and effective practices responsive to user requirements with each mode undertaking the transport task to which it is most suited, and which is equipped to meet the rapid growth envisaged in the 1990s and beyond. The means of achieving these essential goals is by structural adjustment through micro-economic reform. Micro-economic reform aims to accelerate growth in living standards. It also seeks to establish an environment in which industry can provide the goods and services demanded by Australians and by our trading partners at competitive prices. To date, this Government's reform achievements span the whole economy, including product and labour markets, service industries, the waterfront-despite what people on the other side might say-aviation and, indeed, broadcasting. The task in the transport sector is to improve intermodal and the links between modes to lower the real cost of transport. That is something I that we in this Parliament should all be committed to. This directly benefits industries, or exporters and consumers. More efficient railways, for instance, would substantially decrease the annual $4 billion drain by the of railways on public sector savings and assist Federal some of Australia's largest exporters. you Improved efficiency in road investment and management can increase the returns to the community from the Commonwealth's conI strongly siderable road funding. The Federal Gove11l1'ilent has also played a pivotal role in initiating road reforms that can deliver an extra $2m a year in national earis nings. Working with the States and Territories, the Government has embarked on a of reform strategy that aims to develop a more to efficient and responsive national transport is an sector. The basis of this program is the Government's fourth-term policy commitment to structural reform of those industries with a the greatest impact on the national economy. our The impetus is the very real need for Australia to be more competitive internationally. The specific aim is to increase the economy's responsiveness and resilience by enabling higher growth in productivity, production and employment, and real wages, and easing Australia's susceptibility to changes in demand and fluctuating world commodity prices that can destabilise our balance of payments outlook. The Industry Commission has estimated that land transport reform has a capacity to increase our national income by more than $6 billion. The Federal Government is determined to deliver these benefits to the economy and to all Australians. The changes now under way are being pursued in a spirit of cooperation with other levels of government through the establishment of institutions covering the national transport sector. However, more change is needed and at a faster pace. This is not solely a government responsibility, but one which we must all share. Australian industries and those sectors serving them need to be more efficient; that is, increasing the return on public funds through better management practices, more targeted investment, lifting productivity and the use of new technology. The efficiencies achieved can be passed directly to users in the form of lower prices. While increasing efficiency and improving performance in the transport sector, the Government will act to safeguard public interests, social justice and safety objectives. The pursuit of a modem, efficient and costeffective transport system across all modes has required the creation of new institutional structures in both road and rail, national in outlook and commercially focused. As a consequence, governments are moving towards a consistent national, institutional regulatory environment conducive to structural reform and growth. More transparent cost structures will provide clearer price signals in the marketplace. It follows that goods and services will be valued appropriately. Savings flowing from these changes will contribute to a more equitable society through improved national income. Underpinning this restructuring of the industry is a forward looking infrastructure development program, the largest of its type ever undertaken by any government in recent years. The Federal Government and the National Rail Corporation have committed $2.2 billion to mainline rail development in the years ahead. This Government will spend $4 billion on Australia's national road networks in the three financial years to June 1994. This Government's land transport strategy and the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister focuses Commonwealth spending on road and rail projects that reduce transport costs for industries, speed the flow of goods and produce to ports or demonstrate a capacity to lift national income through shorter travelling time and greater efficiency gains. My only disappointment with the Prime Minister's statement relates to two projects which I and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who is sitting at the table, are committed to: the Caloola Pass Road and the Maldon-Dombarton rail link to the port of Port Kembla, so that it can reach its full potential as an export development port. Neither of us nor the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) had given up in our pursuit to have that objective achieved. We come from the Illawarra and we are used to waiting, but we believe that ultimately we will be successful in the noble goals that we have set ourselves in that area. The Prime Minister's One Nation statement has set the parameters for economic recovery in this country. I believe it is a distinctly Australian statement and I would contrast it with a letter I received recently regarding people who claim to be Australian. I listened to the fine contribution of the honourable and member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) today on what it means to be Australian. Like all honourable members, I receive a wide range of letters each week in my office. Some of them are genuine and some are not quite so genuine. I received a letter two weeks ago and, quite frankly, I thought it was a hoax until I read it and decided it was not. I have several private schools in my electorate-one is called Tudor House. Alan Caradus, a gentleman who obviously teaches there, wrote to me on Tudor House letterhead, a copy of which he sent to the Prime Minister. I hope it is known that he has used school stationery. The interesting thing is that he wrote to me as a fifth generation Australian; but he wrote to the Prime Minister as a sixth generation Australian. Obviously he had a generational change in the time he took to pen the two letters. There were numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which I corrected. Several times the Prime Minister's name is spelt as Mr Keeting. He said that he objected to the Prime Minister's statement when Her Majesty the Queen was here. He stated: Mr Keating has no right to make personal comments on constitutional matters. His manners are about as good as his economic and accounting skills. I think the Prime Minister's economic skills are pretty good, so his manners must be pretty good. He says he hopes that I will raise this matter in the Parliament, which I am doing for my constituent tonight. I acknowledged his letter and said that I would not raise the matter in the Parliament because I thought it was silly. I also pointed out the correct spelling of the Prime Minister's name. I stated: Your letter does show clearly how lacking people like you are in a feeling for Australia. We are no longer a British outpost but an independent country, and the sooner we do away with the anachronistic trappings of colonialism, we can take pride in Australia. I said a few other things. I did not send the letter to him in which I corrected his English, but he sent a letter to me purporting to correct my English, which seems to be something we do in my area. He started his letter by saying that he was a fifth generation Australian to prove his credentials. He then told me that he found my letter insulting. It always amazes me as a member of parliament that people can write the most unbelievably rude and insulting letters. Some of the letters I get are beauties. I always take the view that I will write back the same type of letter I get. If people send me letters which are very rude-by nature I am not a rude person-I write the same sort of letter back. At the end of his letter, Mr Caradus listed his academic qualifications. I do not know what that has got to do with it. I do not know what he teaches, but he has a Bachelor of Education and a Diploma of Music Education. He also lists a lot of professional organisations to which he belongs, but he did not mention the generational change he had had. I wrote back and said that I had received his rather pompous letter and ended with a thought I have had for some time: if this was the standard of teaching in the private education system in Australia, it confirmed my long held belief in and admiration for the State education system. I stated: The letters from you raise serious doubts about the maturity of some people in the private education system, and strengthens my belief in the State education system. I must say that no-one I know in the State education system would have been silly enough to write such a pompous and silly letter to any member of parliament. I have done Mr Alan Caradus, the music teacher of Tudor House, Moss Vale, the honour of raising his serious concerns in the Parliament of Australia tonight. I will be sending him a copy of my speech.",138
417,Mr ANDREW,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"In response to the comments made by the honourable member for Throsqy (Mr Hollis), may I in my opening remarkS simply put in a word or two in defence of freedom of choice in education and say that I do not believe that even the honourable member for Throsby believes that the evidence of one letter from one constituent damns all education systems, whether they be private or public. In my own electorate I have some very good private schools and some very good public schools. I discover that there is a certain enthusiasm for the private schools, which I am quite prepared to endorse, given that I do not find the students in the private schools placing the same demands on the taxpayers' dollar as the students in the public schools do. In that sense, I think we need to applaud freedom in education and freedom of choice in education. Even the honourable member for Throsby would agree that the evidence he has put to the Parliament tonight in criticism of the private school system was hardly representative of the entire system. I rose to participate in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1991-92. As speakers before me have evidenced, this Bill seeks the funding of $87m for labour market reform and for assistance to job seekers in industry, $5Om for residential fee relief for older people and $66m for child-care relief. This Bill is necessary because the Government considers that these three items of expenditure are so important that they cannot wait on the passage of Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 through the Parliament. The Government has indicated that awaiting the passage of that Bill would place severe hardship on many individuals, companies and charitable organisations, principally, the Opposition has observed, in the electorate of Wills. The concern that the Opposition has with these Bills is what this passage of money does to the Government deficit. As we are all aware, the Government indicated in the 199192 Budget that it was anticipating a $4.7 billion deficit. It was not long before that particular prediction was revised to suggest there would be a $6.3 billion deficit. But now, as a result of the impact of the One Nation package on government funding, we find that that deficit has blown out to $6.8 billion. The Government has indicated that by 199293 the deficit will hopefully-and I underscore 'hopefully' - be $8 billion. It is this blow-out in deficit that most clearly marks the difference between the Government's One Nation package and the Opposition's Fightback package. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said, what we have with the One Nation package is distinctly a credit card led recovery. The particular significance of the GST, the proposal for tax reform under the Opposition Fightback package, is that the GST is not an additional tax. In fact, seven existing taxes go. The Liberal and National parties have mutually pledged themselves to a reduction of $13 billion in public sector spending. At this point we see most clearly marked the difference between the Government's proposals and the Opposition's proposals. What we are putting to the people of Australia is not an additional tax but one tax that replaces seven existing taxes and one tax that deliberately and significantly takes less of the taxpayers' revenue. The facts that we cannot escape, much as we would like to, are the facts about the Government debt. I want to refer to two charts. The first is an indication of Australia's net external debt. The chart starts in 1960 and runs through to 1990. It is painfully evident that in 1983 the Government's external debt soared out of control, reaching, on a calculation made a fortnight ago, $163 billion, compared with $35 billion when the Government came into office. This level of debt can only be repaid by additional Australian productivity. I am not going to score a cheap political point by suggesting that this debt is the fault of the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is not entirely. Part of this debt is the fault of misguided entrepreneurs around Australia-something that the Opposition freely acknowledges. But the Prime Minister cannot wash his hands of this debt, because he, along with the entrepreneurs, has been very much a part of that graph. The significant, inescapable and damnably uncomfortable truth is that that debt can only be repaid by increasing Australia's export earnings. This is clearly a part of the Opposition's Fightback package. It has been calculated that, unless we raise our export performance by an improved 3.5 per cent of our GOP and sustain it, we cannot pay off that debt. The second chart to which I draw the attention of the House is a measure of our export performance relative to GOP since 1970 through to 1990. At the top of that chart one will note that there is a line. That line is the 3.5 per cent improvement in GDP, export related, that we need to pay off the debt. In 20 years we have not done it. These two charts underscore all that the Opposition is about in offering an alternative to the One Nation package. They underscore what is wrong with the One Nation package, because we would contend that one cannot justify a credit card led recovery, I seek leave to have these two charts incorporated in Hansard, CHART AUSTRALIA'S DEBT CRISIS AUSTRALIA'S NET EXTERNAL DEBT 1960-1991 Nel debt 1: GDP 40,------------------------------------------, 35 30 . 25 20 15 OECO d.ta NA a SlIslllh.,!,1 contributioll of :\.f) % of r---------------------------------------------- 4 2 o -2 /UpijHt"" i ""I"": ""1""1""1""1' 'I""; ""I.L1P-4-lJ-P-4"" 70 7:1 711 nVE YEAR MOVING ""\'[RAGt: Leave granted, The charts read as follows(PERCENTAGE OF GHOSS DOMESTIC PIWDUCT) TI-IE DEBT I-IURDIJE NA Gnr is r""'llIi ...!.1 wit,.\ _.

418,Mr ANDREW,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I appreciate the courtesy. If we are serious about repaying Australia's debt, we have no choice but to improve our export performance. As the chart indicates, that improvement makes demands on the Australian taxpaying public and demands on the Australian productive public that have not been met in 20 years. All Australians should be asking themselves, as I am sure every Government member has asked himself or herself: why on earth would an Opposition be proposing such a dramatic change? Why should we run around committing ourselves to something that is going to be initially unpopular, unless there is no choice? If we are truly to be an alternative government, if we are to stand and look the electors in the eye and say, 'This is where we are going and why', we find ourselves with no choice but to outl ine what are dramatic changes in order to deliberately encourage Australians to be productive and to reward them for doing so by taking away the penalty that currently exists through our income tax provisions. I note that in the debate in this House on tariff reform the Prime Minister was very anxious to denigrate the Opposition. As has been clearly pointed out by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), there is little between the Opposition's proposals for tariff reform and the Government's proposals for tariff reform, except that the Opposition commits itself unreservedly to industrial relations and micro-economic reform hand-inglove with tariff reform. One would have thought that the Prime Minister, given that it is much easier for the Opposition to oppose than to agree with the Government, would at least have been gracious enough to acknowledge that what he has sought to achieve in tariff reform has not been thwarted by the Opposition parties. But, no, what did we have? We had the bare-faced hypocrisy of a Prime Minister who wanted to pretend that what we were doing was totally different from what he was doing, even though what we had done was done with a great deal of Opposition discomfort. It is time the Prime Minister woke up to the simple fact that the Opposition has endeavoured, not only in the area of tariff refOlm but also in the area of taxation reform, to be responsible, accountable and answerable to the people of Australia, and has not chosen to make cheap political points out of anyone of the major reforms that will be necessary if we as Australians are to accept the challenge we face in paying off the debt that has been incurred over the past eight years. In the area of the Opposition's Fightback package, particularly the proposed changes to taxation, I frequently find myself as the representative of a rural electorate facing all sorts of accusations from the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). The honourable member for Hinkler has come into this House and said on frequent occasions that every primary producer will find that the cost of the primary products he or she is producing will go up by 15 per cent. I was delighted this evening to note that the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) reviewed that figure. Whereas the honourable member for Hinkler alleged there would be a 15 per cent increase, the honourable member for Scullin was at least prepared to review that figure downwards somewhat-you may have heard him make this comment, Mr Deputy Speaker-and suggest that the increase would be 10.5 per cent. I say to the House that the proposal under the Opposition's GST package is to advantage-not to disadvantage-rural producers. It has been all too easy to get the impression that ALP members have somehow been pleased and almost relieved to be able to say that rural producers around Australia, because of their low income, pay little income tax and therefore will not be advantaged by the Opposition's goods and services tax. As a member of the alternative government, and as a representative of a rural electorate, my commitment is to make sure that my farmers pay income tax, not by increasing their income tax rates but by increasing to realistic levels of return they get on their investments, so that along with the rest of Australians they become income earners. But my message in tonight's debate is this: even my farmers who are currently poverty stricken and not paying income tax will be advantaged by the GST. The GST is attractive to people who are paying income tax because of the changes it offers in tax rates-16c in the dollar if they are earning less than $22,000; 30c in the dollar if they are earning less than $50,000. Even people not on large incomes will be advantaged by this package. Why? Because seven existing taxes are rubbed out. I do not have time tonight to elaborate, but let me deal with just three of them. The Opposition proposes to remove in total, under its GST package, the wholesale sales tax. Out goes wholesale sales tax. What does that do? It removes a tax that is totally inconsistent in the way in which it applies. Do people realise that they pay wholesale sales tax on toothpaste but not on toothbrushes, that they pay wholesale sales tax on wardrobes but not if they are built in, that they pay wholesale sales tax on above-ground swimming pools but not on in-ground pools? A whole measure of inconsistencies is removed when wholesale sales tax is taken away. While many farmers are currently in industries that are not entirely exempt from wholesale sales tax but at least have relief from it, all of the people who service the rural areas of Australia, for example, the truckies who bring the goods into rural towns and take the goods out, will find that their trucking and spare parts have the wholesale sales tax removed. Their tyres and fan belts will all be cheaper as a result. Of course, the wholesale sales tax that is removed will be replaced by a goods and services tax, but under the Opposition's proposal that goods and services tax will be rebated because it is a cost to business. Effectively, the wholesale sales tax will be removed and there will be no tax to replace it. There will be a real fall in the cost of servicing rural industries and getting rural produce to the ports. As if that were not enough-and one can see the attraction that offers to rural peoplein addition, diesel fuel, used principally in trucks, will have the petroleum excise removed so that it is available to the truckie at the same rate as it is currently available to the farmer for use on farm. Of course, it will be replaced by a GST but, as the fuel is a legitimate business cost, the GST will be rebated. The diesel fuel and the petrol, for that matter, that is used in the rural communities and in any form of business enterprise will fall in price. Even in those areas where people do not have the GST rebated, the price of the fuel will nonetheless fall. So the first question people on fixed incomes who are concerned about the impact of the GST should ask themselves is: 'Do I own a car?'. If they do, they will be advantaged by $10 or $11 every time they pull up at the bowser to fill their tanks. In addition, the third tax area of change in the Fightback package compared with the One Nation package is that the Opposition proposes to remove payroll tax. It is too easy to be flippant about payroll tax and say, 'Oh well, small business isn't affected by payroll tax'. Of course it is. In New South Wales alone, 54 per cent of employees are employed in industries that pay payroll tax, and the cost of that to those industries flows on to every other New South Wales consumer. A similar situation exists in every State in Australia. If we remove payroll tax we remove a real disincentive to employment. The Opposition proposes to provide opportunities for employment, as part of its Fightback package, rigs by removing the current payroll tax. As if this were not enough-and time will not permit me to run through all of the advantages in the Fightback package-the Opposition goes one step further by exempting exports so that all Australian manufacturers, particularly primary producers, involved in producing exports will be producing goods that are more economic to export and more attractive in terms of the revenue they raise for Australia. In terms of the graphs that I had incorporated in Hansard, there is a real opportunity to push that line through the 3.5 per cent and help us meet the debt that has been mutually incurred by the Government and by entrepreneurs. The removal of payroll tax will do something to encourage employment. I was appalled tonight to hear the honourable member for Scullin say that only the Labor Government has ever done anything for the poor and the underprivileged. That is historically untrue, of course, because the coalition in opposition and in government has a proud record of concern for the poor and underprivileged. I refer to the family allowance aloneMr Gibson-Which you never increased for years.",144
419,Mr ANDREW,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"I will mention the family allowance, if there are honourable members who want to frivolously interject. My point, which leaves the Government without one valid argument, is: how can this Government claim to have done anything for the poor and underprivileged when under its leadership and stewardship we have effectively put one million people out of work? They are hardly likely to thank the Government for their standard of living. The proposal under the Fightback package is to provide real opportunities for employment. The proposal is to give people an opportunity to get back into the work force and to exercise real independence. As far as rural communities are concerned, the Fightback package is endorsed by the National Farmers Federation, which clearly sees it as more advantageous to its farmers than the proposals in the One Nation package, which has been compared with the Fightback package in this debate this evening.",146
420,Mr SINCLAIR,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"I rise in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.5), Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) largely because of an article in this morning's Australian headed 'Furrowed brows down on the farm' by rural writer Tim Stevens. This article highlights to me one of the real daries we have as a nation and as a parliament in trying to identify where we go from here. As a parliamentarian, it concerns me that the politics of prejudice and personality are increasingly dominating the debate at a time when the people of Wills and the people of Australia deserve better. I am sure Tim Stevens's article and its implications, like the measures in this Bill, are not going to provide a solution for those poor and underprivileged to which the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) referred. It seems to me that all the Government has done for the poor and underprivileged is create more of them. I do not think that is anything of which a government or a Labor Party should be proud. As one of my colleagues said a moment ago, there are one million people unemployed. Is that really something Government members would want to have blazoned around the electorate of Wills and around Australia? We are looking at a measure which itself is illustrative of the whole problem. I have researched this legislation and I believe this is the first time that Appropriation Bills being advanced in their normal course through the Senate will be altered before they have been passed through. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), they are being altered because of a requirement to meet expenditure which in a time frame on current estimates cannot be accommodated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Why not? The Advance to the Minister for Finance on every past occasion has been adequate for circumstances of additional expenditure by the Government. This is not late in the parliamentary yearthis is towards the end of March-and the Parliament is going to sit for some months before the end of the current financial year. Sure, things are crook, but we have been told that things are now bottoming out. We have had all this rhetoric about progress and recovery, which I am afraid I am not as yet convinced has occurred. This legislation is going to alter the financial allocations, which will put more pressure quan- on borrowing by those who are going to enable the economy to recover and generate the jobs-which I happen to be worried about. This legislation is going to put greater pressure on our deficit. The turnaround has been well and truly articulated by my colleagues who have spoken before me. This legislation will ensure that money is not going to be cheaper and recovery is going to be slower. I want to come back to the article I mentioned and then look at the One Nation document and at where we are going. As a representative of rural Australia, I do not believe the crisis is just a product of drought, nor of a fall in commodity prices. I believe the crisis in rural Australia is Government made. In my mind, the measures that were pursued by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the five-minute Treasurer and former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, have been absolutely disastrous for those I represent. It is appalling that somebody who supposedly has some background in agriculture pursued policies that reached the state that Tim Stevens addresses in his article in this morning's Australian, when he said: Without significant stimuli-not just rain-the sector may never turn around to a situation where it can again be described as healthy. That legacy of the honourable member for Werriwa as Minister for Primary Industries is diabolical for the Australian family farmer. It is no use saying that we are in the day of corporate agriculture and vertical integration and that the day of the individual who tilled his block of earth, milked his cows, dug his vegetables and laid out his dried vine fruits has gone. His day has not gone. That is the basis of the arithmetic of modern civilisation. In a moment I will refer to an excellent analysis by Ian Castles in the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication headed Rural Australia. I want to talk about some of the figures included in it. I have a complaint about this paper: it refers to the 1986 census. I say to Mr Castles that I hope that we will get the product of the analysis of the most recent census a little before six years after the event. Mr Castles and his staff have a capacity with their computers to give us some updating of these demographic characteristics and the economic statistics of what is happening in the bush. This paper has only just been produced so, although I am referring to a 1986 census, it is the latest information available. There were 2.3 million people counted in rural areas, which represented 15 per cent of all people counted in Australia. As far as I am concerned, that 15 per cent of people is just as important as anybody else in this country. The present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is a joke, and there is no use addressing the contribution he has made. One Nation reflects that his contribution has been nil. The package did provide a bit of money for counsellors-and I am pleased to see that-and there are some adjustments in the contribution for rural adjustment, but there is no amendment to rural adjustment. Rural adjustment is still helping people off the land. The original rural adjustment scheme, the original income equalisation deposit scheme, was designed to help to keep people on the land. What this Government and each of its successive Ministers for primary industries rural have achieved has been to force people off the land. That is why Mr Stevens's catastrophic statement that 'the rural sector may never tum around to a situation where it can again be described as healthy' is the epitaph on the term of the honourable member for Werriwa as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I wil1100k first at Mr Stevens's article, then go to the general climate of the rural sector and come back to what One Nation does for it. I do not have long to do it, but I want to do it because it seems to me that there are some fallacies around the country at the moment. To my mind, Mr Stevens's article is based on entirely the wrong premise. This country has enormous resources in the rural sector-human and material. This is still one of the most efficient food producing countries in the world. If there is to be a crisis in the world, it will be a shortage of food-a shortage of the very things of which Australia is the most efficient producer in the world. We have to place emphasis again on the way in which we can allow that sector not only to play its part but to drag Australia out of this enormous debt burden that Labor has imposed on us-a burden which the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with his One Nation statement, will augment and which he, in his role as Treasurer, created-that is, a debtloaded burden that no sensible fanner would be proud to carry. What does Mr Stevens say that is so wrong and creates this problem? First he says that the nation can, in effect, float with a sick rural sector. He seems to have a view that Australia is out of the trough. I will come back to that in a moment. In my view Australia is bubbling along at the bottom of the trough, and I can see no significant sign that it is improving. Let us face it-in tenns of investment in plant and machinery in the secondary sector, Australia today, in 1992, is at its lowest position for 30 years. In tenns of our secondary industry we are way down in the depths. It is certainly no better in the rural sector. The second thing Mr Stevens says is this: The sector's contribution to Australia's gross product has dropped from more than one quarter in the early 1950s to less than 4 per cent in 1990-92. Why is that? Because of commodity prices, drought and the debt burden that this Government has created for fanners. There is no longer the wheat stabilisation scheme. We know of the absolutely disastrous way in which the former Minister for Primary Industries handled the wool price support mechanism. It is no use saying, 'Oh, but it had had its day'. The point is that the Government was part of making it have its day. There was a representative of the Minister's Department on the Australian Wool Corporation through every phase of decisions which made that 870c limit. He was there through every phase of the decisions that changed the legislation that took away the responsibility to ensure that that minimum reserve price took account of the price of other commodities. Those were the 1987 amendments. I remember that my colleague the former member for Gwydir, Mr Ralph Hunt, when shadow Minister for primary industries during an early phase of the Hawke Government, produced some figures and calculated seven years ago that the Labor burden on the rural sector at that stage was more than $2 billion per annum. I have tried to update the figures, and on my calculations it is three times as high as that at about $6 billion per year. That is removing tax concessions, removing wheat stabilisation schemes, changing commodity arrangements and removing the minimum reserve price scheme for wool. That additional burden is something like $6 billion per year in the rural sector. It takes account of the higher relative rate of the cost of money in Australia and takes account of the debt burden that this Government's policies, including One Nation, represent. The third thing that Mr Stevens says is this: While the late 19808 balance of payments crisis was largely created by the blow-out in foreign borrowings by the so-called entrepreneurs and a blow-out in spending, it was compounded by crashing rural commodity prices and the resultant trade deficit. We need to understand that that was not purely the result of the commodity crash. It was at a time when trade indices around the world were rising. The opportunities were there, and if the Government had taken the right action, if it had been on the front foot and tried to worry a little more about bilateral trade arrangements-for example, in the Middle East-a lot of our problems would not have occurred. When we look at the live sheep trade, we have to understand that through successive Ministers for trade under the Labor Government there was a feeling that they did not like the politics of Saudi Arabia and did their best to antagonise the Saudis. During the most recent visit by the honourable member for Werriwa, in his current role as Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, he did not even see the Minister for agriculture in Saudi Arabia. Why not? Because of the progressive antagonism that has grown between this administration, under whichever manifestation, and the Govenunent of Saudi Arabia. If this Government had tried to do more in the Middle East and in Asia from the time when it was first elected, that crisis that Mr Stevens referred to would not have been as bad. At that stage world trade was on the rise. Instead of our leading the world into depression, we would have been out there behind the rest of the world. And so we could and should have been. Mr Stevens continues: Much of the turnaround can also be attributed to wool prices which have since fallen back again, and drought breaking rains. Wool is in a crisis state. The downward spiral continues according to yesterday's Australian Financial Review, and today's Australian says wool growers are on tenterhooks as prices hold steady. There are enonnous problems in marketing. The price is compounded because of the difficulties of knowing how to handle the stockpile, and the Government has been absolutely of no use. Why we have three organisations, I do not know. The Government seems to go mad on creating jobs in the bureaucracy. We have three bureaucracies to do a job that one could do. I pay great tribute to those who are on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for the impossible task that they are attempting. The reality is that those in the Wool Realisation Commission should be linked with those in research and development and with those in the Australian Wool Corporation who are responsible for promotion. I believe that between the three they could do the task far better than three organisations could. There needs to be far more sympathetic consideration of the recommendations that were made by Sir William Vines. When the Government cannot reach a decision, it has great pleasure in appointing committees of inquiry. It has appointed some outstanding Australians to these committees, and Bill Vines is a very good example. I thought he produced a great report. It was a very difficult challenge. The Government had made a mess of it. The Government refused to acknowledge its involvement in the collapse of the minimum reserve price scheme. What happened? It appointed Bill Vines, he came out with his report, and its most significant recommendations were ignored. I am not sure whether those recommendations would have created a better wool market. Nobody can tell now, because the time is past. The point I make is that it is of no use appointing people who are experts and have knowledge of the industry, then listening to their reports, and then saying, 'No, we don't like them'. That is what the Government did with the wool industry in the first place. It had its own representatives from the Department of Primary Industries on the Wool Corporation right through the period of the wool market collapse. As far as I am concerned, it was the Government that created half the problem. I said that I wanted to refer briefly to the demographics of the industry. There is no doubt that in the rural sector we have some significant problems. In terms of the present decline, we have a high proportion of children but a low proportion of people in their teens and their early twenties. The cost of education in the rural sector is significantly higher. We have a number of difficulties in the ageing of the population on farms in Australia. We have a greater percentage of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the rural community. We have a lower percentage of migrants, but a larger group who come from English speaking countries. We have a higher proportion of women, but when we get down to education, employment and income, there lies the rub. People living in rural areas have left school at an earlier age than urban dwellers. Fewer of them have graduate or post-school qualifications. To a large degree rural students are being ignored by this Government. The Government talks about what it does for education. Children in boarding schools are ignored. Children who go to universities, whether to institutions such as the University of New England and its many campuses or Sturt University, have to live away from home. This Government has taken away the assistance to residential colleges. Austudy does not take account of the circumstances where, because of the means test, there are enonnous difficulties for many who are on the land in educating their children to the standard that they would wish. The proportion of tertiary students who live in rural areas is low. I could go on. The analysis of these statistics from ABARE are a damning indictment of the Government and of One Nation. As is said in this report, there is high unemployment. There is high unemployment for a compound of reasons. There is a movement out of the rural sector. It is a major social problem. The point is that One Nation has done absolutely nothing about it. What we have to understand is that the One Nation forecast economic growth for 1992-93 is 4.75 per cent, following zero growth in 1991-92. These year average forecasts imply six to seven quarters of strong economic growth. Although perhaps not quite as strong as the recovery from the 1982 recession, they certainly project a medium term forecast growth of around 4.5 per cent for the next three years with inflation remaining under 4 per cent and a current account deficit remaining under 5 per cent of GDP. On any assessment, while this scenario might be desirable, I think it is unlikely met. If we look at the present state of investment in plant and machinery, and if we look at the inherent sluggishness of the domestic economy following that spending binge of the late 1990s, the crisis of confidence and the cost of money, we have no doubt that there are enormous problems. Look at the other adverse factors such as the higher real interest rates in the business cycle, long term oversupply of commercial property, weak growth in household incomes, reflecting slow wages and high unemployment and slow employment growth, the continuing impact of the debt overhang, especially in the corporate sector, implying that any increase in incomes is likely to be put first to debt repayment and balance sheet repairs rather than investment in plant and equipment. That is a real negative. We have the continuation of sluggish world growth and the prospects of what is happening in Japan. We have child-care Australia's relatively high current account deficit, the deficit that is continuing and deficit that is going to be increased, as it, by the Appropriation Bills now House. What concerns me, if I can revert back that article by Tim Stevens, is that there is nothing in One Nation that is going to the bush; there is nothing in the present prospect of weather conditions or the prospecber tive failure of the GATT round that will allow the sector which on so many occasions in past has helped Australia out of the rough do so now. While in 1982-83 the drought induced recession was ended by a rain soaked rural sector able to produce, willing to produce and producing, that is not going to happen now. The reason it is not going to happen now is that there is nothing in One Nation. It is a very good reason to accept Fightback. The alternative the coalition offers is that we provide positive assistance which, sadly, is totally lacking under the Labor package. (TIme expired)",146
421,Mr WILLIS,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"in reply-I wish to take advantage of the opportunity to make a to be few correcting observations about some comments made by the Opposition lead speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who suggested that there was something particularly incompetent about the Government's management of its budgetary process, as demonstrated by Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1991-92, that it was an unprecedented state of affairs to have such legislation brought before the House, that there was a funding crisis, and that funds were being used for purposes other than those that had been suggested. I assure the House that the suggestions made by the honourable member for Curtin are quite without foundation. The fact is that the reasons for this Bill have been quite clearly spelt out by me in my second reading speech, in which it was clearly stated that there were three areas of expenditure which are the subject of the Bill: labour market programs, residential care for the elderly, and fee relief. We faced unexpected demands in two cases and substantial adthe ditional pressure in the other, brought about I see by the measures announced in the November before the and One Nation statements. In respect of the labour market programs, to there was an increase of some $87m mainly as a result of the increase in the expenditure help on labour market programs deliberately introduced by the Government in the Novemstatement and, to a lesser extent, in the One Nation statement. In the case of residenthe tial care for the elderly, in the way that to program is organised, if the religious, charitable and other organisations that are building capital works, for which they are entitled to Government assistance, for aged persons residential care move into a faster path of construction than has been forecast, that expenditure automatically increases. In relation to child-care fee relief, the increase in expenditure comes about because of the additional places over and above those forecast in the Budget, particularly in the private sector. That is a very welcome development and one which certainly accords with the Government's policy of increasing child-care places in the private sector. It comes about also because of the lower level of average income per person utilising the child-care places than was forecast, and therefore a higher level of fee relief. In all of that nothing is being hidden from the Parliament. We have given the reasons why there is this funding pressure, which collectively mean that the demands on the Advance to the Minister for Finance are greater than the amount that is in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, and suggested that, if we waited for the normal Additional Estimates Bills, which are also before the House at the present time, to go through in the normal way, by the time those Bills were through the Senate we would have faced demands on the Advance to the Minister for Finance which could not be met and therefore there would be problems in terms of maintaining programs. To ensure that people who are the beneficiaries of these programs are not subject to the massive inconvenience that would otherwise result, this Bill is before the House. Such a Bill is not unprecedented. Last year we had a Bill of this kind before the House to meet another unexpected event, the Gulf war. The expenditure for the Commonwealth in the Gulf war meant there was more pressure for expenditure than could be met through the AMF, and we had a special Bill for that purpose. So it is not unprecedented. Nor is it the case--and I strongly refute the suggestion by the honourable member for Curtin-that there is anything in this Bill which relates to the one-off family allowance payment to be made in April. The Opposition has been suggesting through its finance spokesman, Senator Short, that there is some such likelihood. I refuted that statement at the time he made it some days ago. It has now been repeated by the honourable member for Curtin. Let me repeat that the funding for the family allowance one-off payment in early April was provided for in the Bill which was brought into this House on 26 February and passed through the Senate on 5 March. The Opposition is simply not keeping up with what is happening in this place. The funding for the one-off payment has well and truly passed through this Parliament and is totally irrelevant to the Bill now before us. I repeat that this Bill is required in circumstances ·6f unexpected pressures on the Advance to the Minister for Finance which cannot be met, and it is very sensible for the Parliament to give it a speedy passage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Willis) read a third time.

422,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"Order! I have received a further message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending, in accordance with section 56 of the Constitution, an appropriation of revenue for the purposes of the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92. It may assist the House if I indicate the reason for this further message from the Governor General. As a consequence of the introduction and passage of the Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1991-92, the Government proposes to move consequential amendments to the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92, one of which would amend the long title of the Bill. As messages from the Governor General recommending an appropriation of revenue or moneys refer to Bills by the long title, it was necessary to have a further message specifying the long title as proposed to be amended.

The amendments to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 which have been circulated to honourable members were foreshadowed in of the course of introducing Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1991-92 in the House. The effect of these amendments is to delete from Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 reference to appropriations for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry, residential care for older people and child-care fee relief as the appropriation of moneys for these purposes has been included in Appropriation Bill (No.5) The appropriations for these are permissive rather than mandatory in that they merely provide an upper limit against which moneys can be expended for these purposes. Notwithstanding that controls could be imposed administratively by the Executive or officials rather than the Parliament to effect a reduction in expenditure under Appropriation Bill (No.3) to offset the appropriation in Appropriation Bill (No.5), the Government has decided to formally move for the deletion of these programs from Appropriation Bill (No. 3) so as to give effect to Parliament's role in approving the upper limits on expenditure under authority of the appropriation Acts.",152
424,Mr RUDDOCK,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"My understanding of these matters is that the Government is moving these amendments because we have made accommodation for these sums in Appropriation Bill (No.5), which we have already dealt with. The progress of these Bills would not be such as to enable the Government's program of payments to be met. Therefore, the matter has been dealt with in Appropriation Bill (No.5), which we discussed earlier. In that sense, these amendments are consequential but certainly related to the matters about which the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) already commented. Obviously the Opposition intends to accede to the request of the Government for these amendments. It ought to be clear that important questions were raised by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on the way in which these matters were dealt with by the Government. We do not resile at all from our view that there has been a funding crisis in relation to these matters and the way in which they have been dealt with. The Government could have programmed these matters in such a way that they could have been more appropriately met. We still do not know why the Advance to the Minister for Finance was insufficient to enable them to be addressed. This certainly has not become clear to me from the comments that have been made. As far as the Opposition is concerned, it is absolutely correct that these matters reflect very seriously upon the Government and its performance. I note that the Minister said tonight, as he has said before, 'These are not unprecedented events. Although they relate to aged care, labour market programs and childcare relief, you ought to understand that there were certain unexpected pressures placed upon the Government.' In fact, these matters arose consciously as a result of Government decisions in the One Nation statement and also in the statement made in November. The Minister made that clear in his own comments. Mr WiHis-Earlier than that.",153
425,Mr RUDDOCK,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"Yes, in the earlier statement made by the former Prime Minister in November. These matters of decision by the Government have placed pressure in a budgetary sense. The statements clearly did not appropriate sufficient funds, otherwise we would not have Appropriation Bills now. The Minister says, 'What you need to look at is that there are precedents for this', but what is the precedent he gives us? The precedent is that in the Gulf war, one of the most serious events that a government could face, there were comparable situations where funds like this had to be found in such an emergency. I do not know how one can make that sort of comparison at all. We are not dealing with a wartime .situation, we are dealing with a matter which the Government, if it had its eyes on the ball and was concentrating on the issues, would have been able to plan appropriately. There must be a crisis, otherwise the Government would not have to appropriate funds at this time. There would be severe embarrassment to the Government if it were not able to meet the bills as they fell due. That is why we have this legislation and that is why we have these amendments. This is not a matter that can be idly excused in this way; it is a matter of great moment, a point that was made, quite properly, by the shadow Minister for finance, Senator Short, and by the honourable member for Curtin. It is no excuse that the one precedent the Minister gives us was a situation of war where extraordinary expenses are naturally incurred, and that is well understood. I think that point needs to be made and emphasised properly, as I have done. Notwithstanding that, we would not want to see the Government embarrassed by not being able to meet its bills as they fall due. That is why we have acceded to the passage of the earlier legislation and to these amendments.",153
426,Mr WILLIS,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE," Mr Chairman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) seems to have a confused view of how moneys are appropriated in this place. The mere fact of making a statement in November does not appropriate moneys; it simply announces that we are going to spend more in particular areas. An appropriation has then to be forthcoming. The appropriation, of course, was contained in Appropriation Bill (No.3), involving an additional $87m, all but $5m of that coming from the additions to labour market program expenditure, if necessary in the context of the recession announced in the November statement and in the One Nation statement. Now those moneys have, to be appropriated. If an Appropriation Bill has not gone through the House and there is not sufficient money in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, obviously the moneys cannot be spent. Whether it is a Gulf war or labour market programs, the financing problem is the same. We need to have an appropriation to meet something which has occurred subsequent to the Budget which could not be catered for by the Advance to the Minister for Finance and which puts an obligation on the Government to try to ensure that it is able to meet its announced program of expenditures in a way which will mean that there are appropriations available. The only way that that can be done in these current circumstances is to have a Bill of this kind. There is nothing wrong with such an approach. It is an approach which will mean that there is parliamentary scrutiny in every way of these additional expenditures. In the Senate the Appropriation Bills normally go to the Estimates committees and are looked at in considerable detail. We have indicated that we have no objection whatsoever to the items involved in Appropriation Bill (No.5) going to the Estimates committees even though the Bill will have been through the Senate by the time those committees get to consider the items. However, officials can be questioned in relation to those expenditures. We made that quite clear. This process, which has been explained several times, ensures that there is not a cessation or a cutback in expenditure for certain program areas. At the same time it gives the Parliament full scrutiny and is absolutely necessary because of events that have arisen since the Budget was brought down. There is nothing about a financial crisis in relation to that and the attempts by the honourable member for Dundas to talk in those terms are just beating up the issue extraordinarily.",154
427,Mr RUDDOCK,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"I understand the point the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has made. I certainly understand that there is a need for separate Appropriation Bills. Normally when these matters are dealt with they occur in a Budget context. The Budget is a statement. It is like the statement that was made in November and the One Nation statement. It is a statement by government and Appropriation Bills have to follow. Normally they are part and parcel of the Budget. When the Government makes its statement, it introduces Bills which deal with the appropriations that are necessary. In other words, it knows the consequences of the decisions that have been taken, and Appropriation Bills come in. We are dealing with a situation now in relation to payments that have been incurred because of the statement that was made in November and, more recently, the One Nation statement made by the Government. It gets down to a question of timetabling. The fact is that, because of the way in which the Government had dealt with these matters, it was not in a position to pay its bills when they fell due. That is what it is about. It is like a person not being able to handle the payments of his bills when they fall due because he is, in one way or another, living beyond his means or has not been able to shift the money from one account to another. The fact is that the Government, which had the obligation to manage these matters, was not managing them. I am told by the Minister that it is a beat-up. I do not regard it as a beat-up when people are not able to pay bills when they fall due. I regard it as even less of a beat-up when the Government is not able to do so. If these matters had not been able to be dealt with and accommodated in this way, the Government would not have been able to make those payments. The Advance to the Minister for Finance would not have been sufficient. Mr Beale-They are broke, aren't they?",154
428,Mr RUDDOCK,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,That is what it was. The Government had not appropriated the money. If we had not agreed to these Bills the Government would not be able to pay that money. That is what it amounts to. Mr Gibson-That happens every time.,155
429,Mr RUDDOCK,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"It does not happen every time. The one example the Minister gives us of a precedent for the way in which these matters have been handled relates to the Gulf war-a situation of war; not a situation of everyday payment of accounts in relation to the labour market, child-care or residential care. That is the difference. These matters would ordinarily have been dealt with in a proper way. The appropriations could have been put in an orderly way and the accounts could have been dealt with in an appropriate way. But because the Government was in such disarray-it had its eyes on every ball, with the Prime Minister making a statement which went down like a lead balloonMr Beale-Which one?",155
430,Mr RUDDOCK,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"Former Prime Minister Hawke. That statement in November went down like a lead balloon. It has been largely forgotten by most Australians, of course, except now there are some bills to be picked up. That is what we are dealing with. Then we had the One Nation statement, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was so ashamed of that he had to distract everybody's attention from it by talking about a whole lot of other extraneous issues. That is the fact of the matter. Of course, there are bills to be met as a result of that. That is why we are dealing with appropriations legislation now. This situation is not comparable with the Gulf war. If the Minister would like to give me some other examples, he might be able to persuade us that this is just a case of a government dealing with these matters in the ordinary course of events. But when the one precedent is a war-time situation, I think it demonstrates more clearly than anything else how abnormal it is that we are dealing with appropriations legislation in this way. If the Minister would like to give me a bit more advice and have a little homely chat about it, I will listen to a further homily. But it will take a lot of talking to convince me that the Government has handled this situation in a proper and appropriate way, given the important timetabling and the accounts that need to be paid. That is the point that my colleagues have been making, and making quite properly.",155
431,Mr WILLIS,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"I cannot let this opportunity pass without making a couple of comments. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) says that the Government cannot pay its bills unless this Bill is passed. Of course, that is true of any Appropriation Bills: if the Appropriation Bills are not passed, the Government will not be able to pay its bills. The reason we have Appropriation Bills is to give parliamentary authority to the Government to spend moneys. In the circumstances we face at this time, we are simply speeding up the Appropriation Bills process to - nsure that before the normal Additional Estimates Bills get through we will have the proper appropriation for unexpected expenditures, in the case of two of the areas I have mentioned, and for the other expenditures which were announced at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, for which there has been no chance to put appropriations through. The honourable member for Dundas is really saying that we should have had Appropriation Bills sooner so that forthwith. we could have dealt with this. Mr Beale-You could have managed the time. whole thing better.",155
432,Mr WILLIS,WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE,"If the honourable member is saying that we could have had Appropriation Bills sooner, then, yesMr Ruddock interjecting",156

434,Mr GIBSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is a pleasure to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the statement of the Prime I) Minister (Mr Keating), One Nation. Like all my colleagues on this side of the House, I very much welcomed the commitments made in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister, and as the member for the electorate of Moreton I am particularly pleased with a number of the initiatives contained in the statement. The One Nation statement contains some very real and very important initiatives which will improve employment prospects in my electorate and throughout the nation, and will provide some very positive benefits to constituents, to business, to the economy and to the nation. I think the most important thing to say about the One Nation statement is that it gives this country a very strong fighting chance to really succeed in the 1990s and to grow and further improve our export and economic performances. Unlike the Opposition's statement, allegedly known as Fightback, the One Nation statement actually does create real jobs for real Australians and gives some real hope for the future for Australians. It is those particular points that I would like to mention this evening. The package promises to do a great deal in our community, and in particular it has an important emphasis on improved infrastructure. Within my electorate that infrastructure mainly refers to improved railway facilities. Two important projects that were announced in the One Nation statement which are of particular interest and benefit to my constituents are the freight rail line to the port of Brisbane and the new rail line from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. Both of these rail projects pass right through my electorate, and many hundreds of my constituents will receive the jobs that will be created by them. I am delighted that this Government is contributing $30m to the establishment of a standard gauge freight rail line to the port of Brisbane, because this link will mean that the port of Brisbane will provide a viable competitive alternative to the southern ports as a major port for the import and export of goods. At the moment, for southern businesses to have goods shifted to the Brisbane port by rail, the goods would need to be unloaded from a standard gauge train, which happens at Acacia Ridge depot, and then shifted onto alternative rail carriages or onto trucks, then transported to the port, unloaded again and put onto ships. This means that for movement of freight into and out of the port of Brisbane a double or triple handling process is involved, which costs money and makes the freight rail line very inefficient. The construction of a standard gauge railway Hne to the port of Brisbane, and its inclusion in a number of other rail projects which will link the whole country together with one national standard gauge rail line, means that rail becomes a very efficient mover of goods and that freight traffic through the port of Brisbane will be cheaper and faster for all businesses, both in Queensland and in southern ports. That means that the port of Brisbane will continue to grow. It is already one of the most efficient ports in this country, and with this project it will be an even more efficient port. I am particularly pleased about that because it will also mean further growth and development of Queensland business with job opportunities for Queensland workers. There are very many positive benefits for Queensland with the rail projects, but there are some community concerns about the freight rail line. I know that the residents of my electorate who live along the freight rail line are concerned about the possible impact of additional rail noise on their quality of life. It is an issue I am particularly concerned about because the urban environment and the noise of traffic, whether road, rail or air traffic, is a very important element in the quality of life for people in cities. The impact of additional trains along these lines needs to be considered by governments at both State and Federal level when they are developing this project. It has been one of my important tasks to raise with both the Queensland Minister for Transport, David Hamill, and my parliamentary colleague the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), the important question of ameliorating any noise impacts of this new freight line on the residents along the line. I have taken up the issue of trying to ensure that, when the environmental impact study is done on the impact of this rail line, comprehensive measures are undertaken to reduce the impact of rail noise on the residents. I have also asked for very serious consideration by the Federal Government of any submission by the State Government for an electrification process to occur for freight rail traffic along this line. This rail line will massively improve the efficiency of the port of Brisbane, but in fact it will add only something like three or four trains a day along the line. The major noise problems along this rail line come from the existing freight rail traffic, and I am also working with the State and Federal Governments to put together a package to ensure that all that freight rail traffic through those suburban areas of Brisbane is electrified, because it is the 158 other freight trains that run past people's homes every week now that are causing most of the noise problems. For all the residents in about 14 suburbs who live quite close to that line we need to do something about that noise. The most efficient and most effective way of achieving some reduction in noise is to add electric engines to the trains rather than the heavy, noisy diesel engines. The lines along which these trains will flow are already electrified because they are also passenger lines, so it is not a question of great expense to make the freight traffic electrified as well. It is just a question of purchasing additional electric engines to be added on at the Ipswich point or the Acacia Ridge point where the traffic changes. So I am hoping that the noise problem that my residents along that corridor currently suffer will be ameliorated by such measures, and it will be my task as their Federal representative to fight to get the necessary funds flowing from both State and Federal coffers to achieve that. I am pleased that the freight rai1line will be proceeded with by this Government in concert with the Queensland Government. I am also pleased that the Federal Government has made a contribution towards the establishment of a passenger rai1line to the Gold Coast. It has been something of a tragedy in Queensland that there has not been a rai11ine since 1957 from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. I think that has created considerable difficulties in the development of the corridor between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. I am pleased that this Government has had the foresight to finally put some money into this project to enable that to occur. As I indicated earlier, a fair amount of the line from Brisbane to the Gold Coast will run through my electorate, and it will be the workers in my suburbs who will get a lot of the jobs on the construction. For them. I am delighted at the funding of this project. There are many other measures in the One Nation statement that are of benefit, not just to my constituents but to the whole of Queensland and Australia. I refer particularly to some of the very important tax benefits that have been included in the statement and the new accelerated rates of depreciation on plant and equipment, which will considerably assist the many manufacturing companies and businesses in the industrial areas of my electorate. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that a number of areas in my electorate represent the industrial heartland of southern Brisbane. I have the suburbs of Rocklea, Oxley, Archerfield, Coopers Plains and Moorooka, where most of the industry in southern Brisbane is located. Many thousands of residents in my electorate are employed in industries based in those suburbs, and every one of them will benefit from the accelerated rates of depreciation and the other tax measures that have been included in this statement. Since the release of the One Nation statement, I have had some opportunities to speak with managers and other staff in these companies. Without exception they have expressed their very strong support for the measures that have been contained in the One Nation statement because of the assistance that they will provide for industries to reequip and have some opportunities to expand in their production and, therefore, their employment. I am pleased that they will take up the opportunities offered in the One Nation statement to do just that. I think that is a very important element of the One Nation statement which contrasts most definitely with the Opposition's Fightback package; that is, that we have some very real and important measures in the One Nation statement that create real jobs. We do not just make judgments that maybe somewhere down the track jobs can be created; we are actually creating real jobs with real projects and with real measures that will benefit industry, business and commerce and the whole nation with expanded infrastructure projects. As the One Nation statement says, over the next four years there will be 800,000 additional jobs created. This is not just with the expansion of infrastructure projects, but also with the expansion of business and industry throughout the country, with the new measures that we have undertaken in both depreciation of plant and equipment and other tax measures. I am very pleased to be able to support the One Nation statement and to indicate that it has been received very well the constituents of my electorate. They are very pleased with the measures contained in this statement. I might add that there are a number of measures in the statement which will also significantly expand the training and apprenticeship opportunities for the young people who live in my electorate. There is some concern within the community-a concern that I share-about the high levels of youth unemployment. I think it is very important that we take the opportunity now provided to us to expand the training and employment opportunities of youth. I am delighted that the One Nation statement contains a comprehensive boost to TAFE. I think it is in the TAFE area that we have had a real problem with unmet demand in our tertiary education and higher education sector. In Queensland there has been quite a considerable campaign mounted about the number of young people who have been unable to get into universities. What they have ignored is the massive expansion in' tertiary places that has occurred in the last nine years under this Government and the fact that this Federal Government has funded a considerable number of additional places for Queenslanders to go into universities and places of higher education. The area where' we have a great deal of unmet demand is in the TAFE sector. Most the unmet demand is from students who not believe that TAPE will really address their needs. I think that indicates that we need considerably expand our funding of and provide some improved facilities and services so that they are able to access courses that are relevant and will be table to the employers in this country. That why I think it is very important that the Federal Government has grasped this issue very strongly and has put forward in the One Nation statement a considerable funding boost to TAPE which will enable it to address some of that unmet demand for training places and provide some real training and, therefore, future employment opportunities for our young people. I am delighted to support the One Nation by statement, not just for the benefits that flow to my electorate but also for the benefits that I know flow to the whole conununity in Australia. I believe that it provides a very strong contrast to the Opposition's package and that the people of Australia will very clearly identify the sharp contrast between the ideological dreams of the Opposition, which contain no real substance, and the very real and positive benefits that will flow to Australia and all Australians from the measures it contains. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Vietnam Veterans Job Link Program",156
435,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I am speaking this evening on behalf of the Vietnam veterans job link program, an organisation in Western Australia which provides very important assistance to those ex-members of the defence forces who require assistance in gaining employment either immediately after leaving the service of the defence forces or later as they have left one particular job and moved' back into the marketplace. The VVJLP was originally created to meet the needs of former Vietnam veterans re-entering the civilian work force after career disruptions due to military service of obligations. It became obvious in the short do term that this exclusive employment placement service should be rightly expanded to to embrace all former Defence Force personTAFE nel and their direct dependants. Over the past two years, the Vietnam good veterans job link program has received a accepfunding allocation from the Western is Australian Department of Employment and Training, or DET, through its employment equity program. The actual cost of operating the service exceeded funds allocated by DET. This continued uncertainty in relation to future funding and support resulted in a lapse in job placement activity in early 1991. The organisation undertook a review which led to a total reorganisation of the committee and program functions. This program restructure resulted in a client base increase from 74 to 136 and the placement of 34 clients in permanent full time employment and 43 in casual temporary employment between 13 May and 24 September 1991. The aim of the organisation is to place former Defence Force personnel and their direct dependants in employment. The target group for their services are all former Defence Force personnel and their direct dependants, including former defence personnel from allied nations who need job placement assistance. The organisational structure is quite simple. It operates from a location called Cypress Cottage. Personnel who are considered suitable are able to use that particular facility for recreation or to take the opportunity to collect their thoughts or plan how to restructure their lives. The total funding required for the effective operation of the project is $84,518. To date it has received $50,000 from the Department of Employment and Training, as I have mentioned, leaving a shortfall of $34,518, which is required to ensure the continued operation and success of the program. Given the target group being serviced, it is the belief of the Vietnam Veterans job link program that the responsibility of funding the project should be shared between both the State and the Federal governments. The program has recently upgraded its accounts and records procedures and is therefore well placed to provide the respective funding bodies with regular financial and activity reports as required. Procedures have also been established to review the strategic plan on a quarterly basis, therefore ensuring the ongoing effective service provisions of the target group. Over the past months the Vietnam veterans job link program has undergone a very stringent review and restructure, resulting in a dramatic increase in services being provided and outcomes being achieved. With a pending reduction in Defence Force personnel and the inception of the Ready Reserve scheme with its short term enlistment, the need for such a service becomes even more paramount. To realise its potential and to continue to place unemployed Vietnam veterans and former Defence Force personnel in employment and training, the project requires ongoing financial support from both State and Federal governments, which leaves, as I said, a shortfall of just under $35,000. In conclusion, I would like to list some of the services available through the Vietnam veterans job link program: canvassing business and employers for potential job placement; arranging work placement; increasing former, Defence Force members' awareness of the job market through the development of vocational and job search skills; advice in personal presentation skills; assistance with resume preparation, job applications and interview techniques; information on the areas of employment, training, education, welfare and enterprise; information on accreditation of service skills; typing of resumes and letters; post-interview assistance; and information on the job market prior to discharge. In conclusion, I would like to add my personal representation on behalf of the Vietnam veterans job link program so that it may receive assistance from the Defence Department for that valuable funding to be able to fulfil its total service to those Vietnam veterans and other Defence Force personnel who are, in fact, using its services. Legal Profession",159
436,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"Denison) (10.30 p.m.)Tonight I want to reflect on some debate that has become much more current over recent years about the future trends in the legal profession. In particular, I want to be positive about those elements in the legal profession that are quite courageously looking at the possibility of substantial reform, opening up the profession and dealing with some of the residual areas of anti-competitive behaviour which has been inherent in the profession over the years. I guess the recent debate has been sparked most dramatically by a report of the Victorian Law Reform Commission in which it has proposed very substantial changes to the role of the traditional profession in Victoria. There are a number of areas which have attracted criticism by those concerned by competition issues: the division between the Bar and solicitors and, in particular, one aspect of that, the two-counsel rule, which means that Queen's Counsel have traditionally been obliged to appear with a junior paid at two-thirds the rate of the senior; the separation of the profession into different State entities, so that it is difficult for a professional to obtain reciprocal recognition between different States, which has prevented the development of an all-Australian profession; and the question of advertising, where the profession has traditionally resisted what ordinarily would have been seen to be a pro-competitive approach by barring advertising. In that regard the profession is often criticised for establishing what are broadly 1981 Rules 5, 6, 7, 10 and 15 PART I - SCALE OF CHARGES FOR I Consideration Not exceeding $200 Exceeding $200 and not exceeding $1,000 Exceeding $1,000 and not exceeding $2,000 Exceeding $2,000 and not exceeding $4,000 Exceeding $4,000 and not exceeding $6,000 Exceeding $6,000 and not exceeding $8,000 Exceeding $8,000 and not exceeding $10,000 Exceeding $10,000 and not exceeding $12,000 Exceeding $12,000 and not exceeding $14,000 Exceeding $14,000 and not exceeding $16,000 Exceeding $16,000 and not exceeding $18,000 Exceeding $18,000 and not exceeding $20,000 Exceeding $20,000 and not exceeding $22,000 Exceeding $22,000 and not exceeding $24,000 Exceeding $24,000 and not exceeding $26,000 Exceeding $26,000 and not exceeding $28,000 Exceeding $28,000 and not exceeding $30,000 Exceeding $30,000 and not exceeding $32,000 Exceeding $32,000 and not exceeding $34,000 Exceeding $34,000 and not exceeding $36,000 Exceeding $36,000 and not exceeding $38,000 Exceeding $38,000 and not exceeding $40,000 Exceeding $40,000 and not exceeding $42,000 regarded as minimum price fixing arrangements through the promulgation of scales of fees.

438,Mr KERR,WILSON DOWD,"One of the interesting things in terms of both the scale of fees that is demonstrated and the survey that was conducted is that there is a very competitive market indeed in lawyers' services, notwithstanding the minimum price that is established under the scale of fees that is promulgated. Interestingly, approximately just under one-half of the practices surveyed showed that they were charging less than scale fees. I regard that and the other information contained in that survey as very refreshing.

Obviously has its own circumstances and peculiarities which positive light, although a number within the profession will no doubt resent the fact that they are exposed through surveys of that kind to examination by the public. I believe it is very much in the profession's interest to welcome an examination of its operations and to move towards a situation in which its members are prepared to advertise. It does not seem to me to be correct that the profession is, in a sense, still regarding itself as being in the gentleman's club environment of the 1800s when the rest of the professions have had to face up to very competitive pressures in the marketplace and to adopt very procompetitive approaches. Indeed, I would very much like the law societies to abolish the establishment of scales of fees and to pennit advertising. That is a very live issue that, as I indicated, has been raised by the Victorian Law Refonn Commission. There is very good theoretical justification for concluding that advertising would reduce the cost of producing legal services. For example, I cite an article by Muris and MCChesney in the American Bar Foundation Research Journal, Winter 1979, at pages 179 to 207. I commend to the attention of the House the table I have had incorporated in Hansard. (TIme expired) Department of Veterans' Affairs",165
439,Mr MACKELLAR,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"I wish to raise the matter of a constituent of mine tonight. It relates to the actions of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Having been in the chair, I did not have the chance to contact the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) before I raised this matter tonight, and I apologise for that. I was written to by my constituent's doctor. He says: I am writing to ask if you will intervene on behalf of my constituent, date of birth 17.8.1904, with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. His local orthopaedic surgeon has decided that he should have a spinal myelogram. He goes on to discuss the question of this spinal myelogram. He then says: It seems incredible to me that Concord should insist thatmy constituentaged 87, almost totally bedridden due to spinal pain, controlled temporarily by pethidine injections, should be forced to travel the distance from Manly to Concord and back for any medical reason. His wife is about 80 and herself too frail to accompany him. My constituent: suffered four years in the infamous Changi camp. It seems to me time that he was allowed the privilege of being treated locally. I hope you can persuade the Department of Veterans' Affairs to permit this. I tried to persuade the Department of Veterans' Affairs to permit the action that was requested by my constituent's doctor.",166
440,Mr COBB,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,What was its reply?,166
441,Mr MACKELLAR,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"The reply I got said: Treatment outside RGHs will be approved only in special circumstances, such as where the necessary treatment cannot be provided at the RGH or in an emergency which results in admission to the nearest suitable facility. Excepting emergency, admission must be arranged with the prior approval of my Department. In the case of emergency, approval must be sought as soon as possible afterwards. I am surethe Department tells me---':' you will appreciate that circumstances vary for each patient and a decision on each case must therefore be considered on its merits. However, in giving approval to being treated outside of departmental facilities, factors such as the medical and social condition of the patient, the clinical urgency of the proposed treatment, access to the RGH and the resulting waiting time are all taken into account. My constituent is 87 years of age, he is a Changi veteran, his wife is 80 years of age and too frail to travel. Yet the Department, having considered this case, has said to me that no special circumstances apply. I understand the basis for the general policy. But if we get to a situation in this country in which the specific circumstances of an individual like this man-an 87-year-old veteran suffering constant pain, with an 80year-old wife-cannot be treated on those merits, bureaucracy has gone mad. I believe the Minister, who I know to be a compassionate man, should intervene personally in this matter. I expect him to do so. I am quite prepared to make the name of my constituent available to the Minister; in fact, I have already made it available to the Department. Given the sacrifice of people such as my constituent, if the Minister does not intervene on behalf of this veteran of 87 years of age who is in constant pain and seeking to be treated locally, I can only say that the administration of this Government of the people who have defended the country in the most difficult circumstances availableand we can think of no more difficult circumstances than being an inmate of the Changi system during the Second World War-is in more than a sad state. It is a vicious indictment of the approach of this Government towards the very real and personal problems of veterans who, in the latter stages of their life, surely deserve better treatment than this bureaucratic approach which has been demonstrated in this instance.

443,Mr RIG GALL,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"MCMillan) (10.41 p.m.)Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of the House a very - d case of a woman who lives in my electorate. I will call her Lorraine. Lorraine is an invalid pensioner. She has two children, aged 14 and 16, both going to school. She is a very compassionate person and has another child who is boarding with her. The child is there because she needs Lorraine's help. Lorraine is not a particularly well woman. I will read a letter that I received from Lorraine's doctor. The opening paragraph states: This unfortunate lady suffers from severe, recurrent, resistant complex partial epilepsy. She has seizures almost daily, and, in spite of treatment, the seizures are not completely controllable. This is a tragic situation. This lady really needs compassion from the Victorian State Government. The Victorian Government has a very good program called the multi-purpose taxi program to help these people get medical treatment, which is needed about four times a year. I think this program has a lot going for it. I wrote to the Minister concerned and Lorraine was given approval to go on the program. We were very pleased about that, until we found out about the sting in the tail. First of all, she was given a card stamped 'Approved'. Despite all the publicity and advertising brochures about the program, she received a letter which said that people using this taxi system would have to pay 50 per cent. In this case, the cost of the taxi from Moe to the doctor in Melbourne would cost $150 each way-$300.",167
444,Mr COBB,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,Each time?,167
445,Mr RIGGALL,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"Yes, each time and she has to go four times a year. The program offers 50 per cent to a maximum of $30. We find that the Victorian Government has now introduced the program, which in principle is terrific, but it is city based and city oriented. It enables those people who live in the inner city to get to doctors close by. Once again, country people are being disadvantaged by a government which claims it is caring, but it is only caring for people in the city electorates and the country people are disregarded because they are not strong Labor voters. When one of my staff members rang the director of the multi-purpose taxi program, Mr Robert Stonem, and suggested that it was a city based program, he got upset. He seemed to think it was reasonable for someone on an invalid pension to come up with $270 four or five times a year for a trip to Melbourne. Yet, quite clearly, this woman needs medical help from a specialist which her local doctor has asked her to get. I say to the Victorian State Government and particularly to the Minister concerned, Mr Spyker, - Stop playing funny games without money. If you are genuinely compassionate, have a look at this program and, for God's sake, have some compassion for people like Lorraine who desperately need help. They are good people and are doing their bit to raise a family and are working as volunteers under difficult circumstances'. They need this help on a fair basis. Seamen's Union",167
446,Mr CAMPBELL,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"I have here the traditional brown paper bag which is beloved of Queensland and other places. In it we have fake money. I will just read what it says, 'Vote Labor for the light on the hill, not Dr Hewson and the Boys from Brazil'. That rather got to me. This money is an initiative of the Seamen's Union of Australia. I think the union is to be congratulated because its members have seen fit to take this initiative in order to alert people of Australia to just what the consumption tax will do to their dollar. The consumption tax will, of course, reduce a $5 bill to about $4.25-unless one happens to be very rich. I was reading the claim the other day that some people will save $5,000 a year on the GST. This is quite possible. All one has to do is to buy a Mercedes Benz. If one buys a Mercedes Benz and lives on dog food, one saves even more. I want to talk about the Seamen's Union because I think it has come in for a lot of unfair criticism from The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who is still living in the past. The reality today is that the manning rate on Australian ships is comparable to that in any OECD country, while Australian maritime wages are in the lower sector of OECD wages. We are much cheaper than most OECD countries, but this is not generally recognised. In the past, there was a higher manning rate but this was partly due to inefficiencies that occurred through having outdated ships. With the modem ships it is a different story altogether. I think BHP would acknowledge that it is probably making more money out of its iron ore tankers manned by Australian crews going to Japan than Japanese manned tankers. It is also important because Australia is a maritime nation. As Kep Enderby once observed, we are surrounded by sea. That is one of his more profound statements, but it is true. Australia desperately needs a maritime service of its own. This is one of the areas where we can make our quickest and best current account savings. If Australia is to carry a greater percentage of its produce in its own ships, we would be making substantial savings. We would be making even greater savings if we were to build the ships here. I have been talking to a fellow from Sweden. This particular gentleman set up the computerised ship building industry in Germany and has now moved to Australia. He says that Australia is, in his view, the best place in the world to build large ships for the reason that the we have a very good skill base and that the quality of our tradesmen is second to none in the world. I might add that this is a Swedish view, not an Australian view. He also says that we have the best weather in the world for building ships but what is lacking in Australia is management-which has been appallingand infrastructure. He said that, given the right infrastructure and proper management, he believes that Australia can competitively build ships. What a great thing it would. be for Australia if we could establish a viable shipbuilding industry-build our own ships and carry Australian produce in them. Think of the employment and the wealth it would create for Australia in terms of current account savings. There is another thing that ought to be considered. Australia is competitive with the OECD countries, but we should not expect our seamen to compete with a rust bucket and a rice bowl. It is irresponsible to expect that. I believe that these ships create a real danger for Australia. A ship in Western Australia broke its bow and spewed oil into the Indian Ocean. In my view that ship was heading for the rocks. If it was not, it certainly had no business to be where it was. Foreign owners were prepared to risk our environment for the sake of the money that they were going to get from that operation. I believe that if we had our own ships we could have much better environmental control of our coasts than exists at the moment and we could take very strong action against anybody who threatened that environment. If this imposes any cost, it is a cost that can certainly be absorbed in the confidence, the safety and the environmental security it would give us. Health Insurance CommissionAustralian National Line",168
447,Mr MILES,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"I am glad to follow the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and some of the comments he has made, because I also want to talk about some maritime matters. The first matter I draw to the attention of the House is an incident where a person on a ship crossing Bass Strait required medical attention. I understand that she received attention which cost $44, but that the Health Insurance Commission has refused to give the 85 per cent rebate. The Commission has deemed that the service was not provided within Australia because the person was on a ship between Tasmania and Victoria. This is quite an incredible situation. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) talks about ridiculous decisions being made by the bureaucrats in Australia, and here we have an instance of somebody who has lived in Australia all her life and who, while crossing Bass Strait on a ship travelling, I think, from Sydney to Hobart, was given a service by a doctor for $44, yet when she makes a claim from the Health Insurance Commission, is told that it is unacceptable because she was outside Australia-she was overseas. It is an incredible situation when bureaucrats can make that sort of decision. It is ludicrous that somebody can be travelling between two of our States and yet be regarded as being overseas and not eligible for Health Insurance Commission benefits. I wonder what the situation is for the people travelling on the Abel Tasman between Melbourne and Devonport. Once they get out the 12 nautical miles, are they therefore not eligible under Health Insurance Commission rules to receive any benefits from Medicare? The second matter I wish to raise relates particularly to ships and concerns the Searoad Tamar. I support the honourable member for Kalgoorlie when he says that we ought to be able to have a good shipbuilding industry in Australia. Sea road Tamar can carry up to 190 containers across Bass Strait. At the moment this ship, which is run by ANL, built in the last two or three years in Newcastle, is going backwards and forwards across the strait with 60 of these containers on the top deck filled with sand. It looks as though there is a roaring trade across Bass Strait, because this ship always comes in with these containers on the top deck, but 60 of them are filled with sand. One might ask a few questions about this. Why on earth is this the case? The situation is that ANL has a ship going across Bass Strait without any cargo. One might say, 'Why don't they take these containers off and just go backwards and forwards with the few containers which they have been able to get and which they are getting paid for?'. The situation is that this ship is so poorly designed that unless it is fully loaded with 60 containers on the top deck it does not handle the sea conditions very well.",169
448,Mr COBB,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,Where was it built?,169
449,Mr MILES,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"In Australia, unfortunately, at Newcastle. Surely Australia is able to design better ships than we have at the moment. This ship has to carry containers full of sand to keep it upright, and to stop it from rolling too much, going through Bass Strait. Australia has a lot to learn in this area. I only wish we could do what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was suggesting. Here is a situation which is absolutely disgraceful. It should be investigated to find out why a ship could be built which has to have up to 60 containers - ull of sand to keep it balanced properly to go across Bass Strait. Tertiary Education",169
450,Mr LES SCOTT,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"Oxley) (10.56 p.m.)Something that many people these days take for granted-although I notice in the media tonight that some people are certainly not taking it for granted-is education. I notice that many students around Australia are protesting about certain concerns in the education area. Those students ought to be looking at some of the problems they would face should those opposite ever have the opportunity to grace the government benches again. We have seen just what the Opposition's Fightback package would mean to education in this country, particularly tertiary education. When I grew up as a young man, very few young people had the opportunity to go on to university and obtain the qualifications that would have made this country a greater country than it is today. It concerns me that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) is running around now trying to pursue a rather draconian attitude towards education, particularly tertiary education. The reception he received at the Queensland University in the last couple of weeks when he went there would have been an indication of the concern amongst students. It is good to see the young people in the nation in that context being prepared to stand up and be counted and to express their grave concern. There is little doubt that, whilst some students have expressed their concerns about HECS and what have you, HECS does provide the opportunity for a tertiary education for all people, no matter what their financial backgrounds. There is little doubt that the Opposition's Fightback package would deny the great majority of Australians-young Australians particularly-the opportunity to have a tertiary education. Mr Beale-You don't believe that absolute rubbish. Have you read Fightback! ?",170
451,Mr LES SCOTT,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"I certainly do believe that. The honourable member wants to believe it, too, because his blokes on tlle back bench believe it. Mr Beale-You couldn't read the first paragraph, let alone 700 pages.",170
452,Mr SPEAKER,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,Order! The honourable member for Bruce will cease interjecting.,170
453,Mr LES SCOTT,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,I am pleased the honourable member is biting on this one.,170
454,Mr SPEAKER,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,Order! The honourable member for Bruce.,170
455,Mr LES SCOTT,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. There is little doubt that if Opposition members ever had the opportunity to put in place their draconian attitudes they would create the positions in the universities that they want. There would be many vacancies because only the rich would be able to afford to go thereback to those bad old days. There has been a great commitment from this Labor Government, particularly since 1983, to assist our young people in the education areas. When we talk about where it may cost students up to $2,000 in HECS every year, we are talking about between $25,000 and $130,000 for a single degree under the Opposition's Fightback package. Which working class people in this country are going to be able to afford such draconian proposals as those that the Opposition puts forward? It is a negative thing. It is a deliberate attack on the young people of this country and it should be rejected for what it is. Honourable members opposite should find a bit of backbone amongst themselves and start telling the leaders within their own parties that it i- not on; that it is a ridiculous thing to attack our education system when Australia has the opportunity to be the clever country that we justly deserve to be-and we are. We have a very capable population. We can see from some of the reports that have been put forward in this Parliament in the last couple of days that the future of Australia lies in a well-educated population. That is something that this Government is committed to. I am very proud to be associated with a Government that has such a strong commitment to education. I for one will encourage students throughout this country to protest, not so much against some of the things that have been raised tonight, but against the attitudes that the honourable member for Goldstein is putting forward, because it will deny them and their children an education that they justly deserve. I encourage Opposition backbenchers to stand up and think about their own children for a start, and their children, so that we do not return to a situation where once again the tertiary education system is available only to the rich.",170

458,Mr HUMPHREYS,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"It is important that I respond to the request from the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) in relation to Mr Bert Thomas, who is from his electorate. The honourable member for Warringah has been a friend of mine for quite a while in this House, but it is important that I point out to him that there was a debate in relation to persons such as the constituent he has named here tonight being allowed to be treated in their own electorate by way of the integration of repatriation hospitals into the State system. I draw the honourable member's attention to Hansard of Tuesday, 12 November 1991, in which there appears a vote in relation to giving people such as the person he was talking about tonight, and a lot of other veterans in the community, the opportunity to be treated where they live and to be part of their own system in their own community, and also the opportunity to go to a repatriation hospital. Tonight his colleagues voted against the private patient scheme. Mr Martin-What about the honourable member for Warringah?",171

464,Mr HUMPHREYS,CHARGES IN THE DENISON ELECTORATE,"I think his name is down here as voting against the private patient scheme. We will also draw that vote to the attention of the honourable member for Warringah. I ask the honourable member for Warringah to read Hansard of 12 November 1991 and to make sure that next time we have a vote in this House-because I am sure it is coming back to the House-he votes for the private patient scheme so that those veterans will have the freedom of choice to be treated where they are. When the Commonwealth is running a repatriation hospital, it is responsible for filling the beds in it. The Concord Hospital is supposed to have 20 per cent community patients and 80 per cent veteran patients, but it has 40 per cent community patients and 60 per cent veterans, because the majority of the veterans are choosing to be treated where they live and to be part of their own system. The sooner the Opposition wakes up to this fact and gives the veterans the freedom of choice, the better off the veteran community will be. lt is quite wrong for the honourable member to come into this chamber and accuse bureaucrats of doing the wrong thing, because the bureaucrats have been trying for years to do the right thing as far as hospital integration is concerned. The Opposition's Liberal and National Party colleagues in the New South Wales Government know what is best for the veterans' community, and they support hospital integration. Hopefully. sanity will prevail here soon and the honourable member for Warringah's constituent will be able to be treated where he lives.

465,Mr WILLIS,PAPERS,"The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Subsidised housing loans are only available as part of the employment package where officers of the APS are relocated on compulsory transfer. Compulsory transfers take place where part or all of a department or agency is moved to a new locality following a Government decision. My Department is responsible for developing compulsory transfer policy but the subsidised housing loans are provided by individual agencies. Information on the number of staff eligible to receive subsidised housing loans is not collected centrally; there not been a high level of compulsory transfers in recent years. (b) The rate of subsidised interest is determined on a case by case basis having regard to the circumstances of the particular transfer. (c) and (d) As individual agencies provide the loans and information is not collected centrally, detailed answers to these parts of the question are not available.

International Organisations: Membership (Question No. 1318) Mr Langmort- asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 26 February 1992: Why did Australia withdraw from the (a) Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries and (b) International Bauxite Association.",173
466,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia's withdrawal from the Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) in 1986 followed a review which found, in essence, that the costs of our membership (A$217,OOO that year) far exceeded the benefits. Australia produces only a small volume of copper (around 3% of world production) and thus our ability to influence the market and/or the organisation was limited. Moreover, the cost of membership of CIPEC was increasing disproportionately in relation to the benefits. Given this, the fact that there were no foreign relations considerations which would justify our continued participation despite the costs, Austmlia withdrew its membership. Contacts with other copper producing countries have, however, been maintained through our aid and other policies. The decision in respect of Australia's withdrawal from the International Bauxite Association (IBA) was also based on cost/benefit considerations. In 1991, a review conducted by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade, concluded that membership of the IBA was not cost-effective-the costs of membership far outweighed the benefits; the organisation comprised producer members only and thus consumer views were not adequately represented; there were no compelling foreign policy considerations which would justify continued participation; and industry did not support continued membership. In reaching this conclusion, it was noted that notwithstanding budget cuts in 1986-88 (largely initiated by Australia), the IBA budget had increased 21 per cent in 1989-91 in US dollar terms, resulting in a 50% increase in Australia's contributions to A$388,OOO. I therefore wrote to other IBA member governments in September 1991 advising that Australia had decided to withdraw from the Association. In accordance with the rules of the Association, this will take effect from October 1992. Australia is the world's largest bauxite and alumina producer and the fourth largest aluminium producer. The industry is an important source of employment and export income. Accordingly, in publicly announcing the decision on 12 November 1991, I noted our continuing interest in developments in this industry and said that Australia remains willing to consider, with other countries, cost-effective ways of ensuring continued cooperation and information exchange. Australian officials are actively participating in the search for ways to continue dialogue on the bauxite/alumina! aluminium industry. International Labour Organisation (Question No. 1327) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing and the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 26 February 1992: (1) Which states attended the 11th ILO Asian Regional Conference held in Bangkok from 26 November to 2 December 1991. (2) Which states referred to in part (1) have ratified any of the six ILO Freedom of Association Conventions and which Convention has each state ratified.",174
467,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) A total of twenty-nine member States and two non-metropolitan territories were represented at the 11th ILO Asian Regional Conference. The table indicates which States attended and the position of each (as at March 1992) concerning ratification of the 6 ILO Freedom of Association Conventions.

468,Dr BLEWETT,X X X,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the Social Security Act sickness allowance is not paid to full-time students. Income support students is available under the AUSTUDY program. (a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training pays AUSTUDY to eligible full-time students subject to an income and assets test. AUSTUDY can be paid during periods of shortterm illness or injury as long as the student remains enrolled full-time. The illness/injury provIsiOns allow payment to continue for up to sixteen weeks in a year in the case of tertiary students or at the school's discretion in the case of secondary students. For self employed or part-time employed students ineligible for AUSTUDY because of the AUSTUif DY income test, loss of earnings due to illness would qualify them for sickness allowance only if they ceased full-time study. (b) The Social Security Act 1991 provides the legislative basis for the payment of Sickness Allowance. The Student Assistance Act 1973 is the legislative basis for AUSTUDY. (c) No. Full-time students can be eligible for AUSTUDY, including during periods of short-term illness or injury. Payment of sickness allowance to full-time students who are not eligible for AUSTUDY because their income is over the allowfor able AUSTUDY income test level would circumvent the AUSTUDY income test. This test is designed to direct income support to those students most in need. If a student ceases full-time studies because of an illness, he or she can be paid sickness allowance, subject to the usual income and assets tests. (d) See (a) above.",176
