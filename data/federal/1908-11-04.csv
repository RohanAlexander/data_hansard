1,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Defence aware that, although a fullday's parade of the Tasmanian cadets has been ordered for the 9th inst., the hats needed by the boys and promised by the Minister have not yet arrived? . Mr EWING - Upon the honourable member drawing my attention to a similar matter some months ago, I gave instructions that no incident of the kind should happen again, and was informed that action had been taken which would remove such a probability. I promise the honourable member that I shall get into communication with the authorities at once, and that, if the incident is repeated, something will happen. PATENT MEDICINES.",11
2,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIs he in a position to state what the Government purposes doing with reference to the matter of the importation of patent medicines? .",11
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Cabinet, afterconsidering the question, has thought it best to re-introduce its Bill formerly before the House. This measure will enable us, within the limitations of the Constitution, to deal with the importation of medicines into Australia; but, unless our legislation is supplemented by similar State - legislation, its provisions can be easily evaded. Having consulted the Attorney-General, I find that it is not competent for us to do more. DEFENCE. EXISTING TRAINED MILITARY RESERVENAVAL AND MILITARY EXPENDITURERIFLES AND MORRIS TUBES-STA Y OF IMPERIAL WAR VESSELS IN MELBQURNE.",11
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether he will ask the Military Board how many men under fifty years of age there are in Australia who, though not serving in the forces at present, have nevertheless passed through the volunteers or militia ranks, and have therefore had military training, and are practically a valuable trained reserve in times of emergency?",12
5,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Wit h the object of forming a reserve of those who had passed through the Citizen Forces, . I instructed the Military Board early this year to consider ancl submit a scheme. Regulations for the formation of a Reserve Forces List were published in Gazette of 19th September, 1908-Statutor y Rule 1908/102-and the formation of such a reserve is being carried out. Had records been kept, as will be done in the future, there would be a possibility of obtaining the information with something approaching accuracy, but there are no records. It is difficult to suggest, in the absence of them, bow information could be obtained, which would be of any value, more especially when the following details are required :1. Lists of al] who have served for any period during the last thirty years. 2. Length of such service. 3. Efficiency attained during service by each individual. 4. Information as to existence, or presence in Australia of each individual. 5. Present state of physical fitness for service of each individual. I will consider the matter, and if it be possible to devise any scheme or procedure by which even approximate figures can be arrived at, I will inform the right honourable member.",12
6,Mr REID,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon noticeReferring to question No. 8 of 27th ultimo, as follows:-""What was the amount of the actual expenditure (exclusive of ' special defence material ' and ' new special defence provision') on account of the Military and Naval Defence of the Commonwealth for the year 1906-7 and the year 1907-8. Also, his estimate for the first year's expenditure under the new system, including 'special defence material' and 'new special defence provision.' In both cases excluding the payment under the Naval subsidy payable to the Imperial Treasury""1. Does he observe that the return he has furnished in reply thereto does not comply with the terms of the request? 2. Does he observe that the amount of ^250,000 put to Trust Account, which is still subject to the decision of the House, is included under the head of ""actual expenditure"" for 1907-8? 3. Has he any objection now to furnish the information as asked for. 4. Would he kindly direct the total for each year to be given?",12
7,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answers to the right honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The return already furnished contains all the items of expenditure. The comparison being between actual expenditure, not appropriation, and an estimate of probable appropriation, embracing both Naval and Military Services (initial cost and upkeep) which cannot become an actual expenditure for two or may be three years, it was thought that the details from which the total was derived would be acceptable. The totals asked for by the right honourable member are as follow :Actual Estimated Expenditure Expenditurein first year - of the new scheme, pro1906-7. 1907-8. bably 1010-11. Naval and Military Forces, excluding special defence material and new special £764,52+ defence provision .. £675,627 £740,555 Naval and Military Forces, including special defence material and new special defence provision £335,615 £1,134,5C6* £1,514,591t * Includes new naval expenditure, £250,000. t Includes new naval expenditure, £357,070. 2. Yes. This was voted at the close of the year, and is now available for expenditure. 3 and 4. See reply to r.",12
8,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. When was the new short rifle first distributed to Light Horse Corps in Victoria? 2. In reference to the supply of Morris tubes and the Minister's statement on 3rd instant, has not his Department ordered the return of the long rifle? 3. If the long rifle is returned, of what use is the retention by corps of the Morris tube for that rifle? 4. How many Morris tubes for the new short rifle have been received to date? 5. How many Victorian corps will now have to use short rifles and long rifle Morris tubes?",12
9,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's, questions are as follow :1. In 1905. This was the early pattern of the short rifle (Mark I . ) . The inquiry of the honourable member, which was answered yesterday, was taken to refer to the Mark III . short M.L.E . rifle, which is the latest pattern. 2. Yes, but not those required for use with Morris aiming tubes. 3. As indicated in 2 the Monis aiming tubes retained will be used with long M . L . E . rifles. 4. Sixty aiming tubes .22 in., not Morris tubes. 5. For the present all corps will use Morris aiming tubes with long M . L . E . rifles for miniature range practice - tions."" It may be mentioned that there appears to be some likelihood of aiming tubes being superseded in the British service by a special miniature rifle, and it is not intended to order any more tubes for the Commonwealth Military Forces until the result of inquiries, which the officer in charge of the Commonwealth Offices in London has been asked to make, is known.",12
10,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn reference to promise made in the House in October, 1905 (Hansard, p. 4047), that a vessel of the Imperial Squadron would spend six months yearly at Melbourne'(1) Has this been carried out since? (2) Will he obtain a return showing the number of days spent by each of the subsidized vessels during 1905, 1906, and 1907 at Melbourne? \$) Is there any reason why Melbourne is so rarely visited by these vessels?",13
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The statement made by the then Naval Commander-in-Chief was to the effect that no definite rule could be laid - down, but that the principal ports of Australia would be visited as often as possible, and that the Katoomba was at that time spending about six months of each year in Hobson's Bay. There have been follow :frequent visits since, but so far as I am aware they have not totalled six months. States There are, I believe, three vessels of war, the Powerful, the Challenger, and the count-represen Pegasus, in the Bay at the present moment. NEW WORKS AND BUILDINGS, AND REPAIRS.",13
12,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice What is the arrangement, including cost of preparation of plans and specifications with supervision, between the Federal and State Governments in the erection and construction of mew works and buildings, including repairs and alterations ?",13
13,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :In accordance with the resolutions of a Conference of representatives of the Commonwealth and States, afterwards ratified by the respective - Governments concerned, for such services as they render the State Works Departments are recouped as follows :Six per cent, on new works and buildings costing over ^100, plus expenses of clerks of works, as prescribed in the "" Commonwealth Public Works RegulaOn new works and buildings costing less than ^100-1 0 per cent, in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, and 8 per cent, in Tasmania.

OLD-AGE PENSIONS TRUST ACCOUNT.",13
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether the following statement appearing in the Age on Tuesday is correct :"" His quarterly statement of accounts issued on Saturday shows that, down to' the end of September, the Federal Old-age Pensions Trust Account had £331,354 to its credit. Of this sum Victoria has contributed ,£162,588""? 2. If the statement is correct, how is it that Victoria, with less than 30 per cent, of the population of the Commonwealth, has paid into the Trust Account nearly 50 per cent, of the total?",13
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's' questions are as 1 and 2. The amounts shown under the various in the Treasurer's quarterly statement, as balances in Trust Fund-Old-ag e Pensions Act the cash which happens to be, for Treasury purposes, in such States. They have no relation to the expenditure, which is charged on a population basis. ASSISTANTS, STORES BRANCH, SOUTH MELBOURNE.",13
16,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Were four men (or how many) requisitioned for recently as necessary assistants in the carpenters' shop, Stores Branch, at South Melbourne ? 2. Have only two been appointed ? 3. How many passed as the result of the examination for the position? 4. How many temporary men are employed, and how long have temporary men been employed ? 5. Why are temporary men employed if permanent men who have passed the necessary examinations are available ?",13
17,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furnished the following replies to the honourable member's questions :1. Two carpenters were requisitioned for . 2. Two were appointed. 3. Five men passed the practical test. 4. Four temporary men were employed up to 31st October last. There are now three men on duty. Temporary men have been employed for a number of years intermittently, in accordance with the requirements of the Department. 5. It is not considered advisable to increase the permanent staff at present, as the work fluctuates considerably. VOTING MACHINES' .",14
18,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeWith reference to the reply to a question, asked on the 5th September of last year [Hansard, p. 2890)-Hav e the arrangements with regard to voting machines, which were then stated to be "" in course of progress,"" been completed, or in any way advanced?",14
19,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :Yes. Ten voting machines or models have been submitted' to, and examined by, the Committee appointed for this purpose, and advice has been received that twelve additional machines or models are in course of construction. It is anticipated that the Committee will be in a position to furnish a comprehensive report early in the next year on the whole of the machines submitted. NA COMMONWEALTH.

That the item, "" The President ^1,100,"" be agreed to.",14
20,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Corio) [2.41] - I hope that I shall be able to continue my remarksto-day in a calmer atmosphere than prevailed .last night. I regret that I was not permitted then to continue for a few minutes longer, since but for a reference ro the question of the transfer of the States debtsI had almost concluded my speech. I certainly hope that the debate will not bestarted anew today. I understand that the honourable member for Mernda claims that his scheme for the transfer of thedebts of the States would involve absolutely no loss to the States themselves, and. that they would simply continue to pay by way of interest on their debts the sameamount as they had done before. His proposal, as I understand it , is to return to the States a fixed sum of ,£6,500,000 per annum based upon the average returns for the three years 1902-5, and as the total amount of interest payable by the States is£8,700,000 per annum, there would thus be a difference of £2,200,000 per annum* which they would have to make good. The honourable member proposes that the payment of that amount shall extend over a period of twenty years, and that it shall be decreased to the extent of 5 per cent, annually. The honourable member urged that in this way the States, instead of suffering a loss, would gain to the extent of the5 per cent, cumulative reduction made each) year. I fail to see how it would be possible for the States in the first place to escape such a large liability as is represented' by their debts without paying anything. The amount returned to the States up tr> 30th June last averaged £ 7 , 7 7 5 , 0 0 0 , and SPIRITS. under the honourable member for Mernda'sscheme they would lose the difference beCONSUMPTION. tween that sum and the fixed amount of £6,500,000 which he proposes shall bereturned to them.",14
21,Mr DEAKIN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,They have been receiving a great deal more than three-fourths of theCustoms and Excise revenue.,14
22,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,That is so; but the fact remains that they would have to giveup a considerable sum.,14
23,Mr DEAKIN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,They have no claim upor> us over and above the three-fourths.,14
24,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Quite so; but the difference between the amount which the honourable member for Mernda proposes shall - be returned to them and that to which they .are entitled under the Braddon section presents several hundred of thousands of pounds. I find, further, that the Government proposal is to return only £6,000,000 per annum to the States, instead of £6,500,000, as proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, and that would result in their having to make good a difference of £2,700,000 in respect of their interest bill.",15
25,Mr DEAKIN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The honourable member for Mernda admitted that his calculation made no provision for old-age pensions, a Commonwealth scheme not having been agreed' to when he prepared it.",15
26,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If old-age pensions were payable throughout the Commonwealth, some of the States would be relieved of a considerable expenditure which they now incur in that respect. But, as it is, some of the smaller States where old age pensions schemes are not in .operation would have their revenue largely decreased under the Government - proposal, whilst they would secure no compensating advantage in the shape of relief from the expenappear diture on old-age pensions, such as would fall to the lot of the two most prosperous States of the union. As the total amount payable in respect of interest on the debts of the States is £8,700,000 per annum, it ought not to be said that the adoption of the honourable member for Mernda's scheme would involve no sacrifice to the States.",15
27,Mr DEAKIN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,But the States are now paying that amount by way of interest.,15
28,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"They are, but they are also receiving from the Commonwealth, under a statutory right, nearly £6,900,000 per annum, as against a return of only £6,000,000, which the Treasurer proposes to make to them. That means that they would have to make good a difference of about £900,000 per annum.",15
29,Mr DEAKIN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The honourable member is omitting the payments in respect of old age pensions.,15
30,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Unde r the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, that amount will have to be paid for twenty years, but under the Government scheme it will have to be paid for no less than thirty-five years. That being 90, I do not think that it can reasonably be said that the States are to receive something for nothing. Even if the Customs and Excise revenue remained as it is, the States, for the next thirty-five years, would re- have to make good a difference totalling between £32,000,000 and £33,000,000.",15
31,Mr STORRER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,It all comes out of one pocket.,15
32,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The honourable member's interjection is very pertinent to the point I was trying to make. If it all comes out of one pocket, the people of the States will eventually have to pay, through their taxation, the amount the Commonwealth has to pay, because they are the people of - the Commonwealth. It is therefore necessary to see what advantage is to be gained by all this shuffling and handing over of debts to one central authority. The only advantage that can be derived appears to be that the Commonwealth may borrow cheaper than the States can. But at the present time, seeing that Japan is not able to get rid of her war loans, which she offered at £ 9 0 at 6 per cent., and that Prussia is paying 5 per cent, on £ 9 2 for her money, while Canadian 3 per cents, since the financial crisis are no longer at par, there does not to be much prospect for some time to come of Australia obtaining money at 3 per cent. We appear to be taking upon ourselves as a Commonwealth a very large financial responsibility in the hope that we shall be able to get money at a cheaper rate than we are doing now. A good deal of the trouble has arisen through our trying to take over too much. Seeing that in any case the saving by the Commonwealth in interest must be almost entirely upon the loans held externally, and not upon those held in Australia, we could arrange the matter much better by taking over only the London money, which totals £183,000,000, and bears an interest charge of £6,640,000. The Commonwealth could take those loans over gradually as they fell due, and allow the States, without any of these complicated financial transactions, to face their Australian-held debt only. The amount that we must return to the States, so long as the Braddon clause continues to operate, will exceed the amount required to pay off the Londonheld loans; and it is only on that part of the national debt that any profit can be made by the Commonwealth for the people of Australia. We could not induce Australian bond-holders to take less than 3.6 per cent., which is the average interest payable at present on the Australian-held loans. I believe that Australian money could be used more profitably than that. Our only chance, therefore, will come from trying to float into Australian consols the £183,000,000 held outside. We should not need to ask the consent of the States to take those loans over, although it would be necessary to amend the Constitution in order to deal with any of them which have been incurred since the adoption of the Federal Constitution. Not only does that sum of £183,000,000 represent the amount of the States debts upon which it will be possible to make a saving, but the interest on it comes absolutely within our powers to meet out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise .revenue. The difficulty about the Government scheme and that of the honourable member for Mernda is that it is necessary to obtain the consent of every one of the States to the transaction, and, if only one of them stands out, the scheme falls to the ground. Western Australia, for instance, would not be greatly advantaged by it.",15
33,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Would it be necessary to get the consent of all the States if an amendment of the Constitution were agreed to?,16
34,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I think the amendment of the Constitution contemplated so far is directed purely to the question of taking over the debts incurred since the Federation was inaugurated, and not to the question of whether the States will join in or not.",16
35,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Shoul d not that cover the whole power required ?,16
36,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The honourable member appears to think that that amendment of the Constitution would give the Commonwealth power to limit the rights of the States to borrow except through the Commonwealth. That touches the crux of the whole question. Unless the people are ready to agree to that in the shape of an amendment of the Constitution, it will be necessary to secure the agreement of all the States to the scheme. If they can borrow where and when they please, it will mean that in some years, when the Commonwealth has to convert £20,000,000 or £25,000,000 of old State loans, the States will come in offering better terms and repeat - the disastrous throat policy of the past.",16
37,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The State electors would at once refuse to allow the State Governments to borrow if they had to borrow at higher rates.,16
38,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The State electors have not shown that tendency in the past. A little while ago two Australian States wanted to float large loans. One offered 3J per cent., and the other immediately offered 3! per cent., while New Zealand came in shortly afterwards and offered a loan on the Melbourne market at 4 per cent. Consequently, unless the Commonwealth has some control over future State borrowings-and that can only be secured by the consent of all the States, or by an amendment of the Constitution-the future dealing by the Commonwealth with the national debt will be in danger of being prejudiced.",16
39,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If the Commonwealth can borrow more cheaply than ctin the States, the people of the States will demand that the States should borrow through the Commonwealth.",16
40,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Premiers and Treasurers of two States have stated publicly that the Commonwealth cannot borrow more cheaply than the States 'can. That was said by the Premier of Victoria, and also by the Premier of New South Wales when he was lauding the financial reputation of his State.",16
41,Mr ROBERTS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,But that is not the last word on the subject.,16
42,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Perhaps not, but the same would be said again, and I have not the slightest doubt that if any State wants money in the future and the Commonwealth exercises no control, it will proceed to borrow. The States will want to borrow money, because Western Australia, for instance, could some day easily spend £100,000,000 on railways in the necessary development of her vast area. No doubt that State will some day have a very large railway system, and it will not limit its borrowings unless we can obtain an amendment of the Constitution to compel it to do so. This is the first time that I have heard an amendment of the Constitution for that purpose suggested. Without it, Western Australia will not limit itself to such direction as the Commonwealth likes to give it.",16
43,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I do not suggest that.,16
44,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If it is not secured by cut- an amendment of the Constitution or by agreement the clashing of the States and the Commonwealth in the money market will be disastrous to any attempts at economic financing in the future. The honourable member for Mernda's schemeand, in fact, every scheme that has so far been put forward-propose s some financial control, either jointly by the Commonwealth and States or by a Council of Finance, to limit the States in their future borrowings and prevent them clashing with the Commonwealth.",16
45,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,There will be an arrangement as to the manner in which the loans will be placed.,17
46,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The scheme of the honourable member for Mernda goes further. That honourable member stipulates for the absolute right on the part of the Commonwealth to limit State borrowings except through the Commonwealth, and insists on the Commonwealth having a satisfactory guarantee of the payment of interest and the repayment of principal of all loans that the Commonwealth floats for a State.",17
47,Mr FISHER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,He did not dogmatize on that point.,17
48,Mr CROUCH,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"He did not dogmatize, because the .principle has been so generally accepted that it was not necessary. I have put forward these views because the honororable member for Mernda has from time to time met various alterations and criticisms of his scheme, and I should like him to give them consideration, seeing that under that part of his scheme the Commonwealth cannot work without the consent of the whole of the States, and the Commonwealth would eventually have to take the matter into its own hands, if we are to take the honourable member's view of the writing on the wall. Item agreed to. ADDITIONS , NEW WORKS, AND DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. Division i (Home Affairs), £ 5 , 9 4 8 .",17
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"North Sydney) [3.1] - I should like to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that, during last year, the expenditure was exceedingly small in comparison with the money voted, and great complaints have been made that certain facilities which were very urgently required have not been provided, owing, it is said, to lack of funds. In 1907-8, the sum of £ 2 8 5 , 6 4 6 was voted for works and buildings under the Department of Home Affairs, and, of that, only £ 1 2 6 , 0 9 8 was expended. That money was voted on the 25th September.",17
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That was on the Estimates-in-Chief; there was another vote passed afterwards, in April.",17
51,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That may be, but it is to be hoped that this year we shall not have the same experience. If we provide funds for necessary improvements, we ought to feel certain that a fair proportion of the money will be expended, so that the works may not be held over for future years. A glance at the Estimates shows that an enormous number of the items are re-votes. For instance, on the first two pages of the Works and Buildings Estimates, we find that eight items out of nineare re-votes, and that discloses an unsatisfactory state of affairs, to overcome which some means ought to be adopted. If we have a repetition of last year's experience, we shall find complaints growing louder. It was promised long ago that there would be a more rapid execution of works, especially if the Estimates were passed early. I admit that, even last year, the Estimates were not passed as early as they might have been, but, at any rate, they were agreed to in September, when only three months of the financial year had gone by ; and yet, instead of three-fourths of the expenditure taking place in the remaining three-fourths of the year, we find that less than half the amount voted represents the expenditure.",17
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Hume-Trea s u r e r ) ^ ^ ] - I was myself very much surprised to find at the end of the year that so little of the money voted had been spent. I may point out, however, that the wholeof the money appropriated for the Postal Department was expended, with the exception, I think, of £ 8 , 0 0 0 j and there must BUILDINGS. always be a small balance.",17
53,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Treasurer is speaking of the expenditure by the Post and Telegraph Department itself, and not of what is expended for the Post and Telegraph Department by the Department of Home Affairs.",17
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Department of Home Affairs has a certain sum for works, and so has the Post and Telegraph Department. For works, there was, I think, a sum of £ 1 7 4 , 0 0 0 voted, and a balance of nearly £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 remained unexpended ; but of - that fact I was not aware until the end of the year.",17
55,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The amount --appropriated was, I think, £ 2 8 5 , 0 0 0 odd.",18
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I am speaking of an item of £ 1 7 4 , 0 0 0, of - which £.100,000 remained unexpended. I made inquiries, and two reasons were given to ime for the position of affairs. One was that it required considerable time to prepare specifications, and another was that the Department could not get the works pushed on by the States Departments of Works.",18
57,Mr LIDDELL,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Is it a fact that the for them. public works of the States are carried out 'before the works of the Commonwealth,18
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I do not like make any definite accusation without being blame. - certain, but such is the statement to me, and such is the impression left upon the Department of Home Affairs. Durgiven ing last June I urged that there should be expedition, and, if my desires had been carried out, and the money exMinisters pended, we should not have had so many re-votes this year. Another result would 'have been that, instead of £ 3 3 3 , 0 0 0 returned to the States over and above proportion of the three-fourths of the toms and Excise revenue, the amount £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or whatever it was, would have had to be deducted. This would not have - had any effect on the amount placed to Trust Funds, but it would have reduced the amount returned to the States. I have very strongly directed the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to this matter, and asked him to push forward works rapidly as possible. As the year is proParliament, ceeding I have, in anticipation of the and Buildings Estimates passing at an early date, approved of preparations made for the expenditure of a great deal of money to which I felt sure honourable members would take no exception. That have done with a view of getting the works well advanced, so as not to have left over any large unexpended balance. It has been impressed upon me by those who administer the Works and Buildings branch of the Home Affairs Department that it is about time we had a Works Department of - our own. I have made inquiries as to - cost, and find that it must be much larger than the percentage at present paid to the 'States. However, I shall consult with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and asceryear tain whether it would not be better to pay a little more, and have the works carried out promptly, than to have these unexpended balances each year.",18
59,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Does the Minister know whether the works which are carried out by the Department of Home Affairs are done more speedily ? That Department may be in fault as well as the Departments of the States.,18

I commend the Treasurer for having brought forward the Works Estimates this afternoon, so that 1 the they may be passed as speedily as possible. Apparently, however, the Department is not very serious about the work immediately under discussion, seeing that last only £ 5 2 was expended upon it. The plans for the proposed building would cost more than that, the sum being scarcely more than sufficient to pay for advertising for designs.

The honourable member for North Sydney has pointed to the weakness of the system of re-votes, and the Treasurer has replied that either the Public Works staff attached to the Department of Home Affairs is not competent to deal with all our public works, or that the delays that take place are due to the inaction of officers of the Public Works Departments of the States. Whenever complaint is made of delay in the execution of Commonwealth works, we are told, either that the Estimates were passed too late to enable the whole vote to be expended within the financial year in which it was passed, or that there was delay on the part of the Public Works Departments of the S""tates in attending to our requirementsThe States Departments of Public Works naturally give preference to their own undertakings.",20

83,Mr MCDOUGALL,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,A r e the officials of our Public Works staff paid that sum to keep prompting the State Departments to take action?,20
84,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is a very pertinent inquiry. I should like to learn from the Treasurer what is the proportion of Commonwealth works supervised by our own officials? We have, at present, a Central Public Works staff, and also a staff in New South Wales and in Victoria, under Commonwealth control. Nevertheless, we are told that they have to go to the Public Works Departments of the States for assistance. Exclusive of special defence works, the proposed expenditure on new works and buildings this year is practically the same as that for which we made provision last a year. We are dealing with these Estimates a little later than we did last year, so that the unexpended balance is likely to be greater than it was before. I should like Treasurer to obtain from his colleague, the Minister of Home Affairs, some information as to the reason why such a large proportion of the amount voted for new the works and buildings each year remains unexpended. I do not wish to be unfair no to our own Public Works staff, and am personally in favour of the establishment a Commonwealth Department of Public Works, believing that it would result in economy and give us effective control over our own works. It is unreasonable to exI pect the Public Works Departments of the States to set aside local undertakings in order that they may attend to our requireThey receive at present a commission of from 6 to 10 per cent, on all works executed for the Commonwealth, and that amount added to the sum which we now exon the Public Works staff of the Commonwealth would go a long wav ""towards equipping a department of our own.",20

I then heard nothing of any offer of 600 feet. When I had-to deal with the question, the proposed area had been duced to 224 feet. An arrangement had been made with the British Admiralty for the use of part of the original, block, and, I ' think, that an arrangement had also been made with Messrs. Birt and Co. for the use. of another portion. I had nothing to do with any prodeduction posal to transfer to the Commonwealth 600 feet of land on the Island; but I dealt with a proposition that there should be handed over to the Commonwealth a frontage of 224 feet, as one of a long list of properties, for the transfer of which were endeavouring to arrange. As a matter of fact on the date of my retirement from office I had, I think, effected a seting tlement in regard to every other proour perty in. the list, but as negotiations had not been completed in regard to this one block, I had to leave the money whole matter to my successor. We were glad to receive an offer of 224 feet Darling Island, since it was a valuable £ deep-water frontage.

92,Mr GLYNN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Angas) [3.37] - As bearing on the suggested establishment of a Commonwealth Department of Public Works, I should like to point out to the Treasurer what seems to be a reasonable to draw from the figures with regard to appropriations and expenditure. In South Australia, all - Commonwealth works are supervised by State officers, and from what I have heard in the other States, some are supervised by officers we of the Department of Home Affairs, and others by officers of the Public Works Departments of those States. It is interestto note that in South Australia, where works are supervised by the States officers, practically every penny supplied by the Treasurer is applied. A great deal of is required in connection with telegraphic and telephonic works in that State, on and, but for a miserable addition of 1 , 0 0 0 to the actual provision made, about men, engaged in the underground installation of telephone wires in Adelaide, have been dismissed last week. At present time something like £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 is required to enable the work to be completed the electric tram wires are put up.",21
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I think that the work is now going on.,21
94,Mr GLYNN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I , have been making within the last forty-eight hours, and can assure the Treasurer that, unless he finds within the next few weeks a sum of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 in connection with this work, there will be complete confusion between the installation of telephone wires the erection of overhead wires for the Tramway Company. By referring to page 291 of the Estimates, honourable members will see that a sum of £ 3 4 , 3 0 4 was approus, priated for these works in South Australia in 1907-8, and that £ 3 4 , 2 2 6 was actually spent. In connection with the immediately preceding item there was an appropriation of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , and an actual expenditure of only £ 4 , 8 1 1 . T do not know what is the explanation of this large unexpended balance; but I surmise that in that case the materials had to be found by the Department of Home Affairs, and that as they were not forthcoming the money could not expended by the officers of the State. I only ask that that be borne in mind in connection with the establishment of a Commonwealth Public Works Department. the The Treasurer stated that in some cases he had made advances in addition to the appropriation. Those advances appear to have been confined to one or two States. In New South Wales, for the construction of telephones and telegraphs, the actual expenditure was .£4,000 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 more than the appropriation. In Queensland there has also been an excess of expenditure over appropriation, but no excesses of that kind are to be found in the case of the other States. In Victoria the expenditure was a good deal less than the appropriation. I cannot understand this in the light of the allegations that works are not being pushed on as expeditiously in New South Wales as the people there could wish. I mention these things at this stage, so that when the items are reached the Treasurer will be in a position to give us a more lucid, or, at all events, more convincing explanation than he has suggested up to the present.",21

Out of that only £ 6 5 was expended. Is it for a Customs launch, or a pleasure launch ? Is the amount commission on a sale, or money expended towards the building of a launch ?",22

98,Dr LIDDELL,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Hunter) [3.44] - I cordially agree with the suggestion that it is necessary to have a Commonwealth Department of Public Works. Over and over again I have experienced considerable difficulty in getting works completed, and on inquiry I have found that the matter was practically hung up in the State Department. Consequently,., one can get no satisfaction from the Minister. His reply is, "" We are urging the State Department to proceed, and doing all we can to accelerate the matter."" The onus is then thrown upon one to approach th2 State Department, and one cannot readily do that unless one appeals to the State member. Consequently we, as Federal members, are placed under a compliment to the State members by having to ask them to intervene. Only yesterday I received a letter which shows how these works are delayed. For some months [73]- 2 past it has been proposed to build a Post Office which is urgently needed at Cessnock, in my electorate. At this late date I received a letter from the Department, to the following effectWith reference to previous correspondence respecting the proposed erection of a new post office building at Cessnock, New South Wales, I have the honour to inform you that the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, recently reported that the papers and plan relating to the matter were being returned to the Works Director for New South Wales for an amended estimate of cost and sketch in connection with certain alterations to the Telephone Exchange room, suggested by the Electrical Engineer, Sydney. That is where the matter stands at present,, and from that morass it is absolutely impossible to drag it out, without the intervention of the Minister himself. I cordially agree that we should have a Public"" Works Department of our own. TheTreasurer states that the building which he purposes to construct is to be fireproof I have seen a great many buildings supposed to be fireproof, but when a fire comes along they seem to burn better than any others. I would ask the Treasurer to endeavour, if possible, to have the building fitted with a system of sprinklers, which, so far as my experience goes, is the only method of preventing destructive fires. The Treasurer told us on one occasion when putting the Quarantine Bill through the House, that there would not be much additional cost entailed.",22

103,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Cowper) [3-S°]--The Committee has been asked during this short debate to consider the advisability of establishing a Commonwealth Department of Public Works. I admit that there is a good deal to be said in favour of it , but we should first give serious consideration to the practice which has hitherto been followed, and the way we have been treated. While there has been a considerable amount of delay in many cases, my experience is that it has not been altogether the, fault of the States Public Works Departments. In many cases there is so much circumlocution between the different Departments and offices as to who shall approve or condemn different buildings that to blame the State Departments is sometimes a convenient way of shifting the responsibility on to a body with which we have no power to deal. The State Departments are responsible to some extent for the delay in the carrying out of public works in the shape of repairs, additions, and new buildings, but my experience is that when some such work is decided upon there are quite a number of different gentlemen whose business it is to have a finger in the pie. We have first to move the Post and Telegraph Department to say that the repair or new work is necessary. matter then goes through the Deputy Postmaster-General's office, from him fo the Inspector for the district, thence back to the State Public Works Department, from there to the local officer, then back to the district officer, and back again to the State Department, and so on round and round until one has to be very conversant with the .intricacies of the different Departments to be able to follow the sets of papers in connection with each case, and one is afterwards very fortunate if he is able to put the saddle on the right horse. I wish to caution the Treasurer and the Government before they attempt to create a Commonwealth Public Works Department. I put a question on the business-paper today which had a direct bearing on the matter. I asked for information as to what we paid the States to carry out and supervise these works. The information read by the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, was that, according to an arrangement made, the States receive, on new works costing o v e r ;£ > 6 per cent, plus expenses of IOO clerks of works as prescribed in the Commonwealth Public Works Regulations; while on new works and buildings costing less than £100, 8 per cent, is paid to Tasmania, and 10 per cent, to all the other States; and on all maintenance, repairs, and furniture, 8 per cent, to Tasmania, and 10 per cent, to all the other States. During the financial year just closed we Mr John Thomson. expended £126,098 on additions, new works, and buildings, under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, and on page 28 of the Estimates-in-Chief it is stated that the amount paid to recoup the various States for salaries, & c , for supervising the work-and this I understand includes the cost of the Public Works staff - wa s £7,500, or a little over 6 per cent. 011 the total cost. Our experience of Government Departments teaches us that we cannot start another Department of our own and duplicate all the officers, inspectors, and so on for anything like 6 pep cent. The proposal must be regarded not from the sentimental point of view of whether we ought to have a Department of our own or control more officers than we do, but from the stand-point of whether, if adopted, it will enable us to carry out the works in the most economical way possible. No Department that I know of could carry out these works in the way that they have been carried out by the different States Departments for anything like 6 per cent. The We know that the works of the States being carried out in conjunction with some of our works account for delays, particularly in smaller matters. In the State which I represent it had been quite common to see three or four inspectors in a country town, superintending, one a post office, and others a court house, and various works. This only leads to a multiplication of expense. This has now been remedied and the whole is superintended by one man. I am afraid that similar circumstances would be repeated if we had a Works Department of our own, and I suggest that, before any ' alteration be made, the question of the relative cost of the two systems ought to be looked into. While something may be said in favour of our having a Works Department of our own, the present system is, I think, the more economical.",22
104,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Wentworth) [3-56]-- I wish to strictly obey the ruling of the Chairman in regard to the discussion of questions of policy, and, consequently, I shall do no more at present than congratulate the Government on the proposed expenditure of £2,000, which I understand, is to assist the Government in their benevolent policy of universal conciliation-in enabling honourable menibers and distinguished persons to realise in congenial company the beautiful surroundings and glories of Sydney's beautiful harbour.",23
105,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,It is an excellent vote for the purpose.,24

110,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I think I see three grounds on which the honourable member for Wentworth may be regarded as being in order.

Mr HUM E COOK - This sum was voted last year.",24
111,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"But with no idea that the particular vote was to be used for the purpose. This is a serious matter. The money voted last year was for a Customs boat, strongly built, and fit to battle with all sorts of emergencies. That was a most excellent vote.",24

119,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Hav e you read the last edition of May, Mr MCDonald? However, I shall not press the matter further, because I am not anxious to come in conflict with the Chair, especially in view of a certain tragedy which is said to have occurred in another State.",24
120,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Calare) [4.0]. - In view of the statement of the Treasurer, we are entitled, I think, to know who is responsible for the action of which he complains, because the position disclosed appears to me to be most serious. order We are incurring an expenditure of something like £30,000 on building Commonwealth stores at Darling Harbor, and the Treasurer tells us that that will be practically wasted if we are limited to the small space now at our disposal. In the course of the negotiations, the interests of the Commonwealth appear to have suffered to a serious extent; and if a Commonwealth officer is responsible he ought not to be allowed to remain in. a position to make similar blunders in the future. On the other hand, if a Minister is responsible, we ought to know who that Minister is. No time should be lost in ascertaining whether the blunder can be rectified, and the Commonwealth rights secured. As to the curtailed' expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department, there is seething discontent in the country districts, and, to a lesser degree, in the larger centre^ of population. The Treasurer says that he has hitherto made the provision asked for, but that this year he proposes to reduce the amount. In looking over the Estimates, I find that last year we voted for additions, new works, and buildings, £285,646, of which £159,548 remained unexpended at the end of the year; and presumably that was returned to the States. It would be just as well to know how far the Post and Telegraph Department has suffered in this connection. In the works for that Department, under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, in New South Wales, £40,332 was appropriated', and only £10,933 expended, leaving an unexpended balance of £29,399; and yet, at the same time, we are told that the services are starved owing to want of money. Not only are new works never entered upon, but approved works are unattended to; and all this shows unmistakably that! there is a screw loose somewhere in the administration. When the Treasurer asked us to vote all this money, we were led to suppose that it was intended to be spent on the specified works.",24
121,Mr MCDOUGALL,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"-Surely the honourable member is not suggesting that money is voted for one purpose, and used for another ?",25
122,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I do not know, but, at all events, a large proportion of the money voted last year remained unexpended; and I presume that, in view of the re-votes we are asked to make, the works have not been carried out. The position would be different if the money we voted last year were available now; but, under the circumstance?, the money has now to be found out of new revenue; and that seems to make clear one of the reasons why there is so much friction and trouble. All the States suffer in common in this connection; and I have simply quoted New South Wales, because I am more familiar with the conditions there. AVe have the Electrical Engineer declaring to the Royal Commission on the Post and Telegraph Department, that a sum of something like £800,000 is needed to bring his branch of the Department into a state of efficiency. is saying nothing in regard to the expenditure for new works which the public urgently demands. I wish to know from the Treasurer the cause of the enormous disproportion between the appropriation and the expenditure of last year, and whether what happened then will happen again this year. What is the use of voting money which will not be expended? If the expenditure cannot - take place because of faulty administration, let us have the matter remedied. It seems to me that there is undue friction and too much red-tape procedure in the relations of the Commonwealth and State Departments. It is hinted that the officers of the States do not deal speedily with Commonwealth work because they look upon it as an additional task, and it is said that they give the greater part of their time to State work, doing the Commonwealth work in their odd time. However that may be, the present state of affairs is unsatisfactory. Parliament should not be asked to vote more money than can be expended. If the trouble lies with the administration of the States Departments, we should be asked to remedy the evil by appointing more officers of our own. But whatever the nature of the difficulty, we should be fully and thoroughly informed regarding it, and steps should be proposed for removing it. What is the use of asking, us to pass the Works and Buildings Estimates as quickly as possible, on the ground 1 of urgency, if only part of the money voted will be expended ?

123,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Swan) [4.16] The observations of the honourable member for Calare are justified, and I regret that the"" story which he told is not a new one. Each year since Federation our expenditure on works and buildings has been considerably less than our appropriation. This year the Estimates should have been laid on the table much earlier than was the case, because Parliament met over two months after the end of the financial year,, and during those two months the Department should have prepared them. Generally, it is not possible to present the Estimates until Parliament has been sittinga month or six weeks, because the financesof the year cannot be reviewed by the Treasurer till the financial year has ended; but"" in this instance they should have been That presented at the beginning of the session. Last year we voted no less than£1,098,000 for works and buildings, but only £877,000 was spent, £221,000 remaining unspent. This year, no doubt, a number of votes will lapse, because only six months remain in which to spend the parliamentary appropriation. Something should be done to gmend this unsatisfactory state of affairs. Throughout the Estimates one comes upon votes of last year of which very little was expended.",25
124,Mr IMAHON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Not much is asked f.or Western Australia this year.,25
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is so. We expect the members of the Labour Party from that State to see that fair play is obtained from the Ministry which they support. We have heard a great deal about the want of funds in the Department of the Postmaster-General; but I find that the appropriations of last year were not expended. In New South Wales, Victoria, WesternAustralia, ancl Tasmania, money availablefor the construction and extension of telephone lines was not used, though the Department, seeing what an outcry had been> made about its needs, might Have been expected to spend, not only the whole appropriation for the year, but, in addition, a good part of the Treasurer's advance.",25
126,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,There would have fceen no difficulty in carrying out the works - authorized for Tasmania.,26
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The Postmaster-General should explain why this has happened.,26

129,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"No allowance of that kind will apply in the case of Victoria, for whose public works the appropriation was £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , of which only £[12,000 was expended.

132,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Wentworth) [4.25] There is nothing that one of an utterly generous nature dislikes so much as to be interrupted in a charitable interpretation - of the action of an opponent. I was giving what to my mind was the most charitable interpretation that could be placed on the action of 'the Treasurer in purchasing Mr Hordern's yacht as a Customs launch, - when I unfortunately ran foul of the 'Standing Orders. But I am sincere in expressing my deep admiration of the altruistic policy that underlies the action of the Ministry in purchasing a yacht which, however unsuitable for Customs purposes, is none the less as suitable a yacht as could be bought for the money for entertaining one's friends or those of the Government. yacht that has been purchased for the Government is one of the prettiest pleasure boats that we have in Sydney harbour, and as such is dirt cheap at £ 2 , 0 0 0 .",26

136,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"There I join issue with the honourable member. Can it be said that a boat with an ordinary curved bow, a long overhanging stern, and with glass windows and curtains all round her, is suitable for use as a Customs launch to take Customs When I was officers or any one else alongside big vessels? I do not think that the Treasurer really believes that that is the purpose for which it is intended. ",26
137,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I do not wish my honrule orable friends to run away with the idea that the vacht is badly equipped. She has a really first-class piano.,26
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,That is not so.,26
139,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"There wals certainly a piano on board when she was owned by Mr Hordern. But, apart altogether from pianos and furnishings, she is well equipped. She has magnificent state-rooms, and splendid state lockers for state cigars and state whisky. She is really the best vessel of which I know for conciliating the opponents of the Ministry. But it is absolutely ridiculous to purchase her for use as a bona fide Customs launch. She cannot be used for such purposes. The Treasurer has had some experience of buying pleasure yachts. Just before he retired from office as Premier of New South Wales, he bought the white elephant of an American millionaire-the Victoria--whic h was put in commission in New South Wales, "" for visiting lighthouses.""",26
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,And was given away.,26

It appears that he purchased for £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 , a yacht which, two years later, had to be sold for £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . In the meantime, of course, more than that value-to the Ministry-ha d been obtained out of her.

160,Mr JOHNSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Lang) [4.36] - I am rather surprised at the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Wentworth, more especially as he claims to have knowledge of yachts. Apparently prohe does not know much about this vessel. to Accompanied by the honourable member for Wentworth, I made a visit of inspection of to her, and did not then hear any of the objections which the honourable member",27
161,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The honourable member was told at the time, that she was useless for Customs purposes.",27
162,Mr JOHNSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Quite the contrary, so far as I was able to ascertain. Experienced officers of the Customs told in me she would suit the purpose admirably. She is built of solid teak, will stand I ask much wear and tear, and cost something like £ 7 , 0 0 0 to build in the Old Country. She is a b.andy yacht, and, she is eminently suited, as has been said, for carrying distinguished visitors Sydney harbour, she is also suitable for ordinary Customs work, provided that certain minor alterations are made. If she has a string piece carried round the outside line of her deck, to serve as a fender, she will be able to go alongside vessels coming up the harbour, and to put Customs officers on board them without risk of damage.",27
163,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Has alteration been made?,28
164,Mr JOHNSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I understand that it has not. I was under the impression that Mr Reeks, the naval architect, had been requested to report as to what alterations are necessary to render the vessel suitable for use as a Customs launch, but whether he has done so or not I am unable to say. I have learned with surprise from Mr. Miller, of the Works Department, that, at present, it is proposed only to make some trivial alterations of a temporary character. This, I think, is foolish. All necessary alterations should be - made and the yacht ""put in first-class order. At present she is fitted with light"" chain plates for her shrouds to pass through, and there is a risk when she is ranging alongside a wharf that the piles might carry them away. A string piece would do away with this risk. Tapering from the bow it could gradually swell to the chain plates along the side, and taper away again to the stern, and if nicely rounded would add to the appearance of the vessel. She certainly requires re-decking, which should be done straight away, and she is too heavily sparred for harbour work. Her engines and rudder also require some attention. With those alterations, I am satisfied that the Commonwealth has made a very safe investment in the purchase of the yacht. She is admirably adapted for pleasure purposes, but no less admirably, when the necessary alterations are carried out, for ordinary Customs work as an auxiliary boat. In contrast to her, I would remind the honourable member for Wentworth that a boat was built locally for the Customs Department- I am not sure whether at Mort's Dock or the Cockatoo Dock-of which - everything was made in the country, and, as far as possible, I believe her engines were made here, and yet that boat has - never given satisfaction.",28
165,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,T t is nonsense to say that - a good boat cannot be built in Sydney.,28
166,Mr JOHNSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I know that;' but that boat has been an absolute failure.,28

168,Mr JOHNSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Onl y the other day, I am informed, the top of her boiler flew out, and she is now out of commission undergoing repairs. There were too many fingers in the pie in her construction. Her cost was great and her upkeep has been exceptionally heavy. The Treasurer has not that done the Commonwealth a distinct service in buying the vessel at present under discussion, although she is more of a pleasure yacht than a boat for rough knock-about work, and it may be necessary later on to acquire another. A similar vessel might with advantage be obtained for Port Phillip, because I do not think the Customs Department in Victoria has any boat suitable for its work. I shall not cavil at expenditure of that kind, which I regard as absolutely necessary. This particular investment is one in which the Commonwealth has obtained in every way a very excellent bargain.",28
169,Mr BOWDEN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Nepean) [4.44] - The Prime Minister, on 9th October last, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Dalley, said that this boat cost £ 1 , 7 0 0 , whereas the amount on the Estimates is £ 1 , 9 1 6 . How is the difference accounted for ?",28
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I think £ 5 0 is for different fittings required.,28

I have no doub: that the yacht purchased is a beautiful one, and I trust that it will be at the disposal of members of Parliament, in order that they may be able.to supervise the efficient working of the Customs Department on the waters of Port Jackson. I do not know that members have yet been invited to make use of it. I have not received an invitation yet; but I trust that I shall not be forgotten. I quite admit that occasionally it will be necessary that the yacht should do some work in connection with the Customs Department, but I hope that will be at a time when it is not wanted for more important purposes. Has the Treasurer made any statement to the Committee as to the grounds upon which he secured the authority of Parliament for its purchase? Was it intended for the Customs Department,, or for more important public purposes? Is it charged to the Customs Department? Of course, we do not care where it is charged to, so long as it is at our disposal. Might I ask also whether it would nt have been infinitely better to construct a Customs launch in Australia instead of buying a launch which I believe - I am not sure-ha s the tainted record of having been built in some other part of the British Empire?",28
173,Mr JOHNSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The Government could not have got one anything like her for the money.,29
174,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is a vile free-trade doctrine which I should think would have led the Treasurer to scout the transaction. It is the most damning admission I have heard in connection with the Treasurer's financial administration - Was it a cheap built perfectly. bargain, or was it not?

No wonder temper is breaking down under the finanfriends cial strain involved by such mercenary and in this matter. contemptible considerations ! Where is my friend, the honourable member for Gippsannounced land, who always wears such a contemthe plative attitude, and seems so profoundly sagacious? What has he to say to this transaction ? Consider the magnificent portunities that we should have had of building this vessel in the Commonwealth, and hoisting our Commonwealth ensign over a triumph of Australian industry. Will the honourable member allow these despicably cheap transactions to be perpurchase, petrated? Is this sort of thing to go on? going qualities are claimed for her. On behalf of the gentlemen who usually sit in this part of the House, I wish to - warn the Treasurer that we have put up with a good deal during the past two years or more. We have had nothing but promises, on which the Ministry have lived-and which we have lived-and we are now approaching a very severe ordeal in another arena. Of course, the Treasurer runs away. ' That is the only effective answer that he ever gives to a pointed attack, but I wish to tell him that our patience is becoming exhausted.

192,Mr GLYNN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Angas) [5.1] - In reference to the sum provided for a trawler, I should like to point out to the Treasurer that in South Australia recently an important deputation of fishermen pointed out that trawling might result in destroying the feeding ground of some of our fisheries. It was pointed out by the deputation that, after a time, trawlers in the Old Country had had to abandon the grounds owing to the diminished fish; and I mention the fact so that the attention of our experts may be drawn to it, because it is somewhat important, if the allegations of the fishermen are correct. Of course, it is in the power of a State to prevent the Federal Government from trawling, seeing that the Federal power is only beyond "" territorial limits""-thoug h what that means has never yet been explained. At all events, the States have control of all fishing within the three-mile l i m it ; and we may not expect the trawling to be kept outside that, though, I believe, in some parts of the old world, trawling is carried on forty or fifty miles out.

I know that is a most dangerous subject for me; because the trawler represents a socialistic work. When we could not get what we conceived to be a reasonable price, I saw Mr Lee, the Minister of Public Works in New South Wales, with the result that vernment gave an estimate, and carried out the work. The vessel is to the design of Messrs. Reeks and Christie; and the reason that the price is higher than that of vessels in the northern hemisphere is that we have had to provide for light and ventilamarket tion below.

The honourable member for Angas has, however, pointed out a complication that may arise, if it be found that the trawler does harm to well-known fishing grounds within State limits. Another aspect is represented by the question, whether we are going to endeavour to make this the trawler self-supporting by selling the fish caught; because, if so, the Commonwealth will at once come into competition with local fishermen. I have always understood that the object of the trawler is to discover where our fishermen may find, the State Gonew fishing grounds.",31

It is they who make all the money, by charging high"" prices, the poor, hard-workfar. ing fishermen getting very little. I to know that the fisherman is to have an opportunity to better his position; but does the Treasurer propose to select those who are to be permitted to buy from the trawler, and thus become middlemen?",32
215,Sir WILLIAMLVNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,That is a matter for the Minister of Trade and Customs.,32
216,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,It will be interesting to learn what process of selection is be followed.  us how the fish are to be disposed of.,32
217,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,They are to be sold to the fishermen.,32

219,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If they are not be sold to the fishermen, to whom are they to be sold? It would be ridiculous turn them to the sea. Had that been intended, Parliament would have hesitated about authorizing the construction of trawler. Perhaps the' Treasurer will inpaid form me what the annual expense of the vessel will be.",32
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I shall give the information presently, and deal with some other points as well.",32
221,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I should also like to know when the trawler will commence work, and where it will operate. How long will it remain in any locality, and what parts of the Australian coast are to be explored? I expect information from the Treasurer in reply to these questions.",32
222,Mr ATKINSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Wilmot) [5.Z0] - I understand that the business of the trawler is primarily to discover and explore our fishing grounds.,32
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"And to-determine, as f ar as possible, the habits of our fish.",32
224,Mr ATKINSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The vessel will ' move from place to place, and, no doubt, if it is convenient, will sell the fish which it catches, the proceeds of the sales going towards its upkeep. I do not think that this will seriously compete with the fishermen.  be given away?",32
225,Mr ATKINSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I do not see why they should not be sold, and the proceeds very used for defraying the upkeep of the vessel. ",32

227,Mr ATKINSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Certainly ; but I wish to know what the annual cost of it will be. No doubt, if it discovers valuable fishing grounds, the undertaking will be profitable. I understand that the .steamer is to cost about £1.6,600, and to I wish to know if that amount will cover the expenses of construction, equipment, and fitting for sea. The original estimate was £ 8 , 0 0 0 , but I understand that a much better boat than was at first proposed has been launched, and that it has been built If a superior boat has been built locally at a reasonably to extra charge, I think we should be satisfied; but I should like to know what the to retotal expenditure will be.",32
228,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Dalley) [5.25] - If the Government gets as good return for all its the expenditure as it has got for the money for this trawler, it will do very well. Parliament decided that the vessel should be constructed to explore the fisheries of Australia. She was built in the Government shipbuilding yards by men residing in my own electorate, and is a most creditable piece of engineeringwork. We have obtained in her a splendid bargain. The honourable member for Brisbane appears to be greatly concerned as'to the cost of her upkeep. I would remind him that we decided that the Commonwealth should undertake the task of investigating the fishing grounds in Australian waters, and that it was hoped that, as the result of the exploratory work done by this vessel, we should make discoveries that would lead to the establishment in Australia of large fishcanning industries. Such an investigation must necessarily involve a considerable expenditure. As an amateur fisherman, I do not think that we shall find along our coasts the profitable fishing grounds that some expect to discover, although the representatives of Tasmania tell us that big hauls of edible fish may be secured along their coasts. The trawler will not return to port from day to day. She is a deep sea vessel, capable of withstanding any storm that is likely to occur on the Australian coast, and will be so equipped as to be able to remain at sea for several consecutive weeks. Her upkeep is sure to be an expensive item. In the first place, her master and crew must necessarily be picked men. and their wages will not be those paid to ordinary fishermen. Then, again, scientists are to be employed in connection with her, and, having regard to all these facts, the Treasurer must not imagine that she is not going to cost us more than would a small fishing boat. If we are to have inything like a scientific investigation of oui waters with a view to the development of the fishing industry, the Treasurer must be prepared to provide a considerable sum foi her maintenance and equipment. Even if our experiments in this direction fail, we shall suffer no loss so far as the construction of the trawler is concerned. It must not be forgotten that the Commonwealth Government proposes at an early date to take over the control of lighthouses, and that this vessel will be eminently suitable for the periodical visits of inspection. As to the question of manning, I would suggest to the Treasurer that the Department should take care to obtain through the Public Service Commissioner the best possible crew. ' The success of the experiment will depend largely upon the way in which the trawler is manned, and I think that honourable members will find that theTe is very little to cavil at in regard to the item.",32
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.32]-- I have listened with much interest to the speeches that have been made on this question. An excellent suggestion has been thrown out by the honourable member for Dalley as to the work which this vessel might do in connection with the inspection of the lighthouses which we propose before long to take over from the States. She is eminently suitable for such work, and without her we should have either to charter a steamer, or to build one specially to enable a periodical inspection to be made.",33
230,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Then she is also to be, 'jo to speak, a lighthouse ferry.",33
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Yes ; why should she not be so used?,33
232,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I do not say that she should not.,33
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The honourable member for Brisbane desired some information as to the cost of manning the trawler. He will find at page 45 of the Estimates every item set out in detail. Provision is made there for the expenditure of over £3,000 on the vessel. There is also an expenditure of £2,710 in respect of fishing gear and other items, and a proposed vote of £1,090 in respect of the wages of the crew; an item of £600 for the payment of a Director of Fisheries, and one of- £ 1 3 0 in respect of the salary of an assistant naturalist for part of the year. About a fortnight ago, I had a very interesting conversation with Dr Ramsay Smith, of Adelaide, regarding the fishing industry of Scotland. I learned that for eight years he practically had charge of the industry 011 behalf of the British Government, and li2 has promised to send me several works that he has written upon the habits of fish in those waters.",33
234,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Ha d he charge of the fishing industry there?,33
235,Sir WILLIA MLYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I cannot for the moment recall the exact details' of his appointment, but he was either an officer or the head of a Commission appointed by the British Government to deal with the scientific branch of the industry. He is sending me certain information which I am sure will prove of great value. Dr Ramsay Smith referred specially to the importance of studying the habits of fish, and the foods for which they have a liking, with a view to discovering when certain fish are likely to be found in certain waters. He also gave me a great deal of information of much practical interest. I would recommend those who are interested in this subject to avail themselves of the first opportunity they have of discussing it with Dr Ramsay Smith, who, I should imagine, is more familiar with its scientific features than is any one else in Australia.",33
236,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,What about Mr Dannevig ?,33
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I am referring more particularly to the information possessed by Dr Ramsay Smith with respect to the habits of fish in Scottish waters. Mr Dannevig was appointed Inspector of Fisheries to the Government of New South Wales on the .recommendation of Dr Nansen, the explorer. I met Dr Nansen several times in London, and he was good enough to send us plans for the trawler that we have built. He informed me that in Mr Dannevig we have one of the best experts to be found in the British Empire. The honourable member for Brisbane inquired where the trawler would commence operations.« I cannot answer that question definitely, but should imagine that she will commence her investigations in the colder waters along the coast of Tasmania, 01 the southern coast of Australia.",33
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Seeing trawler has been constructed, is it not time that the Department elaborated a plan of operations ?",34
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I should, think so; although I do not suppose that the vessel will be in commission until three or four months hence. Probably honourable members are not familiar with the habits of some of the edible fish to be found in Australian waters, but the subject is certainly an interesting one. For instance, what is known as the school trumpeter found in Tasmanian waters, usually keeps fairly close to the coast, but we do not know that there are not further out to sea feeding grounds where it may be found at certain periods in large numbers. There is also what is known as the solitary trumpeter which grows to a large size, and is usually found some miles off the coast.",34
240,Dr WILSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Is it intended to follow the solitary'trumpeters with the trawler?,34
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"They are called solitary trumpeters because they are not a school fish. We do not yet know the habits of the pilchard on the New South Wales coast, and I presume that the habits of the herring are much the same. know is that the pilchard comes in from somewhere to the south-east, strikes the coast about the Promontory, and then runs right along the coast some distance out till it gets to the south of Queensland, when it goes away north-east. ought to find out where those fish come from, and where they go to at certain periods. They pass along the coast for three or four months in the year. lieve they are just about finished now. Then there is the large mackerel-no t the small mackerel that we get along the New South Wales coast, but the large mackerel - whic h goes along the coast of Tasmania, coming from the south or south-east, just as the pilchard does. It runs along-the east coast of Tasmania until it gets to the north, and then it goes away to the northeast. That fish comes in myriads, like the pilchard, and its habits should be discovered.",34
242,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,There are other fish further up the eastern coast.,34
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Probably there ' are many others that I do not know of.,34
244,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If the trawler can find out the whereabouts of the whiptail it will do some good. that the Sir WILLI AM LYNE - There is plenty of work for the scientific trawler to do. I cannot say definitely what will be done because the matter is not in my Department. Otherwise I should have had an investigation made already. But I should think that the colder waters would be the first to bedealt with, seeing that there the better fish as a rule are to be found. Very likely that will be the wish of the Minister who has charge of this work. In the matter of scientific discovery, and in Communicating with the lighthouses, we shall have plenty for the trawler to do, and she will answer the purpose well.",34
245,Mr SINCLAIR,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Is it proposed to do any canning ?,34
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Some Scotch fishermen are out here now to get information about Australian fish for the purpose of forming a large company to carry on canning work. I dare say they will be very glad to receive any particulars that will help them in the matter of preserving fish. I do not think that we shall be disappointed in the development of the fishing industry. The first idea in connection with this trawler was that we should ascertain whether we All we could not take some practical step which would result, not only in finding fish for the Australian people, but in getting up a great canning industry. I think that in that direction the trawler will do very usef u l work. I received a letter- I think last This vessel year-fro m a company in Ireland which had been pickling mackerel for export to some part of America, asking me if 1 could tell them whether the mackerel that they I be- had been accustomed to deal with were to be found in Australian waters. The Tasmanian mackerel is the same fish. I do not mean the smaller mackerel that is to be found further north. The large mackerel is very rich, and a fine eating fijli. I do not know whether it is what is called the horse mackerel. I sent the company all the information that I cuiiid furnish, ancl J think I received a second letter asking for more; but I could give them no than my personal experience. The large mackerel are so numerous^on the east coast of Tasmania in June, July, and August, that we boys used to throw a line in the platform on sheerlegs, where the whales used to be tried out, and jag up the line, which never came up without hooking two or three of those large fish.",34
247,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is a fisherman's yam. What bait did you use? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - We used no cutlery, bait at all.  with the fish caught by the trawler?",35

It will be only a day or two before they are brought in. A boat engaged on sciendevolving tific work will not come in every day, or even every second day, but fish will caught fifty ancl 100 miles away from the coast.  The boat might as well go to the try.",35
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"It will do a seems great deal of good if , as the result of investigations, canning work can be underof taken. I agree that the fish caught the trawler should not be lost. I am not prepared at this stage to state in detail what way they will be dealt with, so far as regards helping the' public to get cheaper fish. Both here and in Sydney fish is a great deal too dear, and ought to supply both Sydney and Melbourne with much cheaper fish. That development which it is hoped will take place.",35
250,Mr ATKINSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The trawler will not be able to break that Combine down,35
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Probably not, but the trawler might be able to keep check.

I am glad to see that, because it appears to fix the purchase of the site. I take it that even that small amount would not be asked for if it had not been determined that this site should be adopted. My constituents will be very glad to know that the site is to be purchased, and will be pleased to learn that it is likely to be made available at an early date.",35
255,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Richmond-Minister of Defence) [5-55]--Beerburru m as a site for artillery range and manoeuvring ground must be regarded and judged from the point of view of a large training ground - for all time.  sible places that could be selected !,36
256,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is the point which has been raised. Beerburrum was one of the sites suggested as readily obtainable from the Queensland Government, and on .reasonable terms; but, after investigation, some doubt was created as to its suitability. I should not be justified in recommending Beerburrum as the site on my present official information. I think that the Queensland Government can furnish us with an easily accessible site in another place on reasonable terms.",36
257,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Can the Minister indicate where that other site is?,36
258,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I am not quite siire whether I should do so, but the House will be consulted with regard to the matter. The £ 2 0 0 will not be expended unless I am prepared to recommend Beerburrum as the most suitable place obtainable; and, perhaps,- the better way would be to have the provision made for Beerburrum or some similar site. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [5.57] The information is not so satisfactory to me as I had hoped it would be, because, . with all due deference to the Minister, I think he will have great difficulty in finding ,1 more suitable site than Beerburrum.",36
259,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If that be so, we shall accept Beerburram.",36
260,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The point is that something definite ought to be done. This matter has been postponed from year to year; indeed, it was discussed even prior ito Federation. As I explained on a previous occasion, the Field Artillery in Queensland has, for the last two or three vears, been unable to fire a solitary shell either in instructional practice or in what is called service practice.",36
261,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The point is whether this .site is suitable for all time, and I think I can easily satisfy the honourable member on that point.",36
262,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If the site is not suitable, the Minister, with the assistance - of his responsible officers, ought to make up his mind to take a decisive step. I do not ask the Minister to disclose any other place he may have in his mind, because such a disclosure migh^ be inadvisable; but if Beerburrum is not to be selected, let a decision be come to at once, in the interests of the Defence Forces in Queensland. The efficiency of a very important arm of our defence-and , indeed, the whole of the State forces to a certain extent-is undermined by the fact that there is no suitable artillery range, though I do not say there is not a suitable manoeuvring ground, because such ground can be obtained. I have' been over Beerburrum several times, once In company with General F in n ; and, as Minister of Lands in Queensland, I naturally took a deep interest in the question. In my opinion, there is no place more suitable, where a sufficient area of Crown lands can be obtained. And even there it will be necessary to purchase a certain amount of privately-owned land, though the proportion is inconsiderable, and the land of no great value. There is, I may say, an admirable water supply, and the. Glasshouse mountains make a splendid background behind the targets. There is, I believe, only one small farm of no great value which it would be necessary to purchase.",36
263,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I shall be glad to show the honourable member, or any honourable member, the reports on the question. It would suit the Department well to have Beerburrum, but the reports are somewhat disquieting.",36
264,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,What are the objections ?,36
265,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Finalit y could be reached easily with the State Government in the case of Beerburrum.,36
266,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is the point, and I am satisfied that the place is a good one for the purpose. The State Government have reserved the land for seven or eight years, and we cannot expect them to continue to reserve it , in view of the present rate of land settlement.",36
267,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Is Beerburrum near Brisbane ?,36
268,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"It is thirty-five or forty miles by rail from Brisbane.

271,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That sort of training they can get without breaking into the ordinary camp training, or the time allotted for shell practice. Of course, under the new system, the Field Artillery will probably be out in camp at two periods of the year; at any rate, I desire to impress on the Minister the necessity of coming to some finality. As a State Minister, and as an officer commanding this particular branch of the militia, I can say that, so far as my knowledge goes, there is no doubt that this site is most suitable, and could be obtained at a reasonable price, not only for the purposes of an artillery range, but as a general manoeuvring and camping ground.

We all know that this rifle range ought to have been provided years ago. The money was appropriated early last year, and yet, so far as this rifle range is concerned, we are in the same position now that we were then.",37
272,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"There has been an advance.  and the reply always given by the authorities is that there is no money for the work. There is neglect of duty on the part of somebody, but whether it be the Minister or the Military Engineer we provided for last vear, I cannot say; and I should like the Minister to explain.",37
273,Mr EWING,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Richmond-Minister of Defence) [6.7] - The difficulty in regard to the Brisbane rifle range is one of long standing. I presume that every honourable member remembers the discussions we have had regarding the various sites, and, speaking from memory, it was twelve months ago that the present site was determined on. When I was in Brisbane about four months ago, arrangements had been completed for obtaining this site. The matter is brought to my mind clearly, because it was represented to me that the option would cease if we did not close at once; and I wired to the Department of Home Affairs, from which instructions were sent down to settle the matter. I know that the Commonwealth is in possession of the site, and that the work isgoing on.  sixpence had been spent.",37

275,Colonel FOXTON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I happen to know from private sources that some portion of this property has been transferred to the Commonwealth; and I am quite sure that the vendors would not execute the transfer unless they had been paid.,37

I wish toabout know what has become of the balance of last year's appropriation. Has the Department discovered that it asked for toomuch, and that £ 5 6 will do what JS needed? Proper drill-halls are required in one or two important centres in Tasmania, and I . have already brought under the Minister's notice, in writing, the requirements of Sheffield in this connection.

281,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"It has been pointed out that, because of delays of various kinds which have been explained, large sums were not expended by the Department of Home Affairs last year, and we have not asked for re-votes of the full amounts this year, be-cause we wish to prevent the repetition of what then occurred.",38

I find that where a work is to cost only £ 8 0 0 or £ 9 0 0 , we are asked to make provision for its partial construction this vear, with a view, I suppose, to its completion next year. Apparently, Ministers have been paring down the expenditure in every direction, and their provision for new works and buildings is, to a large extent, a sham.",38
291,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,There is a number of large commitments which will not come before Parliament again next year.,38
292,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"£ 1 , 5 0 0 is proposed to be re-voted towards the cost of alterations in the General Post Office, Sydney. There has been great complaint about the lack of room there for the satisfactory transaction of business, and last year £ 7 , 0 0 0 was appropriated to meet the case. But nothing was expended, and, notwithstanding that the Minister himself has declared the alterations to be urgently heeded, only £ 1 , 5 0 0 is asked for this year.",38
293,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Because we are spending a large sum on a parcels post office elsewhere, and are also leasing premises. The alterations to the main building will, therefore, not cost anything like the original estimate.",38
294,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The total cost is £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 . The cost of the parcels post office is estimated at £ 2 6 , 5 0 0 , but only £ 1 , 0 0 0 is to be voted towards the work this year. For a post office at Katoomba, £ 7 0 0 was voted last year, but not a penny of the amount was spent, and this year only £ 3 0 0 is to be re-voted. Why a small work of that kind cannot be completed within the year I do not know; the plans and specifications should be ready. For a post office at Lithgow, estimated to cost £ 2 , 0 0 0 , £ 1 , 0 0 0 was appropriated last year, but nothing spent, and only £500 is to be re-voted this year.",38
295,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,That has been explained.,39
296,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Thes e cases do not seem to be capable of reasonable explanation. It is not surprising that the administration of the Department is considered unsatisfactory. For a post office at Murwillumbah, estimated to cost £1,500, that amount was voted last year but nothing expended, and we are now asked to re-vote only £500. Apparently, even small buildings are to be erected on the instalment principle, so much being done each year. The Tingha post office was estimated to cost £800, and £40 0 was voted for it last year; but nothing was spent, and the re-vote this year is only",39
297,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Will the Department be able to spend that amount in the year?,39
298,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,It might do so with an effort.,39
299,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,It will make a big try. These matters are under the control of the Minister of Home Affairs.,39
300,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I hope that the Minister will succeed in getting that large amount spent. I am not blaming the Postmaster-General. The fault lies, apparently, with the Treasurer, or another Minister, but the Ministry, at all events, must be held responsible. We find that in respect of a building which is to cost £800, it is proposed to expend this year only £100 , although £400 was voted for the same work last year. In the next item we have provision made for an expenditure of £400 on a post-office at Wahroonga, the total cost of which is to be £1,750, and in respect of which £1,400 was appropriated last year. Then we have an item of £600 towards the cost of a telephone exchange at Ashfield, which will involve an expenditure of £1,500, and in respect of which £600 was voted last year.",39
301,Mr REID,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Ite m 21 relates to the construction of post-offices at an estimated cost of £6,000, which is to be spread over four years. Only £1,500 is to be appropriated this year.",39
302,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is so; but I have been dealing only with items in respect of which appropriations were made last year. There is no excuse for all the delay that is taking place in nexion with these works. The administration of our Departments must have reached an extraordinary stage, when having had twelve months in which to prepare plans and specifications for a building estimated to cost £800, it is found impossible to expend more than £ 1 0 0 in respect of that work during the current financial 1 year. I have alluded to these items, not because they relate to New South Wales, but because they are! grouped more comprehensively in this estitnate than in those relating to the other States. The Estimates in regard to new works in other States, however, disclose the same unsatisfactory position. The examples I have given show that there is gross mismanagement somewhere.",39
303,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,It is to avoid mismanagement that we are. adopting thispractice.,39
304,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Surely , the honourable member does not mean to say that this practice is to be adoptedthat only £ 1 0 0 is to be expended during the year in respect of a building estimated' to cost £ 8 o s , and the plans and specifications for which the Department has had' nine months to prepare.",39
305,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"No ; but under this-' system we shall learn what can be done, and shall be able to say that we have expended all that has been appropriated.",39
306,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"It seems to me that it is simply the result of an effort to cut down the Estimates. We are asked to commit ourselves to a state of affairs far worse than has been disclosed in connection with any other Estimates. In connection with only four items, out of a total of eighteen, for which appropriations have already been made, has any expenditure been incurred. No satisfactory explanation is possible.",39
307,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,We have; admitted that.,39
308,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Minister does not recognise that he is admitting, not only that the system has beenunsatisfactory, but that it is to be still more unsatisfactory. Reference has beenmade to the desirableness of creating a Commonwealth Department of Public Works; but honourable members do not appear to recognise what it would cost to have Commonwealth officers all over Australia to supervise Commonwealth works. If our works are managed in this unsatiscon- factory way at the present time, what will' bt the position when we have - a Works Department of our own?",39
309,Mr MAUCER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I agree that the cost of such a Department would be enormous, but if we had had such a Department we should have avoided two-thirds of the delay that has taken place in carrying out Commonwealth works.",40
310,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I should like the honourable member to show what justification he has for that statement. The position, at all events, is unsatisfactory, and we seem to be drifting from bad to worse.",40
311,Unknown,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-4-5 p-m.,40
312,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Cowper) [7-45]--In the first item of this subdivision provision is made for an appropriation of £ 3 , 8 6 2 in respect of "" sundry offices."" Last year, the amount appropriated was £ 6 , 0 4 9 , d the amount actually expended a n was only £ 3 , 1 6 8 . This year we are to have a re-vote of £ 1 , 8 6 2 , and a new vote of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , making a total appropriation of £ 3 , 8 6 2 , or a sum slightly in excess of the actual expenditure under this heading last year. I fail to understand how the Postmaster-General is going to keep in repair all the post-offices in New South Wales and to make the necessary additions that are required in many instances with such an appropriation. It seems to me that we shall not be able to secure accommodation for the telephone exchanges that are urgently needed in many country districts, and that there is no likelihood of necessary improvements being made. If , as is proposed, we are to become the custodians of these transferred buildings, we must certainly keep them in repair, and a vote of £ 3 , 8 6 2 is wholly inadequate to maintain the many post-offices in New South Wales as they ought to be kept. The fact that the appropriation proposed to be made exceeds the actual expenditure of last year does not prove anything further than that we are to have an accumulation of unfinished works that should have been dealt with before. does not by any means prove that the expenditure under this heading last year was adequate. Representatives of country districts know that it was not, and it ""would seem that we cannot hope for any improvement during the current financial year. Unless we are to have a larger vote we cannot expect that attention to country postal buildings that should be given to them. The number of items in respect of which amounts are voted and re-voted is becoming remarkably large. In connection with a certain work in my own electorate there has been an item on the Estimates for three successive years, and we have not yet had the plans prepared. It is impossible to ascertain with whom the responsibility rests. Inftonnexion with the proposed ejection of a post office at Coff's Harbor, difficulty was experienced in obtaining a site, and now that a site has been secured, I learn that the man who prepared the plans for the proposed building apparently forgot that it was designed to be used as a post and telegraph office, and made no provision for a battery room. The Government cannot say that the delay in carrying out new works is due to the failure of the Parliament to place at the disposal of the Department the funds necessary to carry them out. It is for the Government first of all to propose what expenditure shall be incurred, and then to indicate how the money is to be found. In connection with a long list of new works in New South Wales, for which provision was made last year, we find that an expenditure on new works has been, incurred in only four cases. I hope that an end will be put to these delays. As to the item relating to the erection of telephone exchanges, I hope that the exchanges named therein are not the only ones that are to be erected this year. The proposed vote in respect of them is certainly £ 1 6 2 in excess of the appropriation made last year, but it is not sufficient to cover all that is required. I am in the unfortunate position of having within my electorate a partially-constructed telephone exchange which will be completed goodness knows when. In an important' centre in my electorate telephone poles were erected last April, but the telephone exchange has not yet been opened. In several other cases subscriptions have actually been collected from subscribers, but the exchanges have not yet been opened. What reason can there be for delay in opening offices or exchanges It the construction of which has been completed? I trust that I shall not be asked in this connection to exercise for another two years that patience which I have exhibited since my return to this Parliament. If I am, I am afraid that the breaking strain will be reached. I hope that I shall not be accused of parochialism in pointing to the singular fact that while the total appropriation in respect of post and telegraph buildings in New South Wales under subdivision No. i is £ 3 6 , 4 9 8 , it is posed to appropriate £ 1 1 9 , 5 8 4 in respect of similar works in Victoria. I do not that the provision made for these new on with. works in Victoria is in excess of what it the site has been bought. ought to be; I merely congratulate the people of this State on having ^>een able to secure for themselves such consideror does that appear somewhere else? ation. Ample provision ought certainly to be made for new postal works in a big State like New South Wales, which is not so developed as is Victoria, and Ihe requirements of the town. where we have magnificent distances. are other items to which I shall refer later on. T have only to say that in my opinion sufficient provision has not been the maintenance of postal buildings in New South Wales, and that the procedure is what it ought to be to enable new works to be carried out within a reasonable time. £ 2 , 9 7 6 was spent last year.",40

323,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The Minister has every opportunity of hurrying on the Home Affairs Department.,42
324,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,No opportunity whatever.,42
325,Mr KELLY,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Minister appears to be quite satisfied to say, "" It is not my fault,"" and do nothing. If I were the head of a Government Department I should do my best to stir up the cause of the delay. A large number of the excuses given by the Post and Telegraph Department for the non-fulfilment of promised public works are shown by these Estimates to have been not altogether veracious. I know instances in my own electorate-and other honourable members have numerous examples of the same thing-wher e works are said not to be proceeded with because of lack of funds, but these Estimates show that the Department has not utilized the funds voted. Last year £4,000 was voted for item 23-Erectio n of telephone exchanges at various suburbs of Sydney - and only £838 was spent. Those works are urgently necessary, and I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs to see that they are immediately put in hand, so that the money will be spent this year. We seem to go through the farce in this Parliament of constantly voting supplies for works, the money for which is not expended before the close of the year. The fault of this undoubtedly lies with the Ministries that have conducted Commonwealth affairs for the past seven or eight years. If they will not bring, down the estimates of the cost of public works, how can the officials of the Home Affairs Department proceed to put the works in hand? They cannot take steps in that direction until the Estimates are passed, and the Government take good care that the Estimates are usually the last thing submitted to Parliament before it rises. Under our system of doing business the Estimates should be submitted the momentParliament meets, and driven right through before we do anything else. Only by such, methods will the officials of the Departments be able to carry out works which Parliament has authorized. Until the Government of the day cease to conduct public business upon lines which tend to their own immediate comfort in this House, and' transact it for the public good,, we are bound to have the distorted and strained' finance of which the country has been complaining.",42
326,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Calare) [8.9]. r in the debates on these Estimates1 referred to the striking discrepancy between the amount appropriated last year and the amount expended. This division is a striking example. It applies to the Department of the Postmaster-General, in connection with which there have been during the year many urgent appeals for expenditure. Perhaps the Postmaster General will inform the Committee how it comes' about that, in the face of all the appeals for works, only £ j.0,000 of the £40,000 voted last year was expended.",42
327,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,That is a matter for the Department of Home Affairs.,42
328,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,But the expenditure relates to the Department of thePostmaster-General.,42
329,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,I have nothing at all to do with thei buildings.,42
330,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If the Postmaster-General has nothing to do with the construction, his Department has to find the money.",42
331,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Unfortunately , I have to find the money.",42
332,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"At any rate,, the Treasurer finds the money at the request of the Postmaster-General, and the Department of the latter has to find the plans.",42
333,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,No .,42
334,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Well , I should like some finality. I had occasionsome time ago to communicate with the Department in reference to the carrying out of works of this kind. First of all, I was referred to the Postmaster-General'sDepartment, where I was told that the matter in question was one for the Department of Home Affairs. At the Department of Home Affairs, the chancesare that I was told that it was a matter for the Department of the Postmaster General, or that the State Department was= responsible for the delay; and finally, no doubt, thq information was that, although everything was ready, the Treasurer had not provided the money. That is the sort of battledore and shuttlecock administration that goes on; and I desire to know who is responsible. Despite urgent appeals, only ,£10,000 out of the £40,000 voted was spent; and I desire to know whether we may expect a similar policy to be followed in the future. I notice there are appropriations for sundry offices, and, under this heading last year, out of the £6-,ooo voted, the sum of £2,800 was left unexpended. Much dissatisfaction has been caused in this connection; and I may say that in some of the larger offices in the country, the adoption of the condenser system of telephony has resulted in very primitive arrangements for carrying on the work. At Condobolin the telephone system is worked alongside the telegraph system, with much attendant inconvenience ; and the same remark applies to the office at Barmedman, where the public have to carry on their telephone conversations in the room devoted to the general work of the office, their conversations being heard at the public counter. As we all know, a great essential in the telephone business is privacy; and the only way to meet the public requirements is to have proper cabinets constructed. When, however, requests are made for cabinets, the reply is that there is no money to carry out the work, and the conditions under which it is carried out reflect no credit on the Department. Only during the present week I presented to the Postmaster-General a communication from the municipal council of Cowra, calling attention to the congested state of the business there, and the necessity for some reform, in the interests not only of the officers of the Department, but of the general public. I am pleased to know that the Postmaster-General is prepared to grant the requests made in this connection, and will ask the House - to grant a sum of money for the purpose. I should like to know, however, whether the work will be carried out this year. There is another item to which I should like to direct attention. There are many - farming centres, generally railway towns, which are growing in importance; and these are not like mining townships, which may disappear as mining ""gives out,"" but are substantial and progressive. In many such places it is necessary to convert offices from the non-official to the official status, Mr Thomas Brown. and the first step would be, of course, for the Department to acquire suitable sites, the selection of which, if left till later, may prove infinitely more expensive. Amongst such places are Manildra, Koorawatha, Stockinbingal, where, in the near future, there must be provided properly equipped official offices. It is not to be wondered at that, under the conditions which the Estimates disclose, there should be seething dissatisfaction in the Department itself, and amongst the people more particularly affected. There is a general absence of proper administration.",42
335,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Dalley) [8.24] - The discussion of the Estimates affords honourable members an opportunity to keep a watchful eye on the public expenditure. The honourable member for Calare has spoken of what the Estimates disclose; but, in my opinion, the Estimates are so framed as not to disclose;, but rather to hide facts which ought to be made public; and the items immediately under discussion afford a capital illustration. We find that, of the sum of £40,332 voted in 1907, only £10,933 s expended, and, wa as a matter of ordinary business, one would expect the unexpended balance to appear as a re-vote this year. As a matter of fact, however, instead of a re-vote of the balance, we are asked to vote a smaller sum. There is a considerable shortage. Either the discussion of the Estimates for 1907 was a sham, or the present discussion is one. The only other inference to be drawn is that the Minister last year misled the Committee, I do not say intentionally, or was misled by those who framed the Estimates. If £25,000 was required in connection with twenty-one items last year, and the money could not be spent, then, because it was impossible to get out the plans in time, we should not be asked to vote only £10,000 for the same items this year. The total expenditure in connection with these twenty-one items, including re-votes, is £19,420, which is less by £1,000 than the unspent balance of the appropriations of last year.",43
336,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,And no work has been done this year.,43
337,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Government are not expending money on new works this year, although the Estimates are for new works and additions.",43
338,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Thes e Estimates are faked.,43
339,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The honourable member, in his classical, Collins-street style, says that the Estimates are faked, and a shrewd man would, no doubt, take that view of them. At any rate, they disclose discrepancies which I do not understand. The mere fact that Parliament votes money does not prove the wisdom of the proposed expenditure. Does the Minister inquire of the experts who ask for the money whether the expenditure is necessary, and will give a profitable return? If , say, £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is applied for in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-General, are such questions asked ? If the directing officer of a large private business concern proposed a big expenditure, he would be called upon to show that it was necessary, and likely to be piofitable. Parliament, however seems satisfied to vote money without asking questions. When expenditure is needed, we should certainly make provision for it. But the Minister who proposes it should be armed with information by his expert advisers, showing that it is warranted. These Estimates have not been framed so that he who runs may read; a man is more likely 'to run away,- from them than to read them. I ask the Minister to explain why the re-votes on one particular page are less than the balances left over from the appropriations of last year. there has been no fresh expenditure this year, or that the amount voted last year was sufficient for this year also; or are we merely voting in the dark, trusting to chance for justification ?",44
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Parramatta) [8.32] - Some of the remarks addressed to the Chamber since the dinner adjournment are unreasonable, honourable members overlooking the need for balancing the public accounts. Are those who have indulged in this severe criticism aware that the Treasurer hopes, by means of his manipulation of the Estimates, to balance up his accounts so that at the end of the year he will not have a penny to his credit ?",44
341,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"This is conjuring, balancing.",44
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I call it doing the balancing trick. On almost every page of the Estimates there is evidence of manipulation, for the purpose of making the national expenditure balance the national income. I do not characterize this manipulation as dishonest. The Treasurer, however, has been compelled to pare down his proposals for expenditure in order that the total outgoing shall not exceed the one-fourth of the revenue which the Constitution permits the Commonwealth to expend. I take strong exception to the manner in which public works are now carried out. It is farcical to vote hundreds of thousands of pounds each year, knowing that the money wjll not be expended. In connection with one Department this year the re-votes total £ 9 0 , 0 0 0. But while, throughout the estimates of the Department of Home Affairs there is a continual stream of re-votes, there are no re-votes in connection with the appropriations over which the Departments concerned have direct control. For instance, there are no re-votes in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-General.",44
343,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"We spent all but £ 8 , 0 0 0 of the appropriation of last year. No revotes are asked for, because the appropriation was a general one, amounts not being allotted to specific works. Considering the magnitude of the sum, the actual was very near the estimated expenditure:",44
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I am complaining only of the difference between the way in which money is expended by the Is it that Department of Home Affairs and by other Departments. The more we control our own public works expenditure, and the less we rely upon State assistance, the better it will be for us. Five months of the year have nearly passed, and when the Estimates are through, we shall have to seek the assistance of State officers to oversee much of the proposed expenditure. They will take up the work when they have finished the task set them by their own Governments, and if the business of their offices is congested, our applications must stand over.",44
345,Mr MCDOUGALL,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,The States will have a good opportunity to further reproach the Commonwealth with incapacity.,44
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"We can alter this system if we choose. According to the not Minister who is representing the Minister of Home Affairs, we pay about 10 per cent, for the oversight and control of public works by State officials. If private clerks of works or architects were offered the task at such a commission, we should have fifty applicants for it .",44
347,Mr BOWDEN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,-Five hundred.,44
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Perhaps that is more likely. Notwithstanding that we pay a. high commission, the State works take precedence of ours. Therefore the present system is wasteful as regards expense, and disastrous as regards delay. The situation must be faced sooner or later, because, year by year, it is getting worse instead of better. And so it comes about that out of a total of £213,000 appropriated last year in' respect of new works connected with the - Post and Telegraph Department, £90,000 has not been expended.",45
349,Mr MCDOUGALL,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"And the bigger the volume of Commonwealth work going to the Public Works Departments of the lic States year by year, the less will be done.",45
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"That is evident. These re-votes are increasing year after year. The matter is one which we can, ought to remedy at the earliest possible moment. We have an expensive public works staff, and all that we need is to gsge more men. We have the men at the top of the service, and are paying them good salaries, but they have hardly any under them. We need more officers to finite undertake the supervision of these works for the Commonwealth. If we had more our works would be carried out with to greater expedition, and for far less than which they are at present. There are some recompelled, forms that we can bring about, notwithpenditure standing the present limitations and abilities of the Department. I do not see why the works represented by these re-votes should not be put in hand within a month of the passing of the Estimates. The partments might at least anticipate parsary this year. liamentary approval of re-votes. It seems to me, however, that the Departments practically nothing until the money has year. been voted ; that it is not until that stage is reached that they set to work to get the necessary plans. Everything should be In readiness. If Ministers do not give their Departments their head to a greater extent than they have been in the habit of doing, one-half of our appropriations each year will be absolutely sham votes, Inasmuch as they will not be expended within the year. With a large number Department. of unemployed, and a large expenditure sanctioned by Parliament, we are making a great show; but in its essence it is 3. sham. I blame Ministers themselves for much of what has happened in this connection. A change might be brought about,"" if a little more fearlessness were displayed in the administration of the Departments. The honourable member for Dalley referred to the fact that we have no estimate of the value that we derive from the money that we spend. I quite agree that we have a, right to know what this money is wanted for, and what is likely to be the result of its expenditure. We are told that an additional sum of '£2,000,000 needs to be expended to bring the Post and Telegraph Department up to date. Why was it left to a Royal Commission to obtain that statement from one of our highly placed and responsible pubofficers ? We have been told that, year after year, there has been a difficulty in obtaining money, for even small works required in connection with the Department. and Why is it that such a statement has not been made direct to this House, through the responsible Minister? If a further exenpenditure of £2,000,000 is required, Parliament should set itself steadily to face the position, but befoi;e we agree to such one an expenditure, we should have a very deidea as to the, direction that it is to take. The officer charged with the chief responsibility for the present condition of affairs, says that he requires £2,000,000 extricate himself from the position into he has been allowed, or perhaps 'to drift, and to meet that exwe find provision made on these disEstimates for an outlay of a little over For instance, £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",45

356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"When we get the Minister close to the penitent form, the honourable member will come no further, and so this condition of affairs has come about. I do not wish to indulge in any statements to the effect that, "" I told you so,"" but six years ago, I predicted, in a speech in this House, practically all that has happened regarding the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I saw then that nothing was being done to meet difficulties that were arising.",46
357,Mr FOSTER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,Has the honourable member suggested any remedy?,46
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"No fantastic remedy is needed. All that we require is capability at the head of the Department, and sufficient money to keep it up to date. When the Post and Telegraph Department was first taken over by the Commonwealth, we had the statement of experts that £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 was necessary to place it on a sound footing. I was ridiculed by many honourable members when I said then that we ought to face the position boldly, and that Ministers should ask for an additional vote of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , so that the Department might have a chance. As a matter of fact, it has never had a chance since its transfer. It has been going from bad to worse, until today we are told that an expenditure of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is necessary to place it on a proper basis. We do not know what the result in the end will be. .Certain it is that every year will find the position very much worse, and I hold that the Minister in charge of the Department must be held responsible. I am not referring particularly to the present Postmaster-General. The chief offender is the Prime Minister himself ; he is chiefly responsible for the present state of the Defence Department, as well as of the Post and Telegraph Department. The honourable gentleman has allowed no Minister to remain in either of those Departments long enough to make himself conversant with what needs to be done. For six years we have had a pro. cession of Ministers, through what are, perhaps, the two most important administrative offices in the Commonwealth. No Minister has remained long enough in either of them to enable him to gather up the threads of the difficulties which there present themselves, and the result is that they have simply been shelved.. Meantime, the policy of the Post and Telegraph Department, when any demand in the House has become clamant, has been to make a proposal for reducing by a shilling or two the prices, charged for certain services rendered. Whodoes not remember the statement, made from time to time by the ex-Postmaster General, that he would not be satisfied unt i l the people were able to secure a telephone service for is. per week? The officers of the Department are now telling, us that the telephone service is too cheap; that it is not commercially profitable. Is it not the height of absurdity-is it no: almost a national disaster-that Ministers should play with the interests of the country, as they have been doing, in connection with the Department ? Where are we to obtain any improvement ? I see no prospect of any. This Department can earn money if*it is permitted to do so. It can balance its own ledger very readily, if the Minister in charge of it is permitted to put it ona commercial basis. I am not arguing that that should be done. The Department, I know, has a developmental as well as a money making function.",46
359,Mr CHANTER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,A very strong one.,46
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I admit that to the full , but there must be reason in all' things. Since the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth, it has lost on its transactions nearly £2,500,000. The total debit shown in the balance-sheet, since the Department was transferred, is about £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , but if we add to that interest year by year, since the date of transfer, we find that the debit is nearer £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 than £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , as stated by the Postmaster-General. The Department, which haslost £2,500,000, now requires an additional expenditure of £2,000,000 it right. Yet Ministers come to the House, year by year, with nothing but proposals to make this service and that service cheaper. We have evidence of absolute want of business control of the Departthe ment, and it is only left to those who are not familiar with all the minutia its control to blame the Minister in charge of it, who is solely responsible. to expect re-votes to the extent of£roo,ooo on the next Estimates? I am addressing myself now to the honorary Minister, represents the Department of Home Affairs in this Chamber. I have never believed having spending Departments out Chamber. It may be convenient sometimes to have them elsewhere, but it should be only temporarily. The spending Deat partments ought to be here where the exis only a sham. penditure is initiated. Can thehonorary Minister state whether any better steps have been taken in connection with this year's - expenditure than in connection with last year's? Nearly five months of the year have gone, whereas only three months last year had gone when the Works Estit mates were voted; yet, with nine months to spend the money in, re-votes to the exin tent of £90,000 are asked for. How much are we likely to have to re-vote next seeing that only about seven months of present financial year remain in which spend the whole of this money ? It apThe pears that things will oe worse next year instead of better, and I urge the honorary Minister to see if he cannot quicken the surplus to the States. pace of the Department so as to expend the money and find work for those who are badly wanting it just now in various parts of Australia, and so, in carrying out the intentions of Parliament, do a little good for. the great unemployed problem outside. This money is in small amounts which are distributed well over Australia. I know of no money that could be spent to more advantage in finding labour for those who in the way. want it; but, instead' of being spent, the votes appear year after year. It may be an excellent way to keep quiet those mema bers who have these amounts on the Estidelay. mates, but it is not honest that the money - should be voted and re-voted year after year with people crying out for these works, while we are able to tell them thing except that the money is on the mates. I hope we shall see a better state of things during this financial year. Mr Josefh Cook.  to put is not the first time that I have complained of the slowness with which works are done, but I feel that the system is more to blame than are the Departments. Is there anything to prevent us doing as is done in States, for instance? If we vote a sum of money for a work this year, why of cannot it be credited to that particular work, instead of being re-voted? There is Are we nothing to prevent that being done, and then the work could go on without waiting for a re-vote. The money would have to who be accounted for, and would have to be spent on the particular work for which it in was voted. That appears to be the only of this solution of the difficulty.",46
361,Mr WILKS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"If it were not for the revotes we should have no Works Estimates all this year, so that the present system  recognise that the better. It is unfair to complain of the Departments, which can do nothing for months after we meet..

They have done their best to do it wfienever they have obtained authority, but the trouble is to get the authority. All these works have been on the Estimates for some time, yet there is no authority for the Departments to go on with them, and it is not fair to make it appear that the States Departments stand",47

I have folnolowed out cases where: money had been Estivoted for a work, and afterwards had to be re-voted for several successive years. In every instance I have proved that it is not the State officials that are to blame, nor do I want the blame on the Home Affairs Department. They have not the time in which to do the work, because the system is wrong. Tf a post-office is to be built somewhere, and the work cannot be done before the end of this financial year, why cannot the work) be credited with the amount voted, instead of our having to revote the money again next year?

The honourable member, however, overlooked the That fact that hitherto we have had to adjust the balances with the States at the end of the financial year, whereas we are at liberty now to modify that practice in a direction indicated by the High Court in its judgment on a recent measure-on e which I ventured on the floor of the House to approve of. So long as we appropriated the various amounts, we a pure could have got over the difficulty which stood in our way, but we did not do so. The whole question lay in the amounts being properly appropriated. There is. great strength in the contention that the amounts included in the re-votes have already been properly appropriated for specific purposes, and that we should have been justified in retaining them instead of handing them over to the States if we had so desired. I am also in entire sympathy with those honourable members who have revealed to-night the extraordinary position that under the present Estimates there are to be voted, for works previously approved of, smaller sums than were voted for the same items last year. For myself, I have no complaint to make on behalf of my own electorate, the Postmaster-General having seen the full force of the representations made to him in favour of increased accommodation and facilities. This is a Department which enters into the daily life of every man, woman, and child, whatever position they may occupy; and there ought to be, at any rate, greater continuity of method and policv. The present Postmaster-General is following one who energetically endeavoured to fulfil the important duties of his position : but we have had so many Postmasters-General, with changes of policy, that the Department is not now in anything - like proper working order. facilities should be increased and perfected ; and that can only be brought about by the Government grappling the question in a business-like manner, and letting the country and the House know whether it is the postal branch, the telegraph branch, or the telephone branch which is a drain on the resources. I have previously pleaded for a segregation of the accounts so that we might be enabled to obtain specific information on this point; but at the present time, notwithstanding promises that have been made, we are entirely in the dark. I do not look for anv practical results from the Royal Commission, the time of which seems to be taken up in criticising certain officers.",48

The honourable member who preceded me has justification for his request that somemethod should be adopted whereby the permanent officers of the Department,, whether of Home Affairs or the Postmaster-General, shall not be under thenecessity of waiting for specific votes before undertaking necessary expenditure. The Department of the Postmaster-General isj of all others, one of which the head' should be allowed a free hand in judiciousand thoughtful expenditure; and the suggestion I have referred to is well worthy of the consideration of both the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer.

380,Mr SPENCE,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Darling Downs) [9.18] - In these re-votes, and the construction of new work generally, we have the key to a great deal of dissatisfaction in the administration of this great Department which so closely affects every individual member of the community. If a new post office is required, for instance, the local bodies move, reports are made by if the inspectors, the project is considered by the heads of the Departments, and, all the routine having been gone through, the Treasurer is called upon to find the money. Even then, the question has to come before Parliament; and it is not decided until members have tired themselves outtalking on the financial statement. Eventhen, when the Works Estimates have been passed, it takes about three months to secure the site, and then plans have to honourable be adopted so that in some cases the end of the year has arrived, and the peoplehave to wait for the passing of the next Estimates before the post-office is provided. I do not know how many years it is since a post-office was promised and provided for in part of my constituency; but I see this year again ^ 4 0 0 has to be re-voted for the purpose. It is evident that the whole system is wrong; and we all must bear the responsibility. For myself I do not see why the Works Estimates should not be proceeded with before the Financial Statement, as would be done in any ordinary business concern. I suppose that we have copied the States in beginning our financial year on the ist July, but it seems to me tiiat it would be more convenient in many respects to commences it on the ist January. We have a number of very able and intelligent men in high positions in the Department of Home Affairs, and, other Departments, and there ought to be no lack of suggestions to enable us to get over our difficulties. We here are supposed to be the cream of the intelligence of the Parliaments of die country; and we ought to be able to show the States an example and evolve some better plan; and inci-dently I may point out that we have had Royal Commissions and Select Committees to investigate much less important questions. Although there are amongst honourable members a number of able financiers, we have not been able to evolve a practical scheme of getting our works carried - out in reasonable time. In New South Wales the Commonwealth works are carried ' out by the States officials, who very naturally are expected to see to the work of the State first. The Commonwealth work is a sort of extra job, and the system is byno means working satisfactorily. It would appear as though we should have to establish a Works Department of our own, because it is too much to expect from human nature that the States officers shall attend to the Commonwealth business first. There is not such a friendly feeling on the part - of the Mother State to the Commonwealth as we would desire, although, of course, I do not presume to say that that has any influence on the officers' who have to carry - out our public works. In any case, our works are delayed, and , as a matter of fact, appear to be forgotten. highly desirable that we should have - officers of our own, whom we could hold responsible to the Commonwealth, .and to the Commonwealth only. seems to me that the present method is unbusinesslike, and should be altered. We might, perhaps, deal with the Works Estimates before discussing the financial statement as a whole. It might be well to decide, in the first instance, what works are absolutely necessary, and then provide money for them. In this way a considerable amount of time might be gained. In any case, there must be delay; but the delays now are disgraceful, and it is not surprising that the public is disgusted. The promise is made that a certain work will be carried out when the Estimates are passed, but after that nothing is done. In one town in my electorate the local people have spent money in providing wire and poles for a telephone connection; but the Department has not performed its part of the contract. These people would not have spent their money had they known that so much delay would occur. There are many minor works, for which only general provision need be made by Parliament. I hope that the Commission of inquiry will make some suggestions in this matter. A Department like that of the Postmaster General should be given a considerable sum out of which to provide for minor works. At present it suffers considerably from lack of funds, not only in the carrying out of urgent works, but even in regard to the manning of offices. I have already complained that, in one instance, an office is being run almost by boys, the letters being delivered by contract until recently, when the contractor went on strike, because he was not receiving enough pay. It should not be necessary to wait until the financial proposals of the Government have been discussed at length to get authority for necessary expenditure. My suggestion is that the Works Estimates should be brought forward at the beginning of the financial year, questions of finance being dealt with later. At present, officers are often asked to carry out works in anticipation of parliamentary approval, and there is always the risk that Parliament may not sanction these works.",49
381,Mr FOSTER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"New England) [9.33] The criticism of these Estimates forces one to two conclusions, that the spending De1 partments should hustle more to get works It is constructed, and that the Department of the Postmaster-General is in need of more funds. I have a plea to make on behalf of the country districts. While the wants of It the people in the cities are fairly attended to, those who are struggling in the country, in positions of isolation, are dealt with a very niggard fashion. Only £ 1 0 0 is down for the construction of the Tingha Post Office. It took the Department o Home Affairs eighteen months to buy a site country. for this post-office. I do not advocate that the Department of the Postmaster-General should be run on commercial lines, but, in a matter of this kind, more business like methods might be introduced with advanhas tage. Mr Wertheim did not wait long able after the passing of tfie'Tariff to purchase a site for, and lay the foundation of, his large piano factory. But the Department of Home Affairs was eighteen months buying a site for a country post-office, on 30th June. which it is proposed to expend this year o n ' y i Q - The people in the country dis1 0 0 tricts need telephonic and telegraphic munication more than do those in the city, who live close to each other. At Tingha the business of the Department is quaddoes rupled, but the work has to be performed in a ITttfe crib, which has now from the old site to the new. Then, the important commercial centres of Tamworth and Gunnedah require to be linked together by telephone. That could small expense, ancl yet no amount has been put on the Estimates for it . There is line from Brisbane to Wallangarra, but, as it is not to be continued on to Sydney, business of the northern districts is congested. This extreme niggardliness towards the people in the country must arouse feelments ing. In one instance, after the local people had agreed to place on the ground the poles necessary for a telephone extension, the Department found that it had no money to carry out the work, although the length the line would be only four miles. Not only does the Department say that it has no money for these works, but it also comwith plains that, if carried out, they would produce sufficient revenue. Those in the country have never asked for i d . teletake phone messages. Sooner than be without telephone communication, they would pay rate of 3d. The TCI. rate may be sufficient m the towns, where thousands of calls are made each day, but the country people would not mind paying more if they could get the convenience. It is obvious construction branch is undermanned, because in thriving districts work cannot done, by reason of the inadequacy of the goes on. staff.

392,Mr BATCHELOR,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I sympathize with the complaint that in many cases only a very small proportion of the appropriations made is actually expended, and think that some method ought to be adopted by which an earlier start might be made with newworks every year. I do not agree, however, with those who say that we should not avail ourselves of the Works Departments of the States, and that we should have in all the States a huge Commonwealth Public Works staff to supervise our undertakings. It frequently happens that States officers, while supervising State works in country towns, can at the same time attend to Commonwealth works there, and in that wav much overlapping is avoided. Speaking generally, no complaint of delay in canving out Commonwealth works can be madeagainst the officers of the Public Works Department of South Australia. In many cases, they have appealed to honourable members to hasten the giving of the necessary authority to go on with works for which they have everything in readiness.",52

I have never been able to ascertain the basis on which the Department determines what is the proper amount to expend in respect of postal buildings in different towns. In some cases, offices costing £ 4 , 0 0 0 are erected in small towns, whilst buildings costing only a few hundred pounds are provided in large centres of population. By way of example, I would point *o the fact that a town in my electorate, having a population of 20,000, has been able to secure an expenditure of only £ 3 0 0 or £ 4 0 0 on additions to the post-office there, whereas it is proposed to expend £ 3 , 8 0 0 on new postal buildings in a centre of population in the electorate of Kooyong.",52

I do not grudge it the proposed expenditure, although I have invariably found that representatives of South Australia experit-nce the utmost difficulty in securing a vote for a small post-office, or even a minor alteration to a postal building in that State. Since Federation, we have had much less than our fair proportion of expenditure on a population basis. If the Department is short of funds, I do not object to this treatment; but I certainjy do object to large sums being expended on postal buildings in small centres in some of the States, when a comparatively small expenditure that is urgently necessary in connection with postal buildings in South Australia is withheld.",52

I believe lhat that expenditure is justifiable, but when I appealed to the Postmaster-General to provide a telephone exchange at Norwood, I was met with the statement by the postal authorities that the most that could be done this year was to make provision for the purchase of a site. If the Department finds it difficult to provide funds towards the purchase of a site in one case, how is it possible for it to find the money necessary for the erection of exchanges in the suburbs of Sydney ? For seven or eight years, I have been urging the claims of one town in South Australia to an exchange; but have not been able to secure its proper recognition. The postal authorities have no right to cut down proposed works in South Australia, whilst at the same time they deal liberally with the other States.

That is disproportionate; but on that score I am making no complaint, because it would be absurd to suppose that the moneys can be allocated on a per capita basis.

Amongst other items, there was one for the construction of special telephone lines from Sydney to Woollongong, Sydney to Katoomba, and Sydney to Gosford. It was stated that unless an expenditure of £52,5.58 was incurred, it would be impossible to complete essential works in New South Wales. A little further on the Treasurer stated that there was no doubt that a great deal of the work asked for was of an urgent nature, and that it was very desirable that it should be undertaken during the present financial year. He made a reference to the Treasurer's Advance Account, out of which the money would be paid. In his statement he said I make this statement now, in order that Parliament may understand the situation, and not be surprised if additional estimates for new works and buildings to the amount of about j£i20,ooo are introduced. In the meantime, unless any very strong objection is taken I shall anticipate the approval of Parliament authorizing such works as appear to me to be of the most urgent character. I desire to keep the expenditure, if possible, within the limit expressed in my Budget speech. On the 13th December, 1907, the Treasurer said that these works were of such an urgent character that he could not wait for' any Supplementary Estimates passed-they were not passed until the following April-but wanted to put them in hand at once. When I asked the honourable gentleman the other day, on the motion for adjournment, whether the construction of the trunk line to Katoomba was being proceeded with, he said ""No."" I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether provision for the construction of three special trunk' lines for New South Wales-from Sydney to Woollongong, from Sydney to Katoomba, and from Sydney to Gosford-is included in this item"" of £49,rot, and, if not, when the Department ' intends to proceed with the works which his officers have reported are of an urgent character. Although these lines were not included in last year's Estimates, the Treasurer considered them so urgent that he made, as I have shown, a special statement to the House in, reference to them, and proposed to proceed with them in anticipation of the vote of the House. With the passing of time, the urgency has not decreased, but has rather increased. Mr Bowden.",58
465,Mr MAUGER,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"The Treasurer has already stated that the works are not provided for on these Estimates; but that, if possible, more money will be advanced to the Department for the purpose of carrying them out. They have been put on the list of urgent works required, but are not provided for. It has been stated today that in order to carry out urgent works, such as have been mentioned, the Department would require an appropriation of £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but it is not possible to make that provision at this juncture.",59
466,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Calare> [10.54] - The honourable member for Parramatta mentioned how his electorate had suffered at the hands of the Department, owing to its inability to meet the great needs of his constituents, although it was in close touch with the city. If that is the case with respect to an old-settled electorate, what is it in the case of those electorates which would each include the whole of the electorates round Sydney, and leave a lot of room to spare? Take, for by instance, my electorate, which extends from near Dubbo to Cootamundra, and from near Mount MCDonald to near Euabalong, an immense area of country which practically comprises the wheat growing belt of the State. Settlement is extending rapidly there, and provision of this character is required in order to bring to be the settlers in touch with larger centres, and thus enable them to conduct their business. During the last twelve months, the complaint has been that, whilst the Sydney postal authorities have recognised the needs of these centres, and are satisfied that the extension of telegraph and telephonic communication which was asked for would be a good paying proposition to the Department, still they have not been able to act, because the necessary money had not been provided for them. Here is a section which is under the direct control of the Postmaster-General, and I find that whilst on some items the expenditure has exceeded the appropriation, on other items the appropriation has exceeded the expenditure, leaving an unexpended balance of something like £I<B,OOO. Take the first item, "" Construction and extension of telegraph lines, instruments, and material."" £ 2 1 , 5 0 6 was voted, and only £ 1 5 , 3 9 6 wa« expended, leaving an unexpended balance of £ 6 , 1 1 0 . That has happened in spite of the fact that a number of the lines have been held up because it was r alleged that no money was available. Only recently I brought before the Department 0 proposal to construct a line between Cudal ancl Manildra, which - is very urgently required, to provide telegraphic and telephonic communication, and the reply was that the work had been considered and approved, but could not be carried out until Parliament had made the necessary provision. Let me now take the next item, "" Construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including the construction of conduits and placing - wires underground."" Last year the appropriation was £ 7 9 , 9 1 1 , and the expenditure was £ 8 3 , 1 7 9 , or £ 3 , 2 6 8 in excess of the appropriation. While that was so, and a large number of applications are held up awaiting the provision of funds, still, on these Estimates, it is proposed to appropriate only £ 4 9 , 1 0 1 , or about £ 3 4 , 0 0 0 less than was spent last year. very important Department, in a very vital - direction so far as settlement is concerned, is asked to be satisfied in the coming year with about £ 3 4 , 0 0 0 less than was expended last year; ancl with that increased expenditure, last year a large number of applications from country centres - had to be held up. I - lot of correspondence read, would bring home this grievance very strongly to the Minister; but I shall - content myself with reading two communications. From the Deputy Postmaster General in Sydney, I received a communication saying that an application for a telephone exchange at Koorawatha hacl practically been approved; but he goes on to sayI may add, however, that even if the establishment of the exchange mentioned was approved of the question as to when the work - could be carried out would depend on the provision by Parliament of funds for new works - of this class. Still, in face of that statement, we are asked to vote nearly £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 less than was expended last year. Here is another communication, which I handed to the Postmaster-General a few days ago. It relates to a proposal which has been under consideration for a very considerable time. At. 'last, when the writer had got fairly desperate over the matter, he wrote in these termsIn Teply to your communication re telephone from Con'doblin lo Bobadah, I have to point out - that you have taken about eight months to give a reply, and at this rate of progress it would take about 80 years to build the line, if you live long enough to decide to do so. You estimate the cost of construction at £i,7S<o, but I would like you to understand that it is not a heavy line of railway we are asking for. The writer goes on to suggest that the Postmaster-General might allow that community to construct the line, and use it for twenty years, when they would be prepared to hand it over to the Department, provided that they were allowed to utilize all the revenue it earned during that period. That is a sample of the correspondence which honourable members receive and forward to the Department,, as the outcome of the policy which has been pursued during the past few years. I am considerably disappointed with the provision made on this year's Estimates.",59
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,And yet the honourable member voted that the Budget was satisfactory. This Mr THOM AS BROWN - I did not. The honourable member knows that the motion to which he refers was moved with the object of consolidating the opponents of the Labour movement in this House.,60
468,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Nothin g of the kind. Mr THOM AS BROWN - Notwith have a standing that the Department, in order to which, if meet urgent demands from country dis tricts, had to exceed the appropriation made last year, the Estimates submitted in respect of new works and buildings this year provide for an expenditure of nearly £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 less than was actually expended last year on works that are absolutely necessary to the development and progress of the Commonwealth. I must express my dissatisfaction at the arrangements that are being made. I hope that supplementary Estimates will be submitted so that the bare needs of this side of the Department may be supplied.",60
469,Mr JH CATTS,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"Cook) [ n . 2 ] - I wish to enter a protest on lines similar to those which have been adopted by the honourable member for Calare in regard to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I have in mv electorate a business man who has been endeavouring for six or seven months to have 'his premises connected with the telephone exchange. So far he has been unable to obtain any satisfaction from the Department, and only today, in response to a further request that I made on his behalf, I received 'another stereotyped reply from the Department. One could understand the cry of want of funds if big works were involved, but it is ridiculous to think that the Department is unable to supply a telephone connection. The position is humiliating.",60

566,Mr BOWDEN,PREMISE SLEASED BY THE,"I recollect that occasion of the last Empire Day celebrations there were about fifty or sixty cadets at Parramatta South who possessed only dozen rifles between them. One of cadets adversely criticised the Government, because some of the boys were provided with Chinese crackers in lieu of rifles, which to salute the flag. The whole of cadets from the Parramatta South Superior Public School possessed only about a dozen rifles between them. Wherever one goes one hears complaints that the cadets canment not obtain a sufficient supply of rifles, that very little encouragement is given to boys to join the cadet forces. I note also that it is proposed to appropriate only for the purchase of torpedoes and gyrowill scopes, notwithstanding that £ 3 9 0 was factory -- voted in this connection last year, every penny of which was expended.
