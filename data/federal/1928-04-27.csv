7,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In ono of last evening's newspapers appeared a statement under the headings "" Economic Council to be appointed-Eedera l Government's latest plank-Bod y to advise Cabinet."" The report proceeded to explain that the proposed council is to provide a thinking department, within the administration at the elbow of the inner ring of Cabinet, which will warn Ministers of what is ahead and advise them on all board questions of economic policy. I ask the Prinu. Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to appoint such a council, and, if so, whether its duties will be as stated in that report?",13
8,Mr BRUOE,Unknown,"I have not seen the paragraph to which the honourable member has referred, but it is obvious, from the language employed, that it is based upon the "" Yellow Book "" published by the Liberal Party in Great Britain after continuous investigation by many members of the party and leading economists over a period of two years. The Government does not propose to take action of the nature suggested, but the subject of economic research with a view to greater and more accurate information being made available to the people of Australia generally, has been under the tion of Ministers for some time past. ""WESTEEN AUSTRALIAN LOAN.",13

If so, can the honourable gentleman explain why that loan was so successful in comparison with flotations by the Commonwealth Government ?",14
10,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Tb e Western an Australian loan was floated under the auspices of the Australian Loan Council, and I assume that one reason success is the recent passage of th& Einancial Agreement Bill.

I was assured that that meetwould be held soon after Easter and that a reply would be sent to the invitation I issued to representatives of trade unions and employers to attend a conference in Canberra. I bave asked the President of the Council to let me bave a reply at the earliest possible date, and as soon as it is received the Government will determine what action it will take in regard to the amending Arbitration Bill. NA PRODUCTION. Mr J. FRANCIS, asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. What quantity ot butter and cheese was produced in each State of the Commonwealth for the years 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927? 2. What quantity of each State's production of butter and cheese was exported in each of the years mentioned?  being obtained. NA PUMPS. Mr COLEMAN, asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether the information sought by a question on the 23rd March last by the honourable member for Beid, relating to importations of petrol pumps, has yet been obtained, and, if so, what action, if any, has been taken or is contemplated?  tion embodied in the honourable member's previous question is substantially correctRegarding what action has been taken, I might state that' some time ago four local manufacturers of petrol pumps requested increased duties. As there were a number of other manufacturers in the various States these were communicated with, and the result was that three manufacturers informed the department that the present rates of duty were sufficient to adequately protect the industry, whilst seven did not reply. This want of unanimity and apparent indifference may be because all the petrol companies distributing here are understood to be now obtaining their pumps from local manufacturers. Another company wbicb is entering the trade will I hope in future do the same, and thereby fall into line with the strong local feeling regarding the matter. I understand that further representations will be made by the petrol pump industry on the subject. PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE.",14

27,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Yesterday the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) asked me whether it was true that the North Australia Commission or some other Government authority had granted leases to Afghans adjacent to the established camp of aborigines at Alice Springs. I have since ascertained that four leases are held by Afghans at Alice Springs. Three of these were granted six years ago, and one seven years ago. All of these leases were granted prior to , the appointment of the North Australia Commission and prior to the appointment of the Government Resident. I am assured by the Government Resident of Central Australia that the aboriginals' camp is balf a mile distant from the nearest town block and that every possible precaution is taken by the local police to safeguard the moral well-being of the aboriginals. There is also a resident missionary at Alice Springs who assists in this work. Arrangements bave been made in connection with the advance"" of railway construction to remove the aborigines'"" camp to a distance of at least 5 miles from any construction work. EXPORTS. FREIGHT REDUCTIONS.",16
28,Mr BRUCE,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"On the 7 t h M a r c h the honourable member for D all e y (Mr Theodore) asked the following question, upon notice 1. What was the number of cases of apples exported from (a) Tasmania, and (6) all other States, to the United Kingdom and Europe for the year ended 30th September, and what was the amount of freight saved on these shipments owing to the reduction in freight rates announced by the Shipping Board in July, 1926? 2. What was the total quantity of frozen beef, mutton, lamb, and sundries, exported from Australia to the United Kingdom and Europe for the year ended 30th September, 1927, and what was the amount of freight saved on these shipments owing to the reduction in freight rates announced by the Shipping Board in July, 1926. 3. What was the quantity of wool, both scoured and greasy, exported from Australia to the United Kingdom and Europe for the year ended -30th September, 1927, and what was the amount of freight saved on these shipments owing to the reduction in freight rates a?inouiiced by the Shipping Board in July, 1920? 4. What was the total quantity of each of the following commodities exported from Australia to the United Kingdom and Europe for the year ended 30th September, 1927:Oranges and other fresh f r u it excluding apples: Butter and lard; Cheese; Hides and Skins; Rabbits; Cased goods; Other exports usually classified as ""General cargo."" and what was the amount of freight saved on each of these classes of shipments owing to the reduction in the freight rates announced by the Shipping Board in July, 1926? I am now in a. position to furnish the following reply:The honourable member's questions are so framed as to suggest that all the reductions in freight on the commodities mentioned,"" whether carried in ships of the Commonwealth Shipping Line or in other ships, were the result of action taken by the Commonwealth Shipping Board. This suggestion is not justified. The following freight reductions were announced in July, 1926, by all Britiish Commodity. Beductlon in Freight.

AUSTRALIANCOMMONWEALTH Australia LINE OE STEAMERS . PAPER : TENDERS FOB PUBCHASE. Debate resumed from 24th A p r i page 4351), on motion by Mr BRUCEThat the paper be printed.",16
29,Mr SCTJLLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Y a r r a ) [11.18] To the motion moved by the Prime M in ister, that the papers in connection with the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers be printed, I move the following amendment:That all the words, after. ""That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu the words "" in the opinion of this House the Government, by the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, has sacrificed valuable public assets and has placed tralian producers, shippers, and our generally at the mercy of the shipping combine."" lines trading regularly to Australia, and the following quantities of the commodities mentioned were exported in the year ended 30th September, 1927:Quantity Bushel Exported Cram. 1,068,262 Tasmania to United Kingdom and Europe 449,282 Other States to United Kingdom and Europe 1,517,544 183,491,000 lb.* All States to United Kingdom and Europe 648,907,300 Ib.f All States to United Kingdom and Europe 86,065 cases All States to United Kingdom and Europe 1,072,018 boxes All States to United Kingdom and Europe 3,879,816. lb.

All States to United Kingdom and Europe 9.145 tons All States to United Kingdom and Europe which are not separately recorded in the Statistics, That amendment is an indictment containing two counts, wbicb I propose to place before honourable - members of this House. The first is that tbese sbips, which were the property of the people of Australia, bave been sacrificed; and the second is that the producers, the shippers and the people of generally, bave been betrayed to a shipping octopus.. In the dark days of the war, l (vid»- when we were dependent upon private shipping companies, a chaotic position existed with respect to the export of Australia's produce abroad. Our producers and our people generally were exploited; but in spite of the high charges which were levied, aud which amounted to profiteering and exploitation, the goods of this country were piled up on its wharves and in its warehouses, and we were unable to secure their exportation. thereof Our trade was almost completely paralyzed. What action was taken by the Government of the day? It discarded Ausprivate enterprise and turned to gopeople vernment control with the object of rescuing Australia from the position which it then occupied. When he launched this discussion the other day. the Prime Minister quoted from a number of conservative newspapers that had challenged his sincerity in regard to the sale of the Line. He waved triumphantly the papers containing the tenders as a proof that he always had been and still was sincere. There was no necessity for him to furnish proof of his sincerity in that matter. I give him full credit for it, if any credit can attach to him for it. Any. person who doubted his desire to sell the Line did not know the right honourable gentleman or his political views. It has been one of principal aims of his political life to dispose of the Line. One of the first important speeches which he delivered in the Commonwealth Parliament after his entry into it as a private member consisted of an attack upon the Line and a suggestion that we should get rid of it. When the Line was making huge profits it was attacked by honourable members who today sit behind the Government, on the ground that it was profiteering against the producers of Australia; yet when the board of management repeatedly reduced freights, thus compelling the private companies to come down to their level, and as a consequence showed a loss on their operations, those same gentlemen found fault with them on that account. Whichever way the Line operated, it did not suit them, because they have always clung to the fetish of private enterprise, and refuse to recognize anything good in Government control. The Prime Minister realized that he had not a good case. He padded out his speech by quoting at length a number of foolish or impossible conditions that were attached to some of the - tenders, using those tenders as a foil with the object of proving that the tender of the White Star Line was a considerable improvement upon them. He then proceeded to reply solemnly to an anonymous writer in a newspaper, whose communication I do not believe any other honourable member had read. It is a departure from ordinary procedure for the Prime Minister to attempt to bolster up the sale of valuable public property by answering arguments advanced by an anonymous writer in a newspaper. But he followed that by action wbicb was equally amusing; he solemnly set himself the task of answering arguments wbicb his mind suggested would be used by "" the man in the street."" According to him, the opinion of the man in the street was that these vessels had no value because they were losing money. What strange conduct it was for a Prime Minister to argue seriously on a subject of this importance, that our five beautif u l "" B a y "" and two splendid ""Dale"" steamers bave no value, and to pretend that be is putting the case for both sides ?",17
30,Mr SEABROOK,NORTH AND CENTRAL,The Leader of the the Opposition sbould not forget that the Prime Minister referred also to the misstatements of the Leader of the Opposition.,18
31,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I intend to deal with the statements that I have made; and after I have done so the honourable member for Franklin will not interject so glibly. The Australian Commonwealth Line has been sold. As some one has said, not only it, but also the people of Australia, have been sold - The price to be paid is £1,850,000, to which will be added the sum of £50,000 to bring our Australian seamen back to their native land. The Prime Minister claims that that is a fair and reasonable price for the sbips. The total cost of their construction was £7,527,000/ The five ""Bay"" boats were built in Great Britain.",18
32,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Unde r navy supervision.,18
33,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"As the honourable member for Newcastle says, they were built under the supervision of the Navy Department. The two ""Dale"" boats were built in Australia. The "" Bays "" are only six years, and the "" Dales "" only f our years, old. Tbey are practically the last word in vessels of the kind that are required for their class of trade. In any reasonable or fair estimate their value today could not be stated at a figure lower than £3,000,000.",18
34,Mr GREGORY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,That depends upon what they are capable of earning.,18
35,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I shall give evidence to support my contention. Earlier in this session, during the discussion of a censure motion, the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) delivered a speech in which he saidThat interest, of course, would be saved we were able to sell the Line say for £4,000,000. The saving of interest at 54 j)er cent on that sum, and $ per cent, paid into the sinking fund, would represent about about £240,000. In addition, there would be the saving of £200,000 for depreciation, and a similar amount representing the loss of working the Line. The total saving would be £600,000. The honourable gentleman insisted that, by the sale of the Line, Australia would save £600,000, and he based a portion of his calculations upon the belief and the assumption that it could be sold for £4,000,000. If he did not believe that that was what it was worth, why did he use those figures? I turn now to another piece of evidence. During the speech delivered by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) he quoted the contents of a cable, the authenticity of which has not been challenged, in which it was stated that a cable bad been sent to the Commonwealth Government asking if it would consider an offer of' £3,500,000 for the ten sbips that were then in commission. In reply, a cable was sent to Mr Larkin, the manager of the Line, who at that time was in London, to the effect that the Prime Minister bad stated that, subject to the price being not less than £3,500,000, the Government was prepared to consider an offer. Those ten vessels comprised the seven which bave just been sold and three others which were then in commission but were sold subsequently for the sum of £77,670. Mr ""WATKINS - They were the obsolete vessels of the Line.",18
36,Mr SCTJLLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"That is so. Deducting that £77,670 from the £3,500,000, we have £3,422,000. Allowing for depreciation for the period which elapsed between January 1926-the date of the sending of that cable-and the date of the recent sale, say £422,000, we can estimate the value of the five ""Bays"" and two ""Dales,"" based on the 1926 offer, at £3,000,000. Examining the price which has just been accepted, the Prime Minister said, "" We have some recent sales to compare with,"" and he cited the sale of two Italian boats. On the Prime Minister's own statement, they are not comparable with the Commonwealth ships either in tonnage, age. equipment or anything else, so I pass them by. I take a vessel that is more nearly if comparable, according to the Prime Minister's own statement. I take the Ormuz and contrast it with the "" Bay"" boats. The tonnage and speed are somewhat similar, the net tonnage of the "" B a y "" boats being a little higher than, that of the Ormuz, and the gross tonnage of the Ormuz being a little higher than that of the "" Bay "" boats. Not one word did the Prime Minister say about the cargocarrying capacity of the Ormuz. He merely compared the passenger-carrying capacity. l i e said that the Ormuz carried more passengers, but be failed to mention the superior passenger accommodation provided by the "" Bay "" boats. It is well known that improved accommodation means fewer passengers. Any man who bas travelled across the seas knows that the passenger accommodation on the "" Bay "" boats is unsurpassed. Again, the Prime Minister was silent upon the subject of refrigerated space, which is most important from an Australian point of view. The cargo space on the "" Bay "" boats is 13,000 tons each, totalling 65,000 tons for the five vessels. On each boat, there is 350,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space. The Prime Minister said not a word concerning the refrigerated space on the Ormuz. Even if the tonnage, speed, cargo-carrying capacity and refrigerated space are the same, we sbould bave to compare the ages of the vessels. It is generally accepted that the life of vessels of this class is about 20 years. The Ormuz, is fourteen years old, because, few according to the Prime Minister, it was built in 1914. It has, therefore, a life of six years. The "" Bay "" boats are six years old and have a life of fourteen years. The Ormuz was recently sold for £257,000, and dividing that figure by the six years that the vessel bas yet to live leaves the sum of £42,S33 for each year of its life. By multiplying that sum by fourteen years, representing the life of the "" Bay "" boats, we arrive at the sum of £599,662 for each vessel. Yet these boats bave been sold for £300,000 each. Let us compare last year's running costs, taking the Prime Minister's figures, with what will be their cost when controlled by a private company. The interest charge to the Commonwealth Line on £4,725,000 was £236,282, depreciation £171,265, or a total of £407,547. The cost to the private company will be interest on £1,900,000, £95,000, depreciation, say, £105,000 or a total cost of £200,000 a year, as against £407,000. The difference in the cost of wages owing to the difference between Australian and British standards is £220,000; therefore the Commonwealth Line had to meet an annual charge of £427,000 more than the private enterprise will have to pay. It is true that last year the loss on the Line was £558,000, still leaving a deficiency of £131,000, but it must be remembered that this Line has been operating under considerable and serious handicaps. I say frankly that some three or four years ago there were difficulties with the seamen, but for more than two years there has been no such handicap. The position improved, largely because the two members of the board wbo remained in Australia knew how to treat men. One of the chief handicaps of the Commonwealth Line was the fact that for three years it was under sentence of death. It was for sale, and as a result shippers would not enter into long contracts with it. That was a most serious handicap. Every business man knows that once the report is circulated that his business is for sale, his customers lose confidence in bim. I wisb now to refer to the agreement which has been entered into with Lord Kylsant of the White Star Line. The Prime Minister has stated that we are to have a fortnightly service, which will be a great improvement upon the present service, but there is this proviso, ""Provided trade justifies it . "" An agreement with such a proviso is not worth anything, because the decision as to whether trade justifies a fortnightly service is left to the company. Even if a fortnightly service is provided there will be no increase in the number of boats trading to Australia. The Commonwealth Line has been providing a monthly service and the White Star boats on the Australian run are also providing a monthly service. Therefore, by running the two lines alternatively, a fortnightly service will be given without increasing the number of boats on the Australian run. I come now to the most important feature of the sale of the Commonwealth Line. Beyond any other consideration is the value of the Commonwealth Line to Australia, as a competitor with the shipping combine, in keeping down freights. Mr G. FBANCIS - There is no evidence of that.",19
37,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"All the evidence is against the opinion of honourable members supporting the Government, and I can give the doubting Thomases opposite statements from the Prime Minister's own lips to prove my contention. I do not propose to traverse the whole of the arguments that were put forward a few months ago. I shall merely deal with the recent statement of the Prime Minister. He told us that when tenders were called in 1925, it was laid down that there should be no increase in the rates of freight or passage money without reference to and approval by a committee comprizing one representative of the purchaser, one representative of the shippers and an independent chairman. The Prime Minister said that the same onerous conditions were not stipulated in these tenders, but that the terms of the contract practically complied with the conditions laid down in 1925. I ask honourable members to contrast the conditions of tender and see bow far that statement can be borne out by facts. The condition of the contract now is that no general increase in homeward freights will be made without reference to a responsible authority representative of the interests concerned. There is no mention of the important words "" and approval by."" I shall now examine the cables that were exchanged to show at what period their omission took place, for which the Prime Minister gave no explanation. He glossed it over by saying that the conditions were practically the same, but I contend that there is a vital difference between them. On the 3rd April the following condition was contained in a cable sent to London by Mr Larkin after a conference with the Prime Minister in Melbourne:Some agreement that no general increase homeward freights without reference to and consent of some responsible authority. Latter point of great importance in view of public opinion here. .. ' Mr E. EILEY - Was that cable sent by the Prime Minister?",20
38,Mr SCTJLLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"It was sent by Mr. Larkin, but it was the Prime Minister's draft. I draw particular attention to the words "" of great importance in view of public opinion bere."" The Government knows that public opinion here is against being exploited by a shipping combine, and that the one thing that stood between us and exploitation was the Commonwealth Line. On the 4th April this reply was received: "" Agree no general increase homeward freights without reference to responsible authority."" The vital words "" and consent of "" were omitted.",21
39,Mr STEWAET,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Tb e cable referred only to homeward freights.,21
40,Mr SCTJLLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Yes . It bas been claimed that there is in London a committee, wbicb the Government at times refers to and consults, but there is in instance no proposal to obtain the consent of that authority before increasing freights. There has been a disregard of the 1925 conditions, and yet the Prime Minister says that the conditions of this agreement are practically the same as those that were previously laid down. He bas misrepresented the position to this House. On the 7th April a cable was sent from Australia to London in which the tender of Lord Kylsant was accepted subject to certain conditions which were outlined by the Prime Minister. They were that £50,000 extra should be paid to provide for the repatriation of the Australian seamen, that a fortnightly service sbould be maintained, and that a responsible body sbould be established in Australia, and no general increase made in homeward freights "" Mrithout reference thereto"" There is nothing whatever about "" with the consent . of "" ; those words entirely ;j disappeared from the messages. The Prime Minister in explaining the position on Tuesday said that there was to be "" no general increase"" in freights until the matter has been referred to the board."" I asked by interjection, "" Will the board have the power of veto ? "" The Prime Minister replied "" No. "" Yet he said that practically the same conditions would obtain as were laid down in 1925, wben there was a definite power of veto, because any alterations, to become effective, - bad tb receive the approval of the board. Mere reference to the board would be only an act of courtesy and would not impose any restraint. Witb regard to outward cargo there *is, of course, the Imperial Shipping Committee to be considered. Australia bas been represented upon it by Mr Larkin. We were told that it was "" consulted by the shipowners."" Of what use is consultation where there is no power to veto, control, or withhold approval or consent? The fact is that the only obstacle in the way of the overseas shipping companies increasing freights was the Commonwealth Shipping Line, it bas beenan insurmountable obstacle for the last ten years. It was not only able to prevent increases in freights, but actually effected reduction on more than one occasion. In February 1921, the Combine fixed the tbi3 freight on beef and mutton refrigerated cargo. I quoted the figures in a previous speech on this subject. In March of that year the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers fixed its rate at approximately £2 per ton less than the rate fixed by the Combine, and the Combine bad to come down to those rates.",21
41,Mr SEABROOK,NORTH AND CENTRAL,It was the Combine that forced the rates down.,21
42,Mr SCTJLLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"If the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) would take the trouble to examine all the facts of the case, be would see bow incorrect his interjection is. A further reduction of iOs per ton was made by the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers in 1923, and Mr Larkin, the manager of the Line, definitely stated to myself and others, that it caused a terrible row among the shipowners of the Combine; but they bad to reduce their rates accordingly. Tbis reduction effected a saving of £2,000,000 a year to the people of Australia. No one has disputed that statement. ",21
43,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"If the honourable  that opinion let him consider the statement made in this House by the Prime Minister in discussing the Shipping Bill, that wben our Line was established it carried - our wheat for £7 10s. per ton while ,the British ships charged £13 per ton and foreign ships £15 per ton.",21
44,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,The Commonwealth Government ships do not now carry any wheat.,22
45,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"The honourable member is too impatient. He may rest assured that I shall trace the history of the Line right down to the present day. The statement of the Prime Minister to which I have just referred is recorded in Hansard, and the honourable member for Porrest may check my reference if he desires to do so. I come now to 1926, in which year a further reduction was made in the refrigerated cargo freight rates by the Commonwealth Line of steamers. This also forced the ships of the Combine to reduce their rates. On that point I quote the following statement by the Prime Minister, which appeared in the Age and Argus and doubtless in other newspapers on the 13th of July of that yearIt is presumed that the reductions the Commonwealth Line will also be put in force by the combined steamship lines. The rigbt honourable gentleman went on to say that he estimated that the resultant saving in freights on our meat, wool, butter, dried fruits, &c, would be about £522,000 per annum. I could adduce further evidence in support of my contention; but it is already in Hansard. I have made these statements to show the substantial value which the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers has been to the country. They are such effective answers to the argument used by the Prime Minister in favour of the sale of the Line that only those who are blind with prejudice against government-owned ships, or government-owned business undertakings of any description will refuse to accept them. If it could be shown that any privately controlled company had saved large sums of money for our producers, honourable members opposite would be vigorously advocating that it should be heavily subsidized. They are quite prepared to spend millions of pounds per annum in subsidies, but are not prepared to admit the value of this shipping undertaking. Last year we paid almost as much in a wine export bounty as the Commonwealth Shipping Line lost. Surely we should bear it in mind that, against the losses incurred in operating the Line, we must place the millions of pounds which have been saved to the producers in freight charges. I bave no objection to the payment of bounties when it can be shown that they are justifiable; but if there is one industry above all others that we should subsidize, it is the shipping industry, for the future progress and prosperity of our country are bound up with it. Yet this is the one industry which honourable members opposite will not subsidize. There is not a progressive nation in the world which at some time or another has not subsidized its shipping industry. If we had to re-establish the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line it would cost us well over £1,000,000 each for these vessels, which we are sacrificing for less than a third of that sum. A gentleman in Victoria referring recently to the losses incurred in operating the railway system of that State, observed, "" If the railways were sold, they would pay."" The made by people of Victoria would also pay.",22
46,Mr GBEGOBT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,What has that to do with this subject?,22
47,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"It has this to do with it, that if it is argued that we should part with a great public utility like the Commonwealth Shipping Line because it is losing money, it may also be argued that we should sell our State owned railways for the same reason.",22
48,Mr JACKSON,NORTH AND CENTRAL,That is a poor analogy.,22
49,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) bas stated that if be could, he would sell the State-owned railways. We are sacrificing our ships to the biggest shipping octopus in the world. The Kylsant Combine is bigger and more far reaching in its power and influence than the combine controlled by Lord Inchcape.  ber did not say that previously.",22
50,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"If the honourable member knew anything about the shipping world, he would know that Lord Kyslant is the rising star in it .",22
51,Dr NOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"He is "" the white star.""",22
52,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"He is also the rising star. A few years ago Lord Inchcape was the man; but today Lord Kylsant is the much more important figure. That is why our sbips are going to bim. The following is a list of the official positions which Lord Kylsant occupies in i m portant shipping companies throughout the world:Position. Company.

The Sydney Sun, in its issue of last evenremarks ing published a striking cartoon. I represented a huge man towing seven should ships away from Australia. This man ing services. was "" Gulliver "" Kylsant, and the crowd of Lilliputians looking on were the tralian people. I now come to the point whii-.h the honourable member Franklin is so impatient. The ilr. Scullin. Minister charged me with having grossly misrepresented him, and with having descended to that mean for m of controCapital. versy which consists of tearing portions £ of a speech from their context and ouly partly quoting his remarks. I hope that I shall never be guilty of such a trick as that. I certainly quoted only certain 500,000 passages from the speech; but nobody would have expected me to quote the whole of it , and if I had done so it would not have been published in a newspaper; but I quoted in full the 1,000,000 relevant passages. I ask honourable members to read the speech, and then 500,000 280.000 challenge my statement if they can. The Prime Minister quoted what I said, and dramatically remarked, "" No w let me 70,500 read what I said."" When be bad done that, his quotation proved to 2,300,000 be merely an answer to the argu500,000 ment that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers bad been of value in the 7,190,000 coastal trade. He went on to show that the Line had carried only a small per3,000,000 centage of the total passenger and cargo traffic, and be said that its continuance could not be justified. There was not 700,000 one definite statement in the whole of the speech to the effect that the vessels were to be taken out of the coastal service. The 900,000 Prime Minister said that his remarks 100,000 - indicated that they were to be removed 250,000 from that trade. If honourable members read the whole of his speech, they will 1,000,000 find that the same sneering remarks that were used with regard to the part that the Line played in the coastal trade were made concerning its activities in the overseas trade. Are we to take it that the right honourable gentlemen meant his speech 7,480,000 to convey that the vessels were also to go out of the overseas trade? There was not one definite statement that they were go out of the Australian trade, but the Prime Minister clearly said more than once-and I quoted the statement in my in the press-that one of the cont ditions of sale was that the purchaser provide an equivalent of the exist",22
53,Mr GREGORY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"If the vessels were sold, Aushow could they remain in the trade?",23
54,Mr SCTJLLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I quoted two pasabout sages from Hansard, in which he defifor nitely said that one of the conditions of Prime sale would be the maintenance of an equivalent of the existing services. Those who have travelled round the coast on the "" B a y "" boats cannot say that they will have an equivalent service when those vessels have gone out of the trade. Those who contend that they knew quite well that the vessels would go were aware that we have an anti-Australian Government in office.",23
55,Mr GREGORY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,How could the ships remain in the trade if they were removed from the Australian register.,24
56,Mr SCUJJLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"-In reply to the honourable member for Swan, I shall quote his remarks, reported in Hansard of the 10th November, 1927, page 1254, when he saidSurely if the ships can be sold on the condition that for a period of ten years they will remain on either the British or the Australian register, and trade along our coast, that is as far as honorab'e members should ask the Government to go.. The Prime Minister complained of misrepresentation. I have listened to many debates, but I have never witnessed a trick such as appeared to me to have been practised by him when speaking last Tuesday. He may not have done it intentionally; but, if it were unintentional, he should have made reparation as quickly as possible. I refer to his quotation of a press statement by an anonymous writer who signed himself "" Traveller."" Some absurd figures were mentioned in this letter. I have never seen it, and I do not know what newspaper it appeared in, but the Prime Minister squeezed that quotation in between two quotations from my statement, and I believe that 90 per cent, of honourable members listening to his remarks believed that he was answering my argument. ""Wben I challenged the right honourable gentleman, and said that he w.as conveying the impression that the figures mentioned were mine, did he utter one word to suggest that he did not - wish to convey that impression? No; he remained absolutely silent. If he did not desire to convey a wrong impression he should have said so. Undoubtedly he left the impression that the statement of the anonymous writer was my statement. The Prime Minister said in his speech that it would be wrong to make any announcement concerning the sale - of the Line until the matter had been settled. ""What would there be wrong about that? Surely the public, who paid for the Line and owned it, were entitled to some information and consideration. There was nothing to prevent a firm tender being received and accepted subject to the condition that it was to be referred to the representatives of the people for ratification of the sale. Of course, it would never do to publish all the tenders while the negotiations were proceeding; but wben a tender that the Government was prepared to accept had been selected, it could have been taken as a firm offer, subject to approval by Parliament. But Parliament was not consulted. The Prime Minister has changed his attitude on that aspect of the matter. At one time he believed that Parliament sbould be consulted prior to the acceptance of any offer for the purchase of the Line. I quote again from the cable read by the honourable member for Batman. When the inquiry came from Mr Larkin whether an offer of £3,500,000 would be considered, the reply sent back wasThe offer will be placed by the Cabinet before Parliament. Purchasers must clearly understand that any agreement arrived at must be subject to ratification by the Commonwealth Parliament. A further cable announced that "" there would be no difficulty in obtaining the ratification of Parliament."" Now the Prime Minister says that it would have been quite wrong to make any statement until the matter had been finally settled. How does the Prime Minister's attitude of 1928 square with that of 1926? He made much of the date on which the contract was signed. Let me give the dates mentioned in his cables. On the 7th April there was a cable accepting the tender of Lord Kylsant, subject to the proviso that I have mentioned. Om the 12th April Lord Kylsant confirmed the sale. On the 13th April a cablegram from London was published in the Australian press definitely stating that the ships had been sold to Lord Kylsant for £1,900,000, and that £250,000 bad been paid by way of deposit. The Australian people, wbo owned the ships, got the information by cable from London; yet the Prime Minister said, ""After we have settled the matter and sold the ships, we will afford an opportunity to Parliament to debate our action."" The Government's generosity is overwhelming! This Parliament represents the whole of the people; the Government does not represent all the people. If Parliament stands up to its responsibilities, it will demand that its consent be asked before a valuable public utility is' sold. These ships were thrown away for millions less than their true value, and, as a consolation to the people wbo bave been betrayed, their representatives in - Parliament are to be allowed to discuss the Government's action. Brutus, having plunged the dagger into the heart of Caesar, allows Anthony to make an oration over the dead body! That could not restore the dead to life, nor can we restore to Australia the sbips that have been sold. We can merely draw attention to what bas been done, in an endeavour to prevent this Government from having a further opportunity of similar wrong-doing. The Prime Minister talks about the need for a navy. He tells the people that they must consent to be taxed so that millions may be spent on naval defence. Yet the Government bad in the waters of Australia seven fast vessels capable of carrywas ing heavy guns. Tbey were auxiliary cruisers and more powerful than the Sydney, which sank the Emden. But the Government ha,s parted with tbem. Will Lord Kylsant mount guns on those cruisers, if ever Australia should be in trouble? Will be send tbem to our aid? Is that provided for in the agreement?",24
57,Mr LISTER,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Were they passenger vessels or battleships?,25
58,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"They were built under the supervision of the Admiralty, and were able to carry heavy guns. They were constructed as auxiliaries to the Australian Navy. The Australian crews are to be repatriated. Some 500 Australians are to be cast on our shores workless like so mucb flotsam thrown up by the ocean waves. The Government have lightly parted with one of the essential utilities, without which no people can claim, to have a standing as a nation; but are we a race of sycophants to be always calling on some noble lord on the other side of the world for our shipping service? Why should we be dependent on the wealthy sea lords of Britain for the carriage of goods to and from Australia? This is an island continent, and yet we are asked to place our destinies in the bands of Lord Kylsant and other members of the shipping combine. The flags of practically every nation float in the breeze on every ocean highway; but the Australian flag has been hauled down by this Government. Students of the history of the Britisb Isles cannot but marvel at the manner in which a mere speck of land in north-western Europe has become a great world power recognized by all countries. It is undeniable that the biggest contributor to that growth was the British mercantile marine. By it, the flag of Great Britain was carried into every port and every clime, and before distant peoples even knew the size of Great Britain, or where it was situated, they recognized and, sometimes, feared its great wealth and power. Tbat was one of the great services that the mercantile marine rendered to the British people.",25
59,Mr MAXWELL,NORTH AND CENTRAL,And men like Kylsant have rendered that service.,25
60,Mr SCULLIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"The honourable member must know that the mercantile marine developed, not by the Kylsants, the money magnates who sit at home in comfortable offices and draw dividends, but by the old sea dogs wbo went abroad in tramp sbips and little trading packets, and suffered privations and faced danger on all the waters of the globe. The mercantile marine was developed by the men wbo went to sea and did the work of sailing and managing the ships, trading with distant countries. Honourable members opposite who interject in disparagement of the seamen, would not endure 24 hours of the conditions under which those men work. This Government's betrayal of the people of Australia is evidenced by its reckless disposal of their valuable assets. This is merely a continuation of what has been the Government's policy ever since it came into office. Regardless of the nature of a State enterprise, if it showed a loss it must be sold; if it showed a profit, it must be sold, in order to clear the way for private enterprise. In this case, the Government is giving the freedom of the seas to a profiteering combine. It is true that in the past we have appealed to the people against similar destructive actions by this Government, and have been twitted by the Ministry and its supporters with the statement that the people had condoned or approved their actions, and that our appeal had fallen on deaf ears. Honourable members may twit us as much as they please, but we shall continue to appeal to the people against such betrayals, and we rely, with confidence, on their ultimate good judgment. The Prime Minister may threaten to put into operation the Crimes Act, which is a disgrace to the statute-book, but we make our appeal to the people. members of the Labour party do not depend upon penal laws to enforce their views; we rely upon the authority that comes from a great democracy. I propose to read to honourable members a telling indictment of the Government published j n the Melbourne Age of yesterday. This journal has always supported the Government's proposals to sell the Commonwealth shipping Line, but this is what it said in a leading article in regard to the Prime Minister's threats and spread-eagle declaration of his intentionsFrom a Prime Minister such sinister utterances are pitiable. Does he believe that important public issues can be helpfully debated in the terms of the "" raging and tearing "" propaganda of 1925 ? If, as may bo. his mind is on the approaching election, he made a most unworthy use of the occasion. These phrases are strangely reminiscent of those that were current nearly three years ago, when the Bruce-Page Ministry was lifted into its present position, mainly on a wave of invective inspired by the Britisli seamen's strike. Is the next general election also to be a carnival of invective? May the fates forbid! The desire of the Government is to inflame the minds of the people and to take advantage of a threat here or an action there by a number insignificant in comparison with the great mass of the workers, in order to suggest to the world that the whole nation is in danger. The Government has misused its political power to do this wrong, and we propose to tell the people that the only effective way to right it is to transfer the control of public affairs to a Government with an Australian outlook.",25
61,Mr GULLETT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Henty) [12.22] - As a private member, I congratulate the honourable member for Yarra upon the [164] attainment of the distinguished Parliamentary position he now holds. Whilst I seldom find myself in complete agreement with him, I , as a comparatively new member, have benefited by his example of industry in the study of great public questions, and his singular debating power. The honourable gentleman almost charged the Prime Minister with being insincere in his professed endeavour to make a success of the Commonwealth Line. In my opinion the Leader of the The Government has behaved with extraordinary fairness towards that enterprise. It is well-known that as a private member be was opposed to its continuance, and that many years ago he advocated its sale. Later he joined the Hughes Ministry and eventually became Prime Minister. Finding that an overwhelming majority of the members of the House favoured the retention of the Line, at any rate until this experiment in government trading had received a thorough trial, he loyally subordinated his own views to the will of the majority, and did everything possible to make the Line a successful trading venture. The change which has occurred in the attitude of ministerial members is in no degree attributable to the influence of our leader. The conviction has spontaneously grown in the minds of individual members that the best interest of Australia will be served by the disposal of these ships, and I welcome the Government's decision to that effect. It affords an opportunity for an emphatic demonstration by ministerialists of their opposition to any increase or perpetuation of State trading. By approving of the sale of this Line we are reasserting our belief in the efficacy of private enterprise in this young country, as"" against, government enterprise, especially in trading ventures. I have never supported the retention of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and would have voted for its sale years ago, but the existing circumstances in Australia make it particularly desirable that we should get rid at once of this obstacle to economic progress. I do not take a pessimistic view of the future of this country, but I believe that wherever possible we should economize in our public finances in order to lighten as much as possible the burden that oppresses the taxpayers. To that end, it is our duty to withdraw from hopelessly fantastic enterprises like the Commonwealth Shipping Line. To realise the seriousness of the present economic position we have only to remember the somewhat astounding fact that after very many years of abnormally good seasons-goo d in respect of both yield and price- a merely partial failure of the wlieat crop bas placed us in serious financial difficulty. Being responsible to the people for the management of their affairs, we sbould take heed of that warning and adopt every means within our power to improve the economic situation. The relation of the Commonwealth Shipping Line to the financial situation can be expressed in a very few words. We have been told that those vessels bave been a powerful factor in the reduction of freights between Australia and the United Kingdom. The amount of the reduction for wbicb they are responsible, if any, has never been established; it is wholly conjectural, if not mythical. It has been said to amount to millions of pounds, but that assertion has not been, and probably cannot, be proved. In opposition to the claim that the Line has been responsible for the saving of millions of pounds in freight, we bave the undoubted fact that in the sister dominion of New Zealand, where the government does not compete against the so-called combine, the freights for years have been at least as low as ours.",26
62,Mr STEWART,NORTH AND CENTRAL,But their rates are governed largely by ours.,27
63,Mr GULLETT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Where does the influence of this precious Line end? The alleged influence of the Line in reducing freights is purely mythical. On the other hand, we know what the Line has cost the Australian taxpayer in hard cash, what it is costing at the present time, and what it will continue to cost if it is retained. In the last report of the Auditor-General will be found the net expenditure upon the Line out of loan funds up to the end of March, 1927. The total is almost £15,500,000. Up to that time the Line had earned just under £6,000,000; therefore, the net outlay was almost £9,500,000. Against that must be placed the estimated value of the sbips a year ago, of £3,300,000. At that time, therefore, the net loss to the taxpayer was £6,167,000. The calling of tenders for the sale of the Line, however, proved that we bad over-estimated the value of the Line, and that the fleet is wprth only £1,900,000. In other words, our net loss at the present time is £7,574,000. That loss is increasing at the rate of £500,000 a year, and each year the depreciation becomes more rapid. It is claimed that the loss cannot be considered an important factor because of the inestimable boon which the Line is said to have proved to primary producers, particularly by keeping down freights. Surely the representatives of the primary producers wbo sit on this side are not incapable of appreciating the value of these vessels in that direction! Is it conceivable that those wbo represent an overwhelming majority of the primary producers, bave lost their financial and economic sense? The decision of Government members to support the sale of the Line was arrived at in a purely voluntary and spontaneous manner. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) exclaimed at the price which has been accepted, and has almost suggested that in the interest of private enterprise the vessels have been deliberately given away to this mammoth shipowner, Lord Kylsant, wbo has replaced Lord Inchcape in the nightmares of honourable members of the Opposition. Any one wbo looks carefully into the matter, however, must come to the conclusion that the price is a fair one. Considering the prospective earnings of the seven boats in question, the price appears to me to be fairly high. It cannot be denied that all the ship-owning interests in the Empire had the opportunity to tender. Honourable members opposite will argue that there is only one shipowner, but we know that there are at least two great combines, and the Runciman tender came from a most reputable source, which commands an enormous capital.",27
64,Mr FENTON,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Do not they all belong to the Conference Line ?,27
65,Mr GULLETT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"We have, too, the opinion of the chairman of the board, who considers that this is a fair price, and whose estimate of the value of the vessels, made immediately prior to the sale, was about £2,000,000. In dealing with the question of price it might beas well to examine the position in which the new owners are likely to find themselves in relation to prospective profits. The value of the ships in the books of the Gommonwealth is about £4,500,000. The interest charge each year was £228,000. In addition to that, the Commonwealth had to pay in wages £220,000 a year more than would be given under English rates of pay. The White Star Line, on a purchase price of £1,900,000, will pay in interest at the rate of 5* per cent., £104,000 a year. In interest alone it will effect a saving of £124,000 a year. Its wages bill annually will be £220,000 less than the Commonwealth has been paying. Under those two heads, therefore, the saving will be £344,000. But the present loss is approximately £200,000 a year in excess of that amount. I know of no means by which I could illustrate with greater force the efficiency and economy of private enterprise compared with government enterprise, than, by quoting those figures. Even when allowance is made for the lower interest bill and wage payments, at the present rate3 of freight the purchasers are faced with a net loss of upwards of £200,000. Of course, the White Star line does not intend to lose money on this enterprise; it will make the vessels pay, despite the apparently adverse circumstances. venture to prophesy that the sale of the Line will not result in an increase of freights. Under the terms of the contract we are safeguarded against such a contingency ; but, even so, my - faith in private enterprise leads me to the opinion that the result of the sale will be a lowering of freights. Under government management, the running of the Line has been expensive and extravagant. We made an utterly hopeless attempt to enter into competition with the world at Australian rates of wages. That has had the effect of bolstering up, rather than of reducing, freights. Honourable members opposite have, by interjection, oharged honourable members who sit on this side with being actuated by the desire to serve big interests. That charge is frequently made in this chamber. It is my belief that Opposition members have contributed largely to the failure of the Line, and that its sale has been rendered necessary by the attitude of Labour towards i ' . The seamen and the employees generally have been guilty of continued acts of disloyalty to unionism, the Labour party, and Australia as a whole. There has been a long series of revolts, pin-pricking and obstruction. These men were given the best working conditions, the most comfortable living quarters, the highest wages, and probably the best food, enjoyed by seamen in any part of the world. I ask honourable members opposite what steps they took at any time to remove obstructions, and to end strikes and hold-ups.",27
66,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Will the honourable member state specifically what strikes and hold-ups have taken place?,28
67,Mr GULLETT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"That would merely be to delay the House. . The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that such occurrences in connection with the Lino have been a scandal in this country for years. This grand venture in State trading was placed in the hands of Labour, and it has deliberately cut its throat. Honourable members opposite on this, as on previous occasions, are posing as the friends of the primary producers. Sucb a pose will carry very little conviction to the minds of the people of this country. I rejoice to learn that the I Government has decided to sell the Line. The price received is a very satisfactory one. The taxpayers will be relieved of the burden of making good a loss of at least £500,000 a year. I have no fear that freights and fares, and communications generally between the Commonwealth and outside countries, will be prejudiced by this action of the Government.",28
68,Unknown,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Sitting suspended from 12Jt5 to 2.15 p.m.,28
69,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Newcastle) [2.15] I suppose that during the history of this Parliament no more important question bas been discussed than the sale of the Australiau Commonwealth Line of steamers. Eor some considerable time all honourable members bave known that it was in the mind of the Government to dispose of the Commonwealth fleet. Whether the Line was profitable or not did not enter into its calculations. Since this Government obtained office it has sold several government enterprises, including the woollen .mills at Geelong, which, besides paying well, were providing clothing to returned soldiers at a cost much lower than that charged elsewhere. I mention that to show that it is not the loss on the operations of the fleet during the last few years that has affected by iota the Government's determination to sell the line. The fleet was a source of noyance to the overseas shipping certain members of wbicb are friends of this Ministry, and it was arranged betbat vessel make? tween tbem that the fleet sbould be sold. For two or three years the fact that the Line was for sale has been known to the public, and this placed a serious handicap upon its operations. In trading between Great Britain and Australia, our fleet bad to contend with the competition the biggest shipping combine that the world bas ever known, and, in addition, the agents of the combine bave refused rebates to shippers who dared to ship their goods by the Commonwealth Line. Another handicap to the fleet was the fact that its vessels were diverted to ports on the west coast of Great instead of trading with the more important English ports. Since the incep-tion of the Line many forces have been operating against it. For some time conand siderable profits were made by it, and, trading concerns, private or otherwise, is usual to use the profits of good years balance the losses of iean years. Mr G. FRANCIS - There were no profits except war profits.",28
70,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Ha d it not been for the operation of the Commonwealth during the war, very little of our goods would bave left these shores. Up to the last two or three years the Line made a profit of £5,000,000. I admit that has since made a loss, but we cannot it both ways. If we cut down freights we cannot make profits. The Government has given no good I reason for selling the Commonwealth fleet. What is more, the Line has not been sold, but bas been given away. the stoppages? The company purchasing it is to make a first payment of £250,000, but the balance will be provided by the people wbo will pay increased prices for imported materials, and by the primary producers who will be faced with higher freights. The Prime Minister stated that the monwealth fleet was becoming obsolete, and that, therefore, its value bad dropped from £8,000,000 to less than £2,000,000. As a matter of fact it is common knowledge that this class is among the best on the seas today. Less than twelve months one ago the Fordsdale made a record trip from Australia to Great Britain; in fact, anit overtook one vessel that bad left tbese combine, shores a week earlier.",29
71,Mr SEABROOK,NORTH AND CENTRAL,How mucb profit did,29
72,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"We cannot bave it both ways. If vessels are used to break records they cannot have an economical oil consumption. But the increased cost of that run cannot be attributed to the has bigb wages paid to the seamen. The of Canadian Government is continuing to operate its fleet although the wages paid on its vessels are as bigb as those paid on the Commonwealth liners. That Government is sending sbips regularly to these shores, and is trading with almost every country in the world, despite the the fact that its vessels are worked under Britain similar conditions to ours.",29
73,Mr STEWART,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Is not the Canadian Government extending its fleet?,29
74,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Yes . The wages conditions of seamen throughout the in world are regulated by arbitration courts it and wages boards, and therefore all this to talk about the seamen on the Commonwealth vessels receiving higher wages than those paid to seamen on other overseas vessels trading to Australia goes by the board. All of us are opposed to fleet stoppages of work on Commonwealth vessels, and in other government functions, but although these frequently take place, the facts are against the assertion it constantly made by honourable members have supporting the Government, that more stoppages have taken place with Commonwealth vessels than with other vessels. n actual fact, more stoppages are taking place with privately-owned boats.",29
75,Mr SEABROOK,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Who is to blame for,29
76,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"That is a matter of opinion. They may be due to the action of some ""pommy"" boss like the honourable member, who builds small cottages and wants his employees to work for nothing. The Conrmonwealtb fleet bas Combeen sacrificed. The Prime Minister well knows that the tenders were not competitive. The Shipping QQmbine bad been patiently waiting until the value of the Commonwealth fleet had declined. Lord Kylsant himself said that he did not intend to give too much for it. The Prime Minister tried to compare these modern vessels with an obsolete vessel like the Ormuz, which, I believe, was originally German. He quotedfiguresshowing the small percentage of goods carried on the Australian coast by the two Commonwealth cargo vessels, as compared with privately-owned vessels, including those carrying coal, iron ore, limestone, and other goods. The comparisons that have been made take us nowhere. It has been said that the Commonwealth Government vessels have done very little work on the Australian coast. The way to have more coastal work done is to obtain .more ships. In spite of the views which have been expressed by honourable members opposite, chiefly by interjection, the sale of tbese vessels is the most dastardly action that has been taken by any Australian Government.",29
77,Mr SEABROOK,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"It is the best thing that has ever happened. Mr ""WATKI1STS - The honourable member knows very little about the matter. It has been said that modation of the Commonwealth boats is not as good as that provided on other passenger vessels which visit Australia; but it sbould be remembered that are one-class vessels, whereas most of the oversea passenger boats with which compete provide for two or three classes. There may be a few cabins in tbese boats superior fo those of the Commonwealth steamers, but, generally in' and goods out. speaking, the average accommodation on our sbips is infinitely superior to the average on the other boats. It bas been argued that the "" B a y "" liners have deteriorated greatly, and that on this account the Government was justified selling them for the price offered Lord Kylsant. But everybody knows that ships which are properly used and cared for do not deteriorate rapidly. cannot be said, truly, that a vessel which is only five or six years of age bas deteriorated very mucb. There justification whatever for the Governcommercial ment selling a fleet worth £8,000,000 a paltry £1,850,000. Is Australia never to possess a mercantile marine of her own ? Is she always to oblige her primary producers to depend upon the ships of companies the registered offices of which are 13,000 miles away?",30
78,Mr SEABROOK,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"""We bad cheaper freights before the Commonwealth Government established this Line.",30
79,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Tba t is all the honourable member thinks about. It shows his nature. I contend that one of the reasons why more than half the population of New South Wales is centralized in Sydney is that the overseas companies obliged our people to concentrate their export trade on one port. That is also the reason why 50 per cent, or more of the population of some of the other States is to be found in their capital cities.",30
80,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,The honourable member appears to be a believer in the new States movement.,30
81,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I am more than that. I am not a half-bred, but a purebred unificationist. I well remember the fight pf the people of Brisbane to get oversea mail boats to call there. Mr G. FRANCIS - Brisban e had a better oversea mail service twenty years the accomago than she has today.",30
82,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,I do not think that it is more than twenty years since they had to fight strenuously to get the ours Orient liners to call there. Mr G. FRANCIS - Brisban e always had they the British-India service.,30
83,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Sh e bad tramp steamers, but they go everywhere.",30
84,Mr YATES,NORTH AND CENTRAL,It was a case of Kanakas,30
85,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"That is so, and the Brisbane people were not satisfied with also the arrangement. The concentration of our shipping upon one port in each State also obliged us to concentrate our railin way systems on one port, which was bad by for the country. That policy bas been persisted in, and this Government has done nothing to alter it. I am a Britisher, It but I am forced to confess that Britisb traders are no different from the traders of other countries. They are out chiefly is no for profits. Some of tbem maintained relations with Germany for throughout the recent war. Wben I was in London in 1916, I said at a publio gathering which I attended, that some British traders would sell their souls to trade with Germany the next day, and a gentleman who spoke after me said, "" They are trading with Germany now."" I am not making these statements as a reflection upon the British people, but upon the exploiters of the Empire who would be prepared to bludgeon the people to death in order to make profits. The reasons wbicb have been given for the sale of tbese boats bave been paltry and flimsy, and will not bear examination. Instead of selling the vessels, we sbould follow the example of Canada and add to our fleet, for nothing will cause such effective development in Australia as the building up of a strong mercantile marine. ' I regret to say that almost every action that this Government has taken within the last few years has had the tendency to reduce the Commonwealth to the status of a crown colony, and to make our people hewers of wood and drawers of water. This has been particularly noticeable since certain British visitors came to Australia some time ago. We have now made practically a free gift of our sbips to the biggest shipping combine in the world, and we are to receive only £250,000 in cash for them. Tbis fleet was in the nature of an insurance policy against high freight and passenger rates and it was worth keeping for that reason alone. It is regrettable that we are doing nothing to make a seafaring life possible for our youth, for we are an island continent and we need an adequate shipping service. I feel sure that before very long the producers of Australia will realise that they bave been sadly misled by the Government in this matter. It is all very well to say that certain conditions have been laid down which Lord Kylsant must observe. When once we have passed the ships over to him, we shall find it impossible to enforce those conditions, and he will be able to give us any kind of service he pleases. The Commonwealth fleet was a valuable adjunct to our defence forces and would have been able to back up the efforts of our cruisers to defend our shores if that ever become necessary, for all the sbips were built under Admiralty supervision. Each of the vessels could Sir. Watkins. carry heavier armament than that with which the Sydney and Melbourne were equipped. Tbey were built to actas auxiliary cruisers. No honourable member bas suggested that they were capable of outclassing regular cruisers.",30
86,Mr STEWART,NORTH AND CENTRAL,They could defend themselves against raiders of the Wolf type.,31
87,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Of course they could. We learnt during the last war that such auxiliary cruisers could do an immense amount of damage before they were put out of action. No matter from what angle we view this subject, we should not debate it upon the basis of the value placed upon the Line by the Government. Although the vessels may not have paid their way during the past few years, we must not lose sight of the fact that a mercantile marine is essential to Australia's trade development. Are we to leave our primary producers to the mercy of the shipping combine, or are we to bave ocean-going sbips on an Australian register to provide us with means of transport at all times ? Other parts of the Empire, sucb as Canada, are extending their government shipping lines. Wben their vessels do not pay, they look for the causes, and remedy tbem. The financial failure of the Commonwealth Shipping Line was not due to the occasional stoppages of work, or to the rates of pay, so mucb as to the bad supervision of the Line from its inception. This Government's most serious mistake was to dispose of the great asset that Australia possessed in the form of a mercantile marine, and I hope that before long this country will either re-possess the Line or have even a better fleet to serve the interests of the people in the future.",31
88,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Gwydir) [2.50] - I join the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) in extending congratulations to the new Leader and the new Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and as a member who came into the House after the last election I sbould like also to express to the late Leader of the Opposition my thanks for the unvarying courtesy that he has extended towards me. This debate concerns a most important, feature of the Government's policy, and 1 take the opportunity to say at once that I am totally opposed to the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I made a thorough investigation of the operations of the Line, and I could come to no other conclusion than that it would be in the public interest to sell it. Speaking as a primary producer, and representing a large number of primary producers, I fail to see that any concrete benefits have been derived through the existence of the Line. On the other hand, I realise that it has proved a decided handicap to the producers because of the tremendous losses it bas caused to the taxpayers generally. My electorate is mainly concerned in primary production, - and yet I bave not beard a single objection taken to the policy of the Government in disposing of the Line. Had the intended sale of the ships met with the disapproval of my constituents I should certainly have beard about it. On one side there was .a theoretical saving of freight.",31
89,Mr STEWART,NORTH AND CENTRAL,The Prime Minister did not say that it was theoretical.,32
90,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I cannot see that the savings have been concrete; but there has been a concrete loss of over £8,000,000. Undoubtedly the losses have been great, ancl the extent of the benefits is entirely problematical. Even granting that the producer bas reaped benefits from the Line, tbese are overwhelmingly offset by the terrific losses incurred since its inception. However, the Line has been sold, and, according to the Leader of the Opposition, the Australian people have been "" sold "" with it. I cannot see that the disposal of five passenger ships and two cargo vessels, carrying less than 10 per cent, of the freight and less than 10 percent, of the passenger traffic between tralia and the other side of the world, and an infinitesimal proportion of the coastal freight and passenger traffic, has delivered this country into the hands of the shipping combine. If all we had, to save us from the combine was five passenger and two cargo sbips it was a very slender protection indeed. I cannot help wondering whether we would bp worse to be in the hands of the shipping combine than under the industrial control that is rapidly threatening Australia. The utterances of certain industrialists and their attitude towards constitutional government, will do Australia far more harm than any problematical benefit that might be derived from the possession of a government shipping line. I was interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that for four years no strikes bad occurred in connection with the Line. It will be recalled that only a few months ago the stewards on the Hobson's Bay went on strike declining to serve afternoon tea to the Governor General. It is a serious matter that a body of men sbould so take control of one of the ships of the Line. Tbeir argument was that it was too mucb to expect tbem to serve afternoon tea to several hundred visitors. Whether that was so or not, we need not inquire; but the consequence of their action concerns us a great deal. The ship was unable to complete its journey to Brisbane. The cargo had to be taken off and transhipped, with the result that the vessel was unable to make its usual trip to England. As a matter of fact, the taxpayers were saved £10,000 by that strike, because that is the amount that would have been lost had the voyage been undertaken. The secretary of the Steward's Union bad the colossal hide to say, when reason came to him, that if the'ship did not sail, it would not be the fault of his union. During the previous debate on the proposal to sell the ships, I said that I did not consider that the saving in freight had been of great Jsenefit. The Leader of the Opposition followed me, and, so far as my memory goes, he quoted the reduction in the freighton wool, and challenged me to say that that bad not been of benefit to the primary producers. I understood at that time Aus- that the evidence submitted to the Public Accounts Committee, which had been given in camera, could not be used in the debate, and, therefore, I was unable to say then that I knew quite well that the reduction in the freight on wool had beenbrought about by the Holt's Blue Eunnel Line, and not by the Commonwealth Line. That fact sbould be given every prominence. That reduction in freight to the primary producers was brought about by the Conference Line.  of the Public Accounts Committee, I maintain that that, is not so.",32
91,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,My statement can be corroborated by other members of the committee.,33
92,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"The honourable member might refer to beef, rabbits and butter, while be is on the subject.",33
93,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I am dealing with the wool industry, wbicb bas been the salvation of this country. We find that the Government Line, between its inception and the formation of the Shipping Board, was written down by £8,000,000, and, since the appointment of the board in 1923, a further shrinkage of assets has occurred to the extent of nearly £3,000,000. I cannot see the use of talking about the benefit that might have accrued from the Line in the past, if in the last four or five years it bas been a steadily losing ' concern. When one engages in a business enterprise, one is always buoyed up by the hope that it will eventually' prove profitable; but wben it is found that the probable result of the enterprise has been miscalculated the proper course is to withdraw from it. Therefore, I think that the Government bas done rigbt in giving up the shipping venture. Even if it were decided to continue the Line, we should be faced with the tremendous problem of augmenting the fleet. That aspect of the matter has beeu ignored by previous speakers. It is futile to argue this matter on the basis of what the Line did in the carriage of wheat during the war period; that is past history. We must have regard to the circumstances of the present and the future, and I see no possibility of the Line being of substantial benefit to the primary producers; certainly any slight savings in freight not likely to offset the losses already curred, and likely to be continued if the Line remained under Government control. In regard to the sale price, I think the subsidies ? Government bas made a fair business deal. The amount to be paid by the purchaser may seem small, in comparison with the original cost of £1,000,000 for each the "" Bay"" liners, but we are concerned only with their present-day value. A motor car purchased in 1920, and kept unused in a garage, would be practically as good today as when it was bought, but it would be worth in the market only the value of a similar car of the same period; the owner could not expect to obtain for an out-of-date car the price he paid for it when new. The same argument applies to sbips, and is strengthened by the fact that building costs in Great Britain bave decreased considerably during the. last few years. I suppose that a ship similar to the "" Bay liners could be built today for between £500,000 and £600,000. During the course of the investigation by the Public Accounts Committee, I inspected some of the "" B a y "" liners, and I came to the conclusion that they were » very good type of vessel for a particular class of trade. They carry a certain quantity of cargo, and cater for passengers who do not want to pay big fares between Australia and the United Kingdom. They handle very satisfactorily that class of traffic, which, however, is only part of the general business of ocean transport. The vessels have been running constantly since they were launched, and having regard to the fact that before long an expenditure of from £7,000,000 to £S,000,000 would be required to replace or augment the fleet, the taxpayers of Australia will be well satisfied to entrust their destinies so far as overseas carriage is concerned to private lines wbicb bave served this country well for many years, and are serving the rest of the world without detriment to those engaged in primary production. The honourable mem-, ber for Henty (Mr Gullett) cited the circumstances of New Zealand, which manages quite well without a State-owned line. Other countries to wbicb sea transport is vital, manage to maintain their commerce and industries without incurare ring the expense which a governmentinowned line involves, particularly in Australia, where costs are unusually bigb.",33
94,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Without Government,33
95,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"I have no objection to subsidies, and at the present time the Commonwealth is paying a substantial of sum to the Orient Company in respect of the mail and passenger service between Australia and Europe. Members of the Opposition no longer defend the Line as a business undertaking, but rely upon sentiment, and argue that it is of great advantage to Australia to have its flag flying on its own ships, and that the Line gave to the primary producers a safeguard which was well worth the loss of millions of pounds. The honourable thropist ? member for Newcastle spoke about the suitability of the "" Bay "" liners use as auxiliary cruisers in time of war. But the conditions of naval warfare are changing from year to year. methods employed in even the last war are now more or less obsolete. In the next great war aircraft will be one of dominant factors.",33
96,Mr MCGRATH,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Is that why the Gocannot vernment ordered cruisers from Great Britain ? ' Mr ABBOTT - Probably we shall ways need war vessels, but as the years go by aircraft will take an increasingly prominent part in both offensive and fensive operations. The "" B a y "" liners are not armoured, their decks are not protected, they steam only 16 knots an 7th A p r i l hour, which is a very, slow speed for a war vessel, and they would be extremely vulnerable to attack from the air menting and from submarines. During the months, Great War tliere were several engagements between armoured merchant cruisers, but such vessels as the "" B a y "" liners would be as helpless against a warcient ship as the Emden was against the Sydney because of inferior armament .and speed. Therefore, the naval aspect need the not weigh very heavily with us when considering the propriety of the continuedsale. The Government is .to be congratulated npon the terms it has obtained from sible the purchaser. The price is satisfactory, and the ships are to be placed on a body British register and operated by a combuyers. pany controlled by Britons. It would impossible to retain them on the Ausundertaking tralian register if they were to compete with other sbips. Brigaded with the ships of the Aberdeen White Star Line, they will serve Australia more usefully than a separate trading unit. The Leader of the Opposition referred to Lord Kylsant and his tremendous commercial interests. As the honourable gentleman enumerated his lordship's shareholdings in various shipping companies, I could not help regarding him as almost a public beneprobably factor; he carries passengers and mersels chandise on the seven seas, and in so out. * doing is benefiting, not only himself, but the rest of the world. [165]",34
97,Mr WEST,NORTH AND CENTRAL,Does the honourable member think that Lord Kylsant is a philan,34
98,Mr ABBOTT,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"He works for a for return just as the honourable member serves his constituents for a return. The contract of sale provides that there shall The be no general increase in freights, and whilst one may quibble over the wording of the cables which have passed between the the Government and Lord Kylsant, I do not think that the general tenor of the agreement is disturbed. Of course, one foretell what will happen. Even on State-Owned railways, freights bave had to be increased because of Arbitraaltion Oourt awards, and I assume that any proposal at any time by the purchasing company to increase freights will be deconsidered on its merits. The Commonwealth is well safeguarded by the terms of the Prime Minister's cablegram of the Buyers to guarantee to inaugurate a fortnightly service via the Suez Canal, supplepresent fleet with suitable vessels as soon as possible after delivery, say, within nine provided trade justifies it. That is a perfectly legitimate provisov Tbis is a business transaction, and if suffitrade is - not offering it would be foolish to require the company to run its ships 'empty. We hope and believe that trade will be available to keep the fleet profitably occupied. The cablegram The establishment in Australia of a responbody representing all interests concerned, and no general increase in homeward freights to be made without reference thereto. Suchto - be selected by the Government and thebe That is a satisfactory safeguard. This by Lord Kylsant links up the whole of the Conference lines and ensures that there shall be no increase in freights immediately, and probably not at all. as The Government has disposed of the ships in a business like way, and the taxpayers of Australia, who are closely in terested, will benefit materially by the transaction. The primary producers, particularly will be advantaged by the regular service which will be instituted, and maintained long after the vesof the Commonwealth Line are worn In regard to the threat of the unions to boycott all ships controlled by Lord Kylsant, and to hold up the shipping commerce of Australia as a protest against the sale of the Commonwealth Line, I was glad to understand the Leader of the Opposition to dissociate himself entirely from such tactics. But industrial affairs in Australia are approaching a crisis, and the attitude of the seamen cannot be allowed to continue unchallenged. It is not right that a few men outside Parliament should be able to say to the legislature that if it does not as - they wish they will compel it to do their bidding. The constitutional authority of the people as exercised by this liament cannot be delegated to a few. sponsible people who do not understand, or are indifferent to, the terrible consequences of their actions. Nothing hurts the primary producer so mucb as the holding up of his exportable produce through shipping strikes. And speaking as a primary producer, I say that if these tactics are to continue, we shall be forced to take the law into our own hands and go to the capital cities, and place the extremists where they should be. As a representative of the primary producers, I would be glad to lead men from my electorate in any endeavour to maintain constitutional government.",34
99,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Hindmarsh) [3.15] Honourable members must have been amazed at the declaration that bas just been - made by an alleged apostle of constitutional government, that he and his fellow primary producers are pared to take the law into their own take. hands. No similar utterance been made by any person who is assowealth ciated with organized labour. that the country will take due notice the fact that these persons are prepared to break the law if they feel that in respect it is likely to interfere with their - private interests. It does not become .honourable member for Gwydir (Mr stances, .Abbott), who professes to represent a the interests of the people. - constituency that enjoys all the advanabsence tages of self-government, to utter a threat of that description. It is entirely trary to the sentiment that should actuate a man who occupies such an honoured position.",35
100,Mr STEWART,NORTH AND CENTRAL,The extraordinary thing is that those sentiments should cheered by honourable members wbo sit with the honourable member for Gwydir.,35
101,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"The utterance of the honourable member found a ready acceptance with and the approval of those who sit on the Ministerial side. It is clear that in a moment of forgetfulness or indiscretion the honourable' member gave utterance to the conviction that is in his heart and in the hearts of many of those who sit opposite. I ask that in future act those honourable members wbo in the past have spoken with their tongue in their cheek about the desire of other persons Parto destroy the effectiveness of constituirre- tional government and to abrogate the principles of law and order will bold their peace and hang their heads in shame. Some honourable members opposite are prepared to take the law into their own bands even to the extent of stringing up persons who dare to assert their right to what is their constitutional due. Tbis latest declaration is entirely contrary to the views that were expressed at the last general election, when on the plea of the maintenance of law and order honourable members opposite professed an anxiety to preserve to this country, everything that is sacred in the Constitution. This afternoon we have had the open declaration, without qualification or reservation, that they are prepared to take the law into their own hands, and in the most lawless and unworthy way to string up their .own fellow citizens beprecause of some action that they might has The sale of the Australian CommonLine is a gross misuse of power. I hope No declaration was made at the last of elections that would convey to the people an intention on the part of the Governany ment to dispose of the Line without a direct reference of the tenders, together the with all the particulars and circumto this House, which represents In the of any such declaration in either the policy speech or the public utterances conof the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), or any responsible Minister, surely we had a right to expect that the fullest information would be afforded to this House, and that we would be given the opporbe tunity of either accepting or rejecting any of the tenders submitted. I deprecate strongly even the suggestion that the Line should be sold. The interests of this country have been sacrificed. It appears to me that honourable members opposite * have only one consideration, that is, how to extract profits from the pockets of the people of Australia to satisfy their friends who are associated with private enterprise. It is obvious to me that freights will be increased to provide larger ""profits and greater dividends in the future. Private enterprise cannot run a utility or an enterprise more economically than.the Government. Mr G. FRANCIS - That is nonsense! Mr MAKIN"" - It is not nonsense. If the honourable member for Kennedy so designates my remark, he proves that he is not competent to express an opinion upon the subject. It will be found that there is more economical working with respect to utilities that are run for service and not for profit, than is the case when additional charges are added by those who desire to make a concern earn profits. That being so, I am confident that no great length of time will elapse before the primary producer will be made to recognize keenly the manner in which his interests have been subordinated and the extent to which his already heavy burdens have been increased, so that these Caesars of commerce and shipping, and others interested in the affairs of big business, may obtain further tribute. I do not ask honourable members to accept my word upon the point. I shall quote the remarks of others who are in a position to give advice in matters such as this. Tbey are not Labour men, but the positions which they occupy entitle them to have their views treated with respect. Mr Harold Burston, the editor of the Investors' Guide, and a man who is associated as financial editor with other public journals, has expressed the following view:That the Commonwealth Line has had some effect on freights is generally admitted, is certain that its withdrawal, leaving the Commonwealth without any locally-owned overseas fleet, would' immediately place shippers at the mercy of the world's big shipping combines. That language is definite, and it conveys only one meaning; that is, that with the Commonwealth Line out of the way, there will be a clear field for the privately owned shipping interests, which, no doubt, work together in perfect understanding, to so raise freights that they will be able to secure in the future greater advantages than they have enjoyed in the past. In 1923 Mr Larkin, who, as is well known, was the managing director of the Australian Commonwealth Line, gave expression to some rather startling views, in which he emphasized the power of the combine, and showed how they were prepared to fight against any agency that was likely to affect their interests and deprive tbem of the profits and dividends to which they felt they were entitled. A Sydney journal of the 15th March, 1923, contains the following paragraph:""Australians shall not ship goods in their own ships without being fined by the Commonwealth. This, in effect, was the law laid down by the great London conference of the Shipping Combine which caused me to take a contra action that resulted in freights to Australia being appreciably lowered."" So Mr H. B. Larkin, General Manager of the Commonwealth Line, wrote in an official communication which reached Melbourne today. He explained how this important freight reduction was brought about. Mr Larkin's letter states that no underlying political or other motive prompted his action, but that his hand had been forced by the discriminating methods used by the combine against the Government line. ""My experience since the reduction was made,"" he said, "" clearly shows that the decreases in freights are going to give a muchneeded fillip to the Australian overseas trade."" The honourable member for Gwydir argued that any reduction in freight had been secured through the agency of the privately-owned shipping companies. This statement of the late managing director of the Commonwealth Line is altogether contrary to that, and proves that the Commonwealth Line was the first to bring about freight reductions in regard to primary produce, the object being to give a much-needed fillip to the overseas trade, in which we are interested. Therefore, it is idle for honourable members opposite to endeavour to make the people believe that and it this Line bas not had a great effect upon the combine with respect to the freights and fares that they, were formerly charging. We should face the facts, and be prepared to admit that the Commonwealth fleet has served the interests of the Australian primary producers. The Line has been responsible for many freight reductions. A substantial reduction has been made in the rateson refrigerated cargo freights, such as butter, cheese, rabbits, and mutton, and there has consequently been a considerable saving to the Australian primary producers, who are at an advantage compared with the producers of New Zealand.",35
102,Mr GREGORY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,I do not think so. Mr G. FRANCIS - The Treasurer gave the figures.,37
103,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"There are other figures that give the true, position. In view of the great benefits that the Line has conferred upon primary producers, that any honourable member representing a country constituency, and posing as the ardent supporter of the man on the land, can lend himself to the sale of this Line passes my comprehension. There will surely be a day of reckoning. We leok to the people to rectify at the next elections this grave misuse of power by the Government. We feel confident that they will express opinion in no uncertain terms respecting the sacrifice of this great public utility. Let me place on record figures relating to freights. If Australian consignors had been obliged, during the last financial year, to pay the New Zealand rates on their refrigerated cargo, they would have paid £239,000 more than they actually did pay to place their products on the British market. Mr G. FRANCIS - Whose figures is the honourable member quoting?",37
104,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"If the honourable ber doubts my statement be is at liberty to examine the Commonwealth Statistician's figures, which are published annually. The extra payments by our producers would have been as follows:Rabbits, £8,055; eggs, £42,500; apples, £66,375; lamb, £6,059; mutton, £7,729; and beef, £108,838. Those figures clearly show how improper bas been the action of the Government in sacrificing the Commonwealth fleet. I wish now to refer to the safeguards that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) alleges will be :given to the Australian consumer, because - of the fact that a board is to be appointed to review any proposed increases in freights. When I pressed the honourable member to amplify his statement, he was unable to proceed very far. It must be remembered that increases in freights are not to be determined by this board, but are merely to be referred to it. The shipping combine will act first, and refer to the board afterwards, in striking analogy with the administration of this Government, because Ministers bave made a practice of performing certain acts of administration, and seeking parliamentary authority for them afterwards. It is idle for honourable members behind the Government to endeavour to make the primary producer believe that his interests will be safeguarded through an agency of this description, especially in view of the fact that that portion of the agreement which would have safeguarded his interests has been purposely omitted so as to give absolute freedom to the shipping combine to exact its demands upon the Australian people.",37
105,Mr WATKINS,NORTH AND CENTRAL,In any case the agreetheir ment will not hold once the vessels are taken over.,37
106,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"That is another matter to be considered. I can hardly conceive of any shipping combine permitting itself to be dictated to by a local body concerning the freights and fares to be charged on the combine's vessels. Even if the terms of the agreement are carried out, the people of Australia will not be safeguarded against the demands of the combine. It is most important, in view of Australia's insular position, that we should have mema government-owned line of steamers. I suppose that there is not another nation in the world that bas a greater need for such a safeguard. Through the sacrifice of the Line we are robbed of that independence that we previously enjoyed with regard to means of transport, and are now solely dependent on outside shipping interests. We must now accept what others are prepared to give us, and must pay whatever charges they care to impose upon us. The sale of the Line will seriously and directly affect not only our primary producers, but the community generally, and as Australia progresses as a manufacturing nation, the sale will seriously affect the efforts of our manufacturers. Henceforth we shall have to depend on outside interests for an essential service, and the sacrifice of the Line, when our geographical position and our isolation from the markets of the world are considered, is nothing short of a national tragedy. Such nations as France, Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and even Great Britain itself, have made liberal subsidies and bounties to shipping interests in order to obtain some measure of protection from foreign shipping interests. Great Britain advanced £2,000,000, without interest, to Britisb shipping interests, merely to protect itself against the demands and the power of American shipping interests.",37
107,Mr GREGORY,NORTH AND CENTRAL,That .was done as an appreciation of private enterprise for its assistance to the nation.,38
108,Mr MAKIN,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"It was done with the desire to protect the country, against the private enterprise and shipping interests of another nation. Honourable members opposite will find it difficult to justify their action in depriving the nation of an essential service wbicb bas thoroughly proved its worth. Every Australian citizen received direct or indirect advantages from the operations of ' the Line. The cost of living was reduced through the reduction of freights, and a sense of security was given to the community generally. Honourable members opposite waxed indignant at the thought that working men were enjoying the standard of living and working conditions which obtained on the sbips of the Australian Gommonwealth Line of Steamers, and they welcome an opportunity to place those ships on a register which will necessitate a lowering of that standard and of the wages paid to the men. It makes roe wonder whether those honourable members are truly Australian in their outlook; whether they really appreciate the wonderful possibilities that Australia offers to its citizens. Surely they are out of touch with the true Australian sentiment, and are unable to appreciate what has been one of the greatest factors in the building up of our nation-the superior conditions of employment that are enjoyed by our people. Now that the opportunity has arrived permitting them to band over this public utility to private enterprise, involving the transfer of the ships to another - register, and [166] necessitating a lower standard* of wages and conditions for the workers, and reduced security, honourable-members opposite applaud the action of the Government, and apparently consider it Well in keeping with the polioy and principles that they espouse. By lowering the wages of the workers they increase the profits of their supporters. By sacrificing public interests they serve those private interests that demand more and more from our people in wealth, health, and well-being, that seek at all times to fatten and batten upon those who are the true producers, those who truly add to our national wealth. I ask leave to continue my remarks on a later occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. HOUR OF MEETING. Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the Houae at its rising adjourn until Wednesday next, at 3 o'clock p.m. ADJOURNMENT. LEAGUE OF NATIONS ASSEMBLY: REKBESENTATIVE INDUSTRIAL PEACE C o if FEEJiNOE.",38
109,Mr BRUCE,NORTH AND CENTRAL,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.48] - I move That the House do now adjourn. Eor the information of honourable members, I desire to announce that, in accordance with the custom that has grown up during the last few years, the Government proposes to send a Minister of the Grown as the chief representative of Australia to the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, which takes place on the first Monday in September of this year. Senator MCLachlan will be the Minister wbo will go on this occasion. This morning the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) asked a question with regard to the industrial conference which 1I have been endeavouring to bring about between employers and employees. I then informed the honourable member that I had not received any reply from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Just prior to luncheon I received a letter from Mr Crofts, the secretary .of the council, intimating ' that his council waa not prepared to accept the Government's imitation to attend the .conference. Hoaorable members will rememiber that a similar position occurred previously, but that then, on representations which I made to the coimcil, it was agreed that the matter should be re-considered at a full meeting of the council. That re-consideration has now taken place, and we bave received the intimation that I have mentioned. In tbese circumstances there appears to - be no alternative for me but to abandon, for the present at all events, the idea of arranging a conference with the object of doing something towards ensuring industrial peace and a better spirit in industry generally. I am consequently replying to the council that I regret its decision, but that in the circumstances there would seem to be no advantage in making further efforts to bring about the conference. I am also communicating to that effect with the various associations of organized employers which had agreed to send representatives to the conference. Next week honourable members will be asked to proceed with the discussion of the motion to print the paper relating to the sale of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The Government desires also to give the House a further opportunity to consider the report of the delegates to the Eighth Assembly of the League of Nations. I promised several honourable members some time ago that I would give notice when it was proposed to deal further with the report of the Imperial Conference. The Govermnent hopes that it will be possible to do so next week. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.52 p.m.",38
