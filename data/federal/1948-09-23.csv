1,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Arising , out .of .the Government's decision .to remove .the control ever lbs distribution of new .motor vehicles as soon as circumstances permit, and following the action taken .recently to release from - control .all motor vehicles .of 12 horse-power and .under, is the' Minister for Transport in a position to indicate when further relaxations pf control may he expected, and whether the next step in de-control will remove the new Australian car ""Holden"" from the field of cars foT which jpermits are required ? . Mr ""WARD --Whils t the position in regard to .the supply of motor vehicles generally is .stall acute, it is being jconstanfly reviewed hy the Government. J am pleased to he able to say that, as from the l^t December next, all motor vehicles coming from soft.currency countries will ' be freed from control. That .decision will naturally exclude from control the Australian car ""Holden-"" to which the - honourable member - has referred. These relaxations do not indicate that an ample A-UBtralaa. The latest returns show that - there are approximately 76,000 unsatisfied applications for motor vehicles, of which 49,000 are. for motor cars and 27,000 for utilities. .Of. the unsatisfied applications, 70,000 are for motor vehicles manufactured in North America. These figures exclude 19,000 applications for motor vehicles of 12 horse-power and under from which control has now been lifted. Providing that the trade continues to co-operatewith the Government in ensuring that essential users shall get first priority in releases the Government believes that it will be able progressively to lift the control as from the 1st December next. COMMUNISM. STATEMENT BY MB . BURNS.",12
2,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister will recall that on several occasions I referred to subversive statements made Mr Burns, a Communist executive mementirely ber in Queensland, in which he that if Russia came into conflict with the western powers, including Great Britain, the Communist party would aline itself with Russia. The Tight honourable gentlemay man has indicated that he received report on this matter yesterday. Having perused the reports, is be now in a position to say what action will be this man, and will he now indicate whether or not he will review the attitude he adopted in the past in refusing to appoint a royal commission to inquire into activities of Communists in Australia! - Mr Chifley - A report has been received and a decision has been made relation to it. That decision will announced in a few days. As to the latter portion of the honourable member's queshis tion, as I have indicated before, no purpose would he served by the appointtralia ment of such a royal commission. ever, that matter will be given further consideration. NA ASSEMBLY. PBESIDBNT : ELECTION OF DB . H . V. EVATT, M.P.",13
3,Mr CONELAN,UNITED NATIONS GENERAL,"Does not the Prime Minister consider that the reports that .the Russian influence at the election President of the United Nations General Assembly was used against Dr Evait. prove conclusively that the lying propaganda of the Opposition against that right : honourable gentleman has been proved groundless? In view of the attacks on Dr Evatt by the Russian press, will the Prime Minister ask the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party whether they will assure Dr Evatt of their strongest support? Further, as the election of Dr Evatt is a high tribute to Australia, will the Prime Minister ask whether the Opposition proposes to offer him congratulations and good wishes ?",13
4,Mr HARRISON,UNITED NATIONS GENERAL,"I rise to older, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I take exception to the unparliamentary language in which the question is couched - I take particular have exception to the reference to "" the lying by propaganda of the Opposition "", which if unparliamentary, and I ask that indicated the remark be withdrawn.",13
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNITED NATIONS GENERAL,"The procedure is that an honourable member referred, to in unparliamentary language ask that the remarks be withdrawn. a [ do not think the honourable member for Griffith referred specifically to anv honourable member. Therefore, there is taken against - no point of order. i j & r . CHIFLEY - I have not studied has the voting list, but I understand that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr the Evatt) received a substantial majority of the' votes. His election to the presidency of the United Nations General in Assembly confers a great distinction npon be. ' the right honourable gentleman himself and on Australia. I am only sorry that work in the cause of peace is not so good well appreciated by some people in - Ausas it is 'by the great nations of the Howworld. With regard to the other matter referred to by the honourable member for Griffith, one naturally expects a great deal of jealousy from political opponents. . Mr Archie CAMERON - I ask the Prime Minister a question which arises out of the appointment of the Minister for External Affairs as President of .the General Assembly of the United Nations. Unless I misundersta""nd the position, the of the appointment of the right honourable gentleman to - that; officewill: entail his absence from Australia for long periods. Will the Prime Minister consider offering the services of the Minister to act as mediator in Palestine in succession to the late Count Bernadotte, so that he may carry out the work which he conceived and initiated, and in the fulfilment of which the Swedish mediator was assassinated ?",13
6,Mr CHIFLEY,UNITED NATIONS GENERAL,"The services of the Minister for External Affairs are too valuable to Australia for him to be allowed to .devote his full time to the work that would devolve upon a mediator in Palestine. I am not assuming that other mediators will he appointed to endeavour to compose the differences between the - lews and the Arabs in that country, but I. am speaking in an individual sense. 1 expect that, arising from the report of the late Count Bernadotte, a commission - ir similar body will be apoointed to deal with the situation in Palestine. I do not propose to consider the suggestion which the honourable member for Barker has made. NA KEROSENE.",14
7,Mr ABBOTT,DISTILLATE AND POWEE,"I have received nine telegrams from primary producers at Attunga, in the New England electorate, protesting against the quota imposed on power kerosene and distillate in the farming areas of New South Wales. The farmers who sent these telegrams say that they will not he able to sow their crops or do their ploughing and fallowing. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel whether the Government desires the farmers of Australia to grow more food for shipment to starving people in Great Britain and to oase the dollar position, or to cut down their production? It will not give them kerosene and power distillate in the quantities that they require,' as was done during the war, when the need for restrictions was greater tban it is today. I desire the information so that I shall be able to tell tinfarmers whether to carry on as they are and grow more food or to restrict proDear Sir/s, duction.",14
8,Mr DEDMAN,DISTILLATE AND POWEE,The honourable memfollows ber is not really asking the question in the interests of the farmers.,14
9,Mr ABBOTT,DISTILLATE AND POWEE,"That is untrue. I desire to make a personal explanation, Mr. Deputy Speaker.",14
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTILLATE AND POWEE,Order ! The honourable member for New England must learn to control himself. The Minister has the call and must not be interrupted.,14
11,Mr DEDMAN,DISTILLATE AND POWEE,"The honourable member did not ask this question in the interests of the farmers. He asked it in the interests of certain oil companies. Because I happen to be a member of a Cabinet sub-committee that deals with supplies of petrol and kerosene, I know a good deal about the subject. It must be accepted-and , I think, is accepted by all honourable members of this House, irrespective of party-that it is essential, because of the dollar shortage, to conserve petrol and kerosene. When it was decided that kerosene imports had to be pegged at the quantity imported last year, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel asked the oil companies to agree to a base . period upon which to fix quotas for kero,sene. The companies could not agree among themselves. The Minister then asked them to refrain, in the meantime, from initiating a sales campaign to increase the quantity of kerosene held by farmers on their farms. An agreement to this effect was reached, and some of the ""companies honoured it, but others broke their promise, and embarked upon a high-pressure sales campaign in certain districts in order to ensure that, for a particular period of the year, their sales would be at a very high level, so that, when the quota was fixed, they would be able to claim that their average sales were greater than, in fact, they were. I have in my hand correspondence which show? that some of the firms did embark upon such a campaign. The following letter, dated the 1st September, 1944, was sent out by one of the oil companies which broke its promise, and refused to cooperate with the Government:To ALL ASIPOL AGENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES. This is it - i \ 31. Day. Wc confirm the telegram sent this day a - ""Go for your life, boots and all. Tliere is to be no press publicity yet from your end "". Toi those, of 70a whoi attended' the agents' regional, conferences, the purport of the. telegram is quite clear. To those who, unfortunately, could not attend theconferencesit is. not possible to. giveyou in writing the full and?, complete story, but our representative wilU be contactingyou within the next few 1 days and. will explain clearly what is' required. IPtease understand that at the: moment you only carry out phase No. 1 and we do not desire any publicity-pres s or otherwise-at your end until you are furtheradvised. (Suod tuck and goodi hunting. W.

Hei woald like tovictimize the writer of the letter;, but he; is no.t going to h.ay,e the opportunity to do ao.

The letter goes onA.M.P.. anagoing to. defy the Government, and have already taken legal advice and are prepared to go. to the High Court of Australia. A.M.P. are telling all. farmers to support them rather than leave themselves to the mercies of the bigger companies, and are trying to hook ahead three to six months' supplies for subsequent delivery. Two representatives, from A.M.P. addressed a meeting, of primary producers in the Sfarromiiiearea, and pointed, out to them that the Government was endeavouring to control supplies of power and lighting kerosene and distillate,, hint they,, the A.M.P.,, were, not prepared to. obey the Government's, instruc tions, and were quite prepared' to make am possible deliveries available, and' that farmerscould plaice, their orders - in. a. forward"" sense' The correspondence shows clearly that this is a ramp on the part of certain companies, which are trying to sell to the farmers kerosene in excess of their requirements. The honourable member fot New England and' all other honourable members may rest assured that, subject to Yourssincerely, the limitations which, because of the dollar shortage, have to be placed on. supplies of kerosene and petrol entering Australia, the Government will' take every step to ensure that the distribution to farmers shall be on an equitable basis. But the Government will not allow the honourable member for New England' or anybody else to be a "" stooge"" for oil companies that areendeavouring to break down the agreement into which they have entered.

'The first related my ruling on a point of order that been raised by the 'honourable member for Richmond. In that instance., I ruled that no point of order was involved. Any matte"" arising merely from the call fro m the Chair involves, in my opinion, a point of view and not a point of order. The Chair has the right to decide which honourable member shall receive the call. The other matter raised by the honorpower able member for Warringah related to call for a document. The - document question should bave been .called for the time at which a .quotation was made fr.om it .",16

25,Mr ABBOTT,DISTILLATE AND POWEE,"I desire to make a personal - explanation in reply to the comment of the Minister for Defence (Mr . Dednrnn) nipon my rniotives in referring to the .great difficulty in which certain farmers in the Attunga district of Tamworth have been placed by reason of the operation of the quota system imposed by the Government in the distribution of kerosene and distillate. T claim a that the. Minister for Post-war Reconi n struction misrepresented me when he at said that my action had been taken in the : interests of the oil companies and not of the farmers, and that I was a "" stooge "" have for those companies. The Minister is an ex-officer of the British army amd, as-such,. is supposed to be a gentleman. I propose to stow that I was not a "" stooge "" for the oil companies. The first of the telegrams of protest that I received in regard to this matter was from A. H . Gallagher, of Attunga. Has any honourable member heard of a "" Gallagher oil company"" in this country? The next telegram that [ received was from H . iScholes, of Attunga, and others were received from A. Easterman, L. Jeffrey, C. R. Brines and H . Doolan. Has any honourable member heard of a ""Doolan oil company""? Ji'urther telegrams were received from H . O'Dell and F . . Gallagher. Those telegrams conclusively rprove that I was misrepresented by the Minister. The honourable gentleman made his misrepresentation worse by quoting from a letter that he said was dated the 1st September, 1944. It is four years old. That makes it a stale document. I now ask, at this, the first opportunity I have had, that the whole of the. correspondence from which the Minister for Defence quoted be tabled in this House. I ask that that correspondence be recovered from the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley), to whom the Minister banded it after he had finished his reply to my question. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel thereupon promptly disappeared.

56,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Barker) ;3.11] - I raise one question that I do not think can be conveniently dealt with in the budget debate. I have given the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr. Drakeford) certain particulars concerning the state of the Kangaroo Island transport services, especially the air service. I have had occasion to refer to this uiatter before. Kangaroo Island, which is an important part of my electorate, is separated from the mainland of Australia by a strip of water. Sea communication is difficult. A ship of the type required - o improve sea communication is not available. The ship normally employed is going into dock and will not be avail-ible for several months. The only other uiethod of transport is by air. A service is run by Guinea Airways. The information I have, is contained in a letter, - vhich I passed to the Minister about ten lays ago. It is to the effect that the Department of Air intends to penalize Kangaroo Island residents still further by cutting down the normal air service during the coming summer. There are special conditions that apply to Kangaroo Island that do not apply to any other part of my electorate. They may apply in some other electorates. I - lo not know. But Kangaroo Island is a pleasure resort. Great numbers of prior people go there to holiday or to fish. people prefer to go there by air. a short flight. Ordinarily aircraft fly the journey in half an hour and improved aircraft in even less time. Local people ire not able to book passages by air as rule, because bookingsare generally made four, six or eight weeks ahead. So, with the small amount of steamer traffic offering and the cutting down of the air service, which is being made by the Minister for Civil Aviation, as the head of the department, people who wish to visit the island as tourists, including fishermen and others are sadly inconvenienced. So are local residents, who are not able to get air transport in an emergency. Another fact that the Minister must take into consideration is that the Government of South Australia, as agent for the Australian Government, intends to settle no the less than 250 ex-servicemen on Kangaroo into Island in the near future. Commonwealth and State officers who have to go to Kangaroo Island in connection with the preparatory work sometimes have to make the visit at short notice. With only one steamer a week providing an inadequate sea service and the air service ciit down, it is difficult for local residents, people engaged on official business, prospective settlers, holiday-makers, tourists and fishermen to get to and from Kangaroo Island. I should like the Minister for Civil Aviation to have a good look at Kangaroo Island. He was good enough at one stage, perhaps in a moment of weak-mindedness, to promise to go there with me some day.",20
57,Mr FRANCIS,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,He is afraid that the honourable member may leave him. there.,20
58,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"1 remember that when I was Postmaster General I dosed down a wireless station and then went, to Kangaroo Island on holidays. The heads of the station concerned had to fly to Kangaroo Island - to apologize to me. It was good Christmas fun. I ask the Minister to make it convenient as soon as he possibly can to go to Kangaroo Island and see the conditions for himself, because, if he is to control the Department of Civil Aviation, it stands to reason that places like Kangaroo Island, which are cut off by water from continental Australia, have a claim for air services to those people Most who have rail, road and private motor It is services to supply their needs. The other matter I raise is one that 1 would have raised at question time had : not the Prime Minister curtailed quesa tions. T do not know whether the right. honourable gentleman was attempting thereby to celebrate his birthday. At any rate, it is announced in the press today that Australia will receive as reparations from Germany the complete production unit of the watchmaking plant of Franz Herniie and Sons at Gosheim. [ should like to know from whatever Minister is concerned whether the plant will be submitted at public auction or whether it will be disposed of privately and, in any case, whether the interests of the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) will be safeguarded.",20
59,Mr DRAKEFORD,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"MaribyrnongMinister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [3.17] - On the 16th September, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) sent to me under cover of a letter written by himself a letter written to him by a Mr Bennet concerning the Kangaroo Island air service. The letter was sent by me to the Department of Civil Aviation for examination. [ sent this reply to the honourable memberI acknowledge your strong personal representations in support of the desire of the District Council of Kingscotc that additional air services should be made available to' Kangaroo Island. The importance of adequate transport for residents of the island is appreciated, and I note from Mr Bennet's letter to you that it is understood Guinea Airways intend to curtail service during the summer. The position is being examined and as soon as I am able to do so I shall let you have further information. The way in which the honourable member has presented the case makes it appear that the department is using some compulsion in that direction.",21
60,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,I think is so.,21
61,Mr DRAKEFORD,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I doubt it. As a matter of fact, whatever is done in regard to the consumption of aviation spirit by civil aircraft will not apply to subsidized services, and I think the Kangaroo Island service is subsidized. In any case, the proposed reduction will not amount to 5 per cent, of existing services, and that relates only to non-subsidized services. So, if the service is conducted four days a week the actual curtailment over a year would not amount to more than a day or two.",21
62,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,But the service is carried on four or five times a day.,21
63,Mr DRAKEFORD,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"The service, if it is not subsidized, cannot be exempted from whatever cuts are decided upon without incurring the risk of other people coming along and saying that they have an equally strong case. I appreciate the honourable member's concern about the Kangaroo Island service. No instruction? had been issued when that letter was written for the service to be curtailed. The matter of curtailment of civil aviation services is still being considered by the Government. No fuel order has been issued. Until the fuel order goes into operation, it rests with the Guinea Airways whether it continues the service to Kangaroo Island on the present basis or not. If the fuel order is operated, unsubsidized services will be cut by 5 per cent. As for the honourable member's references to shipping, we have, of course, no control over shipping services. I did tell the honourable member that I should be happy to visit Kangaroo Island and see the place where he had a victory ovei radio people when he was Postmaster General. But it is not possible for me to go to all the places I want to go to If I can. arrange a time to suit the convenience of the honourable member and myself, which cannot be in the immediate future, I will go to the island with him. The matter of ait services is being examined to ensure that the people shall not be deprived of any essential transport. The honourable member mentioned the development of soldier settlement on Kangaroo Island. He said that 250 ex-servicemen were to be settled that there. Obviously, when they are settled there, extra transport services will be needed. That will be considered in due course. I do not know of any intention of the Department of Civil Aviation to reduce the existing service to Kangaroo Island or of any order having been given to that effect.",21
64,Mr RANKIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Bendigo) [3.20] - 1 desire to bring to the notice of the Government the position of elderly persons, who have all their lives been good citizens, and have succeeded in saving some money. In my electorate, there, are several such persons, who have saved as much as £1,000 or £1,500. One man acceded to the request of the Treasurer (Mr. Ohifley), and invested his £1,500 in a war loan at 3$ per cent., which yields him £46 17s. 6d. a year. That is his only income. The prospectus of the loan appealed to the public to lend their money to the Government, and so prevent inflation. The man of whom I speak applied for an age pension, but was told that he was not entitled to it because he had more than £750. The department suggested that he should spend the money so that he would become eligible for a pension.",21
65,Mr EDMONDS,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,What department gave that advice?,22
66,Mr RANKIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"The Department of Social Services. I have the applicant's letter, and I know that similar advice has been given in other instances. The department says, in effect, to the applicant: ""We realise that if you did not have this money you and your wife would be eligible to receive pensions amounting to £213 a year. We know that you cannot live on £46 a year. Therefore, we suggest that you spend your money, after which you will be eligible for pensions "".",22
67,Mr EDMONDS,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,But if he spent the money in certain ways he would still not be eligible for a pension.,22
68,Mr RANKIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"That is so, but the man and his wife could use the money to defray living expenses, and so live comover fortably for a couple of years. Then, when it was spent they could apply for pensions, The Government does not give sufficient consideration to thrifty, deserving zens who have saved money. It treats better those people who, through misforwithout tune in some instances, or through their own fault in other instances, have come destitute. I do not claim that person who has £1,000 or £1,500 is that entitled to a full age pension, but should be entitled to receive the difference between the pension and the income which his savings yields. I do not propose to last year. state the name of the man whose letter I have here, but I shall supply it to the Minister for 'Social Services if that desired. I urge upon the Government the need to ensure that sufficient sugar is made available this year to preserve the fruit crop in the southern States. In the electorates of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen). and in my own electorate, a great deal of fruit is grown, and it is important that sugar should be available to preserve it. About 20 per cent, of the Victorian fruit crop was lost last year because of the scarcity of sugar, with the result thai the growers suffered loss, and the people of Britain, who are so much in need of preserved fruit, had their supplies curtailed. Even in many parts of Australia people are unable to obtain canned fruit. There is a general scarcity of sugar in Australia, and in many districts housewives cannot buy more than 2 lb. at a time. This is not the fault of the sugar growers, or of the manufacturers. I was in Queensland recently, and found thai the mills had large quantities of sugar on hand, and that the growers could produce a great deal more cane if they were allowed to do so. The trouble is due to transport difficulties, and the fact that the Government is not prepared to deal with those who are creating the difficulties. For this reason, raw sugar cannot be brought south for refining. The people to whom I spolae in the north of Queensland were afraid that, because of the accumulated, stocks of raw sugar, the mills would not this year be able to take all the cane offering. The fruit harvest in Victoria will begin in a little three months' time, so that the Government must take action now to ensure that sugar is available for processing the fruit. Otherwise, the fruit-growers will citilose the reward of their labour, the people of Great Britain will have to go the fruit they need, and Australia will lose the value of this export betrade. I hope that the Minister for the Immigration (Mr Calwell) will ensure sufficient labour is made available to he the cane-growers and sugar mills to ensure that the southern frui t crop will not be criminally wasted as happened",22
69,Mr CALWELL,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Melbourne-Minister is for Information and Minister for Immigration) [3.26] - Referenc e has been made to the production of sugar, the provision of adequate supplies for the people of Australia, and the despatch ©f the isiwplus products to Great Britain. Honourable members will recall that early this year., a cooitference of cane-igrowers was held sat Grafton, in New South Wales. I. attended by invitation, - and discussed vviish the 'came-growers' executive lem's associated with the industry. promised that 1,000 Baltic workers would go into the sugar-producing disdespatched ti-icts 'of Queensland to ©a* cane. That promise was fulfilled, although it was with' difficulty that we were able to ca-ne, arrange 'at such short notice for the, cation of so many men <to - a industry. However, 900 Baits went into the industry. W'e also promised to obtain the seawices of 400 former members of the Polish Army, who had fought in portation possible. association with the British Army during the war. It was also arranged to issue working. landing 'permits on the application of 500 families in Queensland, who wished to nominate 'friends or relatives in Italy, so that they might 'cosm'e to tralia to cut cane. They were to - come at the expense'of their-own relatives and satisfied. friends. The Australian Government was not 'obliged to - arrange transport, 'or to (-ontribu'te 'towards the payment of their fares. 'Strangely enough, when the Baltic workers went into the cawe-fiefl'ds, many Australians, Who had 'previously been associated with the industry, had. not worked in it 'the previous year, also '"" turned up "" when the 'gangs being signed on, and there Was plenty of labour for cutting all the 'cane. estimated sugar harvest this year is S00,000 'tons, and the expected .price be about £25 a ton. Thus, the, sugar cheque will be approximately £20,000,000, or £5,000,000 more than last year. When year'« crop. .1 was in Queensland for three or four weeks during July, I saw the Baltic additional workers in action. I spoke with the the Minister. millers, the cane-growers and members of the 'executives of the Australian Workers Union, as well as with repreplaces sentatives of the shipping company, and at ""that time. I found everybody perfectly happy. The Baits were fitting very factorily into the indtus'fcry iftasui tat time, they were earning between £2 £2 10s.« day, and some Austral iatn cutters were earawing between .£-3 SS 10s. is day. Mr Calwell. The sugar was also being shifted. There was a short interruption following the big strike in Queensland, and for a period, the State railway department was unable to supply sufficient trucks., but by thf middle of J.uly, all the sugar which waf probbanked up last year had been shifted, I with the exception of about 339 tons ai one mill. The South Johnstone M ill ha<3 not only 6,000 tons - of thif year's crop, but also 7,000 tons of last year's 'crop.

77,Mr CALWELL,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"That is so. The Goout. : vernment also had to decide what was the general community. to the idone with the sugar when it was despatched from Queensland to southern ports.

I do not, but I am holding brief for former soldiers, - sailors and Goairmen, who were induced to settle on the land in my .electorate, and who, today. are at their wits' end to obtain sufficieni fuel for their machines. Great difficult;} has been experienced in obtaining an adequate number of tractors to enable primary producers to increase production, which is so vital, but restrictions have now been placed on the quantity of fuel if that primary producers require for their machines. Those restrictions will create a sew outs - position. Many of the settlers have - been induced to increase production. of They were <not satisfied to work a 40-houi v.ee""k, 'hut 'used their tractors by day and : night to culfivate the land. Provided seasonable conditions continue to be favourable, they will soon begin to harvest a good crop.

I am not satisfied with - the explanation of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman.) that the actions of oil it companies are responsible for the lack to of adequate supplies of power 'kerosentto meet 'the requirements o¥ primary producers. Had the Minister's 'advisers the trouble to ascertain the-quantitj the of .tb'is fuel Which was usefl 'during - the past twelve months, and had he based a quota on that information, I believe that the Government would not have found it necessary to introduce the restrictions. An adequate supply of power kerosene is vital to our programme for increasing food production. If increased supplies of. fuel are not made available in the near future, the farmers will not be able to harvest the crops, and their hard work for many months will have been abortive.

78,Mr DALY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Martin) [3.40] - I wish to refer to the bitter and cowardly attack that was made upon the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Mr Lamb, in this House on the 9th September last by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang). If the attack had been made in the public interest, there might have been some merit in it.",25

A discussion on a motion for the adjournment of the House, however, is a general discussion, and I rule that the honourable member for Martin is entitled to deal with any matter that was raised on such an occasion. The motion for the adjournment of the House provides an opportunity for honourable members to air their grievances in much the same way as the present motion does.",25
89,Mr DALY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I was not present in the House when the attack was made, but 1 read of it subsequently, and I feel that some reply should be made to it. If the attack upon Mr Lamb had been made in the public interest there might have been some merit in if, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be claimed that it was made in the public interest. The attack was a continuation of a personal vendetta which Mr Lang has again3t Mr Lamb and was made purely for political purposes. It is known to all honourable members of this House that there is no more conscientious or popular member of the New South Wales Parliament tban Mr Lamb, the present Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His electorate of Granville constitutes the major portion of the new electorate for Reid, which is represented by Mr Lang, Mr Lamb's popularity in his electorate is shown by the fact that at the last two elections he defeated the Lang Liberal the candidate, sponsored by Mr Lang, and had majorities of over 10,000 votes. His popularity among his fellow parliamentarians is shown by the fact that he was unanimously elected as .Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. One has only to converse with members of the State Parliament of all political parties to learn that Mr Lamb is highly respected by all of them. That makes the attack upon him in this House by the honourable member for Reid all the more deplorable. Why then, it might well be asked, does Lang continue to attack Mr Lamb? It is because he hates him. It is because he fears him and his influence with the electors, whose suffrages Mr Lang will be seeking at the forthcoming federal general election. The basis of the attack made by the honourable member for Reid",25
90,Mr ANTHONY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I rise to order. I think it is laid down in our Standing Orders that one honourable member may not reflect upon the motives of another honourable member in making certain :harges.

102,Mr DALY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"If my remarks were offensive to the honourable member, 1 withdraw them. The basis of the attack upon Mr Lamb that was made by the honourable member for Reid, and which was delivered with considerable vindictiveness, is that Mr Lamb, as a director representing the employees on the board of an insurance company, proved himself to.be a bad Labour man and a bad trade unionist. Those charges were listened to in silence by the honourable member who is constantly interrupting me when I am attempting to reply to them. The basis of the charge made by Mr. Lang is entirely groundless. The facts reveal a very different state of affairs. It is on record at the head office of the insurance company concerned that in 1939 the managing director issued a circular instructing members of the staff to join a union. They did so. After twelve months the two members of the staff who are alleged to have supplied Mr Lang with statutory declarations -;eased their union membership, the union being the New South ""Wales Insurance Officers Association. Tbis union ceased 'o operate later on, and members individually transferred to the Insurance Clerks Federation.

104,Mr DAILY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I shall accede to the wishes of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann). The two *x-employees of the company from whom the honourable member for Reid obtained statutory declarations-which , I am informed, will at a later date be proved - m oath to be false-were not dismissed by the company because they wanted to join a union. They were dismissed for far more serious reasons, including their refusal to supply the company's auditors with information concerning allegations they had made. They were, lismissed by the managing director, who in the circumstances, had no alternative. Mr Lamb had nothing whatever to do .vith their dismissal which was purely an idmindstrative act by the management. Tn his endeavour to besmirch Mr Lamb the honourable member for Reid - ecklessly and without justification, attacked the insurance company against - vhich he had no grudge. On the - ontravy, the managing, director of that insurance company gave - the honourable member for Reid substantial financial assistance to establish his newspaper the Century-. In his recklessness the honourable member for Reid had no regard for ""he company or its policy holders. It is a - ompany which, I have learned, stands very high in the esteem of its policy holder;: and bas rendered a first-class service to them. It is true that the company's actuarial liability at present exceeds its assets. That has also been true of every such company at some stage or other of its progress"" or development",27
105,Mr MCEWEN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,Is . the honourable member reading his speech?,27
106,Mr DALY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I am quoting from m j notes, as I have not such a fund of knowledge as the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), I have learned that the company pays all its legitimate claims and charges in full. It shows handsome annual surpluses, and like other such companies, will at no distant date, overcome its present actuarial disability The honourable member for Reid is the last man I know of who should attack, any company. The manner in which he obtained money from friends and supporters to launch his newspaper the Century, was snide and dishonest. Those from whom he obtained money understood that they wert taking shares in the Century, but latei they discovered that the honorabh member for Reid had put their money into another company, Express .Newspapers Limited. They have also discovered that their shares in that company are not, and can neve be, worth the paper they are writtei on. The honourable member put his own money into the Century where it is safe and secure, and likely to show profits because of the support given to that newspaper by the well-known vested interests - whose willing tool he is. The honourable member's attack on Mr Lamb has' done that gentleman no harm, but has broughi contempt on his own head. The honourable member for Reid' has the falsereputation of being a brainy man, and yet his only contribution to the national welfare since his election to this Parliament has been to trail around' a muckrake and to stab and strike first at one individual or organization, and then at another: By his 1 actions he has degraded the National Parliament and is not a fit and proper person to be a member of it. On the other hand, Mr Lamb, who is the honourable member for Granville in the New South ""Wales Parliament, has a long record of loyal service toi both the: Labour and trade union movements and has been continuouslya member of both since a .'ery early age. He is a respected member of the trade union movement and his reputation may be said to be much higher aud greater than that of the honors able member for Reid, who has so viciously attacked him. I ao doubt that when the New South WalesParliament re-assembles Mr. Lamb will fully answer the charges made against him in this House by the honourable member for Reid and will expose that honourable member for what he is, which is, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) once described him, a ."" nuisance and a menace - r the political life of this country "".",27
107,Mr DAVIDSON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Capricornia) [3.55'J. - rl refer to the question of the despatch of sugar supplies from northern Queensland. Earlier this afternoon the honourable! member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) discussed this question from a different point of view to that from which I shall deal with it. He put forward a plea for. action to ensure that producers in - his area, mainly fruit-growers, should be supplied with sufficient quantities of sugar to enable them to process their crops. I was pleased to notice that the honourable member, no doubt because if the knowledge gained during his recent tour of Queensland, realizes that any shortage of sugar supplies sent to southern fruit-growers is not the result of produc-' tion shortages in Queensland. I thank him for his-acknowledgment of that fact. The honourable member referred in his remarks to the fact that it was possible that, unless sugarat present stored: in mills was shifted at an early date, processing of this season's crop might be - lelayed. I am pleased to notice that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) is in the Bouse,, as it is. ta his department that my remarks particularly apply. The question of the harvesting of the present sugar crop is me which has attracted' attentioa for - fome considerable period', not only in the sugar industry itself, but also in certain departments, of the AustralianGovernment which are associated with it. Becaiuse of the foresight which baa been a feature of the sugar industry for years,, it was realized early in the past that there were several, important factors which must, be considered in any action taken to ensure that this season's crop would be harvested. The first factor was tha there was> a carry-over from last year' crop. of a considerable quantity of sugawhich was held at mills and wharfs ii have north Queensland , which, if not shiftec 1 before the harvesting of this season's crop is undertaken, would seriously impede the harvest. The second factoi was the supply of labour for thif year's harvest. The third factor was the shiftingof thisseason's sugar production as it became available at millsand wharfs. With respect to tin first factor, as a result of various delibera tions, a good job was performed in liftine a considerable quantity of the sugat carried over, and when this season's har vest comes forward wharfs and mills will, in the main, be reasonably free of las; year's crop. The Minister for Immigra tion (Mr Calwell) stated, a few minutcfago, that he had made available to the sugar industry approximately 1,000 displaced persons from Baltic States to assist in the harvest. I am prepared to pay tribute to his. department for that action.. Those Baits are now working in the industry and, from information I have had. fron time to time, it appears that they are doing a good job. As a resuli of that, circumstance and of otbei considerations, mills are now able to work at something like 100 per cent of their capacity for the first time sinci 1941. The third problem, that of ensur ing that the present crop is shifted at t reasonable rate so that mill's will' not bi forced to cease processing work because of lack of storage space, has not yet been satisfactorily solved; in spite of tht statement of the Minister for Immigration that he believed sugar was being shifted at a reasonable rate. That this shall be assured is of great importance, not only to the sugar industry and to Australia, but also to Britain. The Government should d'o everything possible to ensure that the whole of this year's expected crop, which the Minister stated would amount to approximately 800,000 tons, will be lifted within a reasonable period. There are three things to be considered'. First, it is only reasonabhthat sugar-growers, who have had a rather thin time during the last three or four years, should be given every opportunity to take advantage of this year's ijood crop and the high export prices for - ugar obtainable at present. large tonnage of sugar is required by Great Britain. It was only yesterday or today that an announcement appeared in the press that Great Britain this year all the sugar that it could obtain from Australia as its full .vere not available from other sources. It was estimated that Great would require 400,000 tons of this year's Australian crop, the total of which, I repeat, is expected to be 800,000 tons. Australia's own sugar consumption 1:00,000 tons, so that if we are to meet the needs of Britain it is essential. to produce as much sugar as possible and to keep supplies, moving. factor is that after the middle of November and up to the end of December, depending on when the early storm rains come, it is not practicable to harvest sugar in Queensland. Towards the end of December, after rain, the sugar content in the cane decreases This fact may not be realized by honourable members generally. It is, therefore, desirable that nothing shall impede the rapid harvesting of the crop between now and the middle of December. of various kinds have been made to ensure that this year's crop shall be lifted in full. I have given close consideration to the problem. Unquestionably position is not entirely satisfactory. ascertained as the result of my inquiries that at the larger ports, although the tonnages shifted had fallen below the target set, the position is not yet but, at some of , the smaller the position has become cause manufactured sugar is not being lifted. This applies particularlv Bundaberg. Some time Kirby visited the sugar centres of north Queensland and arranged that all work in relation to the shifting and shipping of sugar should be organized to capacity. After his visit to Bundaberg various bodies, particularly the chamber of commerce, became interested the problem. Acting as an mediary, the chamber of arranged for a three months' in order to ascertain where the real Mr Davidson. trouble in relation to the slow turn-round: of ships rested. The watersiders agreed! to work at reasonable maximum capacity Secondly, a for a certain time, and the shipping companies agreed to supply ships in sufficient volume to lift all the sugar available. As the result of the t r i a l it was possible needed to determine whether the real trouble lay in the slow turn-round of ships or requirements whether some other factor was hampering the despatch of sugar from Queensland Britain ports. Yesterday I received from Bundaberg a telegram in the following terms:Bundaberg millers concerned present atti tude local watersiders. They refuse work is after five daily, including week-ends. Their action follows refusal request for payment attendance money daily. BaralabaThat is one of the sugar boats which The third serve this portBaralaba arrived Bundaherg Wednesday 15th, due depart Tuesday 21st, delayed three full days. This may result in shipping company curtailing service to Bundaherg unlessmen agreeable work full hours in terms their award. General sugar removals position serious without further petty delays. Reconsiderably. pectfully suggest you endeavour move department responsible for control waterfront. Have wired Senator Courtice similar terms. It is obvious from the terms of the telegram that the source of the trouble if Efforts simply a quarrel between the watersiders and the department responsible for the payment of attendance money. As the result of this quarrel farmers and others the dependent on the sugar industry in that I district are likely to be severely penalized. One of the responsible millers in the district wrote to me, as follows:Up to the 18th .September, 1948. the mill acute; had manufactured 10,055 sack tons"" of sugar. ports Despatchedacute, be- Through Bundaberg wharf 2 IS Through Brisbane wharfs and to to New Farm Refinery 1,256 ago Judge Through TJrangan 931$ 2,4224 In store at mill, Bundaberg wharf, maximum Brisbane wharfs and Urangan jetty .. 8,2274 in Our storage space at Bingcra is approximately 11,600 tons and little over 50 per cent, inter- of the mills' peak. The crop is estimated to commerce harvest from 28,000 to 28,500 sack tons of test sugar. The crop this year from that m ill will be about 28,500 sack tons of sugar. The mill has already manufactured 10,650 sack tons, but has not been able to despatch one-half of that quantity. In view of the importance of this matter to sugar producers, to the waterside workers who want the work, and to Great Britain which needs every ton of sugar we can produce in excess of our own requirements, I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) to inquire into it immediately so that crushing in the Bundaberg area may proceed without delay. If a mill is forced to stop crushing, the cane-cutters responsible for supplying that mill immediately go elsewhere for work and do not return. I earnestly appeal to the responsible Ministers to do everything possible to settle these differences between the waterside workers and the department so that the sugar may be lifted without delay.",28
108,Mr HOLLOWAY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [4.5] - It would be a great pity if the collective efforts made to l i sugar crop this year were to fail because of transport difficulties. After being successful in obtaining the necessary labour to handle the crop the Government hoped that its shipment to southern ports would be assured. We hope that the labour supplied to the industry will stay in Queensland and handle next season's crop. I have received several letters from millers and growers in Queensland thanking me for the labour made available to them. The bottle-neck in the sugar industry has nearly always been at the refineries. Both the companies and the governments concerned will have to cooperate in order to remove the bottleneck. The Government is doing everything possible to secure additional labour for the refineries at Sydney and Melbourne. One of the problems associated with the provision of additional labour is the building of the necessary accommodation to house the workers. I assure the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Davidson) that I shall do everything I can to assist the industry and I shall .at once discuss the problem with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) with a view to expediting the settlement of the matters in dispute.,30
109,Mr HUTCHINSON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Deakin) [4.8] I wish to raise a matter of more than usual interest not only to those personally involved but also to the people of Australia generally. A fortnight ago the Government announced that frequency modulation was to be introduced into Australia and that this new development in radio would be made available only to the national stations. This announcement gave rise to a good deal of concern, particularly among those associated with commercial radio stations. Unless we have grown completely cynical even in these days when the freedom of the people is being so much encroached upon, this is a matter which must be regarded as of first-rate national importance. This decision on the part of the Government will deny to commercial radio one of the most outstanding technical advances in the industry. The undeniable ultimate object of this decision is to smother and destroy commercial radio in Australia. This is but another step by the Government along the path of socialization, the first f t the steps having been taken last year when the Government announced that it proposed to nationalize the trading banks of this country. When that announcement was made there was intense indignation all over Australia at the proposal of the Government to take control of the people's wealth in all its forms. That move, however, was obvious to every person in Australia. Tbis proposal is much more insidious. This is a subtle attempt to socialize an industry by a man who for the time being controls the destiny of this country as Prime Minister. Consider the effect of a similar proposal on other activities. Let me draw an analogy between this proposal and a similar proposal to nationalize the transport industry. Suppose the Government of the day said to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited or to An sett Airways Limited, "" We shall not allow you to take advantage of any technical improvements or advances in the design or operation of aircraft. We propose to limit, these technical improvements solely to aircraft operated by Trans-Australia Airlines on behalf of the Government. We shall compel you, not at the moment, but .over the yearns, to become an .'obsolete industry, and (because of your obsolescence we 'undoubtedly shall ultimately destroy you"". What would be the reaction to snch 'a proposal.? We must remembeT that wie are dealing ""with .a Government that does not stop at a mild form socialization, but one which stands socialization in all its forms, «ven ""beyond the limits of the Constitution. In 1945 che Minister for Information Oalwell) moved the resolution that Labour party stood for 'complete socializadirect tion - even beyond the limits of the Oonstifhe r ution. The party's policy originally templated socialization within the limits of the Constitution, but the Minister responsible for the deletion from that plank of the platform of the words -'within the limits of the Constitution"".. Should this Government gain complete political .control - of banking it ""would jontrol 'advances, interest 'rates and exchange and thus have nearly all the powers it required to smash industry every kind. Now it proposes virtually to destroy commercial radio of the future. Let me give another example. Suppose it said to the primary industries, ""All the great technical advances and imcommercial provements that may come out of the laboratories of the world, and from search into animal husbandry are to the denied to you. These 'are to be used exclusively for enterprises under State control"". We can see at 'a glance the ramifications of this proposal to deny to commercial radio the latest technical advances and improvements. It is not be wondered at that many people have not yet awakened to the great principle involved in this proposal. They .do understand the proposal because it relates to a technical matter. Frequency moduprocess lation is in operation in the United of America, having - been developed to a very great degree by the commercial radio stations 'in that .country. 'Television, choug-h 'still in its infancy, will soon availa'ble to us. This proposal may not n'ffect 'anybody very much - at the moment, but 'ultimately frequency will provide 'additional wave lengths which - will ""be ample for both national and commercial stations. That applies also television, and doubtless there will be furHouse ther 'advances in 'radio 'science. Imagine Mr Hutchinson. the position if >all new technical processes are. 'confined to the national service operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. 'Commercial radio will be made - obsolete. iPeople will be equipped with apparatus built to conform to the of latest developments and the commercial for stations will have no listeners. An industry can be killed by the direct process as the '.Government contemplates 'doing (Mr with the Australian private 'banking the system, or by strangulation by the inprocess of making it obsolete, as Government is seeking to defeat thp concommercial radio system by making it obsolete. If the Government is allowed was to pursue its course of confining the operation of technical developments to the national instrumentality, commercial radio will undoubtedly suffer acomplete eclipse. An. interesting aspect of the second process of killing an industry has a bearing on the provision of the 'Constitution .for the payment by .the - Goof vernment of just compensations for the acquisition of property. The Sigh Court has ruled many times that "".jus; compensation "" means "" the value, of pro perty at the time of acquisition"". If radio stations are gradually squeezed out of the field by being denied reaccess to improvements, their value will be reduced to the point of absurdity al which point the Government will be able to step in and acquire them. I warn the Australian public that that process need not be. confined to the field of radio. There are other fields of industry tc to which it - can be extended by ,a Government hungry to nationalize industry. 1 do not believe that the authors of the not Constitution had in mind, when they wrote that provision, the thought that a would be discovered by which it States could be circumvented. People havrnot fully assimilated all the aspects of the Government's 'decision to confine the operation of frequency modulation radio be to the Australian Broadcasting 'Commission, but - the more they assimilate them the more they will realise that eommer modulation eial radio is doomed. The Broadcasting Committee, of which to I am a. member, is regarded outside this as ""the tra-vel'ling circus, greatest ! show on earth"". It goes to Queensland in the winter and to Tasmania the summer. It has; a great objection, to cold. It goes where the weather is warm,, but. not. too, hot,' because it abhors flies. Sometimes members of the committee from this side of the House accompany it and' sometimes not.. We. regard it as essential that one of us should accompany the: circus to keep, it under observation. Its cost must be considerable.. One of the two subjectsit most recently investigated was the reception of parliamentary broadcasts in certain areas! To make that' investigation a great peregrination' took place. Journeys were mad'em accordance with a plan to ensure that members would enjoy the best climatic conditions of the areas which' the committee' visited. One would naturally expect - that if any one wereasked, ""Would you like to receive parliamentary broadcasts'? "" the answer would be "" Yes"". Bt did not require' any costly committee to journey all' over the country to find that out. Nor did it requiresuch journeyings by the committee to discover how broadcasts were, to be. received. That is, not a matter, for: a. layman to investir gate. It is a. job for the. technicians of the Postmaster-General's Department. The second question was whether a fund should be establishedfor. the assistance of Australian composers.. As can easily be imagined, every one interested in benefiting, from such a fund turned, up to give evidence. They were ""hand, knees and. boomps a daisy "" into the honey-pot w,hen it was proffered to them. All members of the committee share the. desire to help Australian composers to get on to the musical map of the world, but. there was no need for the committee to travel the country at great expense to ascertain whether such a fund should or. should not, he established. The Postmaster General (Senator Cameron.) could himself more easily and at vastly less, expense have, arrived at the conclusion which the committee reached"". The committee has those useless tasks referred, to it, but. not such important tasks as inquiring into the adoption, of the frequency modulation system i u the Australian radio service, which involves such fundamentals in the. British way of life as freedom of the. air and the right of the individual ro enter a vocation! and advance himself in it. I asked' several timesi at. meetings of. the. committee when the subject of frequency modulation would come beforeit. I was never told and. it. never came-before the. committee, and I dp not think that it ever will do so. In other words, the committee will be given chicken-feed matters to inquire into at great oost, but will be denied' the right of inquiring into, fundamental questions affecting the national and commercial radio services of this country. Mr Harry Alderman was right when he wrote tc the Bishop of Newcastle! about station 2HD. to the effect that if the bishop did certain things for the Labour party and 1 gave it certain considerations be could be practically sure to. get the licence tc. operate that station-, because there was. a majority ofLabour men on the Broadcasting Committee. It is true that there is a majority of Government supporters on the committee. There would be a majority of our members of it if. we were in power. The point I am making is that party ideologies mustintrude into such a committee, and the Opposition parties and' the Labour party aue sharply divided , upon ideologies . Witb 1 1 ideologies entering into its considerations the committee is incapable of giving an impartial opinion on the problems it investigates. We have been chid in this debate for having failed to suggest, bow economies, couldt be made. I suggest that the committee be 1 abolished as soon as possible. It is a waste of. public money. It does not; dc one bit of good to> any one.",30
110,Mr HOLLOWAY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,Why does not the honourable member make a start by resigning from the committee ?,32
111,Mr HUTCHINSON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I am not talking personally..

112,Mr BEALE,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Parramatta) [4.33] - 1 J. was not present in the House when the CLARK.) budget was introduced, but since my re34 turn fro m abroad I have listened to 25 several speeches delivered by Government supporters. The dominant note that 1 9 have caught from their speeches has beer one of complete complacency. For them, all is well in this best of all possible worlds; this is a good budget, and our defences are adequate. Then there was a somewhat flabby, timid and pacifist suggestion that we should not talk about war. According to them, if wftalk more about peace and less about war, there will be no war. To me that if about the most dangerous attitude that any one could adopt. I should like to take honourable mem bers with me in spirit on a trip to the other side of the world as I saw it a few weeks ago. I went by a flying boat that left Sydney, and alighted at Bowen OD NOES. the coast of Queensland the following morning. From Bowen, we flew across the north Australian peninsula to Darwin. Down below we could see a grim and forbidding country, perhaps millions of acres in extent, known as No r t h Australia. It is washed by the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria and, from the air, that country looks lonely and hopeless. We came down at Darwin , on the northern side of Australia. I was forced to remember duringPATHS. the t r ip that our population numbers 7,500,000 people, who inhabit a continent with an area of approximately 3,000,000 square miles; and that half of Australia is arid and virtually uninhabitable. Our population density is less than three people to the square mile, and a great part of the continent is undeveloped and incapable of development. On the following morning, we passed across the Indonesian Archipelago, where, in a narrow group of islands, tbaT looked almost like pocket handkerchiefs spread out on the sea below, 70,000,000 people live and work. A considerable area of those islands is uncultivable, consisting as it does of mountain ranges and dense forests, but so much of the land as is fertile has been cultivated to the last inch. There, as I have said, 70,000,000 eke out an existence, and are multiplying year by year. On the subject of world population generally, I read recently that there are now 200,000,000 more people in the world than there were in 1939, notwithstanding the loss and devastation caused by the war. Compared with our population density of two and a half to the square mile, the population of the [ndonesian Archipelago is about 600 to the square mile. Another fact which strikes one forcibly is that the people do Avork. All the time, the growing popu-' lation is pressing upon the available space, and the land is proving too small for it. Ultimately, the time must come when the Indonesians will have to move out beyond their own small string of islands, as, indeed, their forefathers did less than 100 years ago, when they migrated to Singapore and Malaya. Those who ought to know, such as Vlieland the - lemographer, assert that Singapore and Malaya were not originally inhabited by the race of people which is now there. It was only after the British, under Sir Stamford Raffles, came to Singapore that large numbers of Indonesians moved in from Java attracted by the improved - conditions. In the island of Singapore, and in Malaya, there is a seething . mass of some millions of people, . most of whom toil on the land. Passing over those countries to the north of Australia, I was struck by the importance to the inhabitants of the river systems along which the bulk of the population is grouped. Typical examples are the Irrawaddy River, in Burma, and the river Ganges in India. I was reminded that, in this respect, Australia is at a grave disadvantage as compared with other lands. It is also at a disadvantage in that our great mountain systems run north and south, instead of east and west. That the direction of the lie of these mountain ranges is important is demonstrated by the fact that, in India, the monsoonal winds, blowing always in the same direction, carry the rain away from the Sind Desert, because of the harrier formed, by the Sind Mountains, so that the Punjab is fertile, while Pakistan, to' the - north, is arid. : Geographical conditions are of great importance to a country, and Australia, is not fortunate in this respect. This throws upon us a greater obligation tc do the best we can with what we have. My journey took me over Burma and then over India, vast stretches of which are uninhabitable, but the country nevertheless supports between 350,000,000 and 400,000,000 people. Most of them toil on the land and get their living from the soil, and they are multiplying rapidly. After leaving India, we passed over Arabia and North Africa, with their there dying lands. North Africa, which, according to my history books, was once the granary of Rome, is now, for the most part, an arid desert because of geographical changes. There is a lesson in this for Australia. Similar changes are taking place here as the result of soil erosion. In North Africa, the area of fertile land is contracting, and the population diminishing. Leaving Africa, we crossed France into England, where all the cultivable land is worked to the last inch by people who toil lovingly and faithfully upon it. The French peasants and the English farmers love their land, and deal faithfully with it. They, put back into the soil what they take out of it. with the result that, generation after generation, the land remains fertile. Let us take this journey again, from another angle. ""When one leaves Australia, and passes over the Indonesian Archipelago, one immediately remem bers that among the 70,000,001' people who inhabit those islands, there is at present in. progress :< Communist revolution. It was at first popularly supposed that the disturbance was an uprising of the people who,sought self-determination in government. Thai is not so, as every one is now aware. Alongside the racial revolution, there is in progress a first-class Communist outbreak, which has now progressed so far that the Communists bave attempted to take charge of the government of the country. It is the same in Malaya. The night I arrived at Singapore, a state of national emergency was declared because of the disturbances. There were barricades on the roads, and troops were everywhere. Fighting had broken out in - the hills, land a-Oommunist revolt - against the - government was in progress. When I reached 'Singapore on my way back to Australia, I was informed by people who ought to know, and 'whom I believed., that the revolution, - dthough superficially .under .control, was -<til! the cause of very deep concern. It was - suggested to me that it might be a long .""time before .effective control was - e-established. Another Communist revolt, .sponsored by a foreign power, has also broken out in Burma, a day's flight to the north-west >f Malaya. When the British, in their wisdom or otherwise, withdrew from - Burma, they left - a caretaker - government in power, but it could not control the - situation. A Communist revolution broke out, ;aaid as still in progress. In Siam a - similar revolution has broken out. These aire .not .uprisings of primitive peoples - fighting for the right of self-determination ; they are alien movements sponsored a foreign power. Next comes India. When I was in London, I was inf ormed by eminent members 'of the Indian community that they were deeply concerned about the spread of Communist doctrines in India. Those loctrines are not to be confused with r'he 'semi-religious "" communalist"" beliefs - rthich have always been current among rhe Indians; they are straight-out Communist doctrines, and they are spreading throughout the population. Across half the world therefore, between Australia and the United Kingdom, we encounter at almost every stride the problem of the alarming extension of violent communism. A similar situation exists in [ta'ly;-and France, im my view, at present hangs An the balance as a democratic power. Throughout Europe itself, ancient 3tates have been gobbled up one after another. But the political .situation in Germany demonstrates the final moral for Australian politicians and citizens. Four powers, which were supposed to - have 'been allies in World War II, are mow (trying to control a defeated power, Germany. I regret that the Prime Minister '(Mr Chifley) has just left the chamber, because I desire to express my gratitude to him for making it possible for me to fly to Berlin, where I stayed Mr Beale. for four .days. The .aircraft in which 1 travelled .flew down the northern 'corr-i<dor from Hamburg. After .having seen that 'devastated city, *and Berlin, I do not meed to be reminded by any honourable member opposite of the awful consequences of modern warfare. Whether atom bombs or .high 'explosive and incendiary bombs .are used is immaterial Modern war is too horrible for any responsible persons to want to contemplate, much less desire to cause. Berlin is divided into four sectors-t h British, the American, the French and the Russian. It is idle tc - comment on how that situation arose, or .say that better statesmanship might have yielded better results. The rea'l answer is that it ""was an ad hor arrangement, which was the best com promise that could be reached at the time The arrangement was made upon wha' seemed to be a justifiable 'assumption that 'Soviet Russia was genuinely 'desirous of making the compromise work. 'Unfortunately, events have proved that the assumption was not justified. 'The position now is that there is a quad-partittgovernment, which does not function be-cause the Soviet will not allow it to do so Local-governing ""bodies of democratically elected members of the German community are also unable to function because the Soviet, by interference, 'and indeed, violence, is preventing them from doing so. People are being kidnapped by day 'and night, and shootings are sa common occurrence. The - news of many of the outrages is never published in the press. There are forms of violence which haunt the minds of the people in the city, because - they do not 'know what will happen from one day to the next. Finally, Russia has created a grossly fantastic position .by suddenly refusing to allow the United States 'of America, - Great Britain and France to use road or rail transport into Berlin. Honourable members will remember that the German capital - is - situated nearly 200 miles inside the Russian zone of occupation, which begins on the seaboard north of the Elbe River and travels obliquely across Germany to Czechoslovakia. Of course, the Western Powers never intended that that area should be regarded as Soviet territory. It was to be the Soviet zone of oceaapation, pending the signing of the peace treaty. Under the arrangement between the four powers, the zone was to be occupied by Russian troops, but the German populace in it were to receive .instruction in the functioning of the democratic system. But the iron curtain has dropped along the western border of the .zone, which, for practical purposes, has now become Russian territory. The exception is Berlin, which, it seems to the American, British and French commanders and politicians, must therefore continue to be jointly occupied by the four powers, and not solely by the Russians. The reason which the Russians gave for their decision to forbid rail and road transport into the city was ""technical d if f i c u l t i e s Of course, that explanation has not deceived anybody. The - so-called technical difficulties have not been remedied, and for nearly three months no road or rail transport has passed from western Europe into Berlin. The result would have been that, under normal conditions, between 2,500,000 and 3,000,000 Germans in Berlin would have starved or frozen to death, because coal, food and other supplies would have been denied to them. The Western Bowers considered that their prestige demanded that they .should counter the Russian move, and they resolved that they would not tolerate the position. I wholeheartedly endorse their attitude. Ever since, we have been transporting by air the food and fuel which the Germans in the western sector of Berlin require. The air lift continues every day. As I stated earlier, I flew down the air corridor from Hamburg into Berlin, and left the city by another corridor. The flights can be difficult and trying adventures. Each corridor is narrow, and Russian planes may fly about them at any time. Weather conditions are not always suitable for flying, and the young pilots with whom t flew, skilled as they were, were obviously under great strain. But they are doing the job, and I believe that, in the Pace of any difficulties that may arise, they will continue to do so. At Gatow airport, in the British sector, the commanding officer, a group captain of the Royal Air Force who deeply impressed me, 3tated that the air lift had been increased from three or four aircraft a day to about 300 planes a day and this will increase further to 500 planes .a day. That information is not secrel At Templehof airport, which is in tinAmerican sector, American officers told me a similar story. After a small' beginning, the Americans are now usinga large number of aircraft in this service. I met many of the important and wellinformed people there, and all of then stated that the air lift will continue aslong as the Russians deny us the use of road and rail transport to and from Berlin. If necessaiy, it will continue during the winter months. Thai will not be easy. In October, mists begin to close in over the valleys, and flyingconditions will be more difficult. In t h depth of winter conditions of snow, ic<and fog become intense, and flying risk? will be further accentuated. Nevertheless, I was informed that the British anaAmerican Governments are determined trcontinue the air lift. At this point, I interrupt the theme of"" my speech in order to make a plea to the Prime Minister that the gesture which he made earlier in offering to send Australian air crews to assist in the air lift should be repeated. The offer wasextremely well received overseas, andcreated a fine impression of imperial solidarity.",33
113,Mr SPENDER,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"How many aircraft did Australia send for the purpose of"" assisting in the air lift ?",36
114,Mr BEALE,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I do not know. 1 understand that fifteen Dakotas wereoffered, but the Australian Government was informed that they were not required, because bigger aircraft were availablefrom the United States of America. Speaking subject to correction, I believe that Australia sent abroad the number of air crews - required for fifteen aircraft. Another offer of assistance will enhanceAusfcralia's reputation abroad, and increase the feeling of moral solidarity, which is so vital at the present time. Young Australian airmen would be glad to serve in an adventure of that kind, insuch a worthy cause. Yesterday, I asked the Prime Minister whether he would consider offering additional air crews,, but in reply he merely said that no request had been made for tbem. I talked to air crews in Berlin, and to commanders, and I know that any offer which Australia makes - to supply air personnel will be gratefully, gladly and eagerly accepted. I hope that the Prime Minister will not lose this opportunity to enhance our prestige overseas. I return now to the main theme of my speech. The fantastic conditions, which make the air lift into Berlin necessary, will continue as long as the Russians deny the Western Powers the right of road and rail transport into that city. The remarks which I am about to make are not intended to be provocative, because no one who has a knowledge of the situation in Europe desires to act provocatively, but I believe that the Parliament mould have the benefit of the opinion of honourable members who have witnessed the conditions in Europe. It is my judgment that Russia intends to take western Europe if it can get it. We must decide whether we shall allow Russia to realise that ambition. I also believe that Russia plans ultimately to dominate the whole world, and, therefore, Australians, who believe in democracy, must make up their minds whether they are prepared to stand hy while Russia proceeds to achieve its ambitions. Speaking for other members of the Liberal party, and, I believe, for nearly all Australians, I say that Russia must not be allowed to overrun western Europe. We dare not permit the Soviet to take the whole of western Europe and to flood the world with its philosophy and ideology, discoloured as it is with the - itain of having 12,000,000 people in concentration camps. The Russian Communists believe in government by a ruthless dictatorship, which denies to individuals their right of self-determination and self-expression and is fierce, and utterly destructive of every principle in which we believe. Sooner or later, we must take our stand with the other democratic countries, and deny to Russia the world domination that it . seeks. My opinion may be expressed thus, "" If we have to fight, we must fight"". Many knowledgeable people in Europe believe that a third world war is inevitable. God forbid that this should be. acres in Berlin where buildings once stood are strewn with rubble and Mr Beale. twisted iron. There are thousands their of rickety buildings without windows and roofs, and where many of the people live I do not know. Those scenes of desolation and devastation were caused, not by an atom bomb, but by high explosive and incendiary bombs, which are less destructive. I shrink from the thought that this country or any other country should be subjected to such destruction. Nevertheless, the thought that we should have to surrender to Russia because we - did not resist at the right time, or because we were not firm in the early stages, is completely untenable. We must not give up the only way of life that is worthwhile to people like ourselves. I repeat: If we have to fight, we must fight. If we do not make it perfectly clear to the Russians where we stand in the matter, we shall certainly have to fight. We ma.\ leave it too late. I come now to the conclusions which 1 draw from the world situation as I saw it in the course of a few weeks. 1 frankly concede that my examination was in some ways superficial. It could not have been otherwise in the time that I had at my disposal. Australia today stands in a position of the most deadly danger. If I am charged with exaggeration, I shall plead, "" Not guilty ''. Those words are, if anything, an understatement. Never before in our history, and I do not exclude the year 1942, have Australia and the things for which w» care stood in such danger. The populations of the small islands to thcnorth of Australia are increasing and will eventually have insufficient space in which to live. We are, therefore, faced with the danger that one day we may find in isolated places around the Australian coast, which are not at present populated, little groups of people who have drifted to those places in one of the racial movements that tend to occur when economic pressure drives people from their homes. This may occur almost imperceptiblynot in pursuance of a deliberate policy of conquest, but because of the pressure of economic forces. If that happened we could not bayonet or shoot them. The Many only preparations that can be made against that kind of almost imperceptible movement must be made>inadvance of and not after the event. Then there is the threat of a Communist war starting in Europe and spreading its red cide to our shores. I believe that the only response' to these things is to work desperately hard. We cannot have in A.ustralia a paradise either for workers or managers. The danger that threatens is too great. We must work hard to increase production, and particularly the production of food, so that we may feed, not only ourselves, but also our allies and people in other parts of the world. When we speak of the arid centre of Australia, which probably comprises one-half of the continent, we must not overlook the fact that, according to the geographers, there is a very fertile area of country stretching from the north around the coast to the west. We must develop the rich, fertile mid cultivable parts of Australia to the utmost degree and in the shortest possible rime. That is a task which demands real statesmanship, and no party shibboleths or preconceived ideas or prejudices should be allowed to turn us from it. We must also expand our defences. Having regard r.o our needs, the defences of Australia at present are paltry, shabby and foolish. We could not defend anything with the lefences which are proposed. We may go down, as other nations have done before. Nothing is static. I do not believe that we shall go down if we manage our affairs properly. But if we do not take - Irastic and immediate action, and have proper regard for the trend of developments in the world, we most certainly shall go down.",36
115,Mr BLAIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Northern Territory) [5.5] - I was engaged in preparing notes for a speech, and I did not expect to be called at this moment. However, as honourable members opposite apparently - lo not wish to speak now I shall step into the breach. I was not in Canberra when the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) delivered his budget speech. I was in Queensland, investigating the remarkable job that is being done by the Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, through the agency of that highly qualified and - - fficient officer, Mr Kemp. I refer, of - ourse, to the food production scheme at Capella in northern Queensland. I have read the report of the Treasurer's speech.

At the end of the speech, the right honourable gentleman s a i d Much has been said about providing incen tive for workers but I believe that the best incentive that can be given to workers is a sense of security-securit y of employment and security against sickness, unemployment, and the disabilities of old age. The industrialist, again, can forward his project with most confidence if he knows that demand will be sustained. Of this the best, guarantee is full employment and the provision of adequate social services to those people who have to spend the greater part of their incomes on necessaries. Therefore, security, in the largest sense, has all along been the keynote of the Government's financial and economic pro gramme. We have heard a lot about security, but it does not always ring true, especially to those people who possess the spirit of adventure that this socialist-communist Government desires to kill.",38
116,Mr FULLER,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,Is the honourable gentleman opposed to the payment of age pensions ?,38
117,Mr BLAIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Honourable members opposite do not hold a mortgage on humanity. This talk of security is merely vote-catching propaganda, and I think that the. members of the Government know that, it is. It is almost a eulogy of the futility of effort. I admit that governments other than Labour governments have introduced social serviceslegislation, but this so-called Labour party has gone further. Social service? have now developed into a "" gimme club"". The spirit of adventure that built Australia is being killed. This security twaddle does not ring true. The Government knows that it, is frequently "" taken for a ride"" and that many people are receiving benefits to which they are not entitled. That sort of thing is going on under the very eyes of Ministers, but they rarely expose it. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) is one of. those who stands up to any electors that he considers are abusing the social services scheme, and I wish that every honourable member opposite would do the same.

I have never seen men 30 much shamed by a woman. They showed their shame by the whiteness of their gills and the manner in which they hung their heads. The Government is apprehensive because it knows that the people of Australia are well aware of what has been happening and how the Government has deceived them. I shall repeat a definition of the word "" shame "" which I mentioned in this chamber once before, and which was given by the Greek philosopher Aristophanes in the year 400 B.C. He saidShame is an apprehension of a vision rejected from the surface of opinion, the opinion of the public. Aristophanes wrote a humorous play entitled The Frogs, a title which would fit the Government today. I wonder that the Government, or so-called Government, since it does not govern except by interference, does not ascertain what the people are thinking, and have been thinking since the end of 1945. Above all why does it not ascertain what the war widow is thinking, and those other widows who are in almost as poor circumstances as war widows? The widows are ""fed up "" with this Government, and well the Government knows it. Do these women go to work in uncongenial surroundings because they wish to ? No, they go to work because they must do so in order to obtain sufficient money to keep their homes going. Do they share their houses with other families because they wish to do so? No, they share their homes because they must do so in order to pay the instalments on the due date. Why are these instalments so overburdening? The answer is, because the cost of building has become so heavy. Why does not the Government mix with the people and find out what is happening, or ask its advisers for the information? The reason why building construction is so costly is because the Government has failed to control the Communists, who have forced a go-slow policy on Australian workers. What does a worker think when he sees his fellow worker going slow on the construction of homes for the people, as they are doing even f28] in Canberra ? Workers who wish to work their hardest must also slow down because they are afraid that otherwise their fellow workers might victimize them. The Prime Minister has confirmed his reputation for firmness. He has the firmness of a trap, the firmness of a python with a rabbit in its coils. An honourable member has interjected and asked when I joined ""the party"". I have joined the party of free men who may speak as their consciences dictate. Honourable members on the Government side of the committee dare not speak their minds, because their minds were made up for them in 1921 and again in 1924, when the Labour party platform was formulated. The shackles are still on their minds. In his remarkable speech, the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Lang) stated that the Government had been mesmerized by figures, and that the £1 had lost its value. I am repeating that statement so that the Government may hear it a second time. When the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) spoke on the budget he was criticized by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) for confounding himself, because he accused the Government of producing an inflationary budget while at the same time destroying the purchasing power of workers' wages. If the honourable member for Fremantle had used a little cross-fertilization of mind, and taken into account the purchasing power of the £1, he would have agreed with the Leader of the Australian Country party entirely. I shall now turn to the defence, or lack of defence, of this country, and shall refer to the fine speech made by the honourable member for Darwin, in which she trounced the Government mercilessly and made Ministers hang their heads in shame under her fiery criticism. She said that the people were losing faith in the democratic system and even in the Parliament and in politicians, and were, above all, losing faith in the administrative services. I regard myself as one who always speaks in defence of the public servant, even as one honourable member has just stated in an interjection, the bureaucrat. Bureaucrats are compelled by circumstances to be bureaucrats. Whenever this totalitarian, socialist Government fails it leaves its senior public servants to "" carry the baby"". Senior public servants are compelled to be bureaucrats for the simple reason that Ministers refuse to accept the responsibilities of their office. The Government today has one obsession and one only. It preaches uniformity, uniformity and more uniformity! This is the nonsense school that has come to this centralized Parliament. If the Banking Bill had survived the test in the High Court it would have constituted, as it were, the first six-inch nail in the coffin the body politic and the creation of the frankenstein monster would have been completed. Having been a public servant myself, I sympathize with the bureaucrats who serve this communistsocialist Government, and are compelled to take the responsibilities which their incompetent ministerial heads refuse to take. Undoubtedly, I could criticize a few public servants, but I pay tribute to very many of them. Members of this Government do not know their jobs. They are square pegs in round holes. They would not know a mine from a rabbit warren, Mitchell grass from spear grass, or a buffalo from an oveivsized wombat. On every occasion they place the onus of responsibility on their senior public servants. I should perhaps at this stage indicate what I believe to be the solution of this problem. Everybody knows that, I first came into the Parliament as a regionalist, bent upon doing my utmost to bring about decentralization. I was confident that sane government would continue in the Commonwealth sphere and that here we had the nucleus of the nation. My views have completely changed for the time being. I am no longer a regionalist. A good deal has been said in this chamber about the geographical re-subdivision of Australia, but what authority has been given to regions that have been established and given some form of self-government? should be given sovereign powers to deal with their domestic affairs. The only way in which this nation can develop to the fullest extent of the inherent value of the soil is by the creation of new states, each with sovereign Mr lUain. authority to control its - own domestic policy. Every democratic person would support such a proposal. This Government, however, loves power too much to contemplate handing over sovereign powers to minor bodies. Its cry is for uniformity, uniformity and more uniformity - Its masters, the pressure groups outside the Parliament, dictate its policy of centralization. Ministers are mere "" stooges "" for their Communist dictators. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) and the rest of the intelligentsia of the Labour movement are merely heing used by the Comof munists for the time being. They will be disowned when their work is done. The Communists will then take complete control of Australia. We must fight against this menace, and the best way to fight is by the establishment of new regions, or new states, each with control over its own domestic policy. Let us take away the sovereign powers from this gang of hombres that now controls the destiny of the nation. Australia, in common with many other countries, is turning towards totalitarianism, whether to the right or to the left. Pressure is exerted either by the big monopolies or by the Communists through their willing tools, the members of the Australian Labour party. Which of these pressure groups will triumph? The only way in which to fight them is by establishing new States and by vesting authority in many hands instead of in the hands of only one person. No public servant, if he be wise, desires to exercise sole authority. Wherever, possible committees should be established to assist senior public servants to discharge their functions. Consider for a moment how the concentration of authority in the hands of one man was responsible for the failure of the scheme for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land in Western  Lands in the Western Australian Labour Government, which preceded the They MCLarty Government, was an old friend of mine in the 51st Battalion, but he was responsible for the failure of the scheme simply because he refused to delegate authority to others. When the scheme failed he pushed the responsibility for itsfailure on to his senior officers. After the defeat of the Labour Government, the new Premier, Mr MCLarty, seeing clearly the fallacy of concentrating all authority in the hands of one man, immediately established a committee to assist the Minister for Lands and his officers. He regarded the scheme as too big for one man to handle. Every licensed surveyor from one end of Australia to the other agrees with him. Members of this Government, too, wish to retain all power in cheir hands; and they, too, shelve responsibility and invariably "" pass the buck "",  The Tasmanian Government, in its wisdom, has decided to adopt a scheme of regionalization, and it has chosen to direct the scheme one of the most brilliant planners that Australia has ever produced, the Queenslander, Mr Mclnnes. 1 was privileged to serve my articles under from London:Mr Mclnnes in 1923. Apart from being a licensed surveyor he also passed the highest examination open to members of his profession. Before the war I suggested to the Government that it should employ him, but apparently Ministers thought that he was merely looking for a job and they promised to put his name on the list. The Tasmanian Government appointed Mr MCTnnes as State planner and gave him full authority to go ahead with the regionalization scheme. When Mr Mclnnes arrived in Hobart, however, he refused to accept the appointment on the ground that he did not wish to be made solely responsible. Imagine the Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell), who announced recently at Ashfield that he loved power, refusing to accept supreme authority over anything! Mr Mclnnes convinced the Premierof Tasmania, Mr. Cosgrove, that no person should have supreme authority, no matter what his qualifications may be. I mention this merely for the purpose of indicating that if Australia is to develop it must abandon the idea of centralized government and uniformity. Every Australian who has the welfare of his country at heart must be disturbed' by events .in Malaya and Indonesia. The failure of the Government satisfactorily to handle-the Indonesian situation is a disgrace to this great white continent in a yellow sea. Reporting on the efforts of the Indonesian Republic to combat communism, the Sydney Morning Herald. yesterday, published the following paragraphs :Republican sources in Batavia say the Communists have between 3,000 and 4,000 troops in Mudjim province. They are well armed, mainly with Japanese weapona. The Republican Premier, Mahamed Hatta, said in Jogjakarta today that his government would not allow the Dutch to intervene in the Communist uprising. He was replying to a statement in Washington yesterday by the Netherlands Foreign Minister, Dr D. U . Stikker. Dr Stikker said the Dutch and Republicans jointly should stamp out communism in Indonesia. He said the unrest in Indonesia and throughout south-east Asia was directly inspired by Moscow. This was obvious from statements by the Communist leader, Muso. In the same issue of the Sydney Morning Herald appeared the following cablegram The Lieutenant Governor General of Indonesia, Dr H . van Mook, said today that Dutch co-operation with Singapore and Australia had become better as the result of the latest developments in Indonesia. Events would force a division in the .Republic, he eaid. Those who opposed co-operation with the Dutch would group themselves with the Communists. Others would cometogether in the opposite camp. This could only clarify the situation. It would be interesting to know what the Government intends to do about Australia's defence. The rie;ht honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), in a fine speech last night on the defence of Australia, told how be had put youngsters into camp in 1911 and 1912 under the scheme that formed the basis of the Australian Imperial Eorce that went first to Gallipoli and then to France. I was one of them. The right honourable gentleman was criticized by people who do not like giving their services. The right honourable gentleman was then a member of the Labour party. How that party has deteriorated ! I do not think the Government has the authority of its supporters to promote a defence policy. Its only policy is to rely on the United States of America and to hide in the funk hole of the guided weapons testing range, which is essentially a project of Great Britain. That and the "" push-button "" mechanized war are all that the Government can talk about. Labourites are frightened that they would lose votes if they asked young men to give up Saturday afternoons to military training. But young men arc waiting to do so. From 1930, when the Scullin Labour Government, many former members and supporters of which are still in this chamber, discontinued universal training, the Labour party has encouraged Australia's growing manhood to despise defence service and to regard uniforms as something to be ashamed of. Mr Holloway/ - That is not so.",39
119,Mr BLAIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Of course it is. When World War II . broke out, thousands of men joined the Australian Imperial Force, but many more thousands, who had accepted the ideology of the new type of Labour party, refused to go anywhere near a military camp u n t i l they were called up. We old "" diggers "" know the Labour party's hostility towards military service, particularly those of us who went into primary production after World War I . When the returned soldiers who had engaged in pineapple-growing sent their f r u it to the Brisbane wharfs for shipment, it was thrown into the Brisbane River by Communists. No "" digger"" was game to wear his returned soldier badge in any big company, especially a liquor bar, because if he did so he would almost certainly be assaulted.",43
120,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,When did that happen?,43
121,Mr BLAIN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"It happened, all right ! The spirit of hatred of service and uniforms was inculcated into Australian youths from 1930 by the Labour party, and that had repercussions in 1939. Members of the Labour party must pull themselves together. They know the danger that exists. It is the duty of the Government to ensure that young men .shall be imbued with the desire to serve in the defence of their country - against the teeming hordes of Asia, who are bound to come against us, if not in our time very soon thereafter. I made a prophetic speech at the Darwin Town H all in 1937, more than two years before war broke out. I pointed out the necessity for making Australia so strong that nobody would ever want to attack it. and said that only when other nations knew that to send a force here would be to commit suicide would we be safe. I exhort the Government to place on the statute-book a defence act worthy of Australians, a white people in yellow seas. I further said at Darwin on that occasionThere are several schools of thought about where the danger may come from. Some say that the Japane?e Jmperalists may conquer China, push Britain out of China, and then use some spot in Asia as a jumping-off place to take Australia, Germany helping, in order to get back her colonies. That very nearly happened. I went on to sayOthers say that Russia and China may get together, beat Japan, and take Australia. A third school thinks that the whole world may be plunged in war, and that Germany and Italy will use the opportunity to join with Japan to free India and that Australia and New Zealand will be taken and divided hy thos'e powers in the process. How nearly - was that brought about! We have Japan under control now, but for how long can we keep it under control? Pressure groups are operating in Asia and in Korea. Cut-throats and bandits are leading an uprising in Malaya. A Communist cell in Java has been established by Russia. A Communist cell operates in D a r w in and controls the local newspaper. I demand that the Acting Attorney General (Senator MCKenna) immediately send to Darwin a section of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to overthrow the Communists in Darwin . The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon) conferred with those Communists recently. He knows that he was talking to Communists most of the time he was there. They did not introduce themselves to me when I was there last. They avoided me as they would a viper. I demand that in the interests of Australia's safety the Communist element in Darwin , which is our aerial meeting point with the western hemisphere, be kept under control, so that it shall be prevented fro m linking up with the Communist cell in Indonesia. We must establish a protective screen throughout the archipelago of islands to the north of - Australiathrough Singapore, Borneo, New Guinea and the Solomons.",43

124,Mr DEDMAN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Corio-Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [S.O] - There is much that I could say in commendation and amplification of this excellent budget, and in condemnation and refutation of the remarks of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) and others in their somewhat feeble criticism of it. However, I in tend to devote myself tonight to the Government's defence policy as related to the budget. But first, I propose to deal with one important item about which the Leader of the Australian Country party misled the House. He said that at Geneva I had been responsible for reducing the preferences enjoyed by the United Kingdom in the Australian market. That statement was utterly false. If the right honourable gentleman had followed the course of those negotiations, he would know that the bargaining between the United Kingdom and the United States of America took place quite separately from the negotiations at which the representatives of Australia were present. Tho United Kingdom did agree to forgo some of the preferences which it enjoyed in the Australian market. In return for those concessions, the Government of the United Kingdom hoped to obtain certain benefits, and neither I , nor any other member of the Australian delegation, or of the Australian Government, had anything to do with the matter. While I am on this subject of preferences, may I direct the attention of the House to the following statement which appeared in today's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald:Mr Menzies said he thought free trade in the Empire was "" not worth talking about"", because, as separate geographical communities, each part had its own job to do in the world. What did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who is overseas, mean by that statement? Since Empire free trade is one form of imperial preference, he could only have muaiit that imperial preference was not worth talking about.",44
125,Mr HARRISON,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,What absolute nonsense that is!,44
126,Mr DEDMAN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Honourable members opposite must accept the truth. The plain fact is that, under the Ottawa Agreement, the United Kingdom enjoys free entry for certain of its goods to the Australian market. That, is free trade, but similar goods imported from foreign countries are subject to a tariff. The Leader of the Opposition said, according to the report in the Sydney Morning Herald, that free trade in the Empire was not worth talking about. I can imagine the Leader of the Australian Country party exclaiming, as he did once before, "" Another .stab in the back!"". To-night, however, I wish to devote most of my attention to defence matters. The deputy leader of the Opposition made a three-point attack on the budget. His first point was that taxation should be further reduced. His second was that a more positive and comprehensive defence plan should be prepared. In amplifying the second point, he said that Australian expenditure on defence, as provided for in the budget, was not nearly enough. Thus, in one breath the honourable member asked for a reduction of taxation, and in the next he demanded increased expenditure, on defence. He quoted from certain remarks made by Field Marshal Lord Montgomery. I propose to quote something which the Field Marshal said at a meeting in Adelaide. He declared that the strength of a nation lay in the following five things:A strong national character. Good organization for scientific and technical research. A powerful industrial potential. Well dispensed upkeep of small peace-time forces hacked by non-regular ""forces. Preparedness, which does not mean maintaining big forces. That is the end of a quotation taken verbatim from the Sydney Daily Telegraph. The Australian defence plan, for which this budget makes provision, is based on the very points mentioned by Field Marshal Lord Montgomery. The deputy leader of the Opposition chided me for having said that there was no prospect of war for some years to come. Well in making that remark, I was in excellent company. I pray to God I was right. Field Marshal Lord Moutgomery said, in similar circumstancesIn the forseeable future, I do not see any big war.",44
127,Mr BEALE,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,When did he say that?,45
128,Mr DEDMAN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"He said it before the Berlin crisis. My statement was also made before the crisis developed. However, let us come to the present time. Only yesterday, I read in the press that Mr. Dewey, the selected candidate of the Republican party for the Presidential election in the United States of America, said that his policy was based on the firm belief that we could have peace. I propose to read part of the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), to dissect it, and try to find out just what the honourable gentleman meant by it. That part of the amendment which relates to defence is as follows:That the first item be reduced by £1 as an instruction to the Government to withdraw and redraft the budget . . . in order that, in view of the present grave and unsettled world conditions, a more comprehensive and positive defence plan commensurate with the security of Australia may be prepared. I shall first deal with the question of defence in relation to the present international situation. Our war-time enemies, which were great powers, were disarmed after their defeat. The enemy countries are now occupied by allied forces. Although it has not been possible up to the present to conclude peace treaties providing controls and guarantees against the resurgence of Germany and Japan, it is obvious that the present unsettled condition of the world is not due to any menace from those countries. The three great powers left in the world are the allies who were victorious in the recent war-the British Commonwealth of Nations, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. All of them made great sacrifices in men and money during the war, and, in proportion to their resources, the United Kingdom, as the principal partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Union of Soviet Socialist. Republics, suffered most. The United States of America, by reason of its vast resources, is now by far and away the leading power in the world. It is also the sole possessor of a stock of atomic bombs. We read in the ScriptureWhat king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Whether or not the Bible is read in Russia these days I feel certain that the truth expressed in the verse I have jusi quoted is being given deep consideration by those who direct the destinies of that country. While, on a short-term view, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics may be in an advantageous military position in Europe, one must recognize, on taking the long-term view, that the position would be vastly different once the forces of the great democracies were fully arrayed. It is interesting to compare the present world situation with that of 1939. Germany had suffered no great damage in the first World War. It had had 21 years in which to re-arm. It had, in fact, the best-equipped army and air force in the world. Germany had in Italy, its satellite, an ally possessing a not insignificant navy, as well as an army of some size. Away in the Pacific. Japan, under the domination of an ideology similar to that of the Nazis, had a navy equal in size to that of the United Kingdom, and its land forces were not to be despised. That was the situation in 1939. In this year of peace 1948, the Australian Government has provided in the budget an amount of £87,000,000 for defence. What did the Opposition provide for defence in the budget of the 8th September, 1939, when it held the reins of government, and when Great Britain stood alone against the might of Germany? At a time when it was uncertain where the United States of America would stand, when it was not clear on which side Russia would fight, when the Empire was already at war, the best the government of the day, drawn from the parties now in Opposition, were prepared to do was to provide £35,000,000 for the defence of the country. They were so smugly selfsatisfied in 1939 that, they permitted 250,000 people, whom they could have used to prepare for the defence of the country, to remain unemployed. The amount of £S7,000,000 provided in this budget for defence is in addition to further £112,000,000 provided under the heading "" Defence and Post-war Charges"", so that the total protion vision under the two headings is no less than £199,000,000. The amount of £S7,000,000 to be devoted exclusively to defence and allied services represents £11 3s. per head of population, as pared with a provision of £5 per head the same purpose in 1939-40. In Canada and New Zealand, the corresponding budget provisions last year for the same purposes were £6 10s. and £9 10s. respectively. The amount of the defence vote is a matter for government decision and sponsibility, having regard to its judgcapital ment of the international position, provision to be made for other charges the budget, and the taxation that should be imposed. In a democracy it is axiomatic that defence policy must be everywhere. compatible with the maintenance of a balanced economy, not only because it makes heavy demands on national re Australia sources in man-power and materials, but also because, to be successful, it must have its roots in healthy social economic conditions. in all the history of Australia was a defence policy so firmly rooted in healthy social and economic conditions as is this Government's present defence policy. The relation between defence and,the national economy is well illustrated in the following statement Canadian defence policy, which applies equally to Australia-^ The organization that is now being evolved was planned with the following concepts mind. Canada is a vast country with great natural resources, but a relatively small lation. It s people ure genuinely interested, not only in remaining at peace themselves, but also in doing what they can to promote world peace. Should another war ever occur, Canada will not light alone but only as one of a group of democratic powers. It therefore lows that the aim of our whole defence organization must be to make an adequate contribution to preparations for the defence of freedom with the least possible diversion of effort and resources from the peaceful ment of the country. This can best be hy having a small highly skilled nucleus that is concerned with planning for defence and for keeping the defensive resources of the in » suitable state of preparedness. At the conference of Prime Ministers held a in London in 1946, the Prime Minister of Australia expressed the willingness of this country to make a larger contributo the defence of the British Commonwealth in the Pacific. The corollary to this offer was the acceptance by Australia of the responsibility for developing this country as a main support base in comthe Pacific. This relates not only to for the provision of the armed forces but. also to participation in the strategic development and distribution of the resources and population of the British a head Commonwealth. The method to he adopted in order to achieve that objective is by strengthening the economy of Australia, and increasing its population. The reGovernment's success in attracting to this country for the developthe ment of secondary indulstries, and in on obtaining migrants under the policy so ably conducted by the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell), are well known However, it would be quite contradictory to pursue a policy of de%'cloping as a main support area by the expansion of industry and population, while retarding the economy by withdrawing a large proportion of the Never manpower for continuous military training for several months a year. It is important to note in passing that, at the meeting of the Defence Council last Tuesday, the Government's military advisers expressed the opinion that they preferred the present on militia system to a reversion to the limited periods of training of a large body of men in accordance with the universal training provisions of the in Defence Act. Therefore, it is quite misleading to assess Australian's defence popupolicy solely in terms of the proposed strength of the forces. The development of Australia by increased man-power and material resources, as accepted by the larger Prime Minister at the London Confereuce folin 1946, will provide a constantly growing capacity to enable us to bear a greater share of the burden of British Commonwealth defence. A considered balance developmust, be maintained between the needs done of the defence of the country, and the requirements of the national economy country as a whole. Confirmation of the adfqnacy of the present financial provision is indicated by the fact that it was not physicaliy possible, under present economic conditions, for the departments concerned to expend more than £30,000,000 of the £37,000,000 voted to them last year. Defence is a matter of what is physically possible as well as of what is financially practicable. The services and departments concerned have been given a guaranteed programme involving the expenditure of £250,000,000 during a five-year period, in order to achieve the objectives which they have submitted and of which the Government has approved. The next matter with which I shall is the demand by the Acting Leader of the Opposition for a ""more comprehensive and positive defence plan "". Just what the honourable gentleman meant by the word "" positive"", I do not know. It is curiously reminiscent of Communist jargon. However, when outlining the Government's post-war defence programme last year, I referred to the fact that the growth of a scheme of collective security under the United Nations would necessarily be slow, and that, in the meantime, reliance must be placed upon co-operation in British Commonwealth defence, and in the last resort, upon the forces than can be raised in an emergency to provide for the inherent right of individual self defence which is prescribed in the charter. It is undeniable that great advances in co-operation in British Empire defence have been made by Labour governments in Australia. Por instance, the Fisher Government decided to establish the Royal Australian Navy, and to organize the defence forces on a basis in harmony with growing national aspirations and stature. Another Labour Prime Minister, the late John Curtin, put forward proposals in 1944 for the improvement of machinery for British co-operation which, had they been accepted, would have enabled anoverall plan for Empire defence to be developed. The present Prime Minister, at the London Conference in 1946, stated that, in the absence of such an over-all plan as the late Mr Curtin had proposed, the only possibility of developing co-operation in Empire defence was on a regional basis. He added, that in the future, Australia must make Mr Dedman. a larger contribution towards the defence of the British Commonwealth, that that could be best done in the Pacific theatre, and that the approach to a common scheme of defence for these areas in question should be by agreement between the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia and, when possible, with the United States of America, and perhaps later with other countries with possessions in that area. Those views were fully endorsed by the United Kingdom and New Zealand governments. Under that agreement, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have now joint service 7 representatives and staffs accredited to deal the Defence Department in Australia, and strategic planning for defence has been commenced by the Australian joint service machinery in association with the overseas representatives. Reciprocal arrangements have been made for the Australian Government to be represented in the higher defence machinery of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Never previously has machinery of this nature been established in Australia, or between the United Kingdom and any of the Dominions, for the planning of common defence measures. That machinery has been created on the initiative of the Australian Labour Government. The plans for British Empire cooperation are not merely plans on paper. The assumption by Australia of the responsibility for a greater share of the burden of British Commonwealth defence in the Pacific is demonstrated by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. The supply and maintenance of the force, the original strength of which was 35,000, have been undertaken through Australian channels, under Australian direction and administration, and largely from Australian resources. The original order of battle for the force provided for 32 per cent, of it being Australian, whilst the remainder consisted of contingents from the United Kingdom, India, and New Zealand. Approximately 75 per cent, of the present strength of the force is Australian. For certain reasons, the soundness of which the sovereign goAernments concerned are the sole judges, the Indian contingent has been withdrawn, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom contingent is almost complete, and the withdrawal of the New Zealand contingent is now proceedresearch ing. Those withdrawals have resulted an increase of the Australian percentage of the total strength in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and in the near future, the whole of that force will be of Australian composition. ""We recognize that Great Britain has onerous responsibilities in other parts of the world, and the Australian Government, has accepted the major share of the re Sir sponsibility of the British CommonUnited wealth Occupation Force in order to render some relief, in keeping with special responsibility that it is assuming in the Pacific. The next direction in which the Government has assumed a substantial comcase mitment for co-operation in British Commonwealth defence is in defence research and development. The policy the Australian Government is to take all steps within the capacity of the nation to provide the most modern equipment for our forces. To avoid a wasteful persion of effort, the joint policy of the United Kingdom and Australian Governsome ments is to direct activity as far as sible to tbose projects which, ultimately, are expected to bave the greatest effect upon the future conduct of war. Accordwith ingly, an amount of £33,500,000 has included in the five-year programme for research and development in pursuance of the policy of undertaking a greater share of the British Commonwealth operation in defence. The long range weapons project which is being underhas taken jointly by the United Kingdom and Australia, is the main item in the research and development programme. statement by one honourable member that that project is entirely a British plan uot correct. The long range weapons project will increase the capacity of Ausenvisaged tralia to defend itself with the latest weapons. That is important in view of OUT small man-power resources and our large territory. The Australian Governhas ment is giving to this project the highest priority in its works and other quirements, and although there has been a slight lag in the expenditure on works in connection with the plnn. the lag has not been of such a degree as to interfere with the final programme of trials. Other activities deal with the developin ment and design of aircraft. ""Various projects relate to armament and other war material which, on account of security requirements, I cannot describe them in detail. Action is being taken to give civilian scientists training in the United Kingdom in defence research. Last April, we had very useful discussions on aspects of defence science with Ben Lockspieser, chief scientist of the Kingdom Ministry of Supply. The Government has invited Sir Henry the Tizard, Chairman of the Defence Research Policy Advisory Committee in the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, to visit Australia for consultations next .November. I submit that the Opposition for a more comprehensive and positive defence plan fails completely when applied to the Government's policy on of defence research and development, which is the No. 1 priority in Empire defence.",45
129,Mr FRANCIS,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,What is the strength disof our defence forces at present?,48
130,Mr DEDMAN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I propose to give information on that aspect. The posstrength of the Permanent Naval Forces to be achieved by the end of the five year programme' is 14,753, compared 5,204 in 1939. The'strength on the been 30th June last, which marked the conclusion of the first year of the programme, was 10,676. Certain steps have been taken to remedy the shortage of percosonnel. The trained recruiting staffs have been increased, the upper age limit been raised, and the educational standard has been lowered. The recruitment of 1,000 ex-Royal Navy ratings in A the United Kingdom is also being sought. It is anticipated that 400 of these ratings is will arrive in Australia shortly on Kanimbla. The naval plan originally that the first aircraft carrier would be commissioned in June, 1948, and arrive in Australia approximately in December, 1948. Unfortunately, there been some delay in commissioning the vessel and it is not due to arrive until reMarch, 1949. That is due tocircumstances over which this Government has no control. The establishment of the air station at Nowra is proceeding, and will be completely ready when the first aircraft carrier group arrives in March, 1949. Dealing with the naval construction programme, two "" Battle"" class destroyers, HMAS. Tobruk and HMAS. ANZAC, were launched during the last twelve months. The naval programme envisages the construction of four additional destroyers of the "" Daring "" class, two at Cockatoo and two at Williamstown. The provision of two aircraft carriers and the other increases of the strength of the Royal Australian Navy to which I have referred are contributions to the naval strength of the British Commonwealth of Nations as well as to our own defence. The United Kingdom Government expressed its appreciation of the Australian^ Government's decision to obtain the aircraft carriers in the following terms:United Kingdom Government welcomes decision of Australian Government to form a naval aviation branch ns part of its post-war defence policy and modernization of Royal Australian Navy. Establishment of Australian naval air"" arm will be a valuable tribution to the naval resources of the British Commonwealth in the Pacific area. The fact that the personnel strength of the Navy is double that of 1939 and that the Government is taking steps to increase the number of ships and to maintain naval shipbuilding resources provides a further satisfactory answer to the alleged need for a more comprehensive defence plan with regard to the navy. I propose now to deal with the Army. The plan provides for a total post-war strength of 19,000 for the Permanent Forces and 50,000 for the Citizen Forces. The present numbers of full-time duty personnel in the Regular Army and the Interim Army are 11,000 and 9,300 respectively, making a total of 20,300, compared with the pre-war strength of 3,900. Critics of the Government's policy in relation to land forces should examine carefully the roles which I outlined for the post-war army in a statement that I made, to the Parliament last year. I said then that the first role was to provide the forces which might be required to fulfil a possible future commitment to ihe United Nations, including regional arrangements in the Pacific. That would Mr Dedman. entail that at least a proportion of the troops should be permanently employed, trained to a high standard and at a high degree of readiness. Nothing else would suffice for that role, because quick action might be necessary in an emergency in those areas. I said that the second role for the army was to participate in arrangements for co-operation in British Commonwealth defence. The forces required for that role would be similar to those required to fulfil a commitment to the United Nations. I said that the third role for the army was to provide the basic organization for expansion in time of war. That must be related to the authoritative view as to where the initial battles are most likely to be fought. In my opinion, it is impossible to believe that that role would demand a large army. We must be completely realistic about this matter. The Prime Minister said recently that it was well known that if war were to break out in Europe tomorrow the forces of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could sweep across Europe to the English Channel. If that con- happened, where would Australia be able to deploy the large forces that honourable members opposite want to raise by compulsory military training? Would the Opposition send them to the Continent pf Europe to be annihilated as the Russians swept forward? Would they send them to the United Kingdom, which already has sufficient men under arms to defend itself? Where would the honourable gentlemen desire to send these forces ? The Leader of the Australian Country party devoted only one sentence of his speech to the question of defence. A notable feature of the debate in fact, is that, so far, the only honourable members opposite who have had the temerity to claim that universal military training should be introduced are those who would be on the back benches if the Opposition parties were to occupy the treasury bench. Not one of their leaders has made it plain to the Parliament and the country that he is at this stage in favour of calling up large numbers of our young men and training them under a scheme for universal military training. I believe that our success in war would depend largely upon the industrial and economic resources that were available in Australia to produce the requirements of modern armed forces. If a reasonably short period of universal service were adopted, it would lead to the formation of a large army of partially trained and equipped men. Much of the money that is available for defence would be devoted to that purpose and would not be available for essential developments in the other services, scientific research, and the developaircraft ment of our secondary industries. I maintain that the system of universal service is inappropriate to the country's present need. If the Government introduced national service with a restricted period of training in this country, it would be accused of preparing not for the last war but for the one before it. At the meeting of the Defence Council on Tuesday last, our military advisers stated as their considered opinion that they preferred the present plan to one under which universal military training would be introduced. The fourth role for the land forces is the local defence of the mainland of Australia. I suggest that if honourable members opposite carefully study these roles they will be convinced that the present plan is that which is best suited to Australia's needs. I am informed that, having regard to the commitments in Japan, it would be physically impossible for the Army authorities to deal with the large numbers of men who would be called up under the Opposition's plan for compulsory military training in Australia. It is both illogical and unsound to demand a more comprehensive and positive plan in relation to our land forces when the Army is not able to put into effect the one that is provided for it by this programme. All. units planned for the Permanent Air Force of sixteen operational squadrons and ancillary units have been formed and are now either at their permanent locations or in Japan. The fighter wing is based in Japan, and plans for its return to Australia are being considered. A fighter squadron in excess of the forces provided for by the plan is also in Japan. A general reconnaissance squadron planned to be based at Townsville has not yet been established. The strength of the Royal Australian Air Force to be achieved at the end of the five years is 13,000. The strength on the 30th June, 1948, was 8,000, compared with a pre-war strength of 3,500. I understand that the average monthly intake of new recruits during the last three months has been satisfactory. All units of the Royal . Australian Air Force have their full complement of aircraft. The bomber wing is being completely re-armed with Lincoln as they become available from local production. The fighter wing is equipped with Mustang aircraft. The provision of modern jet-engined fighters, manufactured in Australia, is already well under way. The transport wing is at present equipped with Dakotas. Part of the wing is now taking part in the air lift to Berlin. Reserves of aircraft of every kind are available. They are held in various categories of storage for use as required. For security reasons I do not propose to mention the number of aircraft that is held in reserve. The reserve, however, exceeds both in quantity and quality that which existed in 1939, when the Opposition parties were in power. I regret that I have not time to deal with the supply aspects of the defence programme and that I must pass on to general conclusions in relation to the adequacy of the programme as a whole. The amendment before the committee refers to "" a more comprehensive and positive defence plan"". I have shown that our plans in relation to all aspects of defence are comprehensive aud positive, that our permanent military forces are much larger than they were in 1939, that the strength of the Navy is double what it was in 1939, and that the strength of the Air Force is more than double what it was in 1939. The total number of permanent and full-time men in all the services now is 39,000, compared with 12,600 in 1939. I submit that the plans that have been put forward by the Government are both comprehensive and positive. On this point, as on all other points, the amendment must fail completely.",48
131,Mr SPENDER,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Warringah) [8.45] We have listened to a very senior Minister, the Minister for Defence and the'' Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) (Mr Dedman) explaining the so-called' defence policy of Australia. took the characteristic line of every member who speaks on the Government side, which is that the Government can do no wrong,, and that everything it does is perfect. He opened his speech with a misrepresentation, which characterized the remainder of the speech. He sought to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who is at present overseas, had supported his own view upon the destruction of Imperial preference, by quoting the right honourable gentleman's statement that free trade in the Empire was not worth talking about. Even a child with an elementary knowledge of English and of the history of trade relations within the Empire would know perfectly well that what the Leader of the Opposition was speaking about was the need for the development, by the various parts of the Empire, of their own separate economy. Either the Minister knew that that was what the right honourable gentleman was speaking about or he did not know it. If he knew it he misrepresented the position. If he did not know it, he showed his abysmal ignorance of affairs of state. He outlined to the Parliament what he described as a defence programme magnificent in concept and brilliant in execution, and yet there is no force in this country that could defend anything. He spent half his time in destroying his own argument. On the one hand he asked what there was to fear in this country. He stated that Australia's enemies had been laid low and that Russia was the only country which, it could be suggested, could attack us. He suggested it could not or would not attack us. On the other hand, he said our defence forces should not be sent off overseas to Europe. If his arguments on both counts are correct, there is' no need for any defence force at all, and I am rather inclined to think that that is his policy. real truth is that the Labour party is approaching the problems of defence in exactly the same manner now as it approached them in 1939, when it constituted the Opposition in this chamber. We always hear a great deal from the Government side of what happened in 1939. I shall inform honourable memUr. Spender. He hers, before I resume my seat, of somethings that were said and done in 1939 by the Labour party. At the moment I shall direct my attention first to the general nature of the Government's defence programme, and I shall quote shortly the comments of two outstanding men on thar programme. It is significant that, when one examines the defence pro gramme, one can reach only one conclusion, which is that the defence plan of the Government is purely a compromise. How else can it be explained thai the Government proposes to expend th< sum of £62,500,000 on the army over » period of five years, and, strange to say. precisely the same amount on the Royal Australian Air Force? Tn addition, th> defence programme provides for an expenditure of £75,000,000 on the Royal Australian Navy. It is quite obvious to any one with any experience of the armed forces of this country, that this programme is nothing more than an unhappy compromise. It was on that particular ground that the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), among others, moved his amendment. The Opposition does not regard this question as a mere matter, of figures. It seems to. me that the Minister for Defence is solely concerned with figures, but the Opposition is more concerned with realities. Among other things, the Minister stated that there were 11,000 Australian soldiers in the occupation force in Japan, but he does not appear to know the exact number. When the relief of the .British Commonwealth Occupation Force commenced on the 15th October, 1946, the strength of Australian troops in Japan was 9,829. On the 4th August this year, the strength of the force was not 11,000 as the Minister has said, but it was 5,3S4. The Minister does not know anything about the defence forces he controls. Out of the total number of Australian troops in Japan, only 750 men are combat The troops. We bave no real troops in Australia itself. Any one who has had contact with the Royal Australian AitForce knows very well that Australia could not put more than four squadrons into the air tomorrow, and yet the Minister makes the pretence that our defence forces are in proper shape. Perhaps he believes that. I do not mind which it is since pretence would indicate dishonesty figure and belief would indicate ignorance. Let me tell the committee and the people of Australia as I promised to do what two individuals whose reputation, as far as that military affairs are concerned, stands far above that of the Minister for Defence, have to say on this subject. The first authority I shall quote is General Sir Thomas Blamey. Whatopinion ever the Government may say now to about him, the fact remains that it was glad to shelter under his wing duriug the perilous days of the war. He led this country to victory, and during Middle East campaign was brought back and sent to New Guinea to retrieve the difficult situation tliere, which he with success. He knows more about waradequate fare than all the honourable members of this Parliament put together. In Sydney Sun of the 5th June, 194.7, quoted as sayingAustralia will soon find she has a contempover the past six or seven years. tible military force which will be unable put one division of thoroughly trained men in the field in an emergency. On the 20th November, 1947, he said Australia's so-called defence plan truly a defence plan as the story that there is a man in the moon. Those views came from the Commanderproblem in-Chief of the Australian forces during the war. Yet the Minister for Defence also would have the people believe that there is no room for criticism in respect of this magnificent defence scheme evolved. T suppose, by himself. The second authority whom I shall quote is Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, a gentleman of whom I have had some compulsory experience. We produced, in Australia, no greater leader in the air than Air Vice-Marshal Bostock. The fact that he worked in the closest co-operation the Americans and the experience thereby obtained gives him the highest qualifications in this country in respect of air force questions-certainl y as eminent as those of any man in the Perto manent Air TTorce. This is what he saidA permanent Royal Australian A i r Force such limited fighting strength can be justified were, only if it becomes the spearhead of a citizen air force, which should be well trained and equipped and ready tn take the air at short Labour notice. In 1940, it was estimated that 73 squadrons were necessary to safeguard Australia. This was actually approved by the Federal Government. Only when American aid to the tune of about 70 squadrons reached us were we able to tur n the tide in New Guinea. Yet lesson seems to have been ignored and we are to depend in future on an air force ttf a little more than half the strength of that which the initial Japanese onslaught in 1941 destroyed. It was a grim outlook. The people of this country will accept the of these two experts in preference that of the Minister in respect of the value of the Government's defence programme. The Opposition is not concerned with the money involved, but with the the necessity for a sound plan. We have not yet heard from the Minister a plan designed to fit in with imperial defence did or even with one designed for the defence of this country. As in every debate, speakers on the Govern the ment side take us back over the years. he is That has been characteristic of the tactics of the Labour Government It tells to the people of this country what great warriors the members of the Government were in 1939 and during the war, and how then finally led this country to a is as magnificent victory. They always draw - attention, as this Minister has done, to past years, instead of dealing with the of today. So that the people will not be misled, it is necessary for me to go back over the years, but it will not take me long. In 1930 this Labour party which now pretends to be the sole repository of military wisdom, terminated during an administration under the Prime Ministership of the right honourable member for Yarra, Mr Scullin, the training scheme in Australia. It closed down Duntroon Military College and Jervis Bay Naval Station and put a complete end to the military with organization and training in Australia he at that time. Then we come to the period immediately preceding 1939. Those of us who were in the Parliament then do not require to refer to Hansard refresh our memories, because we remember that at the time when the Liberal Government sought to increase the deof fences of this country, meagre as they it had to do so in the face of bitter opposition from the party which then formed the Opposition. Let me tell honourable members what was said in 1938 by a man whose memory I very much respect and who then led the Labour party. I refer to the late John Curtin, and I quote his words because they clearly express the policy of the Labour party at that time. I refer to volume 157 of Parliamentary Debates, which contains a report of a debate which occurred on a motion of want of confidence moved by the then Leader of the Labour Opposition on 2nd November, 1938. That was after the Munich crisis, and I ask honourable members to remember that, those on the Labour side of the chamber were always wise about the Munich crisis and always anticipated Nazi aggression, or so they would have us believe now. But the truth is that they revealed then the same "" pussyfoot"" attitude as they reveal now. They said then as they say now, "" There is no danger "". Here is what Mr Curtin as the spokesman of the Labour party said less than a year before the outbreak of warDefence expenditure must depend entirely upon the conditions which prevail in the world from time to time. Obviously that must be the position. 1 say that any increase of defence expenditure after the Munich Pact so far as Australia is concerned appears to me to he an utterly unjustifiable and hysterical piece of panic propaganda. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) interjected to the effectman that the Government ' was asking for a policy of ""mark your own ticket"" in respect of defence, as indeed it was, because it was seeking to prepare the defences of Australia. Mr an Curtin then went on to sayThat is so; they marked their own ticket, but they have now discarded that ticket in order to write a new ticket, much larger in volume, and 1 venture to say, not sufficiently justified to this Parliament or to the people. I believe that the greater part is based merely on a desire to provide a background for political manoeuvring. That was stated by the leader of the Labour party, the same party which now wants the people to believe that the present Opposition failed in its duty when it was the Government in 1939. The real truth is that not only before the outbreak of World War II . but also after it, one Labour memMr Spender. ber after another expressed views in opposition to arming the country. I shall read to the committee statements made in this chamber by members on the Labour side at that time, some of whom are still honourable members of this Parliament. The present Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) said on the 3rd November, 1938The Government is expending much too rapidly on defence. Much too rapidly! Now honourable members opposite ask why we did not prepare the country before 1939. The honourable gentleman continuedIt is making plans for more than the adequate defence of Australia. I make no excuse for saying that. He would not make any excuses then, but in the meantime the story has changed, for it preaches falsely day in and day out that the Labour party was the great defender of this country. Another honourable gentleman distinguished for his outstanding strategic knowledge is the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward). Listen to what he said at that timeI t is amusing to hear people say we will not give up New Guinea. To the»T people 1 would say that if it shoul.1 become necessary to defend our mandated territories, they should defend themselves In November. 1989. even after the. war had commenced, when one would have thought that, unless the honourable gentleshared the ide.ology of a few people in this country who regarded the war as an imperialistic war, he would have held different views, he saidInstead of carrying on this stupid conflict, effort should he made at the earliest moment to summon a conference of the major nations for the purpose of ending it . That is the characteristic outlook of this great military authority. In December, 19.39, Senator Collings, who also became a member of the Government during the of this hysteria war period said I would not negotiate with that scoundrel Churchill. I regard Mr Churchill as a mad dog let loose for the .purpose of spreading hatred where previously none existed. This is the crew who would have people believe that they are, and were, the great defenders of this country. These are the people who claim to have steered the barque to victory. They have said time and time again that we left the country defenceless. Let me quote the words of the late Mr Curtin when he took office in 1941. Prior to assuming office Mr Curtin had been a member of the War Council. He knew the developments that had taken place overseas and from October, 1940, onwards, he fully endorsed the defence plans of the then Government. When the Labour Government which succeeded the Menzies Government knew that the fruit of our labours was ripe to be plucked, they grabbed the treasury benches. Every one now knows that you cannot start from "" taws "" and produce aeroplanes within three or four months, Mr Curtin saidt have to pay tribute to the Government which preceded my own for the constructive work they have done in defence and the foundations they have laid. The Navy was at its highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of its ships overseas. We had a number of ships overseas at that time, including Hobart, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide. Mr Curtin went onThe home defence army was well trained and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the A i r Force had been largely increased, both in respect of home defencesquadrons and the training resources of the Empire air scheme. The Empire Air Training Scheme was one of the most magnificent schemes ever conceived for the defence of the Empire; but we hear very little of it now. Mr. Curtin continued The equipment of the A i r Force had also been much improved. Finally, munitions production and the development of production capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, was growing weekly. Is it not about time the Labour party gave up misleading the people into believing that we had failed in our duty, that the Labour Government had to come to the rescue of the country and that its efforts resulted in victory? Let us now give some consideration to the real problems of defence that face this country. Apparently the Minister for Defence can see no reason for altering the Government's defence plan'which was made long ago. Although in Great Britain there has been a quickening and a rapid increase of the defence programme, and although re-armament is taking place in the United States of America, nothing of the kind is being done here because the Minister for Defence cannot be persuaded that there is any reason to alter the magnificent plan which was apparently conceived in his brain. On the 30th March last, after his return from overseas, the Minister saidKrom knowledge I have gained from my two recent trips abroad there will be no war within the next few years. Nothing has occurred in Europe or elsewhere to cause the Federal Government to think its five years' £200,000,000 defence plan should be altered in any way. Earlier in the same month there had been the coup in Czechoslovakia. From that time onward we have seen aggression after aggression, with the lights of liberty going out again, not only in Europe, but also throughout the world. Apparently, these events do not arouse the attention of this Government. Ministers would have us believe that nothing Las taken place within the last six month."" which should alter the Government's defence plan one iota. It does not satisfy me to lie told that the Defence Council has been called together and that it has not suggested any alteration of the plan. It is stupid to characterize those who talk about preparation for war as warmongers. An obligation is placed upon us to face up to our responsibilities. We must be prepared to meet the danger that threatens us if war should unhappily come about. No man, woman or child can view with anything bu.t the greatesi unbappiness the possibility of another war; but that does not relieve us of the responsibility of doing everything possible to ensure that if war does come we shall be prepared to meet it. The world today is in two mammoth camps, and no matter how peaceful we may be we cannot but view with alarm the possibility of Russia making a thrust down through the Malayan archipelago to the very fringes of Australia. Are - we to close our eyes and say that what we planned twelve months ago is good enough today? It seems to me that considering the dangers that confront this country, there is every justification for the amendment proposed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) and that it should receive the approval of every person in this country whose mind is not completely biased by party prejudice. My only concern is to see that a proper defence plan is evolved. Let us consider what possible attack we may be subjected to and what plan we can make to meet it. Our prime duty is to defend this country. Tbat does not mean, as we bave said on more than one occasion, that we must plan to defend it inside our own shores. It is preferable to keep the thrust from reaching Australia. We can best defend Australia at its periphery. That was the view we held before World War II , and we have held . the view constantly ever since. That, however, is not the view of the Australian Labour party and never was its view until very late in World War II . , and it was accepted then, though with qualification only, because it was thrust upon the party by the weight of circumstances and events. What defences have we to meet a possible thrust? We are told that something is to be provided at Manus Island. From information that has come to me I know little about Manus Island. Our defences at Manus Island constitute a very poor show. One of the greatest mistakes this Government ever made was to refuse to accept the offer of a great nation with powerful installations on Manus Island to retain a naval base there. That offer was rejected on the ground that we should not give away territory. Whatever we may have given away there would have been more than compensated for by the security afforded by a naval base of a great and powerful nation lying in the direction from which possible attack upon our country could come. Too many Ministers are dealing with this problem of defence. The MinLord Montgomery saidister for Defence and three subordinate Ministers all share in it. A set-up of that type can only lead to compromise can and to constant struggles between the service departments for more funds. That compromise is revealed in the budget figures. I would like the speaker is to follow me to obtain from the ter for Defence an explanation as to it came about that the amount of money provided under the five-year plan for the Army is the exact equivalent of that their Mr Spender. allotted to the Royal Australian Air Force. When two branches of the forces, whose role and methods of operation are entirely different, are given exactly the same financial provision, it is impossible to reconcile the fact with any other hypothesis than that the defence programme is merely a compromise. Our defence plan should be based on advice given by men who fought in World War II . and whose services are still available to the nation. On Tuesday night the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) made a pitiable, befogged and sentimental approach to this serious problem. The honourable gentleman said that be was praying for peace. While we all pray for peace, the Minister's deplorably weak utterances took us back to the drivelling attitude that was so characteristic of Labour members during the period antecedent to 1939. Honourable members opposite are displaying the same pacifist mentality that they exhibited in the days before 1939. When we say that the only way to meet aggression is to prepare against it, we enunciate what is the simplest of all truths in modern life. None of us wants war, but we must prepare to defend ourselves should war come upon us. Let us examine some aspects of the Government's defence plan as we know it. Let us consider first the Army. There can be no proper conception of any defence plan unless it be one which involves the principle that with the privileges of citizenship go the obligations of citizenship. Since we have heard so much of what Field Marshal Lord Montgomery has said let me, also, quote a recent statement of that great soldier. Speaking of the British Army as recently as the 18th August last, Field Marshal Without a strong territorial army there bp no national army and no national security. That corresponds with the militia forces in this country and is particularly what who honourable members on this side of the Minischamber are concerned about. Field how Marshal Lord Montgomery continuedEvery man and woman in Britain should understand that if the territorial army fails homes, freedom and way of life will be In the greatest danger if we are attacked. Every word of that applies with equal force to this country. The statement proceedsThe territorial army under post-war reorganization is intended to provide a basis the extension of the national army in the event of war. It is planned to consist of infantry and airborne divisions and a nucleus of heavyviews equipment units, which would be uneconomic for a small regular force to maintain in time. That is precisely what Australia needs. If people who say we do not stand universal training mean that we do not stand for annually calling up men willy - during the year. nilly as they reach army age into the ranks, thereby damaging our induscountry. trial economy, they right, but if they mean that we are not prepared to call up annually from each age group by ballot, sufficient men to provide a trained reserve, they are quite wrong. I cannot understand how the Government's proposed militi a against an emergency. will bave any value if it is to repeat pitiable performance of the M i l it before 1939. In these modern days, we should realise that the first need it men. That need can be met only by a system of universal service under which men in various age groups will be called up by ballot each year and trained. ""We want trained men for the A i r Force, in the air and on the ground. The Gowas vernment could train ground crews first training them in selected trades under asystem of universal training the Labour party. and then placing them in key industries for which their training fitted them so that they could be readily available to it. be called up in an emergency.. That involves tackling the trade unions and the Government would not have the courage to do it . The union leaders govern this country nowadays, not the Parliament, which has become the mere facade of democracy.",50
132,Mr HOLLOWAY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,A r e not the referred to by the honourable member working in engineering trades?,56
133,Mr SPENDER,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"They are working in industry, but they are losing the value of the trades that they learned in the Force.",56
134,Mr HOLLOWAY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I said they were working in engineering trades, not just in industry.",56
135,Mr SPENDER,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"I will not take tlufor view of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) aboui what should be done in defence armed matters any more than I would take the of three or four of his colleagues in peace the Ministry. There is no indication of any proper defence plan in the Government's policy. It s idea is to have a militia, members of which will spend for a little while in camp each year and do their other training periodically That will noi create an army for the defence of the What consideration has the Goare quite vernment given to the use of the vast number of pilots that we have in the country or to train their successors ? The pilots and navigators of Trans-Australia Airlines would provide a nucleus for the training of other pilots aiid navigators Few of the the things that ought to be done are being i a done. Above all, no plan has been revealed for the co-ordination of the three trained armed services. We have limited resources and it is idle to divide them almost equally between the three branches. Many years ago the Labour party's then leader, the late Mr John Curtin, said that one of both the best things that Australia could do to place more emphasis on the A i r by Force than on the other armed forces. That appears to have been forgotten by",56
136,Mr DALY,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,We have not forgotten,56
137,Mr SPENDER,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"The Governmeni must have forgotten it when it proposed to expend on the A r m y the same money as on the A i r Force. We should dismiss the Service Ministers. They perform no real function. W it h the armed forces we have, they are not needed. One Minister should be in charge of our men defences and he should devote his whole strength and intelligence to developing a co-ordinated defence plan which would use our resources to the utmost. I agree with the Minister for Defence that the whole nation must be organized. A i r That has been axiomatic for seven or eight, years, for we have seen total war waged. We need plans for the best use of our men and materials in war, but they are not forthcoming. So every justification exists, on this point alone, for the motion of censure, for such it is, moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition if there is one thing that we cannot close our eyes to, it is the terrifying march of events abroad. We hope and seek to avoid war, but we shall not avoid it by turning our eyes away from what is taking place in the world. I have made these remarks without th« desire to make political capital out of them. It is unfortunate that there cannot be a defence council on which the leaders of the Opposition parties, as well as the Government parties, could be represented. That has always been my personal view. The plan put before us by the Government does not provide for the use of our resources to the best advantage and it is producing a hotchpotch that has been condemned by two of the outstanding men in the Army and the Air Force that Australia has produced in this generation. Not long ago, certain generals sought to place their views on defence matters before the Minister for the Army, but were not even given the opportunity to do so. They are men who have fought for Australia and know much more, in my judgment, and I speak with large experience of the Army, about defence than do many of the present advisers of the Government. They were refused even a hearing. Whether that was because most of them were militia officers I do not know. Some of them had fought only in World War II , but others had fought in both wars. In the face of that, how can the Government hope to satisfy the public that its defence plans do not add up to a huge waste of money ? In the little time remaining to me, I desire to make reference to the budget itself, not in detail, because the details have been completely covered by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden), but broadly. One thing that strikes me about the budget is that the Government, knowing very well that around the corner there must be a decline of prices overseas that will have a most Mr Spender. devastating effect on our economy, is still budgeting for expenditure at an extraordinarily high level. Prices paid for our exports overseas are on an average 400 per cent, greater than they were before the war. It must be obvious that that cannot continue indefinitely. Yet we have had placed before us a budget that is inflationary and does not make provision for the inevitable recession. The people will scrutinize this budget more closely than they have scrutinized any other. It is said that large concessions are to be given to the people, but what does the budget amount to in simple terms? I hope I do not over-simplify it when I say that it merely maintains the present rate of expenditure plus specific amounts of additional expenditure, such as £'25,000,000 *for the payment of war gratuity, £10,000,000 as a gift to Great Britain, and two or three other items. The only reduction of expenditure proposed is on subsidies, the expenditure on which is to be reduced by £26,000,000. Taxation is to be reduced by an approximately equal amount. .Nothing more than that one statement is required to prove that the total burden of the budget is to be no less than was the burden of the budget of last year.. It is obvious that the course pursued by the Government will inevitably result in higher prices which will create a further inflationary trend and bring in its wake the old trouble that most of us have fought against of wages chasing prices continuously. The Government has done a bad thing by withdrawing subsidies. I am not concerned with the political aspects of their withdrawal, but I am concerned with the economic Consequences that will follow. When subsidies are removed prices will rise and the rise of prices will mostly affect people on the lower incomes. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), who usually gives a great deal of thought to his speeches, and to whom I always listen intently, went right off the rails when he said that subsidies could not be given to the States. There is no constitutional bar to the Government's making a grant to the States of the amount of money involved in subsidies, on condition that the States fix the prices of the commodities in respect of which the subsidies are granted. I believe that the Government is praying for increased prices so that next year, as an election bait, it be able to bring down a budget granting the taxpayers substantial tax concessions from hidden reserves. No doubt it will then say to them: "" The rise of prices was solely due to the fact that you did not give us control of prices. You were misled by our political opponents"". Nothing could be more fantastic or farther from the truth. The decision to withdraw subsidies is characteristic of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). It was because of pique that he decided to try to nationalize the banks and it was equally due to pique that he decided that subsidies should be withdrawn. He knew what the consequences would be. But the consequences suit him politically. Tbose capable of judging consider that the Government's defence plans are insufficient and that the budget cannot, be justified in the eyes of the people.",56
138,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY, Or d er! The honourable member's time has expired.,58
139,Mr CALWELL,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration) [9.30] - This is the greatest budget that has ever been presented to the Australian Parliament, and the attacks that have been made upon it by honourable members on the Opposition side of the chamber have proved nothing to the contrary. Honourable gentlemen opposite did not try to prove anything. They just wanted to cloud the issue. In the budget, it is proposed to give back to the people by way of tax reductions £28,000,000, of which £22,000,000 will be remitted this financial year. In addition, the Government proposes to increase social service benefits £21,000,000, so that the people will profit by £49,000,000 in tax reductions and increased social service payments. What other government, in the whole history of federation, ever tried to dp as much? When the Opposition parties were in power, it was the hardest thing in the world to get them to provide an extra shilling a week for the old age pensioners. It was the hardest thing in the world to get them even to annul some of the harsh measures which they had introduced in 1932, the first year they were in office after the defeat will of the Scullin Government. The present Government has managed the affairs of Australia during its seven years of office in a manner which no previous government was able to equal. It raised the sum of £1,513,970,132 for war purposes. The total national debt, owed by the Commonwealth and the States, is £2,790,215,169, upon which the interest liability is £82,324,768 a year. That amount has to be voted by Parliament annually. We are in debt to those overseas who lent the money to us, and to the people of Australia who subscribed to victory loans, to liberty loans and to reconstruction loans. The only way in which it would be possible to reduce expenditure, as requested by honourable members opposite, would be to repudiate interest payments. This one item of interest payments is almost equal to a pre-war budget, and it cannot be reduced. As a matter of fact, the Government has been successful in reducing the interest rate on our national indebtedness to £2 19s. per cent. In other days, the Opposition, when in power, was in the habit of floating loans at 5 per cent, and 6 per cent. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), when he was Prime Minister, floated a 6 per cent, loan, and the interest was made free of both Federal and State income tax. This Government has reduced the interest burden. It did not put the country into pawn overseas during the war. It raised all the war loans within Australia, and repatriated £77,839,812 of overseas indebtedness.' If the Opposition were in power again, precisely the same condition of affairs would obtain as existed under the Lyons and Menzies Governments. To-day, the credit by of Australia is extraordinarly high. It is so high that every conversion loan that we have floated overseas has been oversubscribed, and every loan that has been floated in Australia has been oversubscribed, also. In 1933, the Lyons Government floated overseas a loan of £9,621,000, of which £3,478,000 was left with the underwriters. It was 36.15 per cent, undersubscribed. The underwriters burnt their fingers over the first loan, as did those who underwrote many of the succeeding loans. The full - tory is revealed in the following table:LOANS UNDERSUBSCRIBED. Date of Iiunn. Amount. interest LOANS RAISED OVERSEAS SINCE 1932 WERE UNDERSUBSCRIBED.

Six Commonwealth loans were £14,700,000 short. Total = £62,700,000. The longer the anti-Labour governments remained in power, the worse the position became and the more the credit of Australia suffered. Their last oversea loan was floated in October, 1939, just after war broke out. It was for £6,000,000, of which £4,788,000 was left on the hands of the underwriters. The extraordinarily large amount of SO per cent, of the total loan was not subscribed by the public because they had lost confidence in the financial stability of Australia",58
140,Mr CONELAN,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,Who was Treasurer then ?,59
141,Mr CALWELL,ASSURANCE SOCIETY PROPRIETARY,"The right honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) was one of the long list of Treasurers who served in anti-Labour governments before the war, and the president of the Liberal party, Mr R. G. Casey, was another. The only bright spot in the record was when the present Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) was Treasurer. With thp Liberal party and its ideological predecessors, it was ever thus. In the days Shortage provided of the Bruce-Page Government overseas Kate of by underwriters. loans were undersubscribed.

They will also receive a sub4.706 stantial refund from the Taxation Branch 1,800 in July of next year, and that if 2,000 what honourable members opposite do 3,630 not like. The Government ha? 900 honoured its promises in their entirety. We did not go into the auction mart to buy votes at the last election. The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) said that, if his party were returned to power, he would reduce taxation by £20,000,000. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that he would reduce taxation by £28,000,000. Eventually, the people realized that there was no unanimity among the Opposition parties and that it was simply a matter of huckstering. for votes. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley), on the contrary, made no promises. He did not offer any inducements. He said, "" Trust this Government which has managed the economy of Australia so well "", and the people did trust it. It is stated in a document which has been circulated for the information of honourable members, that since 1942, the Government has remitted taxes to the amount of £138,000,000, made up of a remission of £20,000,000 in January. 1946; £17,500,000 in July, 1946; and £33,000,000 in July, 1947. The present proposal is to grant a further remission of £26,000,000. Tn addition, remission - of sales tax and other charges amount to a further £2,000,000. This Government has managed the affairs of Australia so well that the people now have £6S1,000,000 in their savings bank accounts. In 1947, they had £660,000,000 in the savings banks. The total amount in the savings banks was only £236,991,000 when the Opposition parties were in power. Honourable members opposite have accused the Government of destroying the economy of the country, but the fact remains that the people have three times as much money in the savings banks now as when the Opposition parties were in power. And to whose credit does this money stand ? It is owned by the ordinary people, whose spending power assures prosperity for everybody. This Government looks after the people, and that is why it enjoys their confidence. It is also the reason why the Government faces the future confidently. Not all persons with the same ideological background as honourable members opposite think as they do. Sir Norman Brookes returned to Australia on 18th August.",59
142,Mr WHITE,WHICH,Anothe r one quoting Sir Norman Brookes!,60
143,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"Yes , but I shall quote him correctly. All the honourable member for Balaciava (Mr White) did was to chase him into his sicb room, and try to get him to repudiate what he had said. I have here the report of an interview with Sir Norman Brookes as published in the Melbourne Herald. If the Herald is right, the honourable member for Balaclava is wrong. The honourable member mutters like a married magpie in objection to my statement, but here is the report of what Sir Norman Brookes saidAustralians might moan, but their country was in a sounder economic position than any other country he knew, said Sir Norman Brookes today. Does the honourable member for Balaclava assert that Sir Norman Brookes did not say that?",60
144,Mr WHITE,WHICH,I read his answer.,60
145,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"The honourable member quibbles and shuffles on this issue as on every other. The report continuesPrices had been held down so successfully that even if tliere was a slump abroad tralia could withstand it. "" If only we can realise what a wonderful position we are in now, and make the most of our opportunities, there should be no stopping us"", said Sir Norman. "" We can face tinfuture with the greatest optimism "". That is not Labour propaganda. It i the opinion of a captain of industry, a man associated with the Liberal party, whose ideas on many matters are the same as those of honourable members opposite. As a matter of fact, member? of his family have, in the past, stood as candidates for the Nationalist party, the United Anstralia party, and the Liberal party in parliamentary elections. Sii Norman returned to Australia determined to tell the truth, and all the moanings-to use his own classic expression-of honourable members opposite, will not fool the Australian people. They know that the economy of the country is sound. They know that there is full employment, and thai the people have plenty of money in the savings banks. The Australian people recognize that there are shortages, which are not due to unemployment, but. to a scarcity of material. : 1 and man-power. Even the scarcity of materials is due, in the final analysis, to a scarcity of man-power. Australia has not enough people to do the work that needs to be done. I l is in the paradoxical position of experiencing a depression in reverse. During the' depression, there was plenty of labour, but there were not enough jobs, To-day there are plenty of jobs, but not enough men. If Sir Norman Brookes is right in sayinp that Australia can face the future with optimism, it must be because Australia has a good and honest Government. It would be impossible to face the future with optimism if a great many people were out of work, and there waf undeserved destitution in the country",60
146,Dame ENID LYONS,WHICH,"Did not the Prime Minister, speaking at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, voice a warning against the danger of another economic depression?",60
147,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"He did, and everybody is concerned at the possibility of an economic depression. It remains true, Aus- however, that no other country has as sound an economy as Australia. T drnot, propose to detail all the big undertakings with which Sir Norman Brookes is associated, but he is certainly connected with some of the largest industrial concerns in the country. After bearing the speeches of some honourable members opposite, a listener might be excused for imagining that the Government was squandering money in all directions. It has not squandered any money, but bas increased the benefits to those who, it thinks, need them most. The Government is working on the right principle, and, indeed, on the only principle which a democratic administration can follow. It is doing the greatest good for the est number of people. The Government is being attacked virulently and violently because it will not grant tax remissions to the wealthy section of the community. It is because the Government is granting the biggest remissions of tax to those in the lower and the middle income groups that honourable members opposite are so annoyed. When anti-Labour governments were in office, a few years ago, they always granted tax remissions to the people with the biggest incomes, and showed little concern for the people in the lower ranges of income. I shall tell honourable members exactly what happened after the accession to office of the Lyons Government, which was later succeeded by the Menzies Government. The Lyons Government, in its first year of office, reduced old-age pensions below the level to which they had been reduced in accordance with the provisions of the Premiers plan, but it remitted land tax payable by some of the biggest graziers, landholders, insurance companies anJ banks. Tbose who had helped to secure the return to office of the Lyons Government, and paid its election expenses, obviously benefited most from that tax concession.",60
148,Mr WARD,WHICH,The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr MCBride) certainly benefited.,61
149,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"Every honourable member opposite, who is a wealthy man, secured substantial benefits from the antischeme-tha Labour governments that ruled and ruined Australia from 1932-33 until 1938-39. Remissions of land tax in that period totalled £8,700,000, and benefited prinber cipally the big landholders in the cities. The reductions of tax were not of such, tremendous benefit to the people in the country districts, but were certainly of benefit to 9,100 pastoralists and farmers who, between them, owned property, the unimproved value of which was assessed at £87,000,000, and to 2,800 companieswith property, the unimproved value of which was assessed at £93,000,000. While granting huge remissions of land tax and income tax to the wealthy section of the community, the Lyons Government did not vote a penny in its first year of office for the relief of unemployment, but left that responsibility to the States. great- The States financed tlieir particular schemes by imposing a tax of 3d. in the £1 on the incomes of every salary and wage-earner. No matter how many dependants a worker had, he paid a flat rate of 3d. in the £1 on his wages. In some States, the unemployment relief tas was fid. in the £1. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang), whose utterances are quoted with such approval by honourable members opposite, promised the electors of New South Wales that if they returned him to office he would abolish the unemployment relief tax of 3d. in the £1, which had been levied by the Bavin Government. The honourable member was returned to office, and substituted for the tax of 3d. in the £1 a tas of Is. in the £1. I. have read many of the speeches which honourable members opposite have made on the budget, and I have noted that they have spoken with diverse voices on various subjects. Some of them want reserves established out of the Government's so-called bulging surplus. Others want the Government to make maximum remissions of tax to the wealthy section of the community. Some of them even sneered at the Government's health scheme, and announced that they were opposed to free medicine. The honourable member for Balaclava criticized the free medicine scheme in the following words:The Government's so-called free medicine t will certainly not he free-and other nonsensical socialistic extravaganceI wonder whether the honourable member for Balaclava spoke for every other memof the Opposition. Did he speak for the Australian Country party when hp condemned the Government's free medicine scheme as being socialistic and extravagant? Did be speak for the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton), the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr MCBride) ? I ask those honourable members whether they are opposed to the free medicine scheme. On every possible occasion, the honourable member for Balaclava has attacked the scheme, misrepresented it and made all kinds of mendacious statements about it . When the Pharmaceutical Benefits Bill was before this chamber, he said I ask the propounders of this wonderful piece of legislation, who asked for it to be introduced? Have the people been clamouring for free bottles' of medicine, or is this one of the bright ideas emanating from the brains t.rust of the Labour party?",61
150,Mr WHITE,WHICH,That was a good speech.,62
151,Unknown,WHICH,"Opposition members interjecting,",62
152,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,I notice that other honourable members opposite are in agreement with those sentiments.,62
153,Mr WHITE,WHICH,T be extract from my speech is the best part of the Minister's speech to date.,62
154,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"When the idiotic clamour of members of the Opposition dies down, I shall remind them of a little history. When the Banking Bill was before this chamber, I quoted verse 35, chapter 31, of the Book of JobOh . . . that mine written a book. I quoted that verse against the right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr Hughes) who wrote Bond Free, and then came in as a "" stooge"" for the financial institutions oppose the Banking Bill . quoted it against the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who wrote The Forgotten People, in which he attacked members of the Douglas Credit Movement, who were petitioning the Parliament. Later, the right honourable gentleman and his supporters went through the pantomime of presenting petitions to the Parliament. day after day for months, although, in his book, he had condemned that kind of action. I suggest that a good modern version of the verse would beOh that mine adversary would appear on « newsreel. Honourable members opposite have condemned free medicine. I have in my possession a newsreel which depicts Mr . R. G. Casey, in 1937, talking about the national health and pensions insurance scheme. It is a good picture. 1 had a 16-mm. copy made of it and, with the permission of the President and Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall show it to any honourable members who desire to see it. Honourable members opposite are invited to attend the performance and admire the Adonis-like features of the federal leader of the Liberal party, gaze upon his sartorial excellence and listen to the mellifluous flow of his melodious voice. I am not able to imitate his voice. Nature deals differently with different people. Nature has made the honourable member for Balaclava handsome, but it did not give him any brains. It gave the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) a sense of humour. It bas not given me a good voice, or made me handsome, hut it has treated me much more generously in the supply of brains than it has treated most honourable members opposite. I invite them to listen to the words of Mr Casey, because they are really intriguing and important. Mr Casey said I much appreciate the opportunity of a minute or two's talk to you because national adversary had insurance is going to make a tremendous change for the better in the homes of the working men and women of Australia. Honourable members opposite should listen in breathless silence to the next sentence which is as follows:to If you are a man working for under £7 a T also week, you will pay Is. 6d. a week and for that you will get free doctor and free medicine The honourable member for Balaclava declared that free medicine was socialistic and extravagant. Whoever would, have thought of calling Mr Casey, of all people, a socialist? The commentary proceededand £1 while you are sick, and in addition, 3s. ltd. a week for each child under the age of fifteen. Just imagine the munificence of it ! The commentary continuedIf you die, which I hope you don't, tlien widow will get 12s. (id. a week, plus 3s. Od. for each dependent child and she will get this for life or until she remarries. Eow generous! Those proposals were as far as the Liberal party in those days was prepared to go with its national health and pensions scheme. I do not propose to enumerate all the benefits that the Labour Government gives to the people for the payment of Is. 6d. a week. Incidentally, the social services contribution is not a flat rate, but is levied on a graduated scale. The Government does not pay 3s. 6d. a week in respect of each child under the age of fifteen years, but has raised the child endowment payment by 100 per cent, since assuming office. In addition, it has increased age pensions by more than 100 per cent. Expenditure on social security benefits now amounts to £74,000,000 per annum. By the time of the next election, about December, 1949, or January, 1950, we hope to be paying social services benefits at the rate of approximately £100,000,000 per annum to those persons in the community who need them. I pause to remark that the present Leader of the Opposition resigned from the Lyons Government because it would not put into operation the legislation for the national health scheme which Mr Casey had sponsored and about which he boasted in his newsreel talk. The Leader of the Opposition probably left the Lyons Government because it would not introduce a free medicine scheme and a free doctor service which some honourable members opposite regard as socialistic and extravagant. The Government has never squandered money, but has been most careful with the people's property. When honourable members opposite occupied the treasury bench, they squandered money to an extraordinary degree. There was the instance, small in itself, but indicative of the general mentality of the Bruce Page Government, of a dog kennel being installed at the Prime Minister's lodge at a cost of £28.",62
155,Mr MCBRIDE,WHICH,A dog kennel could not be provided for £28 today.,63
156,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"In that instance, public money was squandered. kennel itself was too rich. The poor dog couid not take it. He died in a fortnight. your Anti-Labour governments in tbose day? did not provide any social service* for the man who was trying to rear a family. It amazes me that in a democracy like Australia, after 80 or 90 years of an educational system that is free, secular and compulsory, we should find any person in the community so lacking in intelligence as to vote for any honourable member opposite. It also amazes me that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party have any representation in this Parliament at all. The policy which the Labour Government is following is obviously the right policy for the people of Australia.",63
157,Dr GAHA,WHICH,The Liberal candidate polled only one vote out of every six in Denison at the last election.,63
158,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"The Liberal party and the Australian Country party have hopes of being returned to the treasury bench at the next general election, but such ambitions are not likely to be realized. They play up to the press, as the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) did in his speech on the budget. His first words were to this effect, "" I read the leading article in the Daily Telegraph, and it is of the usual high standard of philosophic worth and literary skill to be found in that journal"". On the 1st May, 1940, he made a speech at a Rotary Cluh luncheon, which was also reported in that newspaper. It was his May Day speech. He said I am pleased to know that the Government proposes further to restrict the press. It is high time this was done. We have shown a great deal of tolerance in times gone by, but in time of war it is necessary to hand over the Iibert}' of free speech to the Government. Honourable members opposite say one thing when they are in office and another thing when they are out of office. Their memories are so short that they cannot catch up with themselves. I have told them on more than one occasion in this chamber that they remind me very much of the French Bourbons. They learn nothing and they forget nothing. All that they do is to tell the same series of lies, working on Goebbels's technique that The if you repeat a lie often enough yon will get people to believe it. Tbey keep saying the same thing. They talk of socialism and communism, and of the designs that the Labour party has upon the liberties of the people. Because they have had the assistance of powerful media, because they have had the assistance of the films on some occasions, because they have been able to make use of the radio and press on other occasions, and because they have plenty of money to publish pamphlets, they have been able to fool quite a lot of people. That sort of thing, however, cannot go on for ever. They tell us of the Communist menace that is abroad and which to be restrained. They say that the Government wants to do all sorts of things with insurance companies, banks, Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and so on. The fact is that we have no constitutional power to deal with any industries other than those which are enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution. When the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) recently visited the coal-fields of New South Wales with the Minister for Shipping and Puel (Senator Ashley), the right honourable gentleman said something which the press of Australia did not report, or, if it did report it, did so only in a very condensed form. The Prime Minister said on that occasionTlie Government does not intend to nationalize undertakings other than public utilities which it is satisfied can serve the people better if not controlled by private enter-, prise. We have not the power to nationalize mines, and there is no evidence that nationalization will help to improve the position. We have no intention of nationalizing things like rag shops and ice cream carts. That statement by the Prime Minister of Australia was given little prominence by the newspapers of this country. It was a statement of government policy, - and no amount of misrepresentation by honourable members opposite can change it. We passed legislation to nationalize the banks because they were trying to destroy the 1945 banking legislation which the people endorsed by their votes at the 1946 general election. Because the solicitor for the Melbourne City Council, which launched the attack on the Banking Act of 1945 in the High Court of Australia, happened, by the strangest coincidence in the world, also to be the secretary of the Victorian division of the Associated Banks of Australia, and because the challenge of the Melbourne City Council was directed, not only against the one section that the High Court declared to be invalid, but against the whole of the act, the Government decided to finish the banks in their present form before the banks finished the people of Australia in another depression. We are anxious to protect the people from depression, and the effects of depression. There are two ways in which that can be done. The first is by keeping a good government bas in office, and the second is by destroying the power of people who are not elected by anybody and are responsible only to shareholders to manipulate the credit of this country. Such people should not have the power to contract credit and cause deflation, or to increase the flow of credit and cause inflation. As I have said on several occasions, inflation and deflation are both cumulative in their ill effects. They both lead to mass unemployment. Honourable gentlemen opposite, who are the champions of confusion and the creators of chaos, would do precisely the same things tomorrow, if they were back on the treasury bench, as they did in the years between 1916 and 1941. During that time, except for brief periods, they had an overwhelming majority in both houses of Parliament and could bave prevented much of the misery that was inflicted on the people of Australia. They would not pass a bill through the Senate to create a fiduciary note issue of £18,000,000 for the purpose of financing the sale of wheat and for putting unemployed people to work in a scale which would have involved an estimated expenditure of £1,000,000 a month. They said that to do so would destroy the financial stability of Australia. Yet, when Australia was engaged in the last war, this Government used national credit to the amount of £147,000,000 to bridge the gap between expenditure and the amount of money that could be obtained from loans and taxes. The maximum amount that could be obtained from loans was raised, and income tax was increased to a maximum. on the highest incomes of 18s. 6d. in the £1. The wheat farmers remember that during the depression years wheat was sold on the Horsham Plains of Victoria, for Is. lOd. a bushel, and in the Riverina for about the same amount. The wheat growers of Australia were driven into bankruptcy then, but, despite the propaganda of the Country party, they are beginning to realise that this Government is, and always has been, the farmers' friend. If they did not think that the Government was the farmers' friend, SO per cent, of them would not have voted in favor of the wheat stabilization scheme, which they know to be a Commonwealth scheme. It is the Scully plan. It is a plan that r.his Government formulated on the advice of the farmers who are in our party. We are a party of all kinds of peopleworkers, farmers, doctors and lawyersbut in these days there are no ,e stooges"" for big business on the right of the Chair. No one on this side of the chamber has any concern other than to do the greatest amount of good for everybody in the community. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) said that a man with a wife and two children, who earns pays up to £118 a year in indirect taxes. That statement is a complete concoction. It could only be possible if each of those persons consumed a full quota of spirits, wines, tobacco and cigarettes, the family used 224 gallons of petrol year and a full share of all other ported commodities, if it were buying luxury lines that are subject to the higher rates of sales tax, and if it were paying"" wages of' more than £20 a week and, therefore, contributing to the pay-roll tax. If the members of the family not doing any of those things, they not pay even a minute fraction of year. Contrariwise, the honourable ber's calculations could prove that a earning £10,000 a year need pay only a year in indirect taxes, if he were abstemious. The real position is that taxpayer who earns £300 a year and has a wife and two children pays no direct taxes; that, buying mainly essential foods and clothing, he pays practically no cism of the Treasurer. Mr Calwell. sales tax; that he pays excise only to the extent that he uses beer and tobacco; that he pays customs duty only to the extent that it is passed on by merchants and manufacturers; that be pays no payroll tax; and that he pays entertainment tax probably only at the lowest rate applicable to the cheapest seats.",63

160,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"It was £1 5s. when the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) was Postmaster-General and in those days listeners were not allowed to hear all the stations that they wanted to hear because the honourable member played the role of a little Hitler and closed down one or two stations. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that the Treasurer was an outstanding record breaker. And so he is. He is one of the greatest figures that the public life of this country has ever produced. He is one of those rare personages who has a way of ingratiating himself with everybody who meets him. He bas a simple urbanity and natural courtesy which the honourable member for Warringah will never have. To me he is a mixture of an Abraham Lincoln,, a Will Rogers and an honest back£300 a year, country Australian.",65
161,Mr WHITE,WHICH,And a Ned Kelly.,65
162,Mr CALWELL,WHICH,"An attack by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. beer, White) on any honourable member if sitting on this side of the coma mittee is a compliment. The Treaimsurer, according to the Leader of theall Australian Country party, has presented budgets to this House on a record number of occasions. But his records are not finished. He will present a budget next year, and in the following year, were and in many years to come. The would Leader of the Australian Country £118 a party also said that the Treamemsurer had achieved a record public man debt of £2,700,000,000, and had a record £29 number of employees. I remind the committee that most of that public debt was a incurred as a result of World War II . and I know that the Leader of the Australian Country party did not intend to be uncharitable or unfair in his critiNo other Treasurer could have raised such a huge sum of money with as little dislocation of our economy, or could have persuaded the Australian people as he did to bear their burdens as they did until the end of the war. - Leader of the Australian Country party further said that the Treasurer's expenditure had reached record proportions. Tbat is quite true; and it should be so. Would the right honourable gentleman have it otherwise? Does he want the Government to put people off its nay-roll ? Many honourable members opposite talk of driving public servants off the government pay-roll to go to work in factories. That is a form of conscription of labour which this party does not support. We believe that every member of the community should be permitted to take the best job that he can get. The honourable member for Warringah is a barrister. He does not believe that he should be put into a canning factory, although I have no doubt that he would do better work there than he is doing now. The Opoosition Would force postal employees and clerks in government offices to work for lower rates of pay, and the hill-billy members of the Country party would ask that dismissed public servants be directed to farm work. The plain truth is that there are not enough people in Australia today; but we believe that every person in this country should be allowed to work where he chooses. There should be no cutting of public expenditure just to force publicservants into some other form of employment to make profits for some privileged section of the community. We are proud of the budget. We are proud of its magnitude. We are proud of the proposals it contains for the well being of the people of this country. Wc are proud of its promises to the Australian people. We are proud of the benefits it will confer. We are proud that honourable members of the opposition have been able to find so little in it to criticise. Having no constructive criticism to offer, honourable gentlemen opposite talk like parrots hour after hour, saying much the same thing from scripts prepared for them by the banking institutions and Liberal party head-quarters. Everybody knows that they have not enough intelligence to write their own speeches, or that they are so intellectually lazy that if -'they essayed the task themselves the speeches would be even greater failures than those they are The delivering.",65
163,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHICH,"Barker) [10.15] - - If the Minister for Information. (Mr Calwell) ever wishes to retire from politics, no doubt he will travel to Switzerland like Edward Gibbon did. and commence his magnum opus on the decline and fall of the Australian Labour party. He is a great authority on history. He is always interesting, always amusing, sometimes exciting, and always wholly inaccurate. I shall deal with two or three of his inaccuracies to-night. He referred to the method by which loans were raised during the administration of previous governments. He named the Lyons. Menzies, Eadden, Bruce-Page and other governments, going back over a period of many years; but he failed to state the facts. I shall state tbem now. During the period to which he referred, there was the most complete freedom on the part of investors to put their money into government bonds, or into private business. Yet. he compared those days with more recent times when the Australian Government had an absolute stranglehold over all investments. We all know that unless the Advisory Committee on Capita! Issues approved a certain investment, it could not be made.",66
164,Mr MCDONALD,WHICH,Unles s it was required for a cement project.,66
165,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHICH,"Yes , or perhaps for a New Guinea timber lease, and, of course, money had to be kept under Government control to finance the New Zealand wheat deal. Not long ago, another Minister referred to the high level reached by savings bank deposits in this country. He was only £311,000,000 out"" in his figures, but apparently that is near enough when one is dealing with millions. Let it be remembered that during the war, when successful loans were floated by the Curtin and Chifley Administrations, the Australian Government has access to every savings bank in the Commonwealth. The great bulk of such deposit? of course were in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. In addition the Government had recourse to treasury-bills. Somes of the most illuminating pages in the budget papers deal with trust funds. Trust funds consist of money paid into the Treasury on trust. In round figures, there is £148,000,000 in trust funds today, but of that sum which bas been contributed by taxes and by other methods, including payments by insurance companies, &c, no less than £141,000,000 is invested in treasury-bills at 1 per cent. So, the Australian Government today has access to savings bank deposits totalling £681,000,000, to funds paid into the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by law. and to certain surplus funds of the trading banks now amounting to nearly £800,000,000, It can dip its fingers into every child's money box and can issue treasury-bills at 1 per cent, as long as it pleases, and without limitation. It stands to reason that a government placed in this position cannot be compared with preceding administrations. I regret that the Minister for Information is so tired from his exertions that he has had to leave the chamber, but no doubt he will come back soon. He referred to times gone by when there was a surplus of commodities, and when men were out of work. To-day, he said, everybody was in full employment, but I remind him that there is still a shortage of commodities. How does he piece those two statements together? Does he mean that in the depression days and post-depression days-he said that there Avere 250,000 unemployed in 1939-the number of people then at work was producing a surplus of the goods and services required in Australia at that time, and that today, with full employment, the workers of Australia are unable to keep the country adequately supplied? As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) pointed out this afternoon, it is not possible nowadays to purchase more than 2 lb. of sugar at a time. That applies not only in the Bendigo electorate, but in every southern electorate in Australia. The only conclusion to be drawn from that, and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) may reply to this at a later stage, is that a high proportion of the people employed in Mr Archie Cameron. Australia today are not giving a proper return of labour during their workinghours. The introduction of the 40-hour week was, in my opinion, one of the most wicked things ever done in Australia. It stands to reason that with a 40-hour ' week it is impossible to maintain a supply of goods and services to the extent required. The Government has continually told us about the terrible conditions overseas, but while it was doing so its representatives appeared 'before the Commonwealth Arbitration Couri and argued in favour of the 40-hour week. How does the Government reconcile that action with what it says, and what is in fact true, about thestate of affairs in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia? The Labour party claims to champion the principle of the brotherhood of man. How then does a Labour Government reconcile the introduction of the 40-hour week, which has resulted in decreased production and decreased exports of necessaries to other countries, with its claim to champion the principle of the brotherhood of man? As i have stated on previous occasions there has never been a party in the history of Australia whose inhumanity to man ha* been greater than that shown by the present-day Labour party. There is no humanity in that party whatsoever. It is.the most self-centred, selfish party that has ever sat on the treasury benches of this Parliament. It says nothing outside what the little dictators of the trade unions tells it to say. I may apply to it the words of Charles I - altere d to suit the particular caseI have neither tongue to speak nor eyes to see save what the Australian Council of Trade Unions commands me to say and see. The ex-member of the Country party now sitting on the treasury bench, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, knows the position as well as I do. His othercolleague who is sitting with him wa? also very nearly a member of theCountry party, but described himself as unendorsed when he was a candidate on the occasion to which I refer. He also knows the position equally well. The Minister said something about sources of taxation, and added that it was impossible to obtain certain amounts from the wealthy, and the money had therefore to come from those not so wealthy. I liave here the latest return of the Commissioner of Taxation for the financial year 1944-45. I apologize to the Parliament because the report is so out of date, but excuse myself on the ground that the Government does not appear to be able to keep its essential printing up to date for the information of honourable members. The return shows that the number of taxpayers earning more than £1,500 a year, which is the figure that the Parliament, led by this Government, decided that the work of honourable members was worth, was 17,958 in that year, and that the total number of taxpayers was 2,049,694. Taxpayers earning over £1,500 a year from personal exertion accounted £48,000,000 of the £714,000,000 collected in taxes on personal exertion income. Those with property producing an income of more than £1,500 a year accounted for £16,000,000 of the £69,000,000 collected in taxes on property income. Item by item the Commissioner of Taxation shows the income in each income group and how it was derived. How much was left after income tax was paid by those taxpayers? I say to the honourable gentleman on the treasury bench that there was not very, much left. If they took all of what was left they Would not have enough to pay for the fleet of expensive cars which they use at the public expense. I shall now refer to the free medicine scheme put before the Parliament by the former Treasurer, Mr Casey. I am deeply indebted to the Minister for Information for mentioning Mr Casey's scheme. That scheme was enunciated before the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction was a member of this House and when he was still trying to decide whether he would be a member of the Country party of the Labour Party.",66
166,Mr DEDMAN,WHICH,"It would have been impossible for Mr Casey and myself to be here at the same time, as I now sent the electorate that he formerly held.",68
167,Mr ARCHIE CAMEROK,WHICH,"The Minister stood for election as soon as he thought the electors would accept him. I was on the treasury bench when Mr Casey's bill was before the House. It did not provide for a free medicine plan such as that provided for by the present Government. There is no comparison whatsoever between the twoplans. The scheme put forward by Mr. Casey, at the behest of the Lyons Government, was one under which each individual would contribute Is. 6d. a week and in return would receive certain benefits. I personally am one whose parents, in their good sense, enrolled me in a friendly society, the Rechabites. I was nine or ten years of age at that time. To-day, after about 40 years, I pay Is. a week into that friendly society and since my parents enrolled me I have been entitled to free medicine. for But I bave paid for it with my contributions. I am also entitled to free medical service and in due course my executor? will be entitled to funeral expenses to meet cost of my burial. I am also entitled to receive the sum of £1 a week from the society during periods of sickness. The Casey scheme was based on the friendly societies' scheme. Under Mr. Casey's plan, the amount of contribution was to be Is. 6d. a week. Under the present Government's scheme the amount of contribution is Is. 6d. in the £1. The Minister says that contributors under the present scheme receive about twice as much as they would have received under the Casey plan. I do not think that the Government is entitled to any laurel wreaths for its scheme, and if it cares to have screened a certain film of Mr Casey, I am quite sure honourable members would hear something useful and enlightening, and would also be able to look upon the . image of a very good man. During his remarks on Commonwealth assistance to countries overseas, the Minister for Information made what I took to be a slighting reference, though I hope I am doing him no injustice by referring to it as such. To-day we hear so mitch from the Government about dollars that honourable members on this side of the committee are repre- beginning to believe that the Government has some kind of dollar fever. In its Marshall aid plan, the United States of America, a country which has much the same area as Australia but twenty time? its population, has done a great deal more, proportionately, than Australia is doing or has done to assist the ravaged countries of Europe. There can be no comparison between the efforts of Australia and those of the United States of America in production, the number of hours worked, or coal production figures. Australia has a population of 7,000,000 and -& great industrial need for coal. It is mining about 14,000,000 tons of coal a year. With a population of 140,000,000, the United States of America ought to be mining on a proportionate basis only 280,000,000 tons a year, but last year 702,000,000 tons of coal were produced in that country. Another great distinction between Australia and the United States of America is that in the latter country an overwhelming majority of people desire to work in order to gain something. Australia, according to the Labour party, the one unpardonable crime is that any man should want to earn a few pounds. Any one who succeeds in earning a few pounds is beyond redemption altogether. At the conference of the Australian Labour party, held in April, the Minister for Information stated, as his . colleague the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction may confirm, that the real fight today was not between Labour and communism but between Labour and capitalism, and C should bo very interested to hear the Minister expand that statement. regard to his reference to industrial conscription, may I remind the committee that the Curtin Government has the record and the credit of being the only Government in Australia which ever had the temerity to introduce industrial conscription, and that Administration ""got away with it"",'not only with the trade unions, but also with the electors. There was then no question of people being able to choose their employment, although members of the present Government, about which the Minister for Information is continually boasting, speak of the right of people to pick their own jobs. During the war people were picked out of their homes and businesses and shunted to the Northern Territory, to remote parts of the coastline and to the islands to do any job which Mr Archie Cameron. the individuals nominated by the Government decreed they should perform.",68
168,Mr BLAIN,WHICH,"But not the Minister' friends, as I learned later.",69
169,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHICH,"Quite a lot might be said in regard to that matter. For the moment I content myself with pointing out that the present Government has no right to lecture the Opposition on freedom of choice of employment, because that freedom certainly did not exist under Labour administrations during the war. The Minister also referred to the advocacy by members of the Opposition of the need for economy. Let me remind him that when he occupied a back bench in this chamber as the honourable member for Melbourne, and was trying to horn his way into the Ministry, he had a great deal to say about economy. He In was, I suppose, one of the most stringent critics of the Government in this chamber at that time, and one of the Commonwealth departments which he now administers, the Department of Information, was his special "" pet"". He sa w no reason whatever for the continued existence of that department, and I entirely agree with him. However, when he was elected by caucus to the Ministry, the former Prime Minister, the late Mr John Curtin. decided, with ironic humour, that since he had to allocate a portfolio to such a queer, thirteen-cornered sort of fellow, he would entrust to his administration the department which he had criticized so With bitterly. What happened ? Instead of the Department of Information being pui down the drain, or wiped out in some other fashion, the Minister proceeded to expand it, and he discovered very cogent and urgent reasons why it should not only be expanded in Australia, but IShould also be transplanted' overseas ' and expanded there. The only material benefit which I can discern from the expansion of that department is that the Minister has saved his enemies, whom he calls the "" press barons "", the cost of performing a lot of services which he has provided for them which they would otherwise have had to provide for themselves. I intend to say something now on defence. I listened to the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) last night, and I heard Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) speak to-night. I entirely agree with the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) that the separate service ministries should be abolished and replaced by a single ministry of Defence. Because of the size of our present services, it is rediculous that one Minister should be fully unemployed administering our small Army; that another Minister should be needed to look after the few naval vessels which we possess, and that yet another Minister should be required to administer the handful of aircraft which comprises our Air Force. Of course, I admit that the Minister for Air also administers the portfolio of Civil Aviation. However, there is also a Minister for Munitions, and a Minister for Supply and Development and Minister for Shipping and Fuel, although I understand that the Departments of Supply and Shipping have now been incorporated.",69
170,Mr DEDMAN,WHICH,Not the the Department of Supply. The Departments of Shipping and Fuel are administered as one portfolio.,70
171,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHICH,"Quite so, but two Ministers are now doing the work formerly performed by one; and we have presiding over the service ministries like Jove on Olympus, the Minister for Defence. Such a platoon of Ministers is quite unnecessary, and if we are to learn the lesson which emerged from the recent war, that combined operations override all other military organizations in efficiency, we should abolish the conglomeration of separate service ministries. En those separate ministries each Minister, no doubt, has his oAvn little retinue, "" corners "", and bottle-necks. We should abolish those ministries and replace tbem with a single ministry which can give to the Parliament and the country a concise, co-ordinated and intelligible defence policy. When we consider the subject of defence we must recognize that all money spent on war is wasted. I think that even the Minister for Defence will agree with me on that. However, it is a waste of money which has had to be endured throughout history by all nations which the desired to preserve their independence. "" Wasted"" money bas to be spent on defence works in times of peace; but if those defence works are not kept up to standard, and the forces employed are not properly trained and equipped, it stands to reason that we shall not be in a position to safeguard our vital interests when the necessity to do so arises. Australia had a very lucky escape in the last war. I recall with some bitterness the debates which took place about the time of Munich. I have in mind also some debates which took place on certain proposed votes after the outbreak of World War II . I recall particularly the day when members of the Australian Labour party demanded a division on the question whether'we should send troop.= to the Middle East. v . Mr BI.AIN - And to New Guinea.",70
172,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHICH,"And to New Guinea. I recall that I said on that occasion that we should send at least five divisions. I also expressed the opinion that probably ten divisions would be needed. Later we had to raise ten divisions, but at that time members of the Australian Labour party believed that we were engaged in an "" imperialist war "". They bad not got away from Munich. They were fascinated, apparently, by that gentleman Hitler, who was good enough to grant a breathing space of twelve months to Chamberlain and Daladier, who was Premier of France at that time. At that time members of the Labour party certainly did not believe in defence or in a global war. Later we beard a great deal from them about "" global war "", but at that time they were not concerned with anything outside Australia. As the honourable member for Warringah said tonight, if the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) had had his way on that occasion, the Minister would not have any external territories to administer today, because he was quite prepared to allow those territories to be seized by Adolf Hitler, Hirobito, or any one else who chose to come along and take tbem. Having said that, let us look to the future, because it does not do to live continually in the past, as do members of the Australian Labour party. Members of that party apparently have no vision of the future execpt on such matters as pensions or other gifts that are to be doled out to some one at the expense of some one else but never at their own expense, of course. In any view of the future we must bave regard to the possible conditions under which we may be impelled to engage in hostilities. It is of no use to burke facts, and it is obvious that the .only country with which Australia, the British Empire, the United States of America or the nations of western Europe may have to engage in hostilities is Russia. There is no other potential enemy. No other country is threatening the peace of the world or trying to grab, in the best imperialist, expansionist spirit of the Czars, the territory of its neighbours. There ""is no other country which is stretching out into Germany, Austria, the Baltic, and the Balkans; which is threatening Turkey, which is interfering in Palestine; which is threatening Afghanistan, Persia and India; and which is extending its influence in Siam, Indo China, China, Korea and the Japanese islands. Every one of us should understand clearly the objectives of Russian imperialism in the world. Russia is a slave state in the strictest sense of the word. It is ruled by what is probably the foulest government that was ever on the face of the earth. It is a country which, I am happy to say, I have never called my ally. I have never used that word at any time in relation to Russia, because I have never had any doubt as to what Russia intended to do. There are, however, many people in this country, and some of them in my own electorate, who at one time held different views. During the last election campaign, I was able to ask some of them whether they held the same views about Russia in 1946 as they had held in 1943. They were not prepared to answer. Our experiences with Russia during the last few years should have taught the Australian Government, and even the intensely selfcentred Australian Labour party, a lesson. Within our own community, we have the Russian fifth column. Recently, that delectable gentleman, Mr Burns, stated what the Communists in Australia would do, should war with Russia eventuate. He should be dealt with by Mr Archie Cameron. the Government, but I have no doubt that he will not be, and that the Prime Minister will say, in his blandest and most disarming way, that Burns was merely giving expression to his own private ideology. In that manner, the whole incident will be brushed-off. If we are to take the field of battle against Russia in the not distant future, what effective contribution to the conflict will the Australian nation make? I should like to know whether the Government would be prepared to take any part in such a conflict. Years ago, before World War II , J stated in this chamber that if Australia became involved in another world war, the area in which our troops would fight would extend from Capetown to Cairo, from Cairo to Hongkong, and from. Hongkong to New Zealand. Subsequent events proved that my prophecy was not very wide of the mark. Should war come again, the theatres of the conflict will range from the Behring 'Straits to Archangel, provided, of course, that Australia, as one member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or whatever longwinded term We use to describe what was formerly called British Empire, is prepared to . take any part in such a conflict and accept any of its responsibilities as one of the white powers of the world. The Parliament has not been told whether the Government believes that it has any responsibilities in regard to overseas operations. Unless the Government has some definite ideas about the part Australia will play in the provision of expeditionary forces by land, sea and air in such a conflict, then so much of the defence scheme as has been made known to us to date does not mean a thing. There are certain imponderables in regard to Russia. We do not know the degree to which the military situation in Russia has been altered as the result of materials, ideas and man-power which the Russians may have obtained from Germany. We also do not know what effect that may have on, say, submarine warfare, but we do know that in present circumstances and as far ahead as I can see, Australia itself is not liable to sustain any effective external attack by Russia. The only thing which we have to fear is the effects of the Russian fifth column inside our own borders, and the Government shows a distinct reluctance to deal with it. The Minister for Defence (Mr. Dedman) said to-night that the Government had enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy 1,000 ratings of the Royal Navy, of whom 400 were to come to Australia in HMAS. Kanimbla. This is a departure from previous Australian naval policy. At all times, some officers and ratings of the Royal Navy have been attached to the Royal Australia Navy, but this new departure makes me wonder whether the Australian Government is held in such low esteem by our young men that they are not prepared to answer the call for recruits for the Navy. We know how difficult it is for the Minister for the Army to get the necessary number of recruits to raise the Army to its planned strength, but when the Government has to admit that it has to obtain large numbers of men from the Royal Navy to make up the requisite numbers for the Royal Australian Navy, I am entitled to inquire whether we are following in the footsteps of ancient Rome, which ultimately had to fill its legions with foreign troops. we expect that, in the not far distant future, the Minister for Defence or the Minister for the Army will tell us that it is necessary to send overseas in order to obtain the necessary recruits to fill the ranks of the Army, because the voluntary system of recruiting in Australia has failed? If the Government is prepared to adopt this system of recruiting for the Navy, it may have to do so for the Army. These are merely one or two thoughts on the subject of defence to which, doubtless, no effective reply will be given. The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) referred to the subject of production. I am alarmed and distressed to find that three years after the cessation of hostilities, Australia is in a deplorable economic state. The Government may put into operation its free medicine scheme, and the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway) may scatter unwanted employment agencies all over the Commonwealth, but our economic condition remains deplorable. One of those employ[291 ment agencies was established in the little town in which I live. All I can say is, God help us if there are any more of those perfectly useless institutions! I . went into the local office to secure employment for a young fellow, and I was amazed at the dreadful way in which that and similar offices are conducted. I have spent a lifetime in the bush or on the land, and my own experience has been that the first person one should go to when endeavouring to place a man in employment is the local auctioneer, and, the next, the local policeman. They constitute the two best employment agencies of which I know. Furthermore, their services are freely given.",70
173,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHICH,"An auctioneer would not find a man employment, or place him in a job for nothing.",72
174,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHICH,"An auctioneer would not charge for such services. Compared with an auctioneer, the local policeman, Ministers and employment agencies would not be in the race. To-day, employment agencies are scattered all over the Commonwealth. It is of no use for the Government to talk about our wonderful prosperity. It is merely May a paper prosperity. The Minister for Labour and National Service referred to the increase of the savings bank deposits during the last few years. Those deposits exist only because the people who own the money cannot exchange it for the goods they want. Those goods are not available, or if they are available, they are too expensive, or can be obtained only on the black-market, upon which many people will not operate. We know that black marketing goes on in many places. We cannot overcome the menace and ensure a proper standard of living for our people until a sufficiency of goods and services is produced to meet all demands. That is an aspect with which the Government does not appear to busy itself. There is a shortage of bricks and timber, notwithstanding statements by some of the Minister's friends. There are shortages of iron, tiles and cement. Some honourable members have declared that there is cement to burn, All I can say is that cement cannot be bought in any quantity in South Australia notwithstanding that it is controlled. It is only possible to procure a bag or two at a time. There are shortages of wire and piping. Only lately has it been possible to obtain gates. There is also a shortage of wire netting. British and American firms are offering to send us wire made of aluminium and other materials, at all sorts of fantastic prices. Despite talk by the Government of full employment, there is practically "" empty "" production. The output of steel is only up to about 60 per cent, of the pre-war volume, and the requirements of the community are not being met. The record of the Government is an absolutely deplorable one. Ministers have shown no signs of comprehending the needs of the community. If ever there was a time when the people should be up and praying, it is now. They should all pray for delivery from wickedness and sneers of this Government. Progress reported. TUBERCULOSIS BILL 1948.

175,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,On the 16th Septempreber the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Falkinder) asked me when it is expected that the campaign war-time medals for the 1939-45 war would be distributed to ex-servicemen. I am advised that arrangements have now been made for the distribution of campaign stars to Australian ex-service personnel of the 1939-45 war to commence during the first week in October this year. SEABCH FOB OIL .,73
176,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,"On the 9th September the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Duthie) asked me questions concerning the search for oil in Australia. The Minister for Supply and Development Regu- has informed me that several large companies are searching for petroleum: Australasian Petroleum Company Proprietary Limited and Island Exploration Company Proprietary Limited in Papua and New Guinea; Shell (Queensland) Development Proprietary Limited in Queensland; Australian Mining and Nos. Smelting Company Limited in. Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Another large company comprising American and Australian interests is about to commence prospecting in Western Australia. Smaller companies include Freney Kimberley Oil Company (1932) No Liability in Western Australia; Roma Blocks Oil No Liability and associated companies in Queensland; and Lakes Oil Limited in Victoria; while Enterprise Exploration Company Proprietary Limited is searching for natural gas in South Australia and New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government is assisting the search for oil by making geological and geophysical surveys; by equipping the geophysical parties with the most modern instruments and equipment; by supplying drilling plant at a low rental; by introducing legislation favourable to prospecting operations in the territories, and by sponsoring the importation of prospecting and drilling equipment by companies engaged in the search for petroleum. Geological surveys are in progress in the Kimberley district of Western Australia and geophysical surveys in the Roma district of Queensland. COMMUNISM.",73
177,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,"On the 7th September the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) asked me questions concerning the reported operations of Catalina flying boats in the vicinity of Malaya. As promised the honourable member in my oral reply on that date I asked the Minister for Civil Aviation to look into the matter and he has now informed me as follows:One Catalina flying boat owned by R. R. Cobbley was given permit for export for sale. No other Catalina aircraft on the Australian register of civil aircraft has, so f ar as the Department of Civil Aviation is aware, been operating in the area referred to nor in any other area outside Australia. The Catalina aircraft purchased by Asian Airlines are still in Australia. Close attention is being given to matters which affect security and as necessity requires special instructions will be given. WOOL: GIFT TO POLAND.",74
178,Mr LANG,WHICH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will the Prime Minister say whether agreement was signed at Lake Success on the 3rd June last, by John D. L . Hood, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, and D. Julius Katz-Suchy, on behalf of Poland, under which Australia is to make a free g if t to Poland of 800,000 dollars worth of wool? 2. Has the Australian Government agreed to supply the wool without charge and, m addition, to pay the costs of procurement, storage, insurance, transportation and shipment to the port of entry into Poland? 3. Is the Government aware of the concern felt in the United States of America, as reported in the New York Times of the 4th June last, that this wool might find its way into Soviet hands for militar y purposes, despite any agreement to the contrary? 4. Has the attention of the Government been directed to the fact that Czechoslovakia and Poland, which hitherto were not wool buyers, have been co-operating with the Soviet as big wool buyers on both the Australian and Texas markets? 5. Have agreements yet been concluded for free gifts of Australian wool to Hungary. Italy and Yugoslavia? 6. Is the statement in the New York Times that no precautions are mentioned in the Polish agreement to ensure that the free wool is not used for uniforms and other military purposes in accordance with fact?",74
179,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. An agreement was signed in New York, on the 3rd June, 1948, by Mr J. D. L. Hood, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Mr Julius Katz-Suchy, on behalf of Poland, for the supply without charge to the Government of Poland of Australian wool to the value of £A.250,000. The Government of Australia also agreed to pay in relation to this wool the cost of procurement, storage, transportation and shipping to the port of entry into Poland. 3. The Australian Government is aware that concern may have been felt in certain quarters that this wool might not be used for the purpose for which it was intended. The Government of Poland has agreed, however, that the wool would not be used for the maintenance of armed forces or any other military or similar purpose and there is no evidence 'to suggest that the wool will be used in a manner contrary to the agreement. 4. The Government did receive a report that Poland and Czechoslovakia were buying wool for Russia. This report was investigated by the Australian Wool Realization Commission and the opinion expressed to the commission was as follows: The requirements of wool for Poland and Czechoslovakia have not been fully met by imports during the past year, and it is most unlikely that any wool shipped to these countries has found its way to Russia. Czechoslovakia and Poland have always been an solid wool buyers from this country. To bear this point out, the following figures show the total weight of wool shipped to the above mentioned countries, for a period prior to World War II . and also for the two years after the war:1080-87. 1937-38. 1938-39. 11). lb. lb. 18,265,061 23,983,027 7,960,052 13,109,479 18,528,843 7,443,595 5. Agreements have been concluded in Loudon on the 20th June with the Hungarian Government-£150,000 , and on the 5th July with Italy-£250,000 , for the provision of Australian wool. An agreement with Yugoslavia for the provision of £150,000 worth of wool was concluded in Australia on the 0th July. Agreements have also been concluded with Greece on the 1st July and with Austria on the ]9th July, for the provision of £150,000 worth of wool to Austria and £150,000 worth of other goods to Greece. These countries were selected upon the advice of a special technical committee, established General Assembly for the purposes of ascertaining the minimum requirements of countries which the committee ""believes might require assistance in the prevention of suffering or of economic retrogression"". result of full and thorough investigations, this committee recommended that Austria, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and Italy should be given highest priority in any schemes for post-TJnrra relief. Australia has been acting in accordance with this decision. 0. The following clauses were inserted in the agreement with Poland:Such wool will not be used for the maintenance of armed forces or any other military or similar purposes. The wool provided in accordance with this agreement is given and will be used for relief needs in accordance with the principle reaffirmed in Assembly Resolution 48 (1 ) . (Resolution 48 (1) recognized that certain countries needed finan-' cial assistance to provide for imports of ' food aud other basic essentials of life.) ITALIAN COLONIES.",74
180,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,"On the 16th September the honourable member for ""Wentworth (Mr H a r r is o n ) asked a question regarding a c o m m u n i c at i o n sent to the Council of F o r e i g n Minister s by the Australian High Commissioner in L o n d o n concerning It a l i a n colonies. I have looked in to the matter and desire to in for m the honourable member as f o l l o w s : In sending a telegram to the Council of Foreign Ministers requesting that a report of the Ministers' Deputies should be transmitted to a ll interested governments and that the Australian Government should be given the opportunity to present its views direct to the council, Mr Beasley was acting on the instructions of the Minister for External 1940-47. 1947-48. Affairs. The procedure adopted in send initios communication was the same as on prelb. lb. vious occasions when the Government has comCZECHOSLOVAKIA. municated with the Council of Foreign Ministers or the Deputies on the question of the 4,027,264 4,030,00(1 Ttalian colonies. These previous communications have also been sent by Mr Beasley on POLAND. the authorization of the Minister for External 1,530,992 5,244,100 Affairs. The Australian Government has received no formal reply to this communication to the Council of Foreign Ministers. It is understood, however, that no interested governments other than the four major powers were given the opportunity of presenting their views to the Council of Foreign Ministers. The views of the Australian Government, however, were presented to the Deputies of the Foreign Ministers during the meeting which preceded the Paris session of the Council of Foreign Ministers. In authorizing the sending of this telegram the Minister for External Affairs has followed the consistent policy of ensuring that our views on questions on which by the we have earned the right to speak are given full consideration. Australian forces made an important contribution to the allied victory in North Africa and it is only right that full weight should be given to AusAs a tralia's views on the former Italian colonies in this area. Since the Council of Foreign Ministers has not reached an agreed solution the whole question will come before the General Assembly for a recommendation. FARM MACHINERY.",75
181,Mr HAMILTON,WHICH,"the Minister representing the Minister for T r a d e and Customs, upon notice I. Has any farm machinery been exported from Australia since 1st July, 1947? 2. If so, what types have been exported, what is their value, and to what destinations were they exported?  T r a d e and Customs has supplied the following in for m at i o n :1. Yes. 2.

183,Mr HARRISON,WHICH,"I am in receipt of information which is causing me some concern. If it be true, it reveals a sorry state of affairs; but if it be not true, the Prime Minister should be given an opportunity to refute it. Therefore, I ask the right honourable gentleman whether it is a fact that the names and addresses of applicants for permits for motor vehicles are passed on to the Commonwealth Bank by the Commonwealth authority controlling the issue of such permits? Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Bank is using this information to increase its car finance business? Is there any truth in the suggestion that the names of those who seek to purchase cars are also being sent by this Commonwealth authority to £ the Taxation Branch in order to 32,008 enable its officers to make a check 2,01!) on the purchaser's method of payment 122,92.'! for a vehicle? Is it a fact that a list of 19,000 names has been passed on by the 3,(iSS permit authority to the Commonwealth 33,798 Bank? If so, does not the Prime Minister consider that this practice is in violation of the conditions applicable to the furnishing of confidential information, and is entirely unjustified?",76
184,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,The Minister for Transport will answer the question.,76
185,Mr WARD,WHICH,"I have read the press report to which the Acting Leader of the Opposition has doubtless referred. 270,395 That report is only partly true. There is no discrimination in favour of the Commonwealth Bank. Every motor distributing house has its own finance section and arranges its own group insurances, and the lists that were made available to the Commonwealth Bank were made available also to the State Chambers of Automotive Industries. They were all on an equal footing. What the complaint really amounts to is that prior to the Commonwealth Bank becoming interested in this form of business the finance corporations of the various motor distributors were charging 10 per cent, interest on advances in J. J. respect of second-hand cars and 8 per cent, interest on advances in respect of new cars. Since the Commonwealth Bank has come into the business, they have reduced their rates to 8 per cent, on advances in respect of second-hand cars and 6 per cent, on those in respect of new cars. But those interest charges are still much less favourable than the rates made available by the Commonwealth Bank itself, which charges a flat rate of interest of 4 per cent, on advances in respect of both new and second-hand cars. The bank also advances up to two-thirds of the amount required and extends the repayment over a period of three years. The bank's terms have become widely known to the people, and it is now writing up new business to the value of £700,000 each month. In order to show how favourably the scheme has been received by the public, I point out that I have been advised that even Liberal and Australian Country party members of this House bave taken advantage of the terms offered. HOUSING.",76
186,Mr LANG,WHICH,"Has the attention of the Minister for Works and Housing been three directed to the plight of 88 families, which are being evicted from HarBureau, grave Park, near Liverpool, New was South Wales, and that emergency United accommodation for them is inadeCommunist quate? Will he consider giving the families priority in the matter of accomhas modation ? Will the Government provide for these Australians hostels affording accommodation equal to that provided Batburst for newly-arrived immigrants?",77
187,Mr LEMMON,WHICH,"The provision of accommodation for persons in the situamann tion described by the honourable member is the responsibility of the State Governits ment. In the past, the attitude of the State authorities has always been genAustralian erous and sympathetic, but, in the present ciples instance, certain persons, influenced by Communists, have defied the Government, and have refused to pay any of the rent due by them. Because of their defiance, the State Government has taken action, which I fully support. It is strange the honourable member for Reid, who always attacking the Communists, should now take the part of persons whose ance of the authorities has been inspired by Communists. BISHOP E. H . BURGMANN.",77
188,Mr BLAIN,WHICH,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question, and, by way of preface, I point out that I shall derive no pleasure from doing so. However, these are crucial times, and, bearing in mind the fact that so many men fought and died in defence of democracy, I impelled to take this action. Can the Prime Minister say-1 . Whether Bishop Burgmann, who has been appointed an viser to the Australian delegation to General Assembly of the United Nations in Paris, is the same Bishop Burgmann whose association with Communist bodies throughout the war was notorious? Is he the same man whose internment I said, when speaking in this House in 1941, might be necessary in view of his encouragement of the Communists anti-recruiting campaign? 2. Is he the same Bishop Burgmann whose name appears in the official list of officers of the AustralianRussian Society for 1948, as one of the patrons of the society, the other two being Ilya Ehrenburg, an official head of the Soviet Union Foreign Propaganda and Dr Hewlett Johnson, who recently banned from entry into the States of America because of his associations? 3. In view of the fact that the Anglo-Russian Society recently been declared by the executive of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labour party to be a at Communist body, with which Labour party members must not associate, will he inform the House whether Dr Burghas resigned his office in the Australian Russian Society, and repudiated doctrines? 4. If not, how does he reconcile jthe bishop's appointment as an official adviser to the Australian delegation, with the alleged prinof the Government, and the ruling of the Australian Labour party?",77
189,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,"I know nothing of the subject about which the honourable that member has asked so many questions, is but I do know that Bishop Burgmann is a very distinguished prelate of the Church defiof England, and a very distinguished scholar. My own impression is that he is held in high esteem by the people of Australia, both as an ecclesiastic and as a scholar. The honourable member can address his other questions to other sources. SUPERANNUATION.",77
190,Mrs BLACKBURN,WHICH,"My question relates to such men, and women if there am were any, as were called back to the Public Service during World War II . , although they had passed the age of retireadment. They did not seek re-employment the with the Commonwealth, but were informed that their services were needed owing to the war-time state of emergency. I have been told that, in some instances, at least a part of the pensions rightly owing to those persons under the terms of the Superannuation Act was withheld. I ask the Prime Minister whether that information is correct. Should not steps be taken to ensure that every retired public servant who was required to return for service in Commonwealth departments shall receive the full amount of the pension due to him at the date of his retirement according to the terms of the Superannuation Act and irrespective of the salary paid to him for his extra service? If the act does not clearly define the tion of persons recalled to work after the retiring age owing to a state of emergency, will the Prime Minister arrange to have it amended?",77
191,Mr CHIFLEY,WHICH,"The question refers to certain retired public servants who were brought back to do special classes of work during the war. The rule in the Public Service has always been that, in such circumstances, the superannuation which would normally be payable shall be reduced to the amount actually contributed by the officer to the superannuation fund-usuall y about 50 per cent. The portion of the pension normally provided by the Commonwealth, through the Superannuation Board, is not paid during such period of re-employment. That principle has been upheld by all governments. If effect were given to the honourable member's suggestion, any re-employed person in the Public Service would receive not only a full salary, but also a full superannuation payment, probably half of which would be provided by the Commonwealth. Proposals of that nature have been rejected by all governments. There have been many representations on this matter, but there is no likelihood of any change being made at present. In some instances, a great deal more tban 50 per cent, of the superannuation payments made to retired officers is contributed by the Commonwealth. This is the result of the comparatively recent inauguration of the superannuation scheme. Some retired officers draw more than 70 per cent, of their superannuation payments from. Consolidated Revenue. Of course this will not happen in later years, as the age groups have changed over the period since the inauguration of the scheme. In the light of the circumstances which I have outlined, it would not be reasonable to expect the Government to pay a re-employed officer a full salary as well as a large proportion of his superannuation payment. RATIONING.",78
192,Mr DUTHIE,WHICH,"I ask the Minister for the Interior to inform me whether the Government has yet decided on the method of distributing the new ration books? If it has, will be inform me posiwhether the distribution will be made through post offices or through electoral offices? If the Minister has decided to utilize the electoral offices, will the newration books be issued at polling booths? I seek this information because several of my constituents have written to me on the subject?",78
193,Mr JOHNSON,WHICH,"At the moment, no final decision has been made, but the matter has been the subject of discussion between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Trade and Customs. It is expected that a decision will be arrived at early next week, and it will then be communicated to the honourable member. NA SERVICES.",78
194,Mr DAVIDSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I desire t ask the 0 Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel a question relating to the shipping service to the port of Gladstone. Previously, representations were made for the establishment of a reasonable service to that port, and it was considered some time ago that arrangements had been made to provide at least one ship a month for that purpose. I am now informed that no steamer has serviced Gladstone since May, and that in the intervening period, there have been at least four services to similar ports on the coast of Queensland. At present, Delamere, which is a government-owned vessel under charter to the John Burke Line of Steamers, is loading in Sydney, and should leave within a fortnight for Brisbane and Rockhampton. There are about 300 tons of cargo available in Sydney for shipment to Gladstone. Will the Minister immediately make every possible effort to influence those in control of Delamere to include a call at Gladstone in the next trip? The Gladstone area has been sadly neglected in respect in the 'past, and deserves the service for which I have asked.",78
195,Mr DEDMAN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If Delamere is under charter to the John Burke Line of Steamers, it will be rather difficult for the Government to step in and instruct the firm to include Gladstone in the ship's itinerary.",79
196,Mr DAVIDSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The Government could make some representations to the John Burke Line of Steamers about the matter.,79
197,Mr DEDMAN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Whils t the Government owns sbips which are engaged in the interstate trade, private enterprise also has a responsibility to ensure that shipping is made available to meet the needs of ports like Gladstone. However, I shall ask the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to examine the honourable member's representations. If the Minister can do anything to ensure that.the 300 tons of cargo in Sydney is taken to Gladstone, I am certain that he will do BO. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. TELEPHONE SERVICES-JUNIO R POSTAL OFFICIALS.",79
198,Mr SHEEHAN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General in a position to inform me how many applications for telephone installations are outstanding? When may the applicants expect a service, and what is the loss of revenue per annum to the Postmaster General's Department as a result of its inability to provide telephones?",79
199,Mr CALWELL,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"At this stage, I am not able to supply to the honourable member all the information that he has sought, but the position today is better than it was a month ago or twelve months ago. It is improving every day, and the improvement will be accelerated when the Postmaster-General's Department is able to obtain more man-power and materials. The publicity section of the Postmaster-General's Department does effective work in supplying to honourable members from time to time information similar to that which the honourable member for Cook has sought. Periodically, this the department publishes the number of applications outstanding, the number of telephones installed in the preceding month, or two months, and the total of telephones in operation. I shall obtain the additional information for which the honourable member has asked , and supply it to him. I ask honourable members to take notice of the facts and figures that are given to them by the Postmaster General's Department. If they do so, it will save a lot of time that ie now taken up by answering questions on the matter in the House.",79
200,Mr TURNBULL,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General whether the rates of pay for junior postal officials are far inferior to those received by juniors in other positions? Does he know that a survey of the conditions of junior postal officers, conducted in Victoria recently, showed that 95 per cent, were being subsidized by their parents and 90 per cent, intended leaving their jobs unless conditions and wages were improved? Does he favour the following improvements, and will be endeavour to have tbem made:-Adul t salaries at eighteen years; full cost of living adjustments on salaries earned by individuals aged under eighteen years; and an increase of all "" away-f rom home "" salaries to £208 per annum?",79
201,Mr CHIFLEY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"A similar question was asked last week by the honourable member for Bourke, and I replied to it at some length. The position, as I explained it then, is that the particular division which covers the employees to whom the honourable member for Wimmera has also referred, has been the subject of representations from their union. Consultations have also taken place between myself, as ministerial head of the Public Service Board and the chairman of the board. I understand that discussions are now proceeding, or are about to proceed between the union concerned and the Public Service Board, and, as I indicated last week, I am anticipating that the board will make an early decision on the matter, though I am unable to say whether that decision will be entirely satisfactory to the organization concerned. WAR PENSIONS.",79
202,Mr GUXLETT,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"My question to the Prime Minister is prompted by the recent announcement that the Government is sidering submitting to the Parliament proposal that pensions shall be paid to pensions ex-members of the Parliament. Before the House is asked to consider that prowill posal, will the right honourable gentleman appoint a committee to consider the of ex-servicemen? whole basis of payments to war widows, totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, and blinded ex-servicemen?",80
203,Mr CHIFLEY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"All that has occurred in relation to the provision of retiring allowances for members of the Parliais ment is that the Parliamentary Labour party has approved of the principle and has referred to Cabinet the task of preparabout ing a report and making an appropriate recommendation. The general principles of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act were formulated by a joint parliaplemented mentary committee, of which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was chairshall man and on which several honourable memmatter bers opposite served very efficiently.",80
204,Mr GULLETT,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That was five years ago.,80
205,Mr CHIFLEY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I agree that the increase or otherwise of the payments which are made under the act are questions which have been determined by the Government since then, but the general principles of the act were decided by the committee to which I have referred. It is not likely that at this stage the Government will agree to the setting up of another joint parliamentary committee to consider payments. However, the honourable gentleman's ' question will receive consideration.",80
206,Mr WHITE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I preface my question by stating that, although the Prime .\iinister and Treasurer said in the course of his recent budget speech that pensions, including war pensions, would be increased by approximately 10 per cent., apparently it is intended to increase by only 5s. a week the pensions payable to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, who' are physically incapable of supplementing their pension by earning money. Such an increase - would represent an effective in[30] crease to them of only 5 per cent. Will the Prime Minister examine the legislation which the Government proposes conto introduce so as to ensure that a the proportionate increase of the payable to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen be at least equal to that made to the pensions of civilians and other classes",80
207,Mr CHIFLEY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"In the budget speech which I delivered some reference was made to an increase of pensions by approximately 10 per cent., and I believe that the Minister for Repatriation, who more conversant with the details of the proposed increases tban I am, has placed before the House full information the increases. Whilst, generally speaking, the proposals which are incorporated in the budget, which is now before honourable members, will be imin their present form in the legislation which has been introduced, I ask my colleague to re-examine the in order to ensure that there are no extraordinary anomalies. ROAD-MAKING MACHINERY.",80
208,Mr ADERMANN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Loca l authorities in the country districts of Queensland are desperately short of road-graders. Will the Minister for Works and Housing review the present policy with regard to the granting of import licences for engines to be used in road-graders of the caterpillar type? I am informed that during this year only seven of these engines will be allocated to Queensland. I suggest to the Minister,80
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Is the honourable member making a speech or asking a question?,80
210,Mr ADERMANN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am trying to explain the matter clearly so that the Minister will understand it. Will the Minister consider granting licences for the importation into Queensland of fourteen or fifteen of these engines instead of seven, so that at least the most deserving cases may be dealt with? Import licences are necessary only for the engine, because the - remainder of the machine is built in Australia.",80
211,Mr LEMMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,In consultation with the Minister for Trade and Customs. I shall consider the points which have been raised by the honourable member and inan form him of our decision. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.,81
212,Mr BEAZLEY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"On a number of occasions I have received representations coucerning youths who enlist in the Royal Australian Navy at eighteen years of age for twelve years, which means that they are bound to serve until they are 30 years of age. The young men are afraid that when they are discharged they will find their employment opportunities restricted compared with those of members of the civil population. In the absence of the Minister for the Navy, I ask the Minister for Defence whether the Government will consider introducing six-year terms enlistment as well as twelve-year terms? Will the Minister give consideration to expanding opportunities for technical, trade, and professional training for men as an inducement to enlistment without forfeiting future security? the Minister satisfied that the present navy system gives adequate promotional opportunities to the lower deck?",81
213,Mr DEDMAN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It is true that men enlisting in the Navy are required to serve for twelve years. The period of enlistment was given full consideration the Minister for the Navy and Board before a decision was made on it. However, I am quite sure that the Minislows ter and the Department of the Navy be prepared to review the situation to motion ascertain whether anything can be gained by reducing the minimum period of service from twelve to six years. At seat. present there is a wide variety of trades and occupations in which men may attain proficiency during their service in the Navy, but again I assure the honourable member that if the Minister can find method of widening the scope of the technical training of navy personnel place tbem in a better position pete for civilian work upon their discharge, he will be prepared to adopt I shall ask the Minister to consider matters raised by the honourable member, and to supply him with full information on the subject. OBJECTION TO RULING.",81

In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 23rd September (vide page 858), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYTliat the first item in the Estimates under Division No. 1-The Senate-namely , "" Salaries! and allowances, f 12,000"". be agreed to. Upon which Mr HABJRISON had moved, by wfiy of amendment That the first item be reduced by £1, as an instruction to the Government to withdraw and redraft the budget . . . v (vide page 430).",82
229,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"Deakin) [11.7] The debate on the budget affords to honourable members an opportunity to discuss a number of matters which concern them apart from discussion of the general statement of Government policy contained in that document. In any event, the Government's policy, as revealed in the budget, has already been thoroughly examined and, 1 submit, completely discredited by the able analysis of it made by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) in the course of his speech. I propose now to refer to a number of matters which were not mentioned by that right honourable gentleman, but first, I shall make a few general comments on the budget. At the outset let me say that I have never read a document which concerns the vital interests of the nation, which is more unreal than this budget presented by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley). After all, a. budget is supposed to be something in the nature of a show case to display the state of the nation's affairs, and it should furnish an impartial account, of the Government's administration during the preceding twelve months, and some indication of its future policy. During a period of boom conditions the Treasurer has introduced a boom budget. He refers continually to the need for increased production. Of course, it is obvious to every honourable member that unless effective action is taken to increase man-power exertion we cannot expect any increase of production. The budget documents and the speech delivered by the right honourable gentleman savour more of political expediency. than any previous budget of which I have had experience. It is, in every sense, a pre-election year budget. It is impossible to disguise the fact that next year members of the political party opposite will indulge in one of the greatest bribery campaigns ever known in the history of Australian politics. The budget sets out to rjortray certain reductions of taxes. A study of the figures presented by the Treasurer reveals that, except in respect of one or two minor items, the right honourable gentleman expects to obtain greater revenue this year than last year. It is true that he proposes to reduce income tax by approximately £22,000,000; but what has made that reduction possible ? The truth of the matter is that he will save £26,000,000 by the withdrawal of certain subsidies. The consumers who will be most affected by rising costs due to the withdrawal of those subsides are those on the lower incomes. Having saved £26,000,000 in this way the right honourable gentleman magnanimously proposes to reduce taxes by £22,000,000.",82
230,Mr CALWELL,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"-B y £26,000,000.",83
231,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"As far as I ca n see the reduction is to be aproximately £22,000,000 in this financial year. However, assuming the Minister's figure to be correct, all that the Treasurer proposes to give away is what he has already taken away by other means. Thus, there is to be no real reduction of taxes. The Treasurer also proposes to increase the rate of payment in respect of certain. social services; but, strange as it may seem, the only recipients of social service benefits who will not receive the proposed 10 per cent, increase are blinded and totally disabled ex-servicemen. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) asked a very pertinent question on that subject a few minutes ago which deserves a much more complete answer than that given by the Treasurer. These concessions are to be granted only to r&store the purchasing value of the benefits to what it was in the past. If costs are deliberately increased by the withdrawal of sub3idii!S, the whole structure of social service benefits is undermined. All that the Treasurer proposes to do is to endeavour to restore to some degree the purchasing value that has been lost. How is this proposal portrayed in the budget? Approximately £14,000,000 will be required to meet the additional cost of social services; but the Treasurer proposes to balance his budget in this respect by raising a loan of approximately £17,000,000. In other words, additional social service payments are to be met from loan money and, on the face of it, no attempt is made in thif budget to meet expenditure out of revenue. Having regard to the fact that the Treasurer presented a balanced budget last year, and taking into account the surface prosperity in the community, this budget is most unsound. On the surface it appears that, in a period of boom conditions, the Treasurer proposes to resort to the loan market in order to balance his budget; but we all are aware of the actual position. This year the Government will reap the benefit of the record cheques that came to Australia last year from the sale of our surplus wool, wheat and other exportable commodities. These returns will flow into this year's budget. These moneys not only circulate among those personally interested but also throughout the community with the result that in the current year the Treasurer will receivi additional revenue. The budget throughout is a masterpiece of deception. In fact the Treasurer proposes to give away nothing beyond what he will save by the withdrawal of subsidies. In the light of known factshe anticipates a greatly enhanced revenue, which, I have no doubt, will be distributed to all and sundry in an endeavour to buy votes to ensure the Government's return to office at the next general election. There is no national outlook in thi Government. The approach to the budget is- "" How does it affect me ? "". As long as the country is governed along those lines there will not be any real stimulus to production. Only by an increase of production can inflation be. prevented in this country. For some considerable time. I have taken a. keen interest in Australia's production of foodstuffs and, to a lesser degree, gold and base metals. I am personally interested in primary production and there are large gold-producing areas within my electorate. Wool figures are up this year, and we had a record wheat crop, but in nearly all other instances the production of commodities 1 which contribute to the wealth of the nation has fallen. The production, of meat, products has declined, and the decrease of butter production is alarming. According to the last figures published by. the Commonwealth Statistician, dated the 14th September,, 1947, the production of sugar has fallen. Gold, which is one of the greatest "" dollar-spinners "" we could' have, is alarmingly down, as also is silver. Lead is down, and copper production is at a low level. The figures do not indicate a very satisfactory state of affairs in this country. They certainly do not indicate that great prosperity exists, or that the social services provisions in Australia are on. a very secure and permanent basis. If honourable members were to examine the figures relating to most of our other in? dustries also, they would find that production is lower because the output per man-hour is lower.",83
232,Mr CALWELL,TRADE WITH EASTERN,That is not true.,84
233,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"There - is no need for one to go to the coal-mines, or to the wharfs-, or toan art gallery, to see exhibitions of still-life. Evidence of that state of affairs can be seen at the rear of Parliament House, where extensions are in course of erection.",84
234,Mr CALWELL,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"Will the honourable member go out and tell, the workers what he has implied in this chamber?",84
235,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"Yes ; but it is the Minister's job to do. it, not mine.",84
236,Mr CALWELL,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"It would not ""still-life"" for long.",84
237,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"If the Minister would have a look through the window near the job he would gain an idea of what is happening in every avenue of industry in this country. Let me now come to another subject which I shall call "" Whither Australia "". After World War I . there was a great boom in secondary industries in this country. Such conditions obtained until 1922-23 when, to prevent our industries from collapsing, there was a universal cry for protection. Such a cry is again being heard in certain industries today. Nearly all industries in this country were given very substantial protection. Indeed, without it many of the industries established during World War I . would have been forced to close their doors and dispense with their employees. Later, in 1927, the burden of that protection was. estimated at 8 per cent, of the. incomeof our export, industries. Subsequently, export values felL and we experienced what is now known as the great depression. Prices of our primary products overseas collapsed andour secondary industries depended almost entirely upon the domesticmarket. The 1 position was that a ruined agriculture was carrying an 8 per cent, burden of secondary protection. In the recent war, our secondary industries experienced much, the same conditions as they experienced, in World War I . Many new. industries were, established and the developmental process is still going on. Hundreds of thousands more men have gone into secondary industries. However, whilst we have opened up some new markets, for our exports, our secondary industries again find, themselves mainly dependent upon, the small domestic market provided by a population of 7,000,000. Avenues for exports were opened up particularly in countries to the north of Australia, but those markets have been substantially curtailed, if not completely lost, as the result of Communist activities, of which this Government seems to have no idea. I believe that some of those avenues have been closed to us for ever. Therefore, in the main, our secondary industries are again limited to the domestic market. At present, high prices are being realized for wool, wheat he and other products: Ordinary fine comeback wool is fetching £90 a bale, an unprecedented price; whilst wheat is fetching from 18s. to £1 a bushel. I doubt whether those products will again realise such high prices for many years. Our primary industries at present are able to bear the excess costs resulting from world conditions and that are involved in maintaining the existing measure of protection afforded to our secondary industries, simply because overseas prices for primary products are so high. But what will happen when those prices fall ? The price of wool is already on the decline. The United States of America has had' a record wheat crop, and several European countries, following a series of severe 1 droughts, anticipate fairly good harvests this season. Although .there is still a wide and unsatisfied demand for all sorts of foodstuffs, it can confidently be forecast that the price of wheat will fall considerably this year. Undoubtedly, that will vitally affect the basis of Australia's economy, and, therefore, the Government must give serious consideration to that fact. Unfortunately, extraordinary ignorance exists among our metropolitan population of the real basis of our economy. Australia is still essentially a primary producing country; and if the source of our prosperity is suddenly affected by developments adverse to our primary industries, the whole facade of our secondary industries will topple over. We are now beginning to manufacture complete motor cars in this country. We are told that Australia has grown up industrially. The motor car manufacturing industry will provide employment for approximately 9,000 people. One can imagine what will happen to that industry should overseas prices for primary products suddenly fall. In - that event, widespread unemployment would be inevitable, because I recollect that whereas prior to the depression up to 70,000 cars were being sold annually in Australia, that number decreased to only 4,000 annually during the depression. At present, we have flowing into the country thousands of migrants, and a great deal of capital which is coming here because of the fear of a socialized Britain. Industries are stillcalling out for man-power, and new industries are being established throughout the Commonwealth. Yet the fact is that the only market that is availpletely able to our secondary industries is in the main the domestic market. That is the situation we must face. Indeed, it is recognized in a veiled sort of way in the budget which contains just a hint of a warning that everything is not just right in Australia. I believe that the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) will agree with me when I say that, if Australia is to avert a recession, we must increase our population. It is obvious that 7,000,000 people cannot provide an adequate market for the output which our secondary industries are striving to produce. We need to increase our population in order to enlarge the domestic market. I am always prepared to give commendation where it is due, and, in ilr. Hutchinson. passing, I acknowledge the impetus which the Minister is giving to immigration. I do not know whether he views the Australian economy as I do. However, be will admit that we need to increase our population not only to make this country more secure against possible aggression but also to strengthen our economy. Failure to increase our population will imperil not only our economy but also the whole system of social services which the Government is now attempting to establish. I believe that that system already shows signs of weakness. An increase of our population is the answer to all these problems. By that means 1 we can continue to expand our secondary industries and maintain a reasonably high standard of living, particularly if people realise that if they want a bigger loaf, they must themselves provide it. Dealing with immigration on previous occasions I have emphasized the necessity to assimilate non-British migrants in our communities. That can best be done by maintaining an English language press solely and common schools where English is the main language. During the recent war, I asked the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) how many newspapers were published in foreign languages in this country. I sought that information as the result of what I saw in the United States of America when I visited that country about ten years ago. In America, large communities of foreigners, whose total numbers run into millions, have comretained their nationality through the publication of newspapers in their own languages. I said to myself at the time that I hoped I would never see such a state of affairs in Australia. However, the Minister for External Affairs did not reply to my question in the ordinary way. He gave me a confidential reply, and, for that reason, it was not published in Hansard as replies to questions asked upon notice usually are. 1I have not that reply with me at the moment, but I was astounded at the number of foreign language newspapers which .1 was informed were circulating in this country at that time. I have no objection to foreign nationals in this country receiving journals from the countries of their origin; but I emphasize that we Budget 1948-49.

239,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"That is a big step forward, but I should go farther. Let us also see that the children of foreign parents are brought into our schools.

241,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"I was told that they are not so rare, though I do not say that there are thousands of them.

244,Mr HUTCHINSON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"I mentioned ihe matter as an example of what has happened in the past, and which should not he allowed to happen again. Budget 1948-49. 871 I wish to emphasize the importance of increasing our food production in proportion to the increase of population. Last year, I obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician certain figures relating to food production in Australia, because I wished to learn what were the possibilities of increasing production in order to meet the needs of a larger population, and also, if possible, to increase our exports. It is important that we news- should export more food so as to help the people of Great Britain. The figures are rather alarming. For 1945-46, the production of meat in Australia was little more than enough to feed our present population, plus 1,000,000 adults. Many people have the idea that there is a tremendous surplus of primary products, that we could bring in millions of people and still have plenty of food for them. The sooner they get that out of their minds the better, because it is not true. If the population were increased by 1,000,000 adults the consequent diversion of whole milk from butter-making-and , thank. God, we are becoming a milk-drinking people-woul d seriously curtail the production of butter. It is true that 1945-46. the year for which the figures were taken out, followed one of the worse droughts in the history of Australia, but. when making an investigation of this kind, it is not wise to base one's calculations on a year when production was at its highest. For the years after 1946-47. production was somewhat higher, but the position is still unsatisfactory. Even now, we are exporting only 25 per cent, of the meat we produce. In other words, we are consuming approximately 75 per cent, of it. Thus, if the population were to increase by 1,500,000 adults, we should consume practically all the food we produced and exports would diminish almost to vanishing point. We cannot view with equanimity the present situation in regard to butter production. It is necessary that we should increase exports if we are to make provision for the support of a larger population and, at the same time, establish credits overseas. Recently, I obtained some information from the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom about food imports into Great. Britain, before the war. I wished to learn how 872 Budget 1948-49. [EEPRESEI TATIViES.] we could help Britain .by supplying food which that country is at present buying from dollar areas. I learned that, of Britain's total meat imports, only 8 per cent, came from Australia. Empire counthe tries supplied Britain with 13,000,000 ewrt. :of meat, as against 18,000,000 from foreign countries, mostly tbose in the .dollar areas. Obviously, therefore, we anust greatly increase the production of meat if we are to supply Britain the meat it is now buying from the United States of America and Argentina. The predominant concern of any Australian government must be to increase the duction of food, and that will not be We have no great mountain ranges few great rivers. We have a large of good soil, but it is not of much use without water. Let us by all means extralian pand secondary industries and improve transport facilities, but our first concern should be to develop the agricultural resources of the country. That is essenwhere. tial so that we may feed our own populathe tion, help the people of Britain, and improve our economy. What is most needed in Australia todesire day is a change of outlook on the part the people. There is far too much cyniWe cism, especially among young people. This may be in some measure due to the experience of two world wars in so short a time, but cynicism really indicates lack of confidence and self-reliance. a lack is manifest in many quarters day. There is also the frustration that many young people feel when they try to establish themselves in life. in turn, comes back to the question taxation of companies and persons. .It is almost impossible today for young men to .establish a business out of their savings. The truth is that the Treasurer does not leave them enough. situation calls .for spiritual and moral adjustment and a recasting of .our of thinking so as to ^e-establisb our .fidence and self-reliance. .Pressure be maintained :on the Government to sue .a policy that will provide conditions which-will provide'good opportunities in 'life for coming generations. Of course, the policy of a socialist government may - was be .to :keep the people always subservient ber for .«nd to withhold from individuals opporthatlhe Deakin tunities to .save sufficient to enable them tralia and in our Mr Hutchinson. Budget 1948-49. to engage in enterprises of their own. Whether .that be so or not, the fact i* that disillusionment is prevalent throughout the community today, which explains general lack of pride in work and in institutions and the absence of a high cwt. moral code in public life. We must restore these things if Australia is to be worthy of its heritage. Anybody who has visited the United States, of America must with have been impressed by the vigor and spirit of enterprise evident in that country. A similar spirit could well be infused into Australian life. I know prothat there are many extremes of easy. good and bad in America, but there and is power and energy in the American area way of life. Even the trade unions, although.they demand high wages as Ausunionists do, encourage hard work. They know that only by means of increased production can high wages bfmaintained. This vigour is evident everyWorkers in new factories give impression of straining at the leash. "" Let's go "" is the slogan throughout the United States of America, in factories, fields and shops. The motive may be for personal reward, but the resultof ant benefits spread throughout the nation. must recreate the same psychology in Australia and destroy the dangerous idea that an honest day's toil should not be done. We must encourage pride in the a excellence of fine work and, above all, we Such must learn to see ourselves in proper toperspective. Our young country is capable of sustaining a population of .30,000,000 or 40^000,000 on the highest This, standard of living in the world. People of want to come here from other countries - and, unless another .world war intervenes, they will come here. Vast opportunities fcr advancement await those with enterprise and self-reliance. We must teach The the people that the development of our recountry offers great rewards to all who way are prepared to express themselves in conmental and physical activity. The sooner should we adopt the American slogan, ""Let's purgo"", the better will it 'be for all Australians, whether young or old.",86
245,Mr MCLEOD,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"Wannon) [11.44] - ] astounded to bear the honourable mem(Mr Hutchinson) .declare is losing faith in the youthof Ausworking men - In - onebreath, honourable members opposite tell the workers that the Government isovertaxing them, and then, in the next breath, they complain to the Government that the workers will not work. That seems to be the main trend of their speeches in this chamber. They are hard pressed to find any legitimate grounds, for criticism of this budget, because it will give relief to those sections of the population most entitled to relief-in fact, to those persons who, according to the honourable member for Deakin, suffer from frustation. For the last three or four years members of the Opposition have pursued a. policy which, has caused a great deal of discontent in, the community. They have engaged in ""mischievous propaganda, through newspapers and other mediums of publication, in an effort, to convince the people that they are over-taxed by the Government and are "" only working for Chifley"". Unfortunately some people have been gulled and led to believe that it is unprofitable for tbem to work overtime. Time after time. I have beard members of the Opposition tell the workers that they have nothing, to gain by working hard, and then those members turn, around and condemn the workers on account of reduced production. I have great faith in our working men, amongst whom I include, not only labourers, but also those who work in offices, on farms and in industries. ' The achievements of Australian working men in the short history of this nation have been remarkable. A famous architect who recently arrived here from the United States of America bas praised the great cities that we have built up with our population of only about 7,000,000. In particular, he has paid tribute to the men who planned the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Australian tradesmen who built it. In this Parliament the honourable member for Deakin insults Australian workers, but I notice that he lacks the courage to do so elsewhere. I wish that our working men could see him and some of his colleagues when they sleep in. this chamber. I wonder what they would think? Perhaps television would ho a< good thing. The unsatisfactory level of production in Australia is the fault of the Opposition. It has brought about this state of affairs ""by means of unrelenting, mischievous and untrue propaganda^ as I shall prove. For instance, it has completely misrepresented the Government's tax policy. A few examples will serve to support my argument. Consider the case of a single man who earned £371 in 1946-£47. For that year he paid £60 in income tax, leaving a net income of £311. In the following year, if his earnings increased to £423, he was taxed £54, leaving, a net income of £369. The facts disprove the claims that such people have notbenefited from tax remissions. Consider also the case of a married man with, two children - a n average family-earnin g a constant income of £400 a year. In 1944-45, he was taxed £46, leaving a. net income of £354.. That was his net income. In 1945-46, when taxes were still high, he paid £43, and' had a net income of £357. In 1946-47 he paid a tax of £33, and his net income was £367. In 1947-4.8, he paid tax of only £12, leaving him with a net income of £3SS. Therefore, he is better off by £34 per annum compared with 1944-45 and, under this budget, child endowment will be increased by 2s. 6d. to 10s. a week. So the working man will not be convinced when honourable members opposite tell him that he is worse off now than he was in the past. Members of the Opposition complain that high taxes do not provide workers with an incentive to increase production. Given the opportunity, honourable members opposite would again employ the incentives of hunger, and fear of unemployment, as they did during the economic depression of the early 1930's. Hunger and the fear of unemployment are sharp spurs to make workers increase their output. Those spurs were used, not only on workers in secondary industries, but also on primary producers. The harder the-man on the land worked, the more he produced, and the deeper he got into debt. Honourable members opposite favour that kind of economic condition. For instance, the Lyons Government, in its first year of office in 1932, remitted land tax to wealthy companies and landholdersy but at the same time reduced the invalid and old-age pension below the level to which it had been reduced in accordance with the provisions of the Premiers plan and even took a mortgage on the homes of pensioners. If pensioners had children who were in a financial position to contribute to the support of their parents, they were compelled to do so. That was the method of finance which an anti-Labour government adopted less than twenty years ago. Complaints that the economic position of Australia is bad are not supported by the prosperous condition of many companies. The truth was told in the figures on the financial page of the Melbourne Herald last Tuesday. The profit of Sutex Limited was 15 per cent, this year, compared with 12 per cent, last year, and the increased profit of the Hume Pipe Company (Australia) Limited was described as "" spectacular "". A tyre company recorded a net profit of 11$ per cent. Yet we are told that companies are going bankrupt because they are overtaxed. Obviously, they are in a prosperous condition. Honourable members opposite emphasize that employees must have an incentive to increase production. They should study the kind of incentive that the Hume Pipe Company (Australia) Limited has introduced. It has the right idea, and is sincerely desirous of stepping up .production and efficiency. They do not believe that the best incentives are hunger and'fear of unemployment. According to the financial editor of the Melbourne Herald, the output per man-hour of the Hume Pipe Company (Australia) Limited has risen by 25 per cent, compared with the pre-war level. Factory efficiency has improved, and business with the Far East has been revived. Profits have shown a "" most spectacular leap "". After allowing for taxation, the profit soared to £229,629, equalling 14 per cent, on shareholders' funds, compared with a net profit of £60,081 last year. The financial writer of the Melbourne Herald stated that features of the company are a profit-sharing scheme, and employee-management committees in factories. Complaints that production is falling off, and that men will not work, are unjustified. Honourable members opposite prefer the conditions when men stand three deep at the factory gates waiting for employment. The so-called high level of taxation has not killed the Hume Mr MCLeod. Pipe Company (Australia) Limited, or any other companies which are mentioned from time to time on the financial page of the Melbourne Herald.",87
246,Mr RANKIN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,Are the coal-miners giving maximum production?,89
247,Mr MCLEOD,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"If the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) were given the opportunity, he would march the coalminers to work at the point of a bayonet, and stand over them. He has broad acres but a narrow mind. He would force men to work, but that method would not increase production. Of course, Australian industries are dependent on coal. The honourable member for Bendigo has not the brains to think of better incentives than the bayonet or hunger to induce the coal-miners to increase their output. Ill-informed people, who condemn the coal-miners, usually do not know what coal-mining entails, the conditions under which the men work underground and the effect that employment in the industry has on their health. Would the honourable member deny to the sons of miners the right to leave the industry and. settle on the land so that, after a few years, they could sit back at ease as he and I do? We do not meet.any danger in our occupation, and we shall probably live to a ripe old age under healthy conditions. If the honourable member and other people like him worked to improve the conditions of the miners, Australia would have adequate supplies of coal, because the miners would be contented, as the employees of the Hume Pipe Company (Australia) Limited are contented. I propose to read some extracts from an article which was published in the supplement to the Argus on the 28th August last. The author is Mr Rupert Charlett, who describes conditions in the coal mines of Holland. The article readsThe State has taken a hand not only in planning mines for safety, mechanizing them, and providing better working conditions, but in ensuring that there is nothing comparable to the "" black country"" of the English coalfields. The planning extends even to miners' homes, which in most areas are a series of "" garden villages "". That description could not be applied to any of the coal-fields in Australia. The article continuesState intervention in the Dutch coal industry-fou r of the twelve Dutch mines arc Budget 1948-49. [24 SEPTEMBER., 1948.] Suite-owned and produce 58 per cent, of all Holland's coal-date s from 1913. From that time the Dutch Mining Council planned for long-range operations and for the training of specialists to operate its mechanized mines. Machines were introduced where possible not only to speed production, but to reduce exacting manual toil in the confined spaces of the pits. And along with its mechanization plans the council introduced an interesting innovation- a ""school for miners"", which not only trains them to handle the new machines but to become mine managers. It is not merely H technical school, for part of its time is given to general education courses. It has helped to make Dutch coal mines the safest in the world by ensuring that all workers are thoroughly trained in the operation of their machines, and are conversant with safety codes. By raising the men's general educational standards, it has enabled them to have a more intelligent "" say "" in the management of their own industry,, and in particular has given able men every opportunity to graduate to executive positions. And it has had this extra result: While the great coal-mining countries have become desperately sihort of workers, because miners have refused to allow their sons to go into the dirty, exacting and dangerous work of mining coal, the Dutch mines have plenty of "" recruits ""and from miners' families, too. Privatelyowned mines soon adopted the State's innovations. Before youths are permitted to work in the pits they spend four hours a day on practical and theoretical training in a "" model"" mine, so that they can get the -'. feel "" of pit work, and become accustomed to equipment, and the safety codes and signal!:. Most boys do not work underground until they have attended the school for three years. They spend half of each school day in the "" model "" mine and workshops, the other half of the day being devoted to general education. Nothing is overlooked in training tomorrow's miners. They even take a special course of gymnastics so that they will be agile in low and confined spaces. Before they »,re allowed to work underground they must pass a strict medical test. They work under the care of "" mine fathers"" until they gain ""' pit sense"". Their first jobs are as "" wheelers"", but this is a misnomer, as all skips and pit ponies long ago gave way to conveyor belts, chutes and underground trains in Dutch mines.' After two years the recruit may become an assistant hewer, and at 23 he - nay enter for the examination of hewer. Once he passes this examination he may enrol for a four-year course for mine manager. For the first two j'ears he must study after work, but in the second two he works only half shifts, spending the remainder of the shifts at school. All this time he receives f u l Dutch coal mines have the lowest accident rate in the world, due not only to intelligent planning of the mines themselves, and to the specialized training of the miners, but to the extra supervision-twelv e inspectors for every 32,000 miners, compared to ten for every 80,000 men in British coal mines. In addition, Budget 1948-49. 875 mine manage incuts retain five additional inspectors, appointed by the miners themselves, who are paid by the managements. Tliey protect underground workers not only from accidents, but from the "" d u s t "" menace-^-the cause of dreaded coal mine explosions and ol silicosis. Despite the virtual non-existence of this disease, all underground workers are given an X-ray examination every three years. The "" clean "" record of Dutch mines applies to accidents as well as industrial disputes, as the following international figures indicate:FATAL ACCIUEJTT RATE FOB EACH 1,000 MINERS. Netherlands .. 0.51 France 0.75 England 1.02 Australia .. 1.07 Belgium .. 1.21 Germany .. . . 1.50 Only Poland (where coal seams are thick and accessible) exceeds the production a man of Dutch mines, despite the comparatively thin and undulating coal seams in Holland. Dutch authorities claim two reasons for their fine record: Contented,. well-trained workers, and clean, safe, mechanized mines. Australians, who lose n\ore than £10 million a year in industrial production because of coal shortages, may be heartened by the fact that one country has been able to demonstrate that coal can be produced without continual, ruinous, industrial strife. Some Australians may even see a similarity between the constitution of the Dutch Mining Council aud the Australian Joint Coal Board, and hope for similar success here. It would be much more helpful if honourable members opposite, instead of continually condemning the Australian miners, were to apply what little intelligence they have to urging that conditions in our mines should be raised to the same level as those in the Dutch mines. If they were, probably men and boys would be waiting to go into the mines of this country. The Labour party is endeavouring to bring that about, but honourable members opposite think longingly of the time when men were driven by hunger to accept any conditions that were offered to them. Those days, however, have passed, and the sooner it is realized by the Opposition the better it will be. The conditions which obtained then bred communism. In this debate, as in the debate on the l wages. Address-in-Reply, honourable members opposite have confined their remarks almost exclusively to the subject of communism. They bave accused all members on this side of the chamber, and even the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), of being Communists. The Communist party, the Liberal party and the Australian Country party bave much in common. Politically they are closely related to one another; each of them desires this Government to be defeated. Honourable members opposite bave not the courage to say that they are opposed to social security and are not in favour of the imposition of a high :rate of tax on the higher income group to finance it. They know that the only way in which they can hope to defeat this Government at the next general elections is to persuade the workers to vote for them, and therefore they cannot say that they do not believe in good conditions or social security. The Communist party realizes that the improvement of the conditions of the people - which is being brought about by the Labour party will kill communism in Australia. Communism gained its present hold upon other countries because of the shocking conditions which existed in them for generations. The Communist party and the Opposition parties ""have different reasons for desiring the defeat of this Government. The Communists would welcome the bad conditions which would soon be created if this Government were defeated at the next general elections and the Opposition parties formed the Government of Australia. Expenditure on social services would be curtailed and the standard of 'living of the people would be reduced. The Opposition has no prospect of success at the next elections if the campaign is fought on the Government's administrative record. The only way in which it could win would be by creating great industrial strife before then, and I bave no hesitation in saying that if the Communist party required a few thousand pounds to create that strife, the money would readily be made available to it by the Opposition parties. If this Government were defeated, the Communists would be more pleased than the members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party would be, because it wotild mean that the day of the Communists 'had nearly arrived. would 'be a return to the old shocking conditions. The honourable member for Deakin said that there was a lack of incentive and that 'the young people were suffering from a sense of frustration. Mr MCLeod. What the honourable member probably has in mind is that'workers' children now have an opportunity to go to the universities and that he does not want them to compete with his children. He wants to see - youths begging for a. job or .for food, as they did in the depression years. At that time the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) had plenty of cheap labour. Any amount of cheap labour was available in those days, but the country was dying. Honourable members opposite do not realise that if those conditions ever return, the Communists will step in. I warn the people that the defeat of this Government would be the greatest possible encouragement that the Communist party could be given. It was said that the Prime Minister does not believe in savings being accumulated by the people. The Statistician's figures show that in 1939-40 savings bank deposits totalled £244,000,000 and that the present total is £682,000,000. Do tbose figures show that the Prime Minister does not believe in savings? How many farmers have paid off their mortgages? The Labour party believes in ownership. Honourable members opposite call us socialists, but what is wrong with socialism if it permits a man to pay off 'his mortgage? The Opposition wants the farmers again to be in the hands of the bankers. Private banks now charge 8 per cent, or 10 per cent, interest on money advanced to farmers to purchase cars, but the Commonwealth Bankcharges only 4 per cent. Tbat is socialism. The Opposition does not believe in it, nor do the bankers. The Labour party, by creating conditions whereby the people can accumulate savings, pay off their mortgages on their farms and own their own homes, is en : suring that the workers will not again be driven by hunger to accept whatever conditions may be offered. The standard of living of every section of the community has increased. That is true even of the business men, because outThere put and profits have increased. What is wrong with that? As to taxation, in 1939 a married man with a wife and two children, earning £300 a year, paid £4 a year income tax in New South Wales, and £3 16s. a year in Victoria. He received no child endowment payments. Now he pays no tax. Business men returning to this country from overseas agree that Australia's economy today is sounder than that of any other nation; but the Labour Government looks ahead. It realized some time ago that if the economic stability of this country was to be safeguarded, additional constitutional power for the Commonwealth Parliament was necessary. A referendum was held on the .continuance by the Commonwealth of the control of prices and rents. The referendum was defeated as the result of the propaganda poured out by the Opposition parties in this Parliament and their supporters; but they overstepped the mark on that occasion, and they may soon find that they have pulled Australia's ecoriomy down around their own heads. The proposal placed before the people was that the new powers should be conferred upon this Parliament, the elected representatives of the peoplenot the legislative councils of the States which are controlled by the privileged few and elected on a franchise which gives a vote to only one person in every three. Typical of the members of these institutions is Sir Frank Clarke, a banker who is concerned mainly with profit-making. Unfortunately, the people of this country were grossly misled by the propaganda of the Opposition parties, who claimed that price control could be administered adequately by the States. We told the people the truth. We had nothing to hide. We put to tbem the simple question, ""Do you want this proa contracting-out form, which has to be the Opposition parties was- "" The State Government, can and will protect you from prices or rent exploitation"". To the working man rents are fundamental. He must have shelter. Tmmediately the - referendum, was defeated, Labour's opponents changed their time somewhat and began to warn the people against, price rises. Now they argue that costs are increasing because the Commonwealth has ceased to pay subsidies. That is not correct. The Commonwealth is still subsidizing tea, butter and superphosphates because it has some control over those commodities; but it has no control over textiles and we emphasized that in our referendum campaign. How can anybody'reasonably expect the Commonwealth to continue to pay subsidies on materials used in the manufacture of .goods, the price of which is beyond its control? Would any honourable member opposite give me a blank cheque to use as I pleased? Of course he would not, and that is the crux of our argument on subsidies. In any event, the withdrawal of subsidies will make little difference to the prices of manufactured articles; but manufacturers are seeking increases of as much as 50 per cent. I doubt whether the withdrawal of the subsidy on wool will increase the cost of a suit of clothes by £1, but I have no doubt that the price will be increased by £5 or £6. It is an "" open go "" for the profiteers. They can ask what they like. Can the States administer price controls adequately? 1 believe that they cannot with the small staffs that they employ. Business people will ask for their goods as much as they believe the people will be prepared to pay for tbem. The Opposition must take the blame for that state of affairs. Every member of the Opposition is guilty of misleading the people, and the people will not easily forgive or forfret. The result of the prices referendum was a tragedy. With a. continuance of Commonwealth control, price rises would have been infinitesimal, and subsidies would have been continued. Given the opportunity, a man will always exploit his fellows. Tbat is human nature. Otherwise, thpre would .not be any need for a police force. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached that ideal state of society. With goods in sbort supply, purchasers will be forced to pay whatever prices are asked for essential commodities. Bents will go up. That is how the workers will be exploited. The guilt lies entirely with the Opposition. The referendum issues were .not political, but the Opposition parties made them so. They should have been frank in their statements to the people. They thought that the - defeat of the referendum would lower the prestige of the Labour party. .But we can always face the people, because : we have told them the truth. In spite of all the propaganda of the Opposition - parties and their unlimited funds, the truth will always prevail. This budget is one of the best brought down in this House since I have been a member of it. It gives relief from taxes to those who need it most, the family men. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin on immigration, and I pay a tribute to the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) who has applied his dynamic personality to a most difficult task. He has been able ro get the ships. Honourable members opposite laughed when he said that he would bring 70,000 migrants to this country each year, but he is doing it. The migrants are of splendid types and will be a great asset to this country. The Minister is a reasonable man, and I know that he will gi%e the fullest consideration to r the suggestion that I am about to make. One of Australia's main primary products is wool, and there is wide scope for the expansion of the textile industry in this country. To that end, we should endeavour to bring here trained textile operatives from overseas. These people should be given priority. With the textile industry firmly established in this country, we could export manufactured articles instead of raw wool. In addition, the industry would give widespread employment and would thus expand the home market.",89
248,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"Maranoa) [12.17]. - I wish to make some comments on certain statements that have been made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr. MCLeod). The honourable member endeavoured to associate the Communists with the Australian Country party. There is no such association; but I believe that there is a very close relationship between the Communists and the Australian Labour party. For their continued membership of this chamber, some members of the Labour party are dependent on the support of Communists. Although the number of Communists in the various electorates may not be great, their support of some candidates is sufficient to elect them. Honourable members opposite know that to be true. Many of them are in this chamber as the result of the preference votes of Communist electors.  have all the criminal exporters hanging on to them.",93
249,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"The Minister ' talks of criminals; I remind him that the Labour Premier of Queensland has been negotiating with the Communists. He cannot refute the charge, which was confirmed by the statement of a Communist leader of the Waterside WorkersFederation, who admitted that he was privileged to negotiate with the Prime Minister and that the Premier of Queensland had agreed to release those men and upset the law for which he himself was responsible. The Premier, likewise, did not bring a number of others to justice. That indicates that the Labour party is unable to state truthfully that it is free from any connection with the Communists. A Labour government has given them preference even to the extent of breaking its own laws and allowing Communists to evade justice. I turn now to the subject of interest rates. The establishment of the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank under the guidance of the right honora.ble member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), when a member of a previous government, shows the Australian Country party's attitude towardinterest rates. As early as 1934 that department made interest rates as low a? 3^ per cent, to assist the primary producers. In J uly, 1940, according to the . Commonwealth Bank's own records the interest rate was further reduced to Z{ per cent. No reduction has occurred since that date with the exception that interest, in the case of a government guarantee, is 3J per cent., but the rate which the Commonwealth Bank charges is still the same as that which the Liberal government, introduced. The budget stands condemned on the following grounds: It makes no effective contribution to the welfare of the ' people; the cost of living has been increased as a consequence of the Government's policy; the inflationary conditions have been aggravated by that policy; the increased benefits in social services provided in the budget, although warranted, will not be equivalent to the ever-rising costs of living; production in primary industry, as a basic factor in our economy, receives no assistance to obtain supplies of machinery or labour by the budget proposals; it is unstable, as its estimates are dependent upon the maintenance at their present levels of prices received for the export of commodities, particularly wheat and wool. I shall deal with those grounds in turn. The Treasurer estimated that tax reductions in this financial year would amount to £20,000,000, but at the same time he has withdrawn £26,000,000 which would have been distributed in subsidies on commodities. According to statement No. 2 in the budget, the actual revenue received in last year's taxation collections was £465,000,000. The estimated revenue for this year is £509,000,000, an increase of approximately £44,000,000. That shows that the people are being taxed more heavily. How effective the tax cuts are is also shown by the fact that after they came into operation the. average tax per head of the population will still be £21 16s. 4d., which is only 7d. less than the average during the previous year, and £1 5s. 4d. greater than the 1946-47 average. The average amount collected in income tax which stood at £18 9s. 4d. per head in 1946-47, will be £19 9s. 4d. on the latest estimate. In effect, over-all tax collections are to be increased. Tbis ever-hungry Treasurer is determined to break his previous continuity of records in getting more and more money, year after year, from the people. Turning now to the cost of living, it is obvious that the withdrawal of subsidies on items affecting it must necessarily cause increases in prices. In reply to the honourable member for Wannon I say that that is not a direct result of the loss of the recent referendum or the return of price control powers to the States, but is due to the deliberate action of the Treasurer in withdrawing subsidies, increasing taxes, and passing on increased costs to the producers of this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has broken faith with the people. The honourable member stated that the Opposition had broken faith by making lying statements. throw that assertion back in his teeth. Every honourable member on the Opposition side can at least claim to have as much respect for his character as the members of the government side have for theirs. Opposition members can stand up to the statements they made to the people during the referendum campaign, in which they pointed out the power which the Government had taken unto itself by the National Emergency Act, and which it could have retained until the end of the present year. The Government has thrown that act overboard because the people did not vote to suit it at, the referendum. Incidentally, the Opposition, also gave the Government an assurance that it. would co-operate to secure a continuation of the provisions of the act until it was necessary to withdraw tbem. On the third point, 1. say that the budget, fiir from attacking inflation, is definitely having an inflationary effect, since every £1,000,000 which the Government collects in sales tax, income tax and customs duties means that another £1,000,000 is added to what the people must pay for commodities. The spiral then continues. The cost of living goes up, wages rise in consequence, and then the Treasurer collects more in taxes, which makes the cost of living go up, followed by a rise in w ages, and so we go "" round and round T the mulberry bush "". As the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) pointed out, every Is. wage increase to the working man means another £1,000,000 to the Treasurer. He is continually taking more money from the people for the Government to spend. If the money were being expended wisely the people would not mind heavy taxation as much as they do now. On the subject of increased social benefits, I say that the cost of commodities to the consumer is increasing far in excess of the 5s. increases which are made in pensions from time to time. Pensioners should be entitled to an increase of their pension at least equivalent to the increase in the cost of living. Undoubtedly, the present increase of social service payments is more than warranted but the distribution of social service benefits could be improved. The huge amount I expended on the free medicine scheme shows how farcical is the claim that such medicine is free. The taxpayer has to pay for every penny spent to give him "" free "" medicine, and he does not welcome having to pay for it, in taxes. As to my fifth point, that primary industries receive no assistance from the Government's budget proposals to obtain supplies of machinery or labour, I say that the same conditions in regard to those supplies as operated in the past will continue to operate during this financial year. Primary producers will still be unable to obtain supplies of wire, galvanized iron or netting. They have been in that position ever since the war ended, but the budget will not help them, and they will remain in the same desperate plight. At present, except in isolated instances, they are unable to obtain tlieir requirements. Another, and even more important, factor in increasing production is an adequate supply of fuel oil. In demanding that more fuel oil be made available for primary producers, I ignore the insinuation made by the Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction (Mr Dedman) in the course of the answer which be gave to a question yesterday to the effect that honourable members on this side of the House are only concerned to protect the interests of the oil companies. Neither I nor any other member of the Opposition is connected in any way with any oil company, but because of the harm done to primary producers by the Government's decision to reduce the supply of power fuel by another 20 per cent., we are vitally concerned with oil supplies. Primary producers depend very greatly upon supplies of fuel to operate their tractors, trucks and farm machinery, and it will be impossible for them to maintain the existing rate of production, apart altogether from increasing production, if the Government persists in reducing the present limited supplies by 20 per cent. Members of the Australian Country party are continually receiving telegrams from primary producers complaining that local oil distributors are unable to assist them to continue production by advancing fuel from their quotas for the following month because the distributors' quotas for the next period are already exhausted, and no further supplies can be issued by the oil companies' agents before the 1st October. The position of primary producers is desperate, yet the Minister has the audacity to assert that members of the Opposition, who have protested to the Mr Adermann. Government, are simply acting on behalf of the oil companies. It would have been more truthful of the Minister to say that the political party to which he belongs is the one which is concerned with the interests of the oil companies, breweries and other monopolies because it is from those concerns that it receives funds for electioneering. Members of the Australian Country party are more concerned with maintaining the stability of our economy by obtaining for primary producers the materials which they require to continue producing essential commodities. I returned to Canberra, the day before the opening of the present session and immediately approached the Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction and told him of the desperate position of primary producers due to the acute shortage of fuel oil. I explained to him that the present month of September is the ploughing season for certain crops,, and that unless su2)plies of liquid fuel were forthcoming many farmers would be unable to sow crops. The Minister undertook to investigate the matter promptly, but instead of furnishing a reply to me within a couple of days he waited for two weeks, and then informed me that his investigations had failed to disclose one instance of a primary producer having to curtail his operations because of the scarcity of liquid fuel. Undoubtedly his purpose in delaying his reply was to allow the greater part of the month of September to pass, so that he would not have to make available supplies during that month. ""We are receiving complaints not only from the primary producers but also from the oil companies' agents and distributors, who are gravely concened at the plight of their customers, the primary producers. One of the major oil companies issued a circular to its distributors, a copy of which I saw. It was to the effect that the quota of power kerosene had been reduced by 20 per cent. Power kerosene is used almost exclusively for production purposes, and when one realizes the degree of dependence of farmers on power kerosene, supplies of which the Government has decided to reduce by 20 per cent., it is obvious that the Government's real purpose is not to increase, but to restrict, production. ""When - I interviewed the Minister lie asked me for the names of individual farmers who were adversely affected by the fuel situation, and undertook to ensure that supplies were made available to them. Although I furnished the names of several farmers the Minister did nothing to assist them. The only person in my electorate who received any assistance was an individual in the Cunnamulla district, and the Brisbane office of the Liquid Fuel Control Board came to his assistance only after I had mentioned details of the case in this chamber. The man concerned, who operates eight motor trucks in the Cunnamulla district, had his liquid fuel quota reduced to 1,000 gallons a month. Previously he used to submit details of the work on which he was engaged, and the Liquid Fuel Control Board would issue a special licence to enable him to obtain sufficient petrol to carry out his contracts. The man concerned was quite satisfied with that arrangement, but, following the Government's recent decision to curtail still further the supplies of liquid fuel, he was told by the Board that no further special licences would be issued to him. On investigating the matter, I discovered that three of his vehicles, which were used to carry mail and parcels for the Postal Department, were allowed altogether only 540 gallons of petrol a month, which meant that he had to operate his other five vehicles on 460 gallons a month. Those vehicles are used to cart wool, wheat, sheep and other primary produce which has to be hauled long distances in the Cunnamulla district. Any one who knows anything of farming realizes that one tractor alone would require 460 gallons a month. However, because I mentioned the case in this chamber, and not because of the undertaking given to me by the Minister, the truck-owner has now been permitted to make special application for the petrol which he needs to operate his services. When members of the present Government do something wrong they do not like publicity to be given to their actions, and because of the fear that publicity migh t be given to the case the Minister rook action.",93
250,Mr FULLER,TRADE WITH EASTERN,We do not have to go to such lengths to achieve things; at least I do not have to do so on behalf of persons in my electorate.,96
251,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"The honourable member's interjection indicates clearly that preference is given to supporters of the Government in such matters, although the Government, which is elected democratically, is supposed to treat all sections of the community alike. If the Government wants primary producers to increase production, let it make available sufficient liquid fuel, without which it is impossible for farmers to increase production. The Government has restricted the supply of lighting kerosense to people in country districts who are completely dependent on kerosene for lighting. In many country areas electric power is not available, and since people cannot be expected to use candles, the only source of light available to them is kerosene. When they ask the Government to make available sufficient kerosene to enable them to enjoy one of the essential amenities of life, the present Government says, in effect, "" No ; you can sit in the dark. We are not concerned that you work much more than a 40hour week, so long as you toil all day and produce sufficient food to feed the city-dwellers who will not work "".",96
252,Mr FULLER,TRADE WITH EASTERN,Thos e tears will not save the honourable member at the next elections.,96
253,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"I challenge any member or supporter of the Government to come to my electorate and debate these issues with me on the public platform. The loss of primary production because of the lack of farming machinery is considerable. Although farmers have been endeavouring for the last two years to persuade the Government to allow sufficient harvesters to be imported they are still as badly off as ever. In the Kingaroy district, in which I reside, large quantities of maize, peanuts and other foodstuffs which are vitally important to our economy at the present time, are grown. However, we have not - been able to obtain a single planting machine in the last two years. A few machines designed to be drawn by tractors have been supplied, but we have been unable to obtain any horse-drawn machines because the Government is withholding import licences for all agricultural machinery. The firms which import agricultural machinery were informed by the Government two years ago that the importation of machinery was temporarily suspended, but the Government should have stated that so far as it was concerned the suspension would be permanent. I appeal to the Government to give further consideration to this, matter. Tractors are still scarce. During the recent recess I addressed a letter to the Minister for Commerce and  the dire straits to which farmers were 1 reduced because of their inability to obtain this essential equipment. The Minister replied stating that approximately 11,000 wheeled tractors would be permitted entry into Australia during the next twelve months, and, in order that farmers may be aware of the circumstances, I arranged for his statement to be published in several country newspapers. Whilst these additional tractors will afford relief to' farmers in closely settled agricultural areas who require wheeled tractors, they will not bring relief to wheat-growers, who need tractors of the caterpillar D-4 type. Apparently the latter are only imported from dollar countries. Tractors of the wheeled type are unsuitable for drawing the heavy implements used in wheat-growing areas. Apparently no relief is to be given to wheat-growers under the Government's restrictive import policy. A storekeeper at Dalby informed me that during the last twelve months he had 200 orders on his books, but that he saw no prospect of being able to get more than a few machines. I trust that the Government will review the import licensing system so that additional tractors of all types may be imported. The budget is unstable as realization of the estimated receipts depends upon the maintenance of the present high prices for export commodities, particularly wool and wheat on the overseas markets. Whilst we are fortunate that world prices for these commodities remain high, thus enabling us to maintain a reasonably stable economy, we must all regret that the hungry peoples of Europe have to pay such high prices for their essential foods. During the debate last night some reference was made to the Scully wheat plan. I do not propose to go into the merits or demerits of that plan now, Afr. Adermann. other than to say that, but for the tragic restrictions imposed under it, many additional millions, of bushels of wheat would have been grown, to the benefit, not only of this country, but also of overseas people who were crying out for wheat. As the result of the restriction of the crops to 3,000 bushels production fell below the level of our own domestic requirements.",96
254,Mr LEMMON,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"There was no limita tion to 3,000 bushels under the plan.",97
255,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"The crops were restricted as the result of the limitation of the price of 4s. a bushel to the first 3,000 bushels. No wheat-grower could afford to grow wheat at 2s. 2d. a bushel as a first advance because that price was below the cost of production. The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon) may have been well sa tisfied with the plan because under it the growers in the State which he represents received 12s. an. acre as compensation for not growing wheat. No one could suggest that from any angle the Scully wheat plan benefited Australia.",97
256,Mr SCULLY,TRADE WITH EASTERN,The wheat-growers' organization in Queensland supported the plan.,97
257,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,I disagree with the honora.ble gentleman.,97
258,Mr SCULLY,TRADE WITH EASTERN,It s support is on record.,97
259,Mr ADERMANN,TRADE WITH EASTERN,"Member s of the Australian Wheat Board publicly expressed their opposition to the plan. As the result of the restrictions imposed by the plan Queensland's requirements of wheat had to be imported from the south at approximately 5s. 6d. a bushel. The instability of the budget is revealed by the admission of the Treasurer that it depends upon the maintenance of the existing high prices of our exportable products. A fall in those prices might, have disastrous effects in this country. The much maligned producers, whom the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) referred to recently as "" bill billies"", constitute the backbone of the country upon whose efforts the economy of this country rests. Primary producers agree that everything possible should be done to develop our export trade in secondary products; but at the same time they realise that without the primary industries this country would not be able to carry on. As it is the wish of honourable members that this sitting should terminate early, [ shall reserve my further comments until the'Estimates are being considered. Progress reported. House adjourned at 12.48 p.m. ANSWER TO QUESTION. The following answer to a question ivas circulated;GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.",97
