1,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Is the Postmaster General prepared with a reply to the question asked by the honourable member for Bourke last night?,12
2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Bourke last nightj on the motion for the adjournment of the House, asked' a question as to the overtime paid in the Post Office are as follows:for the sorting of a certain publication. I have ascertained from a copy now in my possession that it is entitled to registration as a newspaper, ' to circulation through the Post Office as a newspaper under the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act, and to the benefit of the nominal rate of postage for newspapers as determined by the Post and Telegraph Rates Act. With respect to the statement that no overtime is paid to the sorters for the additional - work which they are required to perform in connection with the large number of the newspaper referred to that is posted, it can only be said that the payment of overtime is governed by the regulations made by the Public Service Commissionerunder the provisions of the Public Service Act. If the 'sorters work more than the stipulated number of hours per fortnight, namely, ninety-three hours for those who have regular hours, and eighty-four for broken or irregular hours, they will be entitled to payment for overtime.

3,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice-rl n reference to the statement of Major-General Hutton in the Perth Town Hall, as reported in the West Australian newspaper of the 2nd instant, to the following effect:"" As to the probability of any nation wishing to invade Australia, he would remind them of the extracts from Chinese and Japanese newspapers which had been appearing in the Australian press, and from which it could be seen that the people of China and Japan were casting longing eyes upon the rich Northern Territory of Australia. Further, he had it from no less an authority than the Japanese Admiral who visited Australia some twelve months or so ago that such was the case."" 1. Has any report of this intimation from the - isiting Admiral (Admiral Kamimura) been made by. General Hutton to the Minister of Defence, or to other official authority? 2. If so, has the Prime Minister any objection to placing such report on the Library table? 3. If not, will he cause General Hutton to make a full and complete report of the Japanese warning, and its surrounding circumstances? 4. Will he cause representations to be made to the British - Government and to the Japanese Government as to the implied threat on the part of the latter in its Admiral's statement? 5. Will he ask the presumably friendly Japanese Government to make a distinct repudiation of the statement of its Admiral, who, during his visit, officially represented his nation?",12
4,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The answers to the - honourable and learned member's questions 1. No 2. Answered by 1. 3. Major-General Sir Edward Hutton will be asked for an explanation of his statement. 4 and 5. It will not be desirable to make any representations as suggested. The mere fact of a foreign power being said to cast "" longing eyes "" upon our territory can scarcely be construed into a threat; and no good could result from taking official notice of such informal remarks, even if made.

5,Mr WILKINSON,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"the . Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon noticex. What allowance, if any, was made during the past year to members of the Defence Force in the State of Queensland, to provide uniforms ? 2. What is the cause of delay in providing uniforms to the above-mentioned branch of the Force ? 3. What allowance, if any, is made to members of the Light Horse for the use of their horses, saddles, and bridles; and is there any difference between the amount allowed to officers and that allowed to privates}",13
6,Mr WATSON,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"The answers to honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. In the case of the Militia, Commanding Officers received 40s. per head of the establishment, for clothing and corps contingent allowance. In the case of Volunteers, Commanding Officers received 30s. per head of establishment, and 20s. for each effective member, for clothing and corps contingent allowance. 2. The General Officer Commanding reports that there has not been any delay. 3.

7,Mr HUTCHISON,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice- Whether anything has been done with regard to the matter of imported spirits, which aTe bottled in Australia without purchasers being notified of 'the fact, about which subject it is understood the South Australian Government made representations to the Commonwealth Government?",13
8,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows : The statement was made in. December last that spirit was being imported, bottled, and labelled in a manner contrary to the provisions of the law of the State of South Australia. In January of this year, the Premier of that State was informed that, as the spirit in question had been legally passed through the Customs, the latter had no power in the matter. The Customs officers submit all labels imported for the consideration of the local authorities, and for such action as the latter may desire to take. It is not considered that the Department can do more in this matter. PAPERS. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers:Regulation under the Post and Telegraph Act, the statutory rule No. 45.

9,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E," I desire to move- . The the Standing Orders be suspended to discuss a matter of urgent necessity, namely, "" The Extra pay for policy and administration of the Government; also the attitude of the Opposition in relation (other than recruits). to the conduct of the business of Parliament."" £ »- d. 5 12 6 Mr SPEAKER-Standing Order 407 4 13 9 requires3 it o In cases of urgent necessity, any Standing or 2 16 3 Sessional Order, or Orders of the House, may 1 17 6 be suspended for the day's sitting, on motion, 1 17 6 duly made and seconded, without notice : Provided that such motion is carried by an absolute 1 10 o majority of the whole number of the members of 1 7 6 the House. 1 6 3 Does the honourable member claim that the 1 6 3 question he desires to discuss is one of 1 5 0 urgent necessity? 1 2 6 x 1 3 Mr Webster - I maintain that the x 0 o question is urgent, because the Opposition, ... x o o in refusing to allow the Government to . . . 1 0 0 recommit Clause 48 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill for its full consideration in Committee, have in view the defeat of the Administration, and their action deprives those who support the Government of the opportunity to justify that support, while it at the same time prevents other honourable members from giving their reasons for opposing the Government. The action of the Opposition is intended to deprive honourable members of their inalienable right to defend their attitudte, not only in regard to a particular measure of legislation, but in regard to the general support given to the Government during its term of office.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am not sure as ro whether what may be disclosed by the honourable member in the course of his speech, or in the speeches of those who follow him, will show that the matter is one of absolute urgency; but if I find it necessary later on to interpose I shall take the opportunity of doing so. For the present the honourable member mav proceed.",14
11,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I maintain that the matter is urgent because, should the recommittal proposals of the Government be defeated, members of this House would be deprived of the opportunity of discussing the general question. They would be deprived of their right to explain why they have given the Government their support in the past, or why they have religiously opposed the Government in connection with its legislation and administration. I maintain that the course of conduct which has been adopted by the Opposition, with a virw to steal a march upon the Government, has practically prevented honourable members from placing before the electors, whom they may have to face in the immediate future, any reason or justification for the attitude they have taken up, not only on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, but on questions involving the whole policy and administration of Ministers. I wish to ask what justification any member of this House has-be he one of those who has great responsibilities cast upon him, or be he the least influential member of the Chamberto come forward, and by means of the method of procedure which has been adopted, endeavour, while feating the Government, to rob honourable members of their right to express to the country in general, and to their electors in particular, their reasons for the attitude they have assumed, and their justification for their conduct, whether as supporters or opponents of the Ministrv? If honourable members wish to have detailed argument. I should like to say-wh y should we send an honourable member like the honourable and learned member for Bendigo back to his constituents, depriving him of the right-: Honorable MEMBERS - Oh !",14
12,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Deprivin g him of the opportunity,14
13,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I rise to order. I wish to take your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether the expression which has been used by the honourable member for Gwydir was in order, when he asked why we should send the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to his constituents? I wish to ask you whether the prerogative of dissolution, which is vested in the Governor General, can be referred to as if the Governor General had made some intimation",14
14,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Whic h he has not.,14
15,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Whic h he has not, I am sure, to the head of the Government, that such a contingency is involved in the exercise by honourable members of their independence in this House.",14
16,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The question of the dissolution of Parliament, or otherwise, is, of course, within the prerogative of the Governor General, and must not be debated in this House. I am sure that .the honourable member for Gwydir will not transgress the rule.",14
17,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I was not discussing the question of a dissolution. I was discussing the probabilities-as to what'might occur in consequence of the action that has been taken by the Opposition. I maintain that honourable members of this House; before any practical legislation can again be put before the House, may possibly have to face those who sent us here. For that reason, I wish honourable members-as every Britisher would wish-no t to adopt, or support that course of procedure which has been pursued by the Opposition.",14
18,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I should like to take your ruling, sir, as' to whether the honourable member is in order, under cover of a motion of this kind, in imde- pugning the motives, attacking the independence of judgment of honourable members, and anticipating debate upon a matter which is not yet decided by the House.",14
19,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"In no case can an honourable member anticipate debate on a motion which is upon the notice"" paper. Therefore, it will not be competent for him to refer in any .way to any debate which is or may be pending-upo n the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, for example. I am quite sure that the House would desire that in the case of every speech reference to a debate now pending should be specifically avoided, and that we should debate not the personalities of members themselves, but the question of policy which may be under consideration.",14
20,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have not transgressed the rule which you have laid down, Mr Speaker. I have not endeavoured to impugn the motives of any honourable member on account of the opposition which he has given to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which is now before the House. Nor do I intend to do so. I have sufficient knowledge of the Standing Orders to be aware that an honourable member cannot anticipate debate on another question which is upon the notice paper. But I have also the knowledge that whenever a Government is threatened with defeat, whether directly or indirectly, honourable members, whether they be victims of that defeat, or whether they may benefit from it, have a right to defend their attitude. Because every defeat of a Government may involve a dissolution. Since that is possible, I appeal for a right to discuss the question which I have brought forward. I am appealing for a right which would have been granted by any Opposition hitherto existing. No "" Parliamentary Opposition, of which 1I have ever heard, would have made it necessary for me to advance such a claim, nor would it have made any attempt to refuse to a Government the right to recommit a Bill.",15
21,Mr CONROY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I understand that the first reason given by the honourable member for Gwydir for the motion which he has submitted is, to discuss as a matter of urgent necessity, the policy and administration of the Government.' At the present time, one question under the consideration of the House is the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The honourable member is now referring to what is likely to happen in case of the defeat of the Government. I submit - that he is not entitled to do that. I go further He also advances, as a reason for bringing forward this motion, the attitude of the Opposition in relation to the conduct of the business of Parliament. When a Government seeks to have certain clauses of a Bill recommitted, it is quite competent for the Opposition to object to the motion, without violating the Standing Orders. Therefore the honourable member is now criticising not the conduct of the Opposition, but virtually the Standing Orders - of this House. This is my-point of order-the honourable member is not entitled, by means of a motion of this kind, to discuss the Standing Orders which have been adopted by the House. I submit that the honourable member is entirely out of order.",15
22,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have looked again at the notice which the honourable member for Gwydir has handed to me. I see in it no reference to discussing the Standing Orders of the House. I am not quite sure that if the honourable member had been pleased to include that matter, to have done so would not have made the motion irregular. The honourable member has brought forward the motion in order to discuss a matter of urgent necessity, namely, the policy and administration of the Government, and also the attitude of the Opposition in relation to the conduct of the business of Parliament. The honourable member, so far as I know, has not transgressed the rules. I may point out that where there are frequent interruptions by points of order, I am not able to listen so closely to the honourable member as I should otherwise do.",15
23,Mr CONROY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to confine the honourable member to the particular purpose of his motion.",15
24,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have already dealt with that matter. The question now under discussion is, whether, or not, the Standing Orders shall be suspended, and the honourable member has the right to use any reasonable arguments upon that point, for the consideration of the House.",15
25,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I marvel at the spirit which is being manifested by honourable members who are raising these points of order. They seem to have as many points as has the proverbial porcupine. I am merely asking for a British constitutional right, namely, that every representative in this Chamber shall have an opportunity to lay before his constituents, through Hansard - the only medium we have-hi s reasons for the attitude he is taking up. I was referring to the unjustifiable conduct of the Opposition. If honourable members opposite had submitted a direct vote of censure upon which honourable members could have discussed the general policy of the Government, there would have been no necessity f6r me to take my present action; but it is because we have been hobbled and gagged by the methods adopted by the Opposition, that we, - as Britishers, feel called upon to raise our voices in protest.",15
26,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The honourable member is now referring to another debate.,16
27,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I am referring to the attitude taken up by the Opposition with regard to the conduct of the business of the House.,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The honourable member must not refer to another debate.,16
29,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"It is necessary for me to refer to the action of the Opposition with regard to the conduct of the business of Parliament, as illustrated by recent events, in order to show why the Standing Orders should be suspended, and why we should be afforded that right of discussion of which the Opposition have sought to deprive us. It is important that facilities should offered to us to discuss the general administration of the Government. I ask what has been advanced by honourable members opposite against the policy of the Government? What charge has been laid at the door of the Ministry which would justify their ejection from office?",16
30,Mr CONROY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I would ask if the honourable member's statements can fairly be considered arguments in favour of the suspension of the Standing Orders?,16
31,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I take it that the honourable member is now stating one of the reasons which he indicated when I asked the honourable member to show the urgency of his motion.,16
32,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"In spite of the opposition ""shown by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, which is thoroughly characteristic of him, I have a duty to perform, not only to myself, but to the whole Commonwealth, and I intend to discharge it, despite all attacks on the part of those who are seeking to burk discussion. wish to know what portion of the policv of the Government has induced the Opposition to assume their present remarkable attitude ? Are they opposed to the policy of Ministers who have succeeded in placing_ upon our statute-book a measure dealing with a matter which has been dangled before the electors of the Commonwealth ever since the Federation was established? Do they object to the Government because they have expeditiously settled for all time the question as to where we are to go "" in the sweet by-and-by "" ? Are the Opposition seeking indirectly to deprive the Government of office and power because of their action in regard to the Seat of Government Bill ? Do they wish to revert to the state of affairs which existed before we passed an Act to bring about a White Australia? Do those honourable gentlemen who are seeking to conduct the business of this Chamber in the manner which the notice paper indicates, hope that they may reverse that legislation that has been so well administered by the Government in the interests of a White Australia? Are these members prepared to stake their political existence on the attitude which they are now taking up ? I realise that there is only one explanation for the conduct of those who are seeking by these indirect methods to attain something which they have not the courage to achieve by direct means. Are honourable members opposite cognizant of the fact that all the political be leanings and all the public utterances of their present leader indicate that he is opposed to a White Australia?",16
33,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have been looking at the standing order 407, and I wish to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether the honourable member is in order in obtruding his speech upon the House, out of its due order, and before the preliminary question has been decided whether or not we shall suspend the Standing Orders. In connection with a proposal to suspend the Standing Orders, and to interrupt the ordinary course of public business, the honourable member is making a speech which he ought not to deliver until we have determined to throw our Standing Orders to the winds to enable him to do as he desires.",16
34,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I intend to deliver another speech afterwards.,16
35,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I submit, sir, that the honourable member must be confined to a statement of his reasons for asking that the I Standing Orders shall be suspended, and that he must not indulge in a speech on the general question until the House has by an absolute majority determined that the ordinary course of business shall be interrupted.",16
36,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I submit that in the first place the standing order referred to by the right honourable gentleman does not provide that under these circumstances the question as to the suspension of the Standing Orders must be submitted without debate. In giving his reasons for the suspension of the Standing Orders the honourable member surely has the right to refer incidentally to the conduct of the right honourable gentleman and those associated with him in this crisis. It seems to me that the honourable member for Gwydir is' quite within our rules in giving reasons why the Standing Orders should be susthe pended. Even in an ordinary set of circumof stances, if it were proposed to susstatements pend the Standing Orders merely in order to pass a Bil l through stages hurriedly, it would be open to honourable members to debate the proposal. indicates that in this They could show reasons why it was not a matter of urgency, and conversely in instance the honourable member for Gwydir can advance reasons why it is a matter urgency that his views should be placed fore the country.",16
37,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I desire to point that upon a previous occasion- I cannot recall the exact date-whe n Sir Edmund state his reasons? Barton filled the position of Prime Minister, I took exception to a motion to suspend the Standing Orders in connection with despatch of certain Australian troops. I my recollection serves me accurately, my titude then was opposed by a very strong tion now upon the Opposition side of the out. House, and the action of the Prime Minister was upheld. The point which I then raised was whether the Prime Minister was in order in discussing the question which Party's room. he desired to debate before the Standing Orders had been suspended. I believe meeting there. that a ruling was given me, and I claim that that ruling of established a precedent in this Cham ber. Consequently, any honourable mempartition ber who seeks the suspension of the Standing Orders is perfectly entitled"" furnish reasons why that course should adopted. In this particular instance the honourable member for Gwydir wishes the Standing Orders to be suspended, and House cannot possibly know whether or not that course ought to be followed until he has advanced reasons in support of motion. To my mind the grounds which he has already advanced amply warrant the suspension of the Standing Orders. to decide. He is perfectly in order in adopting the line of argument which he is pursuing.",17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I wish to raise the question of whether, in the whole of statements of the honourable member for Gwytiir, there is a scintilla of evidence the character contemplated by the Standing Orders? He has informed the House that he has submitted this proposal because some honourable members of the Opposition to proceed. have adopted an unusual course.",17
39,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That does not appear in the motion. 1 Standing Orders.,17
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am speaking of honourable member's argument, and not the motion. There is nothing in his to indicate that the matter which he desires to discuss is one of urgency. all its Mr WATSON - Oh , yes.",17
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The motion merely House there is an Opposition, and that there is also a this Government which Ss pursuing its ordinary purposes of policy and administraof tion. Consequently we require to look to be the reasons advanced by the honourable member to ascertain whether any urgency exists out in connection with this matter.",17
42,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Why not allow him to,17
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I submit that he has already sufficiently stated them. the After all the tumultuous cheering which f occurred in the caucus room this morning, atI should have thought that honourable memsecbers opposite had quite pumped themselves",17
44,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Was that the caucus which was held in the Opposition room ?,17
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"No , in the Labour",17
46,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"There was no caucus against Mr. JOSEPH COOK - If the meetings that party continue to be so boisterous, I am not quite certain whether a thicker than already exists will not be required between the room in which they to assemble and the Opposition room.' The be gravamen of the statements by the honourable member for Gwydir is that the Opposition yesterday adopted a course of which the the Government did not approve. To argue that that is a matter the discussion of which urgently requires this motion is a his travesty upon the Standing Orders.",17
47,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That is for the House,17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"It is for Mr. Speaker to say whether the matter is one of urgency, and whether he will permit the discussion upon the motion to suspend the the Standing Orders to proceed. I contend that there is nothing to indicate that of the slightest urgency exists in connection with this matter. Upon that ground, as well as upon the other, I submit that the honourable member ought not to be allowed",17
49,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Tw o points of order have been put before me. The right honourable member for East Sydney has called attention to the fact that the first matter to be determined by the House is, whether or not it will suspend the Standing Orders, and, that if it determines to suspend them, the debate may then proceed upon the subjects mentioned in the motion. That is so. The only question which honourable members can now debate is, whether or not the Standing Orders should be suspended. Some time since, I called the attention of the honourable member for Gwydir to the fact that that is the question to which he must confine his remarks. The honourable member for Parramatta claims that no urgency has been shown to exist. I am endeavouring, as well as I can, when I am not engaged in determining these points of order, to ascertain whether the honourable member for Gwydir is making out a case of urgency. He claims that there is some probability of the Government losing its position upon the Treasury benches, and I understand that before that event takes place, he desires to enable honourable members to make certain statements. I am quite prepared to listen to him further, reserving to mysel f the right-whic h I indicated halfan-hour ago-to prevent a continuance of the debate, should urgency not be proved.",17
50,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"During my Parliamentary experience, I have never been so favoured by an Opposition as I have been upon the present occasion. It is, indeed, siderate on the part of honourable members opposite to afford me such frequent intervals in which to think out fresh points. Personally, I do not care whether I occupy a seat upon the Ministerial side of the House, upon the Opposition side, or upon the cross benches. But, seeing that there is a probability of the Government being defeated, owing to the adoption by the Opposition of tactics which are without a precedent in any Parliament in Australia, I contend that we should be afforded an opportunity of criticising, and, if we think fit, of supporting the policy of the Government. What can be more urgent than the right of honourable members to defend themselves against attacks which are made upon them, not in a constitutional way, but in a manner which is unknown in any other Parliament within the Commonwealth? I wish to obtain the suspension of the Standing Orders for the purpose of discussing the policy and . administration of the Government, and also of considering the attitude that has been adopted by 'the Opposition in the conduct of the public business. When they resort to such tactics it is a matter of extreme urgency that the Standing Ordersbe suspended in order that we may exercise the British right of free speech. When the right honourable member for East Sydney smiles, as he is now doing, I know that he does not relish the arguments that are being adduced. I think I have clearly shown that this is a matter of extreme urgency.",18
51,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The honourable member has not yet said a word in support of his motion.,18
52,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Eve n if I availed myself of every word in the dictionary, I do not imagine that I should be able to convince the honourable member. Some honourable members are so full of their own selfimportance that it is impossible to convm :e them that they hold erroneous views on any subject, and therefore I shall not attempt to perform impossibilities. We have a right, as free men, representing a free people, to give full expression to our views on an all important question of this kind. We have a right to protest against the tactics pursued by the Opposition during the last day or two. What are the planks in the Government policy to which the Opposition object ?",18
53,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I submit, Mr Speaker, that while it is perfectly competent for the honourable member to show that it is a matconter of urgency that the Standing Orders should be suspended, he is not in order in discussing the general question.",18
54,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Whil e the honourable member for Gwydir was speaking, I was looking up the precedent mentioned a little earlier in the proceedings by the honourable member for Kennedy, so that I was not closely following his remarks. If the honourable member was distinctly going beyond the question of whether it is desirable to suspend the Standing Orders, he was certainly out of order.",18
55,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"As I am only a novice, I feel inclined to accept the kindly advice offered by honourable members opposite. As a tribute to their high intellectual attainments, to their wide knowledge of constitutional law, and to their intimate acquaintance with the rules of procedure, I should perhaps express my gratitude",18
56,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Will the honourable member discuss the question?,18
57,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I have already shown that it is a matter of urgency that the Standing Orders should be suspended. I shall now discuss those features in the policy of the present Government to which the Opposition are opposed.,18
58,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,In discussing that matter the honourable member would go beyond the scope of the motion.,19
59,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I wish to show that by the action of the Opposition we are deprived of the right to freely discuss their tactics.,19
60,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Not at all.,19
61,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am surprised that the honourable member, in whose veracity I have always had the greatest confidence, should hold that opinion. He knows that the Opposition are anxious to burke discussion-to gag honourable members on this side of the House-and to prevent us from putting before the people of Australia our reasons for objecting to their attempt to follow a course of procedure which has never been adopted in any other Parliament in the Commonwealth.",19
62,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The question is whether honourable members are going back on the vote which they gave in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for iCorinella. It is the Ministry who say they will resign if the clause is not recommitted.,19
63,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I admire the honourable member's friendly interest in me, but do not welcome his interposition. By the action of ' the Opposition we have been deprived of the right, which we should otherwise have enjoyed, to discuss the general question on a direct motion of want of confidence. Do those who are supporting the Opposition tactics fully realise that they are allowing the impression to go forth to the public that they are not prepared to support the policy of this Government?",19
64,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I rise to a point of order. I submit, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member is not discussing the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, and that he is out of order from first to last. I hold lhat he must absolutely confine him- Government. self to the giving of reasons in support of his contention that it is urgently necessary that the Standing Orders should be suspended.",19
65,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Havin g had time to look up the precedent referred to by the honor- is able member for Kennedy,19
66,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"If this is a Government move, I do not wish to object to it.",19
67,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I hold that it is' one of the duties of a Government to protect the rights of honourable members in regard to our methods of procedure.,19
68,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Hear , hear.",19
69,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have had an opportunity to look up the point referred to by the honourable member for Kennedy, and shall briefly put it before the House. On the 14th January, 1902, the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, wished to make a statement to the House relative to the South African war, and the part which he proposed, on behalf of the Government, that the Commonwealth should play in it. The proposal to make that statement was objected to, on the ground that it would give honourable members no opportunity to reply, and the Prime Minister then proceeded to deal with the subject on a motion to suspend the Standing Orders. On that occasion, Mr. Speaker, you ruled thatThe objection of the honourable member for Kennedy is fatal to the Prime Minister on this occasion making any statement to the House except in the way which he proposes- a speech which will conclude with a motion such as for the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Prime Minister adopted that form, and concluded with a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. Debate then ensued, and the discussion, which is reported in Hansard at pages 8741 to 8800, covered the whole question of the South African war.",19
70,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I should like to take your ruling, Mr Speaker, on the point whether the matter to which the honourable member wishes to refer can be discussed by the House even if he obtains the suspension of the Standing Orders. Is it not a matter which is already under discussion?",19
71,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,He wishes to discuss the general policy of the Government.,19
72,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,He wishes to refer to the action of the Opposition during the last two days in endeavouring to prevent the discussion of a certain matter.,19
73,Mr MAHON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,And to the policy of the,19
74,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"In support of the point which I have raised, I should like you to refer, sir, to the following passage on page 264 of May's Parliamentary PracticeNor can a motion be brought forward which the same in substance as a question which, during the current session, has been decided in the affirmative or negative, nor which anticipates a matter already set down or appointed for consideration by the House. I respectfully ask you to decide, Mr Speaker, that the object of the honourable member for Gwydir, in asking for the suspension of the Standing Orders, is to refer to a matter already under the discussion of the House, and to interfere with the right of honourable members to continue that discussion.",19
75,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I will deal first with the point raised by the honourable and learned member for Angas. So far as I , as Speaker, have any knowledge, the question under discussion in the debate to which the honourable and learned member refers is whether a certain clause of a certain Bill shall or shall not be recommitted. Whether the fate of the Government is. or is not, involved in that discussion is a question in regard to which I cannot assume to have any knowledge. It is not for me to say whether it is or is not. Therefore, so long as the honourable member for Gwydir does not discuss the motion relating to the Arbitration Bill now on the notice-paper, and the amendment omitting clause 48 from the proposed recommittal, or any other matter of which notice has been given, he will be in order, and the point which the honourable and learned member for Angas has raised will have no application. The honourable member, however, will be out of order instantly if he attempts to debate any motion on the notice-paper. So far as the point raised by the honourable and learned member for East Sydney is concerned, the House will see that the line between that which the honourable member for Gwydir may discuss and that which he may not discuss is a very faint one. He cannot discuss on the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders the subject which he wishes to discuss if the suspension of the Standing Orders is granted; but he may give as fully as he pleases the reasons why he thinks the'Standing Orders should be suspended. At the moment when attention was called to his remarks by ""the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, he was, as I understood him, arguing that possiblv the action of the Opposition' might prevent certain arguments being advanced in the House, which he thought ought to be advanced, and was thereby proving the need for the suspension of the Standing Orders.",20
76,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Anothe r day or two.,20
77,Mr FISHER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Contemptibl e minds have contemptible ideas.,20
78,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I have every reason to be proud of the wonderful unanimity which exists amongst honourable members opposite in the desire to burke discussion on this question.,20
79,Mr KELLY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Is the honourable member in Order in saying that the members of the Opposition are unanimous in the desire to burke discussion?,20
80,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"If the remark is objected to by any honourable member, it must be withdrawn.",20
81,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"If it is objected to by any honourable member opposite, I withdraw it ; but, knowing the marvellous abilities of the honourable member for Wentworth, I did not intend to convey the impression that he is capable of burking discussion. It is very difficult for a man to speak connectedly when he is being continually badgered. I remember being called to order very quickly on one occasion for objecting to an honourable member expressing his opinions when he desired to do so.",20
82,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Will the honourable member discuss the question before the House ?,20
83,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I feel sure that in discussing the wisdom of suspending the Standing Orders to allow honourable members who, during the last nine months, have taken an attitude which seems to me more incomprehensible and more inexplicable",20
84,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Hav e we anything to do with what has happened during the last nine months ?,20
85,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The purpose for which the honourable member desires the suspension of the Standing Orders is to enable him to discuss ""the policy and administration of the Government, also the attitude of the Opposition in relation to the conduct of the business of Parliament."" So far as I can see, that covers all that the honourable member can say in regard to the whole life of this Parliament.",20
86,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am delighted that the right honourable member for East .Sydney raised the point of order, because your ruling, Mr Speaker, has given me an opportunity for which I am grateful. It considerably enlarges the scope 1 of my observations. We have the right, on whichever side of the chamber we may sit, to explain our actions during the existence of this Parliament, which is not yet twelve months old, in order that later on we may, if possible, obtain the approval of our constituents in regard to what we have done. I am acting as the friend of honourable members on the Opposition side of the House, who, I feel certain, are just as anxious as I am to be able to place on record the reasons why they have taken the course which they have adopted during the existence of this Parliament. I maintain that it is only fair that we should have an opportunity to do so since it is probable that that opportunity may not occur again on account of the action of the Opposition in connection with a motion which has recently been put before the Chamber. Each and every one of us should have the opportunity to defend his attitude towards the Government, and the vote which he intends to give, thereby once and for all , giving to the people whom he represents an honest outline of his reasons for the faith that is in him. Honourable members opposite have the same right to be heard as have the supporters of the Government.",20
87,Mr HUGHES,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Does the honourable member say that they should be compelled to explain ?,21
88,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I do not believe in compulsion except in connection with arbitration. In a matter of this kind I feel that they will not need to be compelled. I am certain that they are only too anxious to have an opportunity to do so. The methods adopted by the Opposition in relation to the conduct of public business have engaged even their own supporters. But the leader of the Government is prepared to extend to them that which their own party would' refuse. What have honourable members to object to in the policy of the Government ?,21
89,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That question has no relation to the suspension of the Standing Orders.,21
90,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Owing to certain occurrences which may eventuate, and which are well known to honourable members, we shall have no opportunity to discuss the question at a later stage.",21
91,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The honourable member may say that, but he must not discuss the policy of the Government.",21
92,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am giving my reasons for thinking that we should have an opportunity to discuss the important questions that are now pending. I am rather sorry that no other point of order has been raised, because it would have given me time'to mature my thoughts. Is it not right, in the interests of good Government, that honourable members opposite should have an opportunity to explain why, in connection with certain legislation, they have opposed the Government, and why they intend to vote in a particular direction in connection with an event which is likely to occur during the next day or so?",21
93,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether the honourable member is not now referring to the pending vote on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill?",21
94,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"At the moment when the honourable and learned member for Angas rose to a point of order, I was speaking to the honourable member for Macquarie with reference to the debate; but if the honourable member for Gwydir was doing what the honourable and learned member for Angas says he was doing, he was transgressing the rule. I ask him not to do that.",21
95,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I certainly have np desire to transgress the rule. I have always endeavoured to keep within the four corners of the law of Parliament. I admit at once that I have to exercise my right to speak within a barbed wire fence, which has been erected for the purpose of preventing me from exsure plaining my position. But, sir, I did not, as the honourable and learned member for Angas stated, transgress the rule.",21
96,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"What was the "" pending vote"" to which the honourable member referred ?",21
97,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I was not referring to the vote which is to be taken on the Arbitration Bill . I contend that I did not transgress by referring to a subject which undoubtedly is hurtful to honourable members opposite. Why are these constant objections raised to the exercise of my constitutional right to debate a question which we are otherwise prevented from debating by reason of the attitude assumed by the Opposition? Do honourable members realise that as the outcome of this method of conducting public business it is possible that they will have to give an explanation of their opposition to the Government and its policy? There is one thing that it is absolutely essential that honourable members should consider, and that is that in the efforts of the Opposition to displace the Government by means hitherto never adopted by a Parliament in Australasia",21
98,Mr GLYNN,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,To what means is the honourable member referring?,21
99,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I rise to a point of order. This is quite a new point. I should like to have the benefit of your ruling, sir, with regard to it. I have just observed the terms of the motion which the honourable member for Gwydir has sprung on us, and I wish to have your ruling as to whether, under the Standing Orders, the honourable member con include more than one subject in a motion, for the suspension of the Standing Orders. Because, he can do that, - he can include a schedule. I submit to you, sir, that there are two subjects mentioned in this motion - the policy and administration of the Government, that is one thing; and the attitude of the Opposition in relation to the conduct of the business of Parliament. These are two absolutely different things, and seeing that this standing order is not often used, I feel that it would be convenient, and useful in the future, if we had the benefit of your opinion as to whether, upon a motion to suspend the Standing Orders, more than one subject can be included.",21
100,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have no hesitation in giving the ruling asked for. I would remind honourable members that it is a common practice in connection with Supply Bills and Appropriation Bills to move that the Standing Orders fee suspended, to enable the report of the Committee of Supply to be adopted, and a Bill introduced and passed through all its stages without delay. In such cases, three or four different things are contemplated by the motion, as contrasted with only two under the motion now before honourable imembers. T t is quite competent for the House to suspend the Standing Orders for - one purpose or for more than one.",22
101,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I shall go on for a few minutes to enable the right honourable gentleman to look up another point of order. Already eleven points have been raised, but they have not disturbed me in the least. I am determined to discharge what I conceive to be my duty, despite the interruptions to which I am being subjected. Honourable members will have to weigh very carefully the reasons which they may be required to give to their constituents for the action which they are taking. Should the not have an opportunity to explain why they propose to desert a Government which is in favour of a White Australia ?",22
102,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I ask, Mr Speaker, whether this outrage upon our rules is to be permitted any longer? We are now being addressed on the subject of a White Australia, upon the assumption that it is a matter of urgencv which will admit of no delav. Mr ' SPEAKER - I distinctly 'heard what the honourable member was saying. He was urging that some opportunity should be afforded to honourable members to discuss the policy of the Government, which includes the maintenance of a White Australia.",22
103,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I know that this subi f ject is a sore point with the right honourable member for East Sydney.,22
104,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The honourable member has now a loose rein; the White Australia question is very urgent.,22
105,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I desire to impress upon honourable members who are following the right honourable member that they will probably have to explain to their constituents their attitude upon this question. They are leaving in the lurch a Government which has fought tooth and nail to safeguard a principle which is among the most sacred to Australia, namely, the maintenance of a White Australia. Are they prepared to assist into office those who have asserted that if they can secure the reins of Government they will do everything they can by maladministration to defeat the objects of the Immigration Restriction Act, and to go back on the grand principle of a White Australia? Will honourable members also be able to explain the position which they have taken up with regard to the proposal of the Government embodied in the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill now before this Chamber? Will those honourable members who profess to desire to encourage Australian industry, who have shed bitter tears of sympathy with the unfortunate unemployed, and who are pledged to their constituents to legislate, and to administer our laws, upon such lines that our industries will be established upon a sound basis and provide work for our citizens, be able to show that their present' action is justified ?",22
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Upon a point of order, Mr Speaker, I would direct your attention to the fact that the honourable member is now submitting as matters of urgent necessity some possible attitude of members of the Opposition at some time or other, with regard to the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill , the White Australian question, the provision of employment for the people, and other items which make up the general programme of the Government, or have relation to their administration. I ask you to rule that none of these are matters of urgent necessity, and that, therefore, they furnish no reason for the suspension of the Standing Orders. They may be matters of great importance, but they have already been discussed and voted upon within the recent past. that there is not a scintilla of proof of urgency in connection with any of these matters, and that the course which the honourable member is taking constitutes a grave abuse of our Parliamentary privileges and procedure. If this kind of argumentation is to be regarded as a matter of necessity, we may as well set aside all our Parliamentary rules, and allow you, sir, to govern the House without reference to them. What would hinder any honourable member from taking a similar course every day of the year, and so render it impossible to transact any business?",22
107,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,What is point of order?,23
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The point of order is that the honourable member is indulging in a grave abuse of the Standing Orders.,23
109,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Orcer . honourable member state his point of order?,23
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,My point of order is that the honourable member has shown no urgent necessity to adopt' the course which he desires to follow.,23
111,Mr THOMAS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That is the honourable member's opinion. It is not a point of order.,23
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Of course it is my opinion, and I am asking Mr Speaker to rule upon the matter.",23
113,Mr HUGHES,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,He has already given a ruling upon it.,23
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Since Mr Speaker gave his ruling the honourable member has introduced two or three fresh matters of the most ordinary character-matter s which do not relate to the Government programme. 'For example he mentioned the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill . I submit, therefore, that his conduct amounts to a grave abuse of the Standing Orders. that such a motion should refer only to some matter of grave importance, which arises suddenly, and which requires the immediate attention of the House. Mr SPEAKER. - Is the honourable member giving a ruling or is he asking for my ruling?",23
115,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Labou r cheers again.,23
116,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Order .,23
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I respectfully submit that I was supporting my point of order, but I do not think that I need proceed further.",23
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I submit that the honourable member for Gwydir was perfectly in order in making the remark to I submit which exception has been taken. The prospect of our existing legislation, in respect « of a White Australia being repealed, is a matter of urgency, and I happen to know that it has given rise to very grave concern in the minds of a large number of persons.",23
119,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The honourable member for Parramatta has asked me whether the course followed by the honourable member for Gwydir is not an abuse of constitutional practice. Of course, I have not to rule under such Standing Orders as I should prefer, or under such Standing Orders as are in force in some other Parliaments, but under those which are operathe tive in this Parliament. I should much prefer that our Standing Orders should require a motion for their suspension to be put without debate. But under those Standing Orders there is no such requirement, Will the and therefore I cannot uphold the view that the course which is being taken by the honourable member for Gwydir is an abuse of parliamentary privilege. The honourable member has distinctly asserted that it is probable that, even to-night the Government may have to vacate their position upon the Treasury benches, and has argued that before that event takes place, time should be afforded for a certain discussion. From his point of view, that matter is certainly arguable, and I am prepared to hear him debate it still further.",23
120,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"When I was interrupted I was seeking to discover how honourable members opposite could justify their position before the workers, who would benefit by the granting of a bonus for the production of iron in Australia. It is due to them that they should be afforded an opportunity of telling their constituents in so many words why they have sunk the May points out fiscal question, upon which they were elected to this Parliament. The right honourable member for East Sydney, who has assumed the position of leader of the Opposition, and who is such an adept in the art of making personal explanations, that he can explain the various and conflicting attitudes adopted by him upon any question, should be afforded an opportunity of stating why he has pulled down the fiscal flag, which he nailed to the mast at the last election. He should perform his duty in this House, and not seek to evade responsibility for his conduct by endeavouring to obtain a snatch vote.",23
121,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Upon a point of order, I submit that the honourable member is now transgressing the rules of Parliament, in that he is discussing the subject which he proposes to discuss when the Standing Orders have been suspended.",23
122,Mr WATKINS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Seeing that you, sir, have pres'iously ruled upon the same point, is not the honourable member for Lang guilty of disorderly conduct in again raising it?",24
123,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The point of order raised by the honourable member has not previously been taken. It relates to a sentence in the speech of the honourable member for Gwydir, which had not been uttered when the last point of order was raised, and, therefore, objection could not then be taken to it. I dismiss the point of order, and call upon the member for Gwydir to proceed.",24
124,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Labou r cheers again.,24
125,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I sympathize with honourable members opposite, who feel that they will not be able to justify the votes they have given, and I am seeking to do justice to them. I sympathize with the Leader of the Opposition; with that democrat of old, the honourable member for Parramatta; with the father of the Labour movement, the honourable member for Lang, and with that self-righteous and lecturing individual known as the honourable member for New England. I desire to secure an opportunity for them to explain their attitude, ancl to put before their constituents the reasons why they oppose the Government. I wish to know why the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-wh o Has been conspicuous by his absence from the Chamber during this debate-and those who followed him under the banner of Protection at the last election, are prepared now to lower their colours. They should have an opportunity to explain why they are consenting to this invasion of their sacred rights and privileges, and attempting to burke legitimate and free discussion. I have done my duty.",24
126,Mr ROBINSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,G o on.,24
127,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"All the fighting qualities of the House are not confined to the Opposition benches, and I may go on too long to suit the convenience of the honourable and learned member for Wannon. A time may come when he will wish that I had not said as much. I have done my duty in availing myself of the forms of the House to draw attention to an action on the part of the Opposition, which will stand out prominently in the history of Commonwealth politics,' as one of the most despicable attempts to burke discussion that has ever been known.",24
128,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That is outrageous.,24
129,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Order ! The honourable member must not charge the. House, or any section of it, with resorting-to methods which are despicable in their character.",24
130,Mr WEBSTER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Then , I shall withdraw the word "" despicable,"" and shall say that the action of the Opposition is unfair, unmanly, and un-British. Their methods would not be followed by statesmen of the type of Gladstone, Disraeli, or Chamberlain. Such men would never stoop to the tactics of which the Opposition have been guilty, in order to secure a temporary victory over their opponents. TJnlike the Opposition, they would not gag them and rob them of their political liberty. I have on a previous occasion spoken of certain honourable members as being political highwaymen, and I say, without hesitation, that those who are supporting the Opposition tactics may fairly be described in that way. They are political highwaymen, seeking to rob the Government of their political rights. ' I trust that my protest will be remembered. It certainly will be recorded on the pages of the history of this Parliament. I do not think that any Labour Government would ever descend to the use of such weapons as the Opposition have employed to defeat their political opponents; but, if they did, I for one should vigorously protest. I have heard the right honourable member for East Sydney say that he likes a fair fight. He invariably cries out for fair play, and yet he is now the first to shelter himself behind a political hedge and pull the trigger of the revolver which another man holds at the head of the Government. He has spoken of what has occurred in New South Wales, but, as a matter of fact, he is pointine a pistol at the head of the Government, and, without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves,- is demanding their political lives. It is his desire that the hands of the Government shall be tied behind them, and that a gag shall be placed in their mouths, so that they may have no opportunity to defend themselves from an attack which is unprecedented in the annals of Australian Parliaments.",24
131,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E," I heartily congratulate the honourable member for Gwydir on his honest, straightforward, and manly attempt to secure the fullest and freest discussion of the question which is really at issue. I do not know whether the right honourable member for East Sydney is the leader of the Opposition or whether that position is held by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.",24
132,Mr MALONEY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,He is the tail of Opposition.,25
133,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That is polite.,25
134,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The leader of the Opposition, whoever he may be, and those behind him, are endeavouring to prevent honourable members from dealing with the policy of the Government in a straightforward and manly way. I care not on which side of the House I sit.",25
135,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,There is more f u n on the other side.,25
136,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,We shall have a great deal more f u n over there.,25
137,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Then , why are the Government so slow in leaving the Treasuiy benches ?",25
138,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,When we fight we desire the Marquis of Queensberry rules to be observed.,25
139,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I challenge any one to point to one act of maladministration on. the part of the Government. As a matter of fact, honourable members opposite are pledged to the policy to which the Ministry are seeking to give effect; but apparently they are ready to displace them merelv because of a desire to gain possession of the Treasury benches. They have nothing whatever to say against the administration of the Government, and that is probably the reason why the right honourable member for East Sydney has not submitted a straight-out want of confidence motion.",25
140,Mr BATCHELOR,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"That ' is"" what He told the people of Australia he would do..",25
141,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The people of the Commonwealth have a right to know the ground on which it is proposed to displace the Government.,25
142,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Clause 48.,25
143,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The right honourable member is afraid to submit a straight-out want of confidence motion, because he knows that it is impossible to say that the Government have in any respect lated the trust reposed in He has told the House and the country a dozen times that he would come down with a no-confidence motion, and yet we now find him prepared to attain his ends by means of a snatch vote. The House ought to compliment, the honourable member for Gwydir upon the action which he has taken. If he had not moved this motion, honourable members would not have had an opportunity to say whether they approve or disapprove of the actions of the Government, and all that the country would have known would have been that the the Government had been defeated on a clause of a Bill. That, to many people, would appear a mere question, of detail, though the Government regard it as covering a vital principle.",25
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Was not the last Government in the same case?,25
145,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,No . We acted straightforwardly.,25
146,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The last Government took their gruel like men.,25
147,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The members of the Opposition are not taking their gruel like men this afternoon. I think that the proper course for them to have followed was to try to defeat the Government on a direct motion. In spite of all his assertions, the right honourable member has not had the pluck to move a motion of want of confidence. There is a great deal of wind and talk about him, but that is about all. There is no "" Yes-no "" policy about me, , however. Everyone knows what my position is ; but I question if one member in the Chamber can say what the position of the right honourable member is.",25
148,Mr CAMERON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"He is in Opposition today, and will be on the Government benches tomorrow.",25
149,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"There is still an opportunity to discuss this matter, and I challenge the leader of the Opposition to take a course which will enable it to be properly discussed.",25
150,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E, I should like to be allowed to say a few words,25
151,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The right honourable member has a quarter of an hour.,25
152,Mr HUGHES,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The right honourable member ought not to sit down before half past 4 o'clock.,25
153,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I hope that I shall not be continually interrupted during my remarks. I wish, if I may be allowed to do vio- so, to say a few words in reply to the them. imputations which, even coming from any quarter, must cause one a certain amount of concern. Honourable members who have spoken upon this extraordinary motion have uttered a number of statements as reasons for suspending our ordinary rules which must, to any man of parliamentary experience, appear absolutely absurd. They should know that it is not for this House, when dealing with a particular Bill on which it has recorded its opinions, to speculate as to the position of the Government. The Ministry chose its own position by taching a certain significance to a request nificant. which the House was at liberty to grant or to refuse. The House was asked to reto commit a certain clause, about which hontheir orable members had made up their minds, and having done so, proposed not to recommit it. Surely we cannot make rules for honourable gentlemen who are so absolutely averse to retention of office",25
154,Mr HUGHES,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Why did the right orable member select clause 48?,26
155,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,I did not select that clause.,26
156,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The right honourable member was agreeable to the recommittal of other clauses.,26
157,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The Government said outside that they would consider that the House had had enough of them if it not consent to the recommittal of the self. clause.,26
158,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have already ruled, on several occasions, that no referDalley ence must be made on this motion to a bate which is pending, or to any motion the business-paper. I therefore ask right honourable imember not to continue present remarks.",26
159,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I fall back upon the sacred principles which you, sir, heard of from the honourable member for Gwydir a hunmember, dred times. If he used the Words once, he used them a hundred times.",26
160,Mr MCDONALD,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I rise to order. Is the right honourable member in order in flecting upon your conduct, Mr Speaker, by imputing neglect of duty to you in not listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir?",26

175,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I was referring to thesacred principle of the right of the people reto choose the men they wish to represent them, as the honourable member for Gwydir would say. I had had some little experience of the rules of Parliament before the present Government was heard of. These rules are old. They have been established many years. It is the most common thing in the world for the House, someon the invitation of the Government, and sometimes against their wish, to vote the recommittal of a Bill to secure reconsideration of some provision in it.",26
176,Mr BATCHELOR,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,This is an attempt to take the business of the House out of prethe hands of the Government.,26
177,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"No one who was a supporter of the Government would take part in such an attempt. But surely those who the Government are entitled to try to to take the business of the House out of their hands? This is a new style of administration that honourable members desire. sigWhat do we care whether our action does the or does not take the business of the House out of the hands of the Government? Are we here to keep the Government in office? Are we here to save them, by building bridges for them at the sacrifice of our own principles? We are not here for that purpose. All the bridges that could be built have been built, and the grievance of honourable members opposite is that they cannot go into the building yard and get another bridge built. That is the only trouble of these valiant heroes, to whom principle is everything, and who have sold the trades unionists of Australia on their own principles.",26
178,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,That is a good gag; but the trades unionists of Australia know the right honourable gentleman. They have been sold by him too often.,27

201,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I wish to protest against. as sad this unprecedented attempt to anticipate the vote of this House upon a matter of public importance.

207,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Like the honourable member for Gwydir, I am rather a novice, and these sudden attacks lead me from the path of rectitude. The very same situation arose in this very Parliament two or three months ago. The same Bill was before the House, and a vote was approaching, regarding which the Government made a certain announcement. Did the Deakin Government countenance- I suppose that the Prime Minister will admit that the present Government countenanced the action of the honourable member for Gwydirone of their supporters getting up to make an extraordinary speech in abuse of the Opposition, in anticipation of the vote that might be given? Did any such abuse of the dignity of parliamentary life take place? No ; the Prime Minister and his colleagues, went out of office without a word.",28
208,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,They were treated fairly.,28
209,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"They were engaged upon a Bill of great magnitude, and when a matter of principle arose, upon which the majority of honourable members differed from them, they submitted themselves to the decision of the House.",28
210,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,No one would have refused them a recommittal of the Bill.,28
211,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,What ! in order to change their principles?,28
212,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,No one .would have refused a recommittal if the Government had desired it.,28
213,Mr REID,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am sure that the honourable ancl learned member for Ballarat would never have asked for a recomimittal in order that the Government might change its principles.

What is the effect of the complaint of the honourable member for Gwydir; simply, that we have made up our minds upon a great principle, and that we do not intend to alter them, and that we wish to 7 C2 let the Government know it at the earliest possible moment. That is the situation.",28
216,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Will the honourable member kindly take his seat? Debate interrupted. Business of the day called on under Standing Order ng. ORDER OF BUSINESS.,28
217,Mr WATSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"-In view of the importance of the issue before the House at the present time, I think it is only proper that I should ask honourable members to forego their rights with regard to private business for today. Therefore, I move That the consideration of general business be postponed until after the consideration of Order of the Day No. r, Government business. Question resolved in the affirmative. CONCILIATIO NAND ARBITRATION BILL. Debate resumed from 10th August (vide page 4083), on motion by Mr WATSON That the Bill be now recommitted to a Committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 4, 37, 38, 39, 46, 48, 52, 67, 68, and 90 and schedule B, and the consideration of proposed new clauses 52A and 95AUpon which Mr MCCAY had moved by way of amendment That clause 48 be omitted from the clauses proposed to be recommitted.  might appropriately refer to the principal amendments that have been made in the Bill . The measure was not the creation of the present Ministry, but was left on the stocks by the Deakin Administration. It then contained a clause which provided for preference to unionists, and the exercise of untrammelled discretion by the Judge. Some honourable members have stumped the country, and have denounced the present Administration for attempting to ruin the primary industries of the Commonwealth. They have never had the manliness to say that the preference clause originated with the Deakin Ministry, and that it was left as a legacy to the present Administration. I have always considered that the Bill does not go far enough, but I am anxious to carry out the pledge which I gave to.my constituents, and to place upon the statute book a measure which, although it may not be perfect, will, at least, form the ground work of the legislation that is desired for the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes. I venture to say that, at the last .general election, the great majority of the electors expressed themselves in favour of conciliation and arbitration. The honourable member for Dalley told me that I should vote against the Bill, because it did not entirely meet with my approval; but I am .anxious to do all I can to bring about the reform which every honourable member professes to desire. The honourable and ""learned member for Corinella succeeded in securing the adoption of an amendment which, I venture to say, would prove absolutely unworkable. Under the common rule an award might apply to the whole of the workmen in a particular industry in the Commonwealth, and it would be impracticable to furnish the Court with information that would satisfy it that an application for preference was endorsed by a majority of those affected. Take the case of the shearers. What man could tell Kow many shearers would be affected by an award of the Court? Any one with a practical knowledge of shearing work knows that during seasons when the harvests fail, many hundreds or thousands of men resort to shearing work, who, at other times, would find employment in the agricultural districts. Men may go out as shearers one year, and not shear the next. Still they would be affected by the award of the Court, because they might obtain a run of sheds for the following season. Therefore, no one could tell how many men would be affected by an award of the Court. Then, in the case of miners, a man may follow mining for a time, and then resort to other means of livelihood ; but he may return to work as a miner at any time. No one knows better than does the honourable and learned member for Corinella that it would be impossible to demonstrate to the Court that the majority of the persons affected by an award approved of the application for preference.",28
218,Mr MCCAY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I do not know it. I think that the proviso is workable, or I should support it.  learned member failed to produce any evidence in proof of the soundness of his view. When I asked him to afford proof he sneered at me.",29
219,Mr MCCAY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I did not.  learned member seemed to think that, cause he knew a little about Castlemaine, was fully acquainted with the conditions of the mining industry. I might tell him, however, that I was working down a mine before he was born. I think, therefore, that I can claim to know something about miners.",29
220,Mr MCCAY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I admit that freely.  ber for Wentworth professed to know everything about the aspirations and requirements of the working classes, and he treated my interjections with contempt. Let me tell the honourable member that it is fortunate for him that he has never been under the necessity of making himself acquainted with the wants of the working classes. He came into the world with a silver spoon in his mouth, and his path in life has been made so easy that it is impossible for him to understand the difficulties that would be experienced in complying with the condition laid down in the proviso adopted at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. The honourable membe for Dalley has declared that he will vote against the clause in the Bill which is intended to confer a preference upon unionists, on the ground that it does not go far enough. There is an old saying, that any excuse is better than none; and I certainly think that that remark is applicable to the lamentable attempt of the honourable member to justify his action in this connection. He even ref uses to allow the Bill to be taken into Committee, with a view to securing an amendment of .the clause in the direction which he desires. He affirms that he can see no distinction between the proposal of the Government and the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. Can his chief see no difference between the two? Does the honourable and learned member for Corinella see no difference? Is there not a vast distinction between requiring an organization to secure the approval of a majority of those affected by an award, and requiring it to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Court that It substantially represents the internot ests of those engaged in any particular industry ? Mr G. B - EDWARDS - The honourable member has said that there is a difference, such but he has not explained what it is.  cases an organization might be able to satisfy the Arbitration Court that it subbestantially represents the interests of the he employees engaged in any industry.",29
221,Mr GB EDWARDS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"But.the Prime Minister declares that the words "" substantially represents"" are equivalent to saying that the organization consists of a majority of the workers in a particular industry.  majority.",30
222,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"What do they mean?  this House were required to represent a majority of the electors, very few could claim their seats. If the individuals who are employed as seamen or shearers today, but are not so engaged tomorrow, are to be used to block the desire of. those who wish to obtain a preference under this Bill, it will be impossible for the members of any organization to obtain a preference award. In connection with municipal arrangements, has it not been repeatedly provided that a certain vote must be polled ?",30
223,Mr CONROY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"This is not a question of voting, but of working.  ing the course of the debate upon this Bill, thac there is only a limited number of trades unionists in Australia. We have been assured that the number of non-unionists far exceeds that of the unionists. that a fair way of stating the facts of the case? Does not the honourable and learned member for Werriwa know that the non-unionists include thousands who are engaged in localities where there are no trades organizations which they could join?",30
224,Mr CONROY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"We ought to consider the interests of men who cannot afford to employ a lawyer to represent them before the Court.  sideration for those individuals who are not members of unions-wit h the exception of some who are resident in places where such organizations exist-as has the honourable and learned member. I would remind him that the profession with which he is associated has a pretty tight union of its own. I wish to show why, other things being equal, a preference should be extended to unionists.",30
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"In the Australian Act no preference is given to them.  this Bill does not recognise individuals. It is based - upon organizations, in .contradistinction from individuals. It was framed upon these lines for the express purpose of enabling the Court to give effect to an award. The organizations are intended to assist in giving effect to the awards of the Court. The individual is not considered at all. A strike occurred in New South Wales recently. The unionists did not strike, although the press of Australia endeavoured fo convey the ini-. pression that they did. As a matte.: of fact, however, it was only the non-unionists - the members engaged in that particular industry who did not belong to organizations-wh o struck. They refused to be bound by the award of the Court. But the trades unionists gave effect to that award. I congratulate the Government upon making an honest effort to secure \n Arbitration Bill, which would at least be workable. It would be a standing disgrace to them if, for the purpose of remaining upon the Treasury benches, they allowed this Bill to pass in its present form - a disgrace which no time could obliterate. They wish to obtain a recommittal of certain clauses, in order that we may secure a measure, which, if not perfect, will at least be of some utility. I commend them for their action in staking their Ministerial existence upon this particular provision. Personally, I am indifferent as to where Is I sit in this Chamber, but I am anxious that those engaged in industrial pursuits in the Commonwealth shall secure a workable measure in connection with the important question of conciliation and arbitration. In my judgment, even the proposal of the Government does not go far enough, but I believe that under its operation there is a possibility of an organization being able to satisfy the Court that it substantially represents the employees in the particular industry affected by an awaid. That, however, would be quite impossible under the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I cannot help remarking that since the present Government assumed office, there has been continuous underground engineering.",30
226,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,Because they have not a majority behind them.  Western has been made to overthrow them. Why ? They do not occupy their present positions as the result of self-seeking? Will any honourable member assert that they attempted to secure possession of the Treasury benches by underground tactics?,30
227,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I would remind the honourable member that the proposal before the Chair has reference to the recommittal of clause 48.  matter. I unhesitatingly declare that the action of honourable members of the Opposition is prompted by a desire to place certain of their number upon the Treasury benches. It is a piece of utter cant and hypocrisy for them to claim that it is prompted by a desire to study the best interests of the country. One cannot close his eyes to the fact that in politics we see strange bedfellows. We have now presented to us the spectacle of certain honourable members, in their endeavour to gain the Ministerial benches, falling upon the necks of others, whose names, if mentioned in their presence only a month or two ago, would have produced the same effect as would a red rag upon It has been asserted on a public platform that the Commonwealth ship of State is being "" steered from the steerage."" Where is the right honourable member who made that statement? Where was he yesterday when this contemptible method was adopted to secure the defeat of the Government ? He was probably in the vaults of the House, or in the sewer. We have had an exhibition of something that is more like sewerage politics",30
228,Mr KENNEDY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I desire to know, Mr. Speaker, whether the honourable member is in order in referring to a course of procedure permissible under the Standing Orders as being contemptible?",31
229,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I would point out, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member not only said that a certain method of procedure was contemptible, but that we were being treated to an exhibition of sewerage politics.",31
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,He said that the right honourable member was probably in the sewer.,31
231,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"It is a remark that should not be applied to any honourable member. - Mr SPEAKER - I shall ask the honourable member to withdraw the statements to which objection has been taken. At the same time, I would again impress upon him that it is necessary that he should confine his remarks to trie question of whether clause 48 shall or shall not be recommitted.

The term ""steerage politics"" has become famous since its use by the main conspirator in the plot that has-been hatched to defeat the Government.",31
234,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,What has this to do with the question under consideration ? .,31
235,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I have on two occasions called the honourable member's attention to the fact that the question under a bull. consideration is whether or. not clause 48 shall be recommitted. I must ask him to confine himself to the matter under debate, or I shall have to ask him not to proceed with his remarks.  Mr Speaker, to obey your ruling, but would point out that there is no occasion for anxiety on the part of the honourable member for Macquarie. The .little time that I shall occupy, in placing my. views before the House will not materially delay his leader, securing a seat on the Treasury benches.",31
236,Mr MAHON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The honourable member does not mean that.  of the party with which I was associated for several years. I believe in fair play, and certainly do not look with favour upon any exhibition of hypocrisy or cant.",31

238,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The honourable member will recognise that the question is not as to any word that he may use, but whether he is dealing with the subject-matter of the motion, to which I have twice called, his attention. He must debate the question as to the recommittal of clause 48, and that only. Any other matter is inadmissible.

I wish to deal with some of the reasons which have been advanced for the attempt to defeat the Government proposal. If there is one thing that I admire more than another, it is straight-out, honest fighting. I object to underground methods, and exceedingly regret that those who desire to gain possession, of the Treasury benches have not adopted a more manly course. These unseemly tactics have been adopted in order that the Opposition may secure an additional vote through the question being dealt with in the House instead of in Committee. An attempt has also been made to break a Government pair. I refer to the pairing of the right honourable member for Balaclava with an honourable member who supports the Ministry.",32
240,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I am sure that the honourable member's parliamentary experience teaches him that he must confine his attention to the clause under consideration, and that the discussion of the conduct of certain honourable members, whether it be dishonourable or otherwise, is out of order. The honourable member can deal only with clause 48, and with the reasons for and against its recommittal. I. am reluctant to interrupt him so often, but he must obey the Standing Orders.  will not allow me to give the reasons",32
241,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,The honourable member must discuss the clause.  that I am going to accept my instructions from honourable members of the Opposition. I wish to show that the Opposition are manipulating a vote.,32
242,Mr SPEAKER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"That is not before the Chair.  statement that I am not prepared to repeat anywhere else. I was told of the incident to which I refer' at the entrance to the chamber. What have trades unionists done that they should be treated in the way that honourable members of the Opposition - propose ? We are told' by the Opposition that they sympathize with trades unionists, but their sympathy is always wanting when a proposal is made.to give them some practical support. At one time in the Parliaments of the States, one heard nothing but the cry of "" property, property, property."" That was the ""gag"" that was commonly used when .efforts were made to extend the franchise to those who were termed "" the lower classes."" We are told today that we are seeking to interfere with the liberty of the subject. That is an old cry. It was raised when Lord Shaftesbury first took steps to improve the conditions of pauper children who were being worked in the factories of England to such an extent that many of them became cripples. It was then asserted that if the existing factory system were interfered with, commerce would be ruined; and we are told again today that if we grant preference 'to unionists we shall interfere with the liberty of the subject, and damage commercial interests. Some honourable members have no regard for anything but commerce. What have trades organizations done that they should be treated as the Opposition propose? Why should they be penalized? Have they not been in the forefront of every reform? Have they not had the courage to take up questions with whlich weakkneed politicians were afraid to deal, and to boldly fight for reform? In England, America, and Australia, and indeed in all parts of the civilized world, we find members of trades unions bearing the brunt of the fight for reform.",32
243,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"There is no compulsory arbitration in the United States of America.  said a few years ago of New Zealand. Trades unionists were at the bottom of the agitation for the non-employment of women and children in the mines of England, and they were behind the great movement against the employment of children for unduly long hours in the factories of England. In every country they have fought for the improvement of the working conditions of the people. Have not many of them suffered for their efforts? Some honourable members would have us return to the days when certain miners in England were transported to Australia because they stood up for the interests of their associations. History tells us of case after case in which trades Unionists sacrificed their liberty, suffered exile, and in some cases lost their lives in their efforts to secure thf advancement of mankind. They have fought not only for themselves, not only for the workers with whom they have been immediately associated, but for the industrial classes generally. Yet some honourable members speak of trades unionists as if they were criminals. They have no consideration for any one but non-unionists.",32
244,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Hav e not non-unionists a right to be considered?  never done anything for non-unionists? Has not every reform which they have secured-the better ventilation of mines, the improvement in the sanitary conditions of factories, and a thousand and one other things-benefite d non-unionists as well as unionists ?",33
245,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,We agree that they have done good work.  bers speak as if the Government desired to subject non-unionists to an injustice.,33
246,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,No . Have we not made trades unionists Ministers of the Crown ?,33
247,Mr BATCHELOR,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The honourable member did not give much assistance in that direction.  of the members of the Ministry are trades unionists is to be found the root of the trouble. In the early stages of the present political unrest, the Government was referred to as a trades union Ministry. That is the only fault that can be found with them. It is because the present Administration comprises trades unionists that the Opposition are prepared to sacrifice not only them but trades unionists generally. They desire to make the Bill so useless that it will be a reproach to the Ministry.",33
248,Mr GB EDWARDS,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Was the Bill designed in the interests of unionists, or of labour?",33
249,Mr BATCHELOR,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"- In the interests of the public.  and Arbitration Bill was designed in the interests of organizations. Can any honourable member point to an organization of non-unionists? That is why in New Zealand, in scores of cases, when other things have been equal, preference has been given to unionists. The New Zealand Court has recognised that the whole basis of this kind of legislation is the recognition of ganizations.",33
250,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Accordin g to the honourable member's showing, there is no need for the clause at all.  though that may be the opinion of the honourable member. I think that if the clause is not inserted, great numbers of men will have black marks placed against their names. I have known men to be black-marked for miles and miles around. Employers may not have gone to the length of sending their photographs ahead of men whom they deemed objectionable, but they have taken every other precaution to prevent them from getting employment. Unless the giving of preference is provided for, that state of things would exist under this measure. . The honourable member himself knows that what I have described is done. The honourable member for Dalley has repeatedly admitted that it is done, and the honourable member for Parramatta knows that men have been blackmarked throughout a whole district, because they had been chosen as delegates to ask for some concession, not for the unionists alone, but for non-unionists as well. I ask honourable members why do they not make an example of these terrible trades unionists? What have they done for society that they deserve consideration? Honourable members appear to prefer to go back to the old methods. Why are they not honest? Why do they not say that they do not wish to have an Arbitration Bill, and prefer to allow disputes to be settled by strikes? Let us make that the issue. Although they profess to desire arbitration, they are not ready to assist the Government in passing a workable measure. Has any one of them been behind the scenes during a strike, and known the hardship,- suffering, and loss which such occurrences bring in their train? Yet they wish to pass into law a measure under which, as it stands, not one organization in Australia would register. One Ministry has been placed in difficulties, and another has been sacrificed already, in connection with this Bill, and the better part of two sessions has been spent in discussing it. The last five months have been occupied in the miserable pretence of doing something in the public interest, but the whole desire of honourable members opposite is to secure possession of the Treasury benches. They are ready to neglect the interests of the industrial organizations, and to forego the oropportunity to secure industrial peace, in order to obtain possession of the Treasury benches. I do not care who occupies those benches.",33
251,Mr KENNEDY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"Then why worry ?  to worry when we think that an important measure should be amended? It is astonishing on what a small pretence some persons will f all from grace. The honourable member has surprised me. the time when he would not have treated the matter so lightly. No one knows better than he does the need for establishing some tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes. He has been in the thick of these troubles. He is not like honourable members who have had no experience. It is therefore his duty, as it is the duty of the whole House, to try to place upon the statute-book a workable measure to secure industrial peace-no t a mere rotten, hollow pretence such as this is.",34

253,Mr KENNEDY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"That Ministry retired with dignity when the fact was proved.  tired with dignity; but the members of the present Government did nothing unworthy to secure possession of the Treasury benches. Indeed, they tried to avoid taking office. An attempt has been made to show that, the present position, is similar to that which resulted when the Deakin Government was defeated; but on that occa- sion there was no underground engineering. The Government were twitted a short time ago with having tried to persuade men to change their votes on this subject, and yet the right honourable member for East Sydney, who made the charge, had sitting alongside him an honourable member who intends . to change his vote, and who was no doubt influenced to do so by his leader. It will be a disgrace to this Parliament if it places on the statute-book an unworkable measure.",34
254,Mr KENNEDY,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"But the Government are objecting to the insertion of a provision of which the majority has approved.  methods which are being adopted. There has not been an opportunity to consider in Committee the advisability of amending the clause. Almost any amendment would make the provision better than it is now.

They are now absolutely refusing to afford honormembers an opportunity to discuss the Bill in Committee, and ascertain if it can be made workable. This conduct is on a par with the tactics which have been used by some honourable members ever since we have been here.

Are we to assume the measure has become objectionable memmerely because it is being handled by a Labour Administration? We have been told that it is desirable, in the interests of some persons, that there should be a change of Ministry.

273,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E," So far as clause 48 is concerned, I am thoroughly in accord with the action taken by the honstricted orable and learned member for Corinella: I think that the present opportunity should be availed of by honourable members to press their opinions, and to deal with this question in a manner that will insure finality and prevent unnecessary waste time. I can see no practical difference workers of the Commonwealth. between the Government proposal and the proviso embodied in the Bill. The omission of the word- "" substantial "" from the ment suggested by the Government would place it upon the same footing as the prothey viso, whilst the retention of that word would involve that vagueness of expression to which I have expressed my objection in connection with other portions of Bill. I have all along objected to the proposal to give preference to unionists, as being a negation of the fundamental principle of equal rights and equal tunities. Unfortunately, the amendment to last Monday, which indicates clause 48, which I proposed, was lost, and I merely supported the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member Corinella, because it appeared to me the next best thing to do. I am unwilling to disturb the present provision, but the clause were recommitted, I should tainly submit an amendment upon the lines of that which I previously The advocates of the Bill are really appearing before the community in the light ist? of opponents to majority rule.

This was refused, and I had to knock off, and after having walked five miles to my job, had to trudge five miles home to my sick wife and starving family.",36

277,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I will not divulge his name, but would not give the statement to the House unless I was fully convinced of the substantial accuracy of these statements, because they were made to me by a man whom I have known for years.",37

280,Mr FRAZER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"When a unionist is out of employment, he is .not called upon to pay his subscriptions.",37
281,Mr JOHNSON,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"I cite that instance to show that the effect of legislation of this character is to create a close corporation of labour unions, and to displace from employment a large number of men whose only crime is that they are not attached to these organizations. The idea that unionists only should participate in the benefits conferred by such legislation is a most selfish and narrow one. What would be thought of the missionaries to the heathen if they invoked salvation only on behalf of the members of their own denominations ? What would be said if they urged that only their own particular sects should receive the benefits of the work which they professedly performed in the interests of humanity at large? That is exactly the position which the honourable member for Darling is taking up today. Because trades unions have been pioneers of the movement for the up-lifting of the workers, he wishes the members of those organizations to secure all the advantages which may result from improved conditions, to the exclusion of that large class in whose interests honourable members opposite are accustomed to declare upon the hustings they have been unselfishly working. I have no desire to prolong the discussion of this question, which was fully debated when the clause was considered in Committee. I merely wished to draw attention to a case of hardship which had come within my personal knowledge, and which had resulted from legislation of this character, which seeks ""to create special privileges for some workers, and to impose great disabilities upon the majority. Whatever legislation may be passed, it should be the duty of honourable members to see that it is based upon equality of opportunity for all, justice to all, and special privileges to none.",37
282,Mr FRAZER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E," I must preface my remarks by an expression of regret that the field of this discussion is so limited. In the past, it has been usual to extend to Governments, whose right to remain upon the Treasury benches has been challenged, the privilege of defending their policy, upon a motion which enabled the whole of that policy to be debated.

No doubt he finds himself in such an awkward position that he realizes it would be inadvisable to allow honourable members too wide a field for discussion, lest they should be in a position to fire too many effective shots. At this stage I think I am justified in referring to the circumstances which led up to the present Government's assumption of office. It will be recollected that when this Parliament assembled, it was found that a majority of its members were in favour of extending the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth.

300,Mr FRAZER,POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OFT H E,"The honourable member for Hume has always been prepared to adhere to the provisions contained in the Bill as it was introduced by the Deakin Government. There has been a remarkable change of front on the part of members of the late Administration. When we find them playing fast and loose with the electors, I hold, that it is our duty to show the public of Australia the attitude which is adopted by them. In my judgment, unionistsare certainly deserving of some consideration at the hands of the Goare vernment in a measure of this description. We must recollect that if it had. not been for their strenuous and self-sacrificing efforts, compulsory arbitration would have been impossible in Australia today. It is very easy for honourable members to declare their belief in that principle upon the hustings, because they know that the majority of their constituents uphold it . It is very significant, however, that in Parliament these very individuals are prepared to vote for proposals which render industrial peace absolutely impossible. So far no objection has been raised to unionists as such. Even the right honourable member for East Sydney has admitted that the trades unions comprise the very cream of the working men, and that, if he'were a working man himself, he would be a unionist. Honourable members opposite admit that these organizations have rendered invaluable service to their fellows, and yet what do they offer them in return? Absolutely nothing. They say in effect, "" By refusing the Court the power to grant you a preference award, we shall make you the victims of unscrupulous emplovers."" When the Bill was under consideration, o n a previous occasion, the honourable member for Maranoa produced a black list, bearing The Con- the names of most of the pastoralists in the western districts of New South Wales and Queensland. On its title page was the following statement:NA MEMBERS DURING THE YEAR 1895. This register has been compiled at the office of this association for the information of members only, and in accordance with'counsel's opinion taken as to its legality. This register must be kept strictly private and confidential. N. J. WESTERGAARD NEILSEN, Secretary. The object of this register may be briefly explained. If any man who shore in those districts was prepared to stand out for reasonable conditions, or dared at any time to dispute the will of the boss of the board, he was described in this register as "" good shearer, but strong unionist."" In other words, such men were black-listed. leaving a shed, a unionist shearer might receive a reference setting forth that he an excellent shearer, and could "" do a tally,"" but in the private list, circulated among the different station managers statement would appear opposite his name that he was a strong unionist, and therefore an undesirable character. It is necessary that we should provide for preference to unionists, in order to guard against such tactics. In Western Australia, certain who brought a dispute before the Arbitracowardly tion Court, and obtained a settlement by peaceful means, found, on returning places at which they had been employed for a number of years, that it had suddenly been discovered that they were not compeI tent, or that some other reason was coming for the refusal to further employ them. They were dealt with in this way, merely because they had taken part in the effort to secure an orable award of the Court granting reasonable conditions to those engaged in the industry. These cases illustrate the object which we have in view in urging that the Court should have power to grant preference to unionists. Without a preference clause the Bill would be useless. If we thought that unionists would even be placed on"" an-equal footing with non-unionists we should not be found fighting so strongly, for preference, but because we know that without a reasonable provision for preference unionists have and will be victimised that we deem it necesgreat sary to fight so strongly against the clause as it stands. It has been asserted during the course of this debate that the policy the unions is to starve the non-unionist. deny that that is so. Every precaution has been taken to safeguard the interests workers, whether they be unionists or nonascertain unionists. The Bill already provides that a man shall not be refused the right to join a union. That provision was insisted upon, and was rightly inserted. In providing for preference to unionists, we shall assist in the tricts. building up and maintenance of those orwould ganizations which are absolutely necessary in order that the Bill may be a workable one.

We hope that by granting preferMr Frazer. ence to unionists, and holding out an in a ducement to men to join organizations, and to take an interest in this measure, we shall On conserve the industrial peace of Australia. The cry which is so glibly uttered that was unionists desire to deprive non-unionists good of the means of obtaining a livelihood has no foundation in fact. The honour the able member for Lang has referred to a poor unfortunate fellow, who alleges that he was compelled by stress of circumstances to leave the ranks of unionists, and that unionists subsequently refused to allow him to work on the wharfs, although his wife men and children were starving. That is a charge to make in this House, unless the name of the man be given. If his to name were disclosed it would be possible for us to trace the story to its source, and to ascertain whether it was accurate or not. have heard many complaints made by disforthappointed persons against unions and unionists, but on investigating them have invariably found that they could not be substantiated. The case to which the honmember has referred may possibly come within the same category. The clause as it 'stands would make it absolutely impossible for the Court to grant preference to unionists. The experience which I have had in gauging the number of persons engaged in a particular industry convinces me that it would be impossible for an organization to obtain evidence showing that the majority of those affected by the award deit is sired that preference be granted. It has already been explained by several honorbeen able members who are associated with the bush unions that the number of persons engaged in the shearing industry varies very considerably from time to time. In of addition to that, we know that when men. I are scattered all over the country it is impossible to ascertain their opinions on any of given question. A union might be able to the opinion of the workers when they were congregated in large centres, but it would be almost impossible to ascertain the opinion of every man connected with an industry carried on in scattered, disUnder the clause as it stands, it be absolutely impossible for an organization to ascertain the views of a majority of those likely to be affected by . any I have no hesitation in saying not that the Government proposal is not all of subthat I should like it fo be.",38

I should have thought that"" honourable members would endeavour to secure the passing of any measure designed in the interests of the people who are looking to this Parliament to save them from so great a disaster as another maritime strike, or any other Inter-State industrial dispute. It appears to me that the Bill is to be thrust aside simply because certain honourable members are anxious to obtain possession of the Treasury benches. The fate of this Bil l is nought to them as compared with the question whether the right honourable member for East Sydneyis to be Prime Minister. This is a most unfortunate state of affairs, and when the people of Australia learn, as they will in the course of the next few days, of the reasons leading to the downfall of the present Administration, and of the sacrifice of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , they will entertain nought but feelings of disgust towards those who have brought about the present situation.

Had the course proposed By the Government been adopted, we should have been able to avail ourselves of the advice of honourable mem-' bers on all sides of the House, and, possibly, some amendment might have been suggested and have received the approval of the majority of honourable members.",40

318,Mr FRAZER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"In view of their present attitude, I do not know why honourable mem. bers opposite should applaud that remark. The Bill is to be thrown, aside and its ultimate fate to remain undecided for weeks. We do not know what the defeat - of the Ministry may mean. There one is always the possibility of a dissolution. I do not hold that out as a threat honourable member, but it is possible that within the next month or six weeks we be engaged in contesting our .and in the interval there may be an Inter-State strike.

They have taunted their opponents with continually deferring this trial. But now that they are side. actually put on. their defence, it is they who - cry. "" Give us until tomorrow."" A great deal has been said from the other Chamber about the underground engineering, and the going back upon electoral pledges which has taken place side of the Chamber; but if honourable members refresh their memories by referring to Hansard, they will see that some of those who were once ardent supporters of the Deakin Administration, and are now sitting on this side of the House, have before this said clearly and distinctly that, when the opportunity fered, they would attempt to tone down several of the extreme proposals in the Bill. Reference has been made to attitude of the members of the late Governthey ment in reference to this Bill. There are or two of them against whom the charge of inconsistency cannot be made, but certo any tainly the honourable member for Hume, for whom the present Ministerial supportmay ers claim such wonderful consistency, is constituencies, not one of them.",41

In any case, the Government had control of the business, and are responsible if they allowed a division to be taken on a matter of vital importance ofbefore honourable members were thoroughlyseized of the importance of the question. Moreover, why have they slept in regard the to the matter for a month? Why have not taken an earlier opportunity to try to convert a minority into a majority? And why are they squealing now, like so many trapped rats?",41
328,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member is a protectionist rat.,42

330,Mr MIALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member will not have a walk-over.,42
331,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I have enjoyed that privilege.,42
332,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Not so often as I have clone.,42
333,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I do not claim to be so notorious as is the honourable member, nor to possess his political virtues. Although the Ministry and their enthusiastic supporters have been looking for trouble, and asking for a fight, they are now, after a month of underground engineering and bridge-building, howling about the tactics of the Opposition, which is strictly parliabeing mentary. Are we to believe that they did not know that the honourable ancl' learned member for Corinella would stand staunchly in support of his provision? Was it likely that he would allow night of underground engineering to go on before acting in its defence? Surely we cannot attribute such guilelessness to honourable members opposite. We have been told that they obtained possession of the Treasury benches in an honourable way. T do not deny that. To some extent I admire the attitude which they have taken up. But now, although the numbers are against them, it looks as though dynamite would not remove their tentacles from the Treasury benches. Has any Ministry cried out more loudly than they have done to be challenged at the earliest opportunity.",42
334,Mr TUDOR,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,We have not had an opportunity to discuss the position.,42

336,Mr TUDOR,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Why do not some of the leaders of the Opposition speak? Why are they putting up ""squibs""?",42
337,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I am not responsible for the actions of either the right honourable member for East Sydney or the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat has always taken direct courses, and those who stood loyally behind him have no reason to regret their allegiance to him. It has been suggested that if there is a dissolution, our seats will be in jeopardy, but that is a question for our constituents to determine. What is the use of honourable members saying, "" We will send you to the country ?"" We have also been told that if we refuse to amend the clause so as to give absolute, and complete preference to unionists, industrial warfare will (spread over Australia. Why are these threats made when an important matter of this kind is being discussed? I was amongst those who, with the late Prime Minister, voted for ythe insertion of subclause b, to give preference to unionists. The only qualification I desired to see attached was the proviso that the unions should be wholly industrial organizations, and not political machines. So long as they were unions, whose funds were not to be used for purposes other than the purposes of the Bill, I was ready to give them a preference. I cannot be charged with opposed to the granting of preferences.",42
338,Mr TUDOR,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The members of the Opposition tried to undo what had been done in regard to the giving of preferences by another fort- adding a proviso.,42
339,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"We were told by the honourable member for Barrier that he would be ready to reject the Bill if unions were not given the right to act as political party machines. Under those circumstances I felt justified in the action I took, with a view to preventing the minority comprising a political party machine from dominating the majority under the provisions of a measure to secure industrial peace. That was why I supported the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. The members of the Ministry and their supporters accuse the honourable and learned member and those on this side of the House with having acted dishonorably; but has not the Prime Minister been continually telling the country during the last three months that he wishes for a trial of strength-simpl y that he wanted a test of strength? The opportunity which he has desired is now presented to him. Ministers took possession of the Treasury benches upon a question of policy in connection with this Bill. Did any Ministers ever retire with more dignity-wit h one notable exception-tha n did the Deakin Government. The present Ministers took office in an honourable and straightforward way, and I regret to say that they are not tinuing in that path, now that their exisand tence is being threatened upon a matter of policy. Why should they complain ? They must admit that the question on which they present Ministry. are being challenged is purely a matter policy, and yet they appear to want more time for the purpose of playing lery. A great, deal of time has been wasted already by the honourable member for Gwydir in dealing with the whole range of politics of the last three or four years. The has. sole object was evidently to gain time.",42
340,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member ber must not refer to another debate.,43
341,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"The threats which have been made by the honourable member to for Gwydir cause a feeling of resentment on my part, not against honourable memment bers opposite personally, but against the line of action which they are following in dealing with a question of policy affecting whole industrial life of Australia.

347,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,That has nothing to do with the matter under discussion.,43
348,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I do not think it I was simply replying to the remark of the honourable and learned memfor Corio, and I do not propose to pursue the matter any further. I would direct the attention of honourable members the question immediately before the House. The Prime Minister tells us that the amend which he suggests is substantially the same as the pioviso inserted at the instance of the honourable and learned memthe ber for Corinella. Those who say that it is is impossible to ascertain what number of in any particular industry would constitute a majority, forget that we have statistics available, which are, for all pracWe matknow that we can rely upon the figures I given in the Statistical Register from time to time with regard to the number of miners engaged in coal mining, or gold mining, or other branches of that industry, and that we can also arrive at a very good idea as to the number of hands engaged in the various factories in our cities. We can even ascertain approximately the number",43

350,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Tak e the case of the by way of illustration. We can arrive at a fairly good idea as to the number of shearers engaged in the different States, and it is absurd to confuse the number of men actually engaged in that occuto pation with those who were shearing fifteen or twenty years ago.  who were working fifteen years ago of only, but of those who were working last of vear, and who mav be shearing next year.",43
351,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"We were told by the Prime Minister that those who were shearfifteen years ago were still shearers for the purposes of the Bill. If that view were correct, I might be regarded as a because the honourable member for Grampians has promised, if necessity arises, to give me a pen in his shed. If the honourable member intends to ship all his wool home, however, it may not be advisable for him to give me that opportunity. There is a difference in phraseology, but not in substance, between the Government proposal and the provision now in the Bill. The clause, as it stands, provides that before the Court grants a preference to unionists it must be satisfied that a majority of those affected endorse the application. I within the discretion of the Court to say whether or not a majority is represented by the applicants. Under the Government proposal, practically the same provision would be made with regard to the numbers represented by any organization that might apply for preference. The Court, before directing that preference shall be given, must be satisfied that the organization substantially represents the industry affected in point of numbers.",43
352,Mr WEBSTER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,And what else?,44
353,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I am now dealing with the numbers, because, as the provision now stands, no reference is made to competence. I am dealing with the points of similarity between the Government proposal and the proviso in the Bill. The clause, as it stands at present, provides that the majority must assent before the Court can grant a preference. I contend that exactly the same condition must prevail under the amendment suggested by the Government.",44
354,Mr DAVID THOMSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Then why should all this fuss be made; why do not honourable members accept the Government proposal ?,44
355,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I want to know what all the fuss is about. Is not the amendment suggested by the Government intended to afford them an easy stairway by which they can escape from a difficult situation? It seems to me to be that, and nothing more.",44
356,Mr DAVID THOMSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,No . We think there is a difference.,44
357,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I grant that there may be legitimate grounds for a difference pf opinion.,44
358,Mr THOMAS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Does the honourable member think that there is no difference?,44
359,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Substantially , I do not think there is any difference with regard to the numbers who will be required to endorse the application for preference. There is, however, a difference between the Government proposal and the provision in the Bill, in so far as the Government amendment refers to the question of competence.",44
360,Mr HUGHES,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member has already been told that the provision which the Government propose is based upon the practice adopted by the New South Wales Court.,44
361,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,It does not follow that we should adopt the provision because it is contained in the New South Wales Act.,44
362,Mr HUGHES,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I did not say that. I said that it followed the practice adopted t will be by the New South Wales Court.,44
363,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Eve n so, it does not follow that we should adopt it.",44
364,Mr HUGHES,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,No ; but that affords an excellent reason why the Government should bring it forward.,44
365,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,There is no provision for preference in the Western Australian Arbitration Act.,44
366,Mr CARPENTER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,That is a great defect in the Act.,44

I have already stated, in connection with clause 48, and my vote on a former occasion proved the truth of my words, that I am prepared to give preference to members of organizations. I think that it is essential to the efficient working of the Bill that practically every person engaged in any industry should become a member of an organization. The Bill can never really be made effective unless we can deal with the workers as members of organizations. I differ from the Government and their supporters, however, with regard to the provisions which should be embodied in the rules of industrial organizations. I do not think that the organizations should be permitted to coerce persons to subscribe to objects other than those which are contemolated by the Bill.  to that matter have been omitted.",44

What happened? Its applicaground tion was refused, because its rules were deemed to be repugnant to any fair-minded facts. man. That, I think, is sufficient justificaassertions. tion for my attitude upon this question. Honourable members opposite have threatened us with all sorts of pains and penalthey ties because of our action upon the present occasion. We have been told that solution of Parliament will follow the defeat of the Ministry. I have contested three elections within a period of twelve months, and have had an appeal lodged with the Elections and Qualifications Compeal mittee against my return thrown in. Conshuffling upon my part. sequently, threats of that sort have no rors for me. When I go down, I shall do so with a clear conscience. Now that this issue has been raised, I do not think that the Government or their supporters can show us any justification for ment again. the lamentations which we have heard from every speaker upon the other side of the chamber. The gauntlet has been thrown down. It has been thrown down upon a question of policy upon which the Government have had a month' to rethat flect.

Those who would not support the amendment submitted by the present Minister of Trade and Customs were branded as traitors to the cause of conciliation and arbitration. I can speak upon this matter as one who has had some experience of strikes and of the evils resulting from them. No sane man who is familiar with the conditions which obtain amongst the dependents of the workers during the period in which a strike is in progress can fail to deplore the evils attendant upon it . There is no fair-minded individual-n o matter to what class he may belong-wh o will not royally welcome any legislative enactment which will have the effect of preventing these industrial troubles, with all the disastrous consequences that follow in their train.

It was urged that if honourable members, opposite had to choose between depriving unions of the power to utilize their organizations for political purposes and offering them this Bill, they would throw this measure to the winds.

I did not say that there would be an intricky one. dustrial dispute within the next three months, but I did say that in a strike occurring, as the result of the action of honourable members of the Opposition hanging up this Bill, they accept the responsibility. ""'",47
403,Sir WILLMM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE," I trust honourable members will bear with me to-night, as I am suffering from a very severe cold, and can scarcely speak. I not intend to detain the House at motion, length, but' I cannot refrain from making a few comments on some of the extraorHonorable dinary phases of the speech made by honourable member for Moira, who preceded me. He is an honourable member for whom I have the greatest respect;",47
404,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,So we all have.,47
405,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I admire his consistency, but on this occasion he appears to have allowed his feelings to run away with his judgment. He has accused the those who support them, of dented course objecting to the unprecewhich has been adopted by member for Coriprompted, I have no doubt, by the right honourable member for East Sydney. an honourable member, whom I have always regarded as a fair-minded man, such a charge, I cannot help think that on this occasion something has gone wrong with his reasoning faculties. I defy the honourable and learned member for Corinella, the right honourable member for views East Sydney, and, indeed, any member of the Opposition, to bring foraccordward a precedent for the action now They cannot refer me to any parallel case. I admit that occasionally, when a Ministry have proposed to recommit an unimportant jusclause,, they have met with opposition; but to I do not know of any case in which a proby posal by a Government to recommit a clause, so important a question as this, as has been treated in this manner. I have been in public life almost as long as has amendany honourable member in this House. I cannot say what is the position of the repreof Victoria, but I have had a r longer unbroken public career than has stated, any other honourable member from adNew South Wales; yet I cannot call to mind one case which approaches the technically tricky position with which we are now",47
406,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I remember a,47

409,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"The honourable member remembers that when I discovered that a sum of money had been paid as a bribe to an honourable member I made it the do subject of an amendment to a substantive as soon as I ascertained what was - the reason for the giving of that bribe. members know that it was the the right honourable member for East Sydney who gave that bribe, and that, in. consequence of that action, he went out of office. What' was the his'tory of that bribe of ^-356 to which I'refer? ' ",47
410,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I must ask honourable members not to interject so loudly and so frequently, and I appeal to the honourable member for Hume to confine himself to the question under discussion, which is clause 48.",48
411,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"In justification of my position, Mr Speaker, I would point out that I was induced to make these observations by the interjection of the honourable member for North Sydney.",48
412,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member was discussing the point before I interjected.,48
413,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"No . The honourable member is mistaken if he thinks that I had that point in view when he interjected. I shall not make any further reference to the matter, but I repeat that the amendment now before the House has been trickily submitted. The position is a grave one, and those who are prepared to allow the full light of aay to shine on all their actions during a public career extending over many years feel that it is degrading that honourable members should be afraid to challenge the Government in a proper manner. There are two ways in which to deal with a question of this kind. It is open to the Opposition to challenge the Government - by a direct motion of want of confidence, or to endeavour to defeat them by a side-wind; but it has always been understood that when the life of a Government is at stake the fullest possible discussion should be allowed. What is the history of this attack on the Ministry? The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was introduced by the Deakin Administration, of which I was a member. The honourable member for Moira has compared my consistency with that of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and I therefore feel constrained to deal with a matter which I should not otherwise have mentioned. I venture to think that there are not many men who, like me. have risked their advancement in public life before entering this Federal House, and are prepared to do so again, even if they stand alone, rather than follow the right honourable member for East Sydney. The right honourable member's face is wreathed in smiles. - Mr Reid - Tell us",48
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The right honHe orable member will have an opportunity speak after I have concluded.,48
415,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,He has not the pluck.,48
416,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Sometime s he has courage, but on other occasions his heart fails him. Let me deal with the course of events leading up to the present situation. This Bill, as introduced by the Deakin Government, did not apply to the railway servants of the States, and it was because of their defeat on the amendment to extend its provisions to those public officers that that Government went out of office. ' I presume that the honourable member for Kennedy was referring to the attitude which I took up in regard to that question when he compared my consistency with that of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. But my late colleagues know that from the very outset I was in favour of the extension of the Bill to all railway servants, and that I told my constituents so. Had it not been for a statement made by the Premier of Victoria, I should not have been compelled, as I was, in loyalty to my colleagues, to vote for the Bill as it stood. When the late Government retired I was free to exercise my individual judgment and to give effect to the view of the question that I had put before my constituents. My colleagues knew that I favoured the extension of the Bill to the railway servants of the States and of the Commonwealth, and surely when I was at liberty to give effect to that view, I had a right to do so, and, therefore, should not now be charged with inconsistency.",48
417,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I was referring to the vote on the amendment to exclude agricultural and horticultural labourers from the operation of the Bill.,48
418,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I think that I voted against the inclusion of agricultural labourers.,48
419,Mr MCCOLL,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,That is so.,48
420,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"As a matter of fact, when the Bill was being drafted, I was opposed to their inclusion, and therefore was not inconsistent in voting in that way.",48
421,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"But the Bill, as introduced by the Government of which the honourable member was a member, applied to them - '",48

That was mv position, and when I found myself at liberty to exercise my individual judgment, I did not see why I should not so. The right honourable member .for Swan knows that what I say is correct.",48
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"It is, and it suits my position exactly. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - As soon as the right honourable member was out of office, went round like a whirlwind, and we have not yet felt the last whirl of that whirlwind.

442,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I will endeavour to confine my remarks to the question. he The honourable and learned membqr for was quite justified, viewing the matter from his stand-point, in moving the is proviso which was added to the clause. The is Government, however, consider that it destroyed an important and practically a vital of the Bill, and they took what was about the only course they could take, short of actually resigning, in regard to it. They intimated that they would ask of the House to recommit the Bill, with a view to reconsidering its decision in regard to to the clause. That was the proper and constitutional course to take. The Prime Minister, shofrtly after making that announcement, said that it would take a week or two for the Cabinet to consider the amendments which would probably have to be moved on the recommittal, and I was surprised, therefore, to hear the honourable member for Moira to-night accuse the Government of having deliberately delayed the consideration of the measure.",49

Although I was unsuccessful in obtaining the adoption of the site which I favoured, I submit without grumbling, and give the Ministry credit for having stuck to the measure.

If honourable members have not the right lo do that, they may be placed in a very awkward position. For example, you may not hear some unparliamentary language; but surely honourable members who do hear it should be allowed to draw your attention to it.",51
467,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I should be very far from stating that any honourable member was not free to raise a point of order whenever he pleased. Every honourable member has that right, and if , at any time, I miss a remark honourable members may properly call my attention to it. I suggest, however, that they should abstain, as far as may be practicable, from taking points of order again and again, and relv upon my watchfulness. Sir 'WILLIAM LYNE - The action taken by the Opposition will have the effect of preventing the Government from placing before the country anything more than their policy with regard to clause 48. They cannot discuss such matters as preferential trade,, or the offering of the iron and other bonuses. If the result of the vote on the present occasion is, as expected, to displace the Government, and to hand over to a new Ministry the administration of all such matters as those relating to the maintenance of a White Australia",51

470,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I shall do everything I can to keep the honourable member to the point.,51
471,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I have no doubt that the honourable member will decline to extend to me the courtesy that he would exhibit to any other member of this House-; but I can put up with'that. the Mr HUGHES - The honourable member for Macquarie will get his thirty pieces.,51
472,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"If the Government are defeated, and ejected from office, the new Ministry will take charge of a number of important matters, with regard to which we are unfortunately unable to enlighten the country at the present time. With regard to the statement that a threat has been made that if the Bill were lost a great strike would occur, I may say that I lisa tened attentively to the statements of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and he certainly did not make any threat. What he said was that those who destroy the Bill must bear the responsibility if a strike unfortunately took place. It is not fair to endeavour to fasten upon the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, or upon any other honourable member, a statement which he did not make. I think that honourable members generally would regard with sorrow anything in the shape of a great industrial conflict. The object of this Bill is to prevent the possibility of anything of that kind. I support the proposal of the Government, first, in the interests of fair play, and, secondly, because it is based upon the practice followed by the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. The Arbitration Act in that State goes a great deal further than is proposed under the Bill now before us. For instance, farm labourers are brought within the jurisdiction of the Court, and there is practically no limitation to the scope of the measure in that regard.",51
473,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Order . I would direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that he is referring to agricultural labourers, who are not in any way dealt with in clause 48.",51
474,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I was certainly making an incidental reference to them, but not with the object of acting contrary to your ruling. I simply wished to point out that, notwithstanding the dreadful consequences which some Honourable members appear to apprehend from the passing of this measure, it is not nearly so drastic as is the New South Wales Act. All I desire to do is to make my position absolutely, clear. I feel that I cannot, under any circumstances, support the Opposition, composed as it is, and led by the individual who is at its head. Whatever may be the result, even though I stand alone. I shall be consistent- I shall not be consistent in my inconsistency. am not going to sacrifice my principles for the sake of office, and I do not intend to form one of a protectionist tail under a discredited free-trade leader.",52
475,Mr KENNEDY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"As a matter of personal explanation, I desire to say that the honourable member for Hume stated that I had accused him of inconsistency in connection with the vote which he gave with reference to the extension of the operation of the Bill to public servants. What I did say was that the honourable member voted for the exclusion of agricultural labourers from the operation of the Bill, although, as a member of the Deakin Government, he was one of those who introduced the Bill, which originally embraced the agricultural industry. The honourable member also stated that I had accused the Government of undue delay in dealing with this Bill. I made no such statement. I commended the Government for the despatch with which they had dealt with the measure, but I did say that since clause 48 had previously been before the Committee, the Government had had something like a month for reflection, and that their suggested amendment represented their mature judgment. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - T am sorrv to see so much heat imparted to the debate by some honourable members. There is no necessity for any extraordinary trouble over the matter. As a party, we are game to die to-night. There is no hesitation on our part. For the three months during which I have been sitting on this side of the House I have felt like a muzzled Rocky Mountain tiger cat, and the sooner WJ can go over to the Opposition benches, the better I shall' be pleased. I do not see why the prospect of the right honourable member for East Sydney coming over to this side of the House should arouse any great excitement. What we object to is the way in which the Opposition are taking advantage of the Government. No opportunity is being afforded to honourable members to discuss the vital issues before the country. If the right honourable member for East Sydney had moved a no confidence motion, and succeeded in ejecting the Government from the Treasury benches, we should have been satisfied. Under present conditions, however, we are absolutely muzzled, because we are prevented from discussing anything but clause 48. The action of the Opposition might be all right, viewed from the stand-point I of the Tammany Hall bludgers or the sand-baggers of Pennsylvania or the Louisiana Kuklux clans, but it is altogether out of place in a British Legislature. Ever since I have been here, British institutions have been held up to me as the glorious apotheosis of liberty and righteousness. We are not troubled at the prospect of crossing over to the other side of the House, but we should like to have an opportunity to discuss clause 48 in Committee. How can we go into Committee, when the numbers are against us ? I do not blame the right honourable . member for East Sydney. He is playing the political' game. '",52
476,Mr HUGHES,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"He is playing a very dirty game. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is a Tammany Hall game. I had hoped that there would be no political trickery or dodgery in this Parliament, but we now have presented to us a sorrowful and pathetic sight. When I look across the chamber and see the sadness depicted in the faces of honourable members opposite, I realise that in their heart of hearts they feel ashamed of what they are doing. I ask them to repent.",52
477,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"As k them to testify. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not ask them to speak, because they have the numbers. It is for those who have not the numbers to speak. The essence of democratic government consists in the preservation of human rights, and no . scheming or trickery should be indulged in which would endanger those rights. Honourable members opposite have set themselves up as the party of negation. In this great Parliament, of the Commonwealth we are absolutely tied up. known nothing like it in the United States Congress. When that body was discussing the great Ben Butler case, there was nothing like that which we now see here. I admit that the Labour Government have not occupied the Treasury benches for any great length of time.",52
478,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"That has nothing to do with clause 48. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I quite agree with you, sir; but nearly all the great discussions that we have had in this House have turned upon matters that have had nothing to do with the question before the Chair. I understand that a majority of honourable members are opposed to the recommittal of this clause. It is absolutely certain, therefore, that it cannot be recommitted, and if that be so, what is the use of endeavouring to recommit it? It must be painfully evident to all that there is a section of this House which does not exactly know where it is. Either honourable members or the Ministerial supporters are at sea. After the skipper of a vessel has been driftin g at sea, in storm and darkness, for a prolonged period, what is the first thing which he endeavours to do? He endeavours to ascertain his bearings. I wish to 'ascertain our bearings, so that we may determine exactly our position. When speaking upon this question, some time ago. the honourable member for Franklin declared that the miners of the West Coast of Tasmania are not in favour of granting a preference to unionists.",53
479,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I did not say that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Well , the honourable member said something to that effect. I hold in my hand a letter which I have received from the secretary of the Amalgamated Miners' Association, at Zeehan, bearing upon this point. This communication is important, as showing that the people of the West Coast of Tasmania are favourable to the extension of a preference to unionists.",53
480,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,How many persons resident in that locality belong to that union ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is a great crowd in Zeehan.,53
481,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,No objection can be urged against a preference being granted to them if they constitute a majority.,53
482,Mr KING OMALLEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I am not prepared to say that they do constitute a maI have jority. The letter to which I have referred readsMr K . O'Malley, M.H.R. Dear Sir,-During the debate on the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill now before the Federal House, a statement was made by Mr MCWilliams that the workers of Tasmania were satisfied with the existing state of affairs, and did not desire arbitration. This has caused a great deal of adverse comment here on the West Coast, where the population is more or less of a cosmopolitan description, being composed of workers who have travelled the whole, not only of Tasmania, but in most cases of the Commonwealth. The feeling here, which, I believe, is shared by the workers throughout Tasmania, is that the passing of the Arbitration Act will mark a new era in the history (industrially) of. every portion of Australia ; and in place of wishing to revert to the old order of things, we look forward to the passing of the Arbitration Bill as a further step in the march of progress and democracy. I trust that if this expression of dissent from the opinions expressed by the member for Franklin will assist you or any member of the Ministry in their efforts to place this important and progressive measure on the Statute Book of the Commonwealth you will not hesitate to use it. With every good wish for your continued prosperity, and regards from ' inquiring friends, I am, yours sincerely, S. FORD, Zeehan.",53
483,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Does the honourable member say that that communication relates to the proposal to grant a preference to unionists ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Indirectl y it does. It is not couched in the language of a lawyer, but in that of the ordinary miner.",53
484,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"The question immediately before the Chair is not the passing of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , but the recommittal of a clause which relates to the granting of a preference to unionists.",53
485,Mr KING OMALLEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Exactly. That is the position which these miners take up. They say that without a preference to unionists the B i ll will prove inoperative.,53

487,Mr KING OMALLEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I would not say that, because I do not think that we have a right to attribute ulterior motives to one another. I wish to put the position as fairly as possible. In the absence of this provision, can any honourable member assure me that there is any power on earth to enforce an award against an individual workman? If a wealthy individual against whom judgment has been recorded in a civil action fails to satisfy that judgment, his property can be sold at public auction. But if a preference is not granted to unionists, how can any award of the Arbitration Court be enforced against the individual workman? Such a preference must be granted, because the trades unions represent the capital of their members. Personally, I should much prefer to institute an action against a strong unionist organization than against a solitary workman. How can we extract blood from a stone? Honourable members are being starved upon a stipend of ^ 4 0 0 a year; but what I wish to know is how we can enforce an award against the individual workman.",53

I do not think that my honourable friends opposite have studied this question. They have been consumed with too great an anxiety to displace the Ministry. I know that the right honourable member for East Sydney is usually a most reasonable individual. But, reasoning with a man who has renounced his reason, is like administering medicine to a dead mule.

The more we examine this question from a financial stand-point, the more we shall come to the conclusion that labour must be organized.

In their anxiety to jump the seats of the present Ministry they have neglected to study this question.",54
492,Mr KELLY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"What question? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member should go home and sleep upon it. I believe that he is open to reason, but he should recollect that prejudice is the deadliest enemy of investigation.",54

This is a socialistic House, and we are all partners.",54

499,Mr KING OMALLEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"It is remarkable how a man will wander away from the question. I believe in preference to unionists, and think that we should give effect to that principle in the Bill . I am anxious that honourable members should consider this question in an impartial manner, and, banishing all sordid considerations, endeavour to deal with it on its merits. I appeal to honourable members to say how an award could be enforced if , each individual in the land had to be dealt with separately?",54
500,Mr GB EDWARDS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,No one proposes anvthing of the kind.,54
501,Mr KING OMALLEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"If it were merely necessary to found organizations consisting of 100 members each, and having only a few pounds at their disposal-the moneys of the unions on which they were based being kept entirely apart from the organizations themselves-it would be impossible to give effect to any award imposing penalties upon them. That, however, would be the position if the course proposed by the Opposition were adopted. I should like honourable members not to be carried away by the awful fears which some appear to entertain in regard to members of the Labour Party. They are no more dangerous than are members of any other party in the House. They are endeavouring to carry out that which they believe to be in accordance with the principles of justice. Some persons have not so clear a conception of the principles of justice as have others, but every member of the Labour Party is filled with his mission to repletion. So far as this question is concerned, the Labour Party are missionaries among the heathen. Honourable members remember that the cannibals in Fij i used to eat missionaries",54
502,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"That question has nothing to do with the matter before the House. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I bow to your ruling, sir.",55

504,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"The honourable member is out of order. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I agree with you, sir. Unions may exist among savages. We had various unions among the Yaqui Indians in Mexico, and the Grand Sagamore used to sit back in his chair, while the members fell at his feet to worship him. We are making a great mistake in proposing to deal with this question without carefully investigating it. It is proposed to turn out of office a Ministry which, during its short career, has set a splendid example to the world. I should not object so strongly to their defeat if it took place after the presentation of our case in the clearest possible way, so that the people might judge for themselves of the attitude which we take up. But I seriously object to the action of the Opposition, for we have no such opportunity to discuss the general question as we should have if a straight-.out motion of want of confidence were submitted. Many persons condemn the Labour Party-me n who have no chance to place their views before the country by means of the press. Could the evil which is in the minds of our opponents die with them, and their bad example also, we might enjoy the luxury of forgetting all about them. That, however, cannot be, because the evil which men do must live after them. The action which honourable members of the Opposition are now taking against the Government may recoil on them with tenfold strength long before they anticipate anything of the kind. Evil and the example of evil acquire tenfold strength when they speak from the grave. We have good memories, and we shall never forget this night. It may be necessary for us to metaphorically gibbet those who are treating the Government in this unchristian, unrighteous, and dishonourable manner, so that with the steel pen of a century to come their names will be written so high, and in letters so black, that their children's children will be ashamed to bear their name. I am sad to-night. When I think of honourable members opposite, after a struggle for protection",55
505,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"The honourable member is again wandering away from the subject. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I admit, sir, that. I am.

507,Mr SPEAKER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I must ask the honourable member to debate the clause, or to cease speaking. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I come back to the consideration of clause 48. I do not desire in any way to come into conflict with the Chair, but I should like to 'point out that there is at least one essential difference between capital and labour. Labour is an organization possessing a soul, a heart, and a conscience, while capital is an organization that is soulless, heartless, grasping, and vicious.",55

Afterwards, when we come to the clause if we ever get to it-som e honourable members may say that they wish it to read 7» man in one way, whilst I may wish to adopt other phraseology. Surely that will be the time to discuss it. A number of honourable members have sought to persuade us that we should have no alternative but to proadopt the Government proposal, or allow That, however, is in not the case. The question is, is the House to be trusted, or not. Is it to be allowed an opportunity to put the clause right, and I feel on the that I have no right to complain of quite the action taken.. As a Ministry we We came into office without seeking it, and we shall go out without athaving disgraced ourselves. We came into office without cadging, and we shall go out We wish without cringing. All that I can say is that our occupancy of office has provided a beneficial lesson for the country, which will see that a Labour Ministry has been displaced before it has committed any fault that of administration, before it has proposed anything contrary to the programme put of forward by its leaders at the outset. I must say that I think it is fortunate for us that the present course has been followed by the Opposition. It might been difficult for us to explain from platform, to those who are not versed in the intricacies of unionism and arbitration, the difference between the clause as it stands as it would appear if the Government When, however, it comes to a question of taking the conduct of the business of the House, and the we ordinary machinery of Government out of from the hands of Ministers, we can make our to the position clear to the constituencies. can show that, because the one honMinistry has been sneered at as two a Labour Ministry by snobs, therea fore, it has been regarded as not entitled to fair play.

I think we went to the utmost limits in that amendment. 1 I to am not at all sure that we did not go too but we went so far in order to save the Bill from being wrecked. Whenever questhe people ask for bread, whatever we do the - n o matter what the consequences may be stupid - w e shall not give them a stone. When the people are asking for an Arbitration Bill which will work, we shall not give them a Bill which will not work. We were quite willing to exclude from the scope of the Bill for the present the agricultural dustry, domestic occupations, and so forth, to which the House did not think the should apply. But when it becomes question of amending the Bill in such a as to make it useless for any industry hold our hands and say, "" No; we will have nothing of the sort."" I regretted the speech delivered by the honourable ber for Moira, whom I have respected tremely in the Victorian Parliament here. I did not understand the unjust in which he treated the action of the Ministry in regard to the Bill now before us and the Seat of Government Bill. I ask any fair man if any unfair advantage, or have been guilty of any trickery. I am quite sure when the honourable member comes to think of it, he will see that this Ministry, whatever its faults may have been, has acted honorthree ably and above board, and has not been vernment. guilty of any underground engineering; that it has fought for its principles, it has not sought office, and that it will it with a good record and an unstained flag.

' The majority of those engaged in any industry cannot be ascertained unless a census is taken. It will be necessary to have practically an electoral roll, practically a revision court, and practically a referendum, and all the machinery necessary for ascertaining who are on this side or on that. Other honourable members have dealt with this measure with a grasp and grip which only experience, can give, and I am not in the position to follow them. I can only avow myself to be convinced by the experience gained in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia that the very best thing for Australia is a good Arbitration Bill, with a very strong preference clause. I do not think that an arbitration measure can be worked without preference to unionists. I know enough from my experience in regard to union delegates having been "" spotted "" by employers, and told that they must stand down without any reason being given. I feel convinced that, unless a preference is given to unionists, the employers will be able to weed out whenever it suits them those men who stand up for the rights of their fellows. I thank honourable members for having listened to me for so long. I do not speak at any great length as a rule, and I do not propose to extend my remarks beyond reiterating that the clause is vague and imperfect, and will not carry out the purposes of its framers.",59
546,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE," I am sorry that the honourable member for Moira is not present. Before he left I directed his attention to certain remarks which he made with regard to the honourable member for Barrier, and he was manly enough to withdraw them. He declared that he would never be a party to voting for preference to unionists unless it was qualified, after hearing the honourable member for Barrier sav that the unions should be political machines, and their funds should be used for political purposes. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Barrier did not say that, and did not speak between the vote for preference to unionists and the vote for the qualification. I have purposely refrained from speaking upon this Bill in order to facilitate its passage through the House. I do not suppose that any honourable member will deny that most of the speeches which have been delivered upon it have emanated from the Opposition side of the Chamber. A reference .to Hansard will establish that fact. Another reason why I did not address myself to this measure was that the other Chamber is absolutely unable to proceed with its legislative work for lack of business. At the present time it is anxiously waiting for this Bill. That House represents the democracy of Australia by the votes of the whole of the States. Shall it be said that honourable members denied to the other branch of the Legislature an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon this Bill ? I confess that I was fairly staggered by the incontestable proof which the Attorney-General advanced that this very provision has never been debated. In the Victorian Parliament I have seen many Ministries displaced from office, but I have never known methods to be employed similar to those which are being adopted in the present instance. This Government would have welcomed a straight-out want of confidence motion, the discussion upon which would not have been limited. During the two election contests for the representation of Melbourne in this House, the dominant questions raised had reference to protection and the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. After having had two elections and a law suit crammed into the brief space of two and a half months, honourable members will understand that a a little rest would be acceptable to me. Nevertheless, so fond am I of fighting, that if honourable members opposite are willing to appeal to the country, I shall gladly welcome the opportunity of again facing my constituents. Who is responsible for the delav in the passing of this Bill? The columns of Hansard will show that the fault does not rest with the Ministerial supporters. Is it not a significant circumstance that upon an amendment affecting the existence of the Government, neither of the two leaders of the Opposition have uttered a single word ? Where are those leaders now? They should be seated at the table of the House. It seems to me that the honourable and learned member for Corinella must have studied the words of the great American iurist-on e of the greatest jurists in the world-wh o said thatFor the betrayer of a country or of a great cause we have not far to seek. We shall find him in the lawyer ready-made. I know that the honourable and learned member for Corinella acted in a similar manner in the Victorian Parliament, and I am sure that he regretted his action. It is true that by Act of Parliament he could« call himself, as Minister, ""honourable,"" but' his constituents did not endorse his right to that title. I am sorry to have to say that. No man ever entered parliamentary life with better opportunities. His keenest admirers, however, will experience a feeling of regret when they see him attempting by a legal quibble of this kind, to oust the Government from office. Personally, I should much prefer to support the right honourable member for East Sydney, because I have studied a record of the measures which he passed when Premier of New South Wales, than the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. The former, with the assistance of the Labour Party, was instrumental in placing some very good laws upon the statute-book of that State. But I cannot find any record of a single good measure which has been passed at the instance of the honourable and learned member, for Ballarat, and I challenge anybody else to point to one.",60
547,Mr MCCOLL,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Who introduced the first Factories Bill?,61
548,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"But did not I receive my first cold douche when, a few weeks after the magnificent meeting which he addressed in the Melbourne Town Hall,. I asked him if he would imake an attempt to put down sweating? His reply was, "" How can we put down sweating ?""",61
549,Mr MCCOLL,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,What about the Factories Act?,61
550,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable and learned member for Ballarat never accomplished as much good in the Victorian Parliament as did the honourable member for Echuca. Does any honourable member of this House affirm that it is possible give effect to the principles contained in this Bill unless a preference be granted to unionists? Why do honourable members object to the Government proposal ? I do not believe that there is any member in - this House who wishes to see a continuance of the accursed system of strikes. legal union is the strongest union in the world.,61
551,Mr FISHER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,But the learned professions are privileged.,61
552,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"They will not be privileged when the proletariat obtain the voting power, when the universities of the world are thrown open to the children of the workers. The honourable member for Franklin declared that it was slavery to compel a man to conform to the judgment of the Arbitration Court. I admit that the honourable member is an honest opponent, but his criticism of the Bill reminds me very forcibly of those persons who used to argue that the prosperity of England would disappear if the employment of child labour were prevented by the Factories Act. I am sure that if he had read the words used in this connection by one of the greatest of English nobles- I refer to Lord Shaftesbury-h e would never forget them. In volume I . , page 418, of his Life by Edwin Hodder, his Loidship says:We were told that without the employment of child labour the pits could not possibly be worked with a profit, for after a certain age the vertebrae of the back do not conform to the required position. The backbone of the child-if it were too old-coul d not bend to the proper position. Consequently, children of five years of age were preferred, and they died like flies in a summer swamp. The honourable member for Dalley, in his straightforward way, has declared that he is not a member of the Labour Party, and that he always has to fight its candidates. I trust that they will always fight him"" fairly. He says that he wishes to secure a workable measure. But is he not aware that this particular clause has never been properly considered? How does he propose to secure its amendment. Would it not be better for the Bill to be reconsidered in Committee, and afterwards transmitted to the other Chamber, so that its members might have an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon it? The Senate is a more democratic Chamber than is this House. Why should we prevent its members from voicing their opinion to upon one of the most important questions which could possibly occupy their attention ? What is more important than the avoidance of strikes? I hold that nobody can advocate that method of settling industrial disputes without doing violence to his intelligence. I am perfectly satisfied that The if the electors were consulted as to whether they would prefer this Bill in the form in which the Government desire that it shall be passed, or in the form which its opponents advocate, they would unhesitatingly declare in favour of the Ministry. They wish to obtain a workable Bill. Since I was returned to this House, upon 30th March last-som e four months ago- I have not occupied ten minutes in discussing, the proposals contained in this measure. If it is now to be thrown aside, the fault does not rest with the Ministry, or with their supporters. It chiefly rests with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. One never knows where he is going, because he possesses no more backbone than does a jelly fish.",61
553,Mr CROUCH,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,That is a most improper and very unfair remark to make. He is a better man than is the honourable member.,62
554,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I do not think that he is, and I know that in every way I am . a better man than is the honourable and learned member who interjects. With the mighty power which .the honourable and learned member for Ballarathad behind him, he could have passed an Arbitration Act in Victoria years ago. The mightiest power in Victoria was at his beck and call for fifteen years, and had he desired he might have been Premier of Victoria years ago.",62
555,Mr WILKS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,He might have had the power of a Czar.,62
556,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"He might, at all events, have been a kind of dictator. There is no such power as that to which I am referring in New South Wales, and during all this period the honourable and learned member had its full support. I wish that he had the backbone of the grey-haired man who has so long exercised that power; if he had democracy would be the better for it. The four months which we have devoted to the consideration of this Bill are to be absolutely wasted. I could have wished that the late Government had been able to pass the Bill into law. One honourable member has said that all should be equal in the eye of the law - It was because of that belief that we endeavoured to extend the provisions of the Bill to the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth. Would it not have been better for the welfare of the Commonwealth had this - Bill become law long ago? I not know that many cigar-makers are today walking the streets of Melbourne in search of employment, ar.d that their position is due to the absence of such a law as this? Did I not meet last week a cigar-maker who had found it necessary to leave Melbourne for Sydney to earn a livelihood because of the action taken by a syndicate or a monopoly in this State? That syndicate is employing girls in South Australia to manufacture cigars at such low rates that many men in this city have been thrown out of employment. would not have been possible had this Bill been passed into law. Men are being deprived of an opportunity to earn a livelihood as cigar manufacturers simply because of the action of this syndicate, which would rob any one in the tobacco trade. If a Royal Commission were appointed to deal with the industry the disclosures which would follow would be almost as bad as the iniquitous and infamous proceedings which have been brought to light by the Butter Commission. What will be the result of the consideration which we have given to this Bill during the last four months? I suppose that if the Government be defeated, and a dissolution does not follow, the incoming Ministry will require an adjournment of something like three weeks, and that we shall then be called upon to go over the whole fight again. If we succeed in carrying the Bill into law by December next we shall be fortunate.",62
557,Mr GROOM,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,We shall not see the Bill again.,62
558,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,I am sure that the honourable and learned member hopes with me that that will not be the case. It Is only by such a Bill as this that we may avoid strikes.,62
559,Mr MCDONALD,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member need not expect to see such a Bill supported by the incoming Government.,62
560,Mr MALONEY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I hope that if , as the result of the attitude which we have taken up in regard to clause 48, the Bill be lost, our masters - the public - will take action. If a referendum were taken the whole question would be very speedily settled. The people of Australia would demand the passing of this Bill, and we should have to carry out their behest. If there is to be a dissolution, I shall gladly welcome it. I shall go into the fight with a light and happy heart; but I do hope that, if we are returned, we shall come back pledged not to grant a preference to unionists subDo ject to all sorts of restriction, but to give the unions some tangible security. We have no desire to lean to either side. Those who ask for preference to unionists are willing that the Bill shall be so framed as to provide that, when unions are in the wrong, they shall be liable to punishment. We are quite willing that, when a union is at fault, it shall be liable to be fined, just as an employer, who is in the wrong, should be liable to punishment. I have today experienced the bitterness of seeing in our gallery some of the men who organized the That system now in operation in Adelaide, which has had the effect of robbing many men of their means of employment. This state of affairs would not be it possible if a Commonwealth Conciliastands tion and Arbitration Act were in operation. There is no cigar-maker in Australia does not deplore the absence of such a measure, and I believe I may, say the same of those engaged in every industry. I cheerfully face the vote which is to taken on this question, and I am sure that the Government do not fear it. If a solution be granted as the result of the proposal defeat of the Ministry, I am sure that honourable member for Moira will cheerfully face the consequence, and that even if constituents wish him to object to the passnella, ing of the Bill in the form which we desire, they will admit that we should least have had an opportunity to fairly cuss it.",62
561,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE," I wish to state in a very few words why I propose to vote against the honourable and learned member for Corinella's amendment. There are two considerations which appeal to me in conmore nexion with this question. The first rewould lates to the merits of the amendment which has been inserted in clause 48, and has given rise to this discussion, while the second deals with the merits of the amendment now before the iChair. With regard to the derepresent sirableness of preserving the amendment in competency. carried on the motion of the honourable learned member for Corinella, as contrasted with the Government proposal, I think that there are various points which some of honourable friends, who base their opposition to the recommittal of the clause their regard for non-unionists, would do well to consider. There cannot be the slightest doubt that whether ers, we consider the interests of unionists or non-unionists, a fair comparison of of competency. the two amendments must tell heavily in favour of the Government proposal. Both proposals would permit preference to be "" substantially ?"" granted. It cannot be too distinctly emphasized at this stage-havin g regard particularly to the possibilities of the situation in the near future-that both posals assume preference to be given to answer. unionists under certain conditions. There should be no misunderstanding in regard that point. It is a question not of refusbefore ing preference, or of voting that there be no preference, but of admitting prefercannot ence, and of saying what are the fair terms under which it shall be allowed. From the stand-point of the unionists the Governthat ment proposal is infinitely superior, because is workable, while the clause as it now is open to the animadversions which we have heard to-night from the Attorneywho General-animadversion s which, to my mind, are nearly all, if not all, thoroughly well founded. The clause as it stands is a provision that may be evaded, and if not be evaded, may render the whole proposal as to preference either illusory or harsh. So disfar as non-unionists are concerned, the of the oovernment is; the much fairer and much more liberal. The clause, as amended, on the motion of his the honourable and learned member for Coriprohibits the granting of preference where it is not proven to the satisfaction at of the Court that organizations making apdisplication represent a majority in number of the workers of the industryI t says nothing about competency. A mere majority of one, without any other condition, would enable the Court to give any preference that it pleased. On the other hand, the Government proposal, while being much workable in the interests of unionism, conserve the interests of non-unionists. It provides that the Court shall not merely have regard to the bare majority in number; but that it shall see whether the unionists making application substantially the industry, both in numbers and and Mr LONSDALE - How would the Court decide the question of competency?",63
562,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The Court would not be my required to decide what is competency.,63

564,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The Court will hot be required to decide the competency of workbut to determine whether the unionists' substantially represent the industry in point,63
565,Mr LONSDALE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,What is the meaning of,63
566,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Something more than the more honourable member's interjection.,63
567,Mr LONSDALE,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,It is too substantial for prothe honourable and learned member to,63
568,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"If we compare the merits to of the two proposals- I was going to say the House-on e of which is already shall embodied in the clause, while the other be brought before us, although it is within our cognisance, I have no hesitation in saying it must be recognised the Government proposition would be fairer to the Bill, fairer to unionists, and much fairer to non-unionists. If , therefore, my honourable friends on this side of the House, who propose to vote against the Government on this occasion, are sincerely actuated by a desire to preserve the interests of non-unionists, they should cast their votes with the other side. The other phase of the question is, what is the real meaning of the amendment immediately before the House. thoroughly endorse what has been said as to its extraordinary nature. I cannot conceive how any honourable member, desiring fairly to treat this question as a matter to be debated, and to be determined,- could refuse to allow the Government an opportunity to deal with the clause in Committee. The ordinary course of Parliamentary procedure is to deal with such a question in Committee. What is to happen if that course be not followed?",63
569,Mr CONROY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,In this case a full House has given expression to its opinion. Every vote was accounted for.,64
570,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"The honourable and learned member has, perhaps, forgotten that which is within the knowledge of the House, and which has been repeated to-night-tha the division which led to the amendment the clause, on the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, was taken in the last hours of the week. It was taken unexpectedly. The proposal of that honorfollowed able and learned member was that the vote should take place without debate. The Prime Minister expressed the view that had already sufficiently met the wishes the House, but he consented courteously, meet the convenience of the honourable and learned member and others, who desired leave, and allowed the division to be taken without debate. Whatever the decision have been, it was unfortunate that so tant and vital a matter-for it was a matter, however we may regard the merits the question-shoul d have been determined without proper and ordinary consideration.",64

572,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"If the honourable member is perfectly satisfied of the strength of position, why does he not allow the vernment to take the Bill into Committee, and debate the clause there? Of what he afraid ? If he is satisfied of the strength of his argument, why does he not welcome opportunity to take the Bill into Committee and have the matter discussed ? I never knew of an instance in which a man who was convinced of the strength of his argument feared to put it to the test. I have had some years of experience in parliamentary government, and I have never yet known an honourable member who was convinced that his position was right, and who yet refused to his opponents the opportunity to test it.",64

If the only desire of honourable members is to fling an insult at the Government, and to oust he it from office, whether it be in the right of or in the wrong, the course now being to taken may be the right one. But it is the invariable practice of Parliaments to allow to a .Government to take its proposals into Committee, and to deal with them there may upon their merits. In Committee objecimportions can be answered, suggestions may vital be made, and there are no limitations of beyond those imposed by his own reasonable discretion upon the number of times which a member can rise to discuss the matter. No 'one would grudge any honourable member, the opportunity to speak more than once in Committee on a question of this magnitude. Yet, we are his now discussing it in the House, where honGoorable members can speak only once.

Of course, they would. They would say that unionists alone should have the opportunity to submit disputes to the Court.

601,Mr GROOM,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Bill-wrecke r number one Not only is there a desire to prevent the Bill from going into Committee for the discussion of this clause, but there has been a wilful abstention on the part of some honourable members from the discussion the merits of the proposal of Government, and when an honourable member wishes to discuss it a taunt is hurled at him the moment he rises tralian Act. to speak. This is done by the members of the party who claim to give fair play to all. I think that in this matter the Government are not receiving fair play Opposition, and particularly from those who are not desirous of having the prinexercise ciple of compulsory arbitration placed the statute-book of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has treated the House in this matter with a degree of fairness ciple which has never been surpassed in this liament. The position he has taken up in regard to the Bill is that there are certain vatives. provisions in it which are vital, and other provisions which may be modified. of the vital provisions is that which gives preference to unionists. But the honourable gentleman has allowed modifications which were never even hinted at during the reading debate. The leader of the Opposivision tion has expressed himself as a firm believer fication whatever, 7 E in compulsory arbitration. He is not going to his constituency as an opponent of that principle. He does not believe in voluntary submission to a self-constituted board. He stands before the public of Australia as a believer in the principle of compulsory arbitration. He is also pledged to a coalition cerwith the party led by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who is also a supporter of compulsory arbitration. Therefore, should we go to the country, there will be no misunderstanding as to the issue. It will be not whether there shall or shall not be compulsory arbitration, but whether there shall or shall not be fair discussion. That is the sole issue now. It is not a question of preference or no preference to unionists. The House has affirmed the principle of preference to unionists, and the question is now whether a small modification shall be made, and whether we shall have in the Bill a proviso which is workable or a proviso which is not workable. What position has the Prime Minister taken up in respect to the clause? The Bill was introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, as ! Attorney-General in the Barton Govern! ment, and on each occasion on which the Bill has been before the House it has embodied the principle of preference to unionists, unmodified, and in exactly the sameterms that are adopted in the New South. of Wales.. Western Australian, and New Zeathe land Acts.",66

It is also well known that the right honourable member for East Sydney supported the Bill, and never asked for any modification of the preference clause. The - measure was not attacked by any responsible member of the Opposition on the ground that it contained provision for preference to unionists; but when the Bill was considered in detail, after the defeat of the Deakin Ministry, honourable members attacked the principle. A great many of those who opposed it desired simply to knock out the Bill, whilst others, like the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who throughout has been a conscientious and consistent believer in the Bill, honestly desired some modification.

He agreed to a proviso that before any preference was granted notice must be given to all those engaged in the industry affected, so that any peremployed, sons interested might appear before the Arbitration Court, and raise objections. That was absolutely a new provision that was not to be found in any existing Statute, and yet the Prime Minister was prepared to accept it. Again, it was urged that men be substituted. might be forced to join unions with jects repugnant to them, and the Prime Minister expressed himself as willing to cept an amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, to enable the Court to suspend its award in cases where it had directed that preference per consideration. should be given, and review the rules of the unions concerned. At the instance of the honourable and learned member for larat, a provision was made that if rules of an organization proved to be pressive or obnoxious, the person aggrieved could make application to have them led. That was the third modification ted by the Prime Minister. It was urged honourable members .that some of the unions were political organizations, and that might be compelled to join those bodies against their inclinations. Again, the Prime Minister was prepared to meet the objection in a fair and reasonable way. He accepted an amendment to the effect that, before preference could be granted, the Court must be satisfied that the rules of the applicant union were of a non-political character. I contend that he has treated the Committee with the utmost fairness. Even at this moment, he says, "" I am willing to go a still further stage, and to provide that before any preference can be given, the Court shall be satisfied that the organization applying for it substantially represents the majority of the persons affected, both as to numbers and competency."" Let us compare the state of the clause as introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the provision as it now stands with the modifications agreed to by the Prime Minister. It contains no less than six conditions, and all that the Prime Minister asks is that at least the House shall do him the courtesy of considering the justice of his proposal. Mr KELLY.:-What is the proposal ?",67
612,Mr GROOM,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The honourable member,67
613,Mr KELLY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Yes ; but what does "" subwas disstantially represents "" mean?",67
614,Mr ISAACS,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,That is a matter to be in Committee.,67
615,Mr GROOM,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"If if is only a mere question as to the particular words to be let us consider the clause in Committee, and adopt the right phraseology. I am sure that the Prime Minister will not take up too rigid an attitude with regard to that. If other words would have the same effect as those which he proposes, they could I think that the Prime obMinister has treated the Committee with every courtesy and respect, and that he is acperfectly justified in asking that honourable members shall have an opportunity to consider a proviso which was inserted as the result of a snatch vote, and without pro",67
616,Mr MCCAY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,That is not correct.,67

It is a want of confidence motion in disguise, and is being supported cancelby honourable members who are not preacceppared to attack the Government upon the by weakness of their administration. I am not appearing here as a defender of the men Government, but I claim that every honourable member should receive fair play, and be afforded a fair opportunity to consider the clause. The Opposition have taken white. up the position that those honourable members who have not already expressed opinions shall not have an opportunity to do so in Committee, and shall not be permitted to consider the rival proposals, cedents already laid down. or to suggest any other amendments.

I feel that this is an occasion upon which we are justified in expressing our opinions, and that we are entitled to know the true reasons which are actuating honourable members in voting against the Government. It is not fair to attack the Government under cover of a motion of this description. If the merits of the rival proposals considered, it would be found that the vision in the Bill would not compare with the amendment suggested by the Prime Minister. Even if the clause were passed in its original form, there would not be valid reason for throwing the Bill on one side, because it would simply make proists vision for the principle which has been adopted in the States Acts, under which Courts are exercising a reasonable tion. They do not give mere arbitrary rulings, but in each case require that dence shall be given which would justify them in granting a preference. act according to intelligible principles. They do not grant a preference unlearned less it is shown that the organization courage member applying substantially represents those endumb dog. gaged in the industry affected. Judge Edwards, in giving judgment in the Zealand Court, in one case refused prefertions ence on the ground that the union .did not really represent the greater number of sons employed in the trade. I have looked up the decisions of the New House. South Wales Court, and I find that Judge 'Cohen practically acts on the same Speaker. principle.

620,Mr GROOM,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Exactly . The Court can always vary its award, and the Prime Minister has anticipated many objections by accepting a provision under which notice must be given to the persons likely to be affected by an award, so that they may have an opportunity of representing their case before preference is granted. Therefore, every safeguard 'is being prowere vided. We should make it perfectly proclear that in this Bill the granting of preference is to be purely discretionary. Several articles have appeared in the newspapers, and several speeches have been any made at banquets and elsewhere, from which it would appear that preference to unionis to be made compulsory. That is an absolute misrepresentation. I should not the like to see preference unduly given or discregranted without discrimination. Mr .CONROY - The honourable and evilearned member said that he would vote for absolute preference. Why has he not They the courage of his opinions?",68

622,Mr MCDONALD,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I apologize, Mr.",68
623,Mr GROOM,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I was pointing out that the granting of preferences was to be purely optional, and that the Court would not act is until a full investigation had been made. The discretion to grant preferences is to be given to a Judge who is to be selected on account of his integrity, ability, and learning, and also because of the confidence which .he will command from all - classes of the community. Further than that, we shall know that he cannot be removed from his high office unless for some proved misconduct. Therefore, the cretion will be exercised by a reliable and responsible person, to whom we may fairly look for fair and impartial decisions. Some of the greatest strikes have arisen owing to unionists being called upon to work with non-unionists, and some honourable members desire to take away from the Court the means of disposing of one of the most fruitful sources of trouble. It is desirable that we should proceed to a division as soon as possible, and also that the attitude of honoinble members upon a principle which has been approved by the whole of the constituencies of the Commonwealili should be fully understood. Our cotuiituencies sent us here to pass an Act dealing with compulsory arbitration. That measure has been before us upon two occasions, and, with the exception of one amendment, it has been fully discussed. But at this stage honourable members who desire to do what is fair and just are blocked by an intrigue to displace the Ministry. I shall not lend myself to such a proceeding, and, therefore, I shall vote for the recommittal of the clause. Motion (by Mr MCDONALD) proposed - That the debate be now adjourned. Mi. SYDNEY SMITH (Macquarie) I should like to know when the Government propose to conclude this discussion. The Opposition have no desire to avoid fair debate. On the contrary, we wish to do everything to facilitate discussion.",68
624,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,The Opposition have a peculiar method of showing it.,69
625,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"There has been no attempt on the part of the Opposition to prevent full discussion. I understand that the Prime Minister desires to bring the debate to a conclusion, and, under the circumstances, I think that my question is a fair one.",69
626,Mr MAUGER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE," I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will not consent to curtail this debate in any way. A number of honourable members upon this side of the House are desirous of speaking, and the question involved is too important to be rushed.",69
627,Mr WATSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"Bland-Treasurer) The Government have no desire to prolong the debate unduly. It is a fact that this evening the right honourable member for East Sydney made a most insulting insinuation in this connection, and one which I resent. At the same time, the Governdisment would not be justified upon an occasion of this sort in attempting to close the mouths of honourable members sitting behind them.",69
628,Mr CONROY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,It is just a little too early to adjourn.,69
629,Mr WATSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I do not think so. We have to reassemble at half-past ten o'clock tomorrow morning, and I do not suppose that all honourable members possess the physique of the honourable and learned member.  see all the members of the Opposition present.",69
630,Mr WATSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I admit that that is rather unusual; but I suppose they think that the end justifies the means. The Government fee] that it is their duty to facilitate the delivery of any remarks which their supporters may desire to make. The present is an important occasion, and I do not think that honourable members opposite can take the slightest exception to a reasonable statement of the views of Ministerial supporters upon this subject. The procedure which has been adopted on the present occasion very considerably limits the scope of the debate, so that honourable members cannot make very long speeches. For that reason we need not fear that the discussion will be unduly prolonged.",69
631,Mr KELLY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Will the Prime Minister promise to close the debate tomorrow ?,69
632,Mr WATSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I shall not attempt to close it before all those honourable members who desire to speak have had an opportunity of addressing themselves to this.question. I have asked Government supporters to curtail their remarks as far as they possibly can, with a view to bringing the debate to a close as early as possible.",69
633,Mr KELLY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE," I can assure the Prime Minister that I have no desire to add to the present embarrassments of the Government in any way. I merely wish to draw attention to the fact that when we were discussing the preference clause in Committee the honourable and learned member for Corio asked for an adjournment of the debate some time after 11 p.m. The Prime Minister thereupon repliedWe have been dealing with this clause for the past three days. That cannot be called burking discussion The principle underlying clause was also discussed on the second reading debate, and upon other occasions, so that it is not asking too much to ask for a division to. night. However, I am prepared to adjourn upon the understanding that there will be a division tomorrow. To-day, without taking into consideration the last two speakers, the Government supporters have occupied 280 minutes, and Opposition members only 78 minutes.",69
634,Mr MCDONALD,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Why will not the Opposition speak?,70
635,Mr KELLY,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"It seems to me that, judging from the speeches of Government supporters, it is quite unnecessary for members of the Opposition to say anything upon this question. I only rose to point out that the Prime Minister's present attitude is considerably discounted by the attitude he took up in Committee on this same clause 48 when the numbers lay with him; and not with us.",70
636,Mr REID,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE, I regret that I was absent from the chamber when the adjournment of the debate was moved. I am sure that there can be no possible objection to such a motion.

637,Mr WATSON,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,Certainly .,70
638,Mr REID,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"In the heat of debate we often make observations that would be better left unsaid, but I wish to say at once that I do not, for a moment, seriously accuse the Government as has been supposed.",70

642,Mr REID,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"When I am endeavouring to act fairly my honourable friend may just as well not make such observations. I can reply to him either way- I can give him just what he pleases. It is a perfectly reasonable proposal to adjourn the debate,' and I do not offer the slightest. objection 10 that course. That is all. I hope that is not offensive. Mr SPEAKER",70
643,Mr FISHER,REGISTER OF SHEARERS WHO SHORE FOR THE,"I understood the right honourable member desired to make an explanathe tion and withdraw certain statements.
