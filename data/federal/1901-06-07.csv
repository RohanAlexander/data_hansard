0,NA,Unknown,"|l?ousc of i&epmentattbes. Friday, 7 June, 1901. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2 p.m. Mr HUME COOK presented a from Mr John Robertson, M.A., of Moonce Ponds, praying that steps be taken to investigate the subject of legal tender, with a view to its equitable and safe reform. Petition received. Mr BARTON laid upon the tableInstructions passed under the Royal sign manual and signet to the Governor General and Comrnander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth of Australia. STATISTICAL RETURNS. SuW ILLIAM MCMILLAN (Wentworth). - Seeing that there are a number of motions on the business paper for .the .production of statistical returns, J should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if he will be goodenough to have a compilation made of all obtainable information bearing .upon the Tariff question, bringing .the statistics .as - nearly up .to date-as possible. The. statistics which we are using at the present time are the statistics for the year 1899, so that they are almost two years behind time. I think that such a compilation as I ask for would aid honourable members very much in preparing for the consideration of the Treasurer's Budget speech.",14
1,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown," There is no doubt that the State statistics upon which we are depending at the present time are somewhat in arrears j but the Government have been in communication with the State Governments with a view to expediting the preparation of later statistics. The Government fully recognise that it is highly desirable that, in dealing with the Tariff, honourable members should have before them all the available statistical information whioh can be of use to them, and to that end we have had certain statistics collated. I notice that motions are to be moved by various honourable members for the production of statistical returns, and the Government will .be very glad if other honourable-members who may be thinking of moving similar motions will indicate as soon as possible what they require. Our desire is to supply all the available information at the earliest date possible, and any suggestion which will help us will receive our most favourable consideration.",14
2,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"A very good form was followed in dealing with statistics when the Convention was sitting. PETITION. Mr KINGSTON - I should be delighted to petition confer with the honourable member or with any other honourable members on this subject in order to meet their wishes. The sooner we know what honourable members desire, in addition to the information we are preparing, the better it will be for everyone. PAPER. THE FEDERAL CAPITAL.  wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to Seotion 125 of the Constitution, which provides thatThe seat of Government of the Commonwealth shaU bo determined by the Parliament, and BbaU be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, . and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth. A number of sites in various parts of New South Wales have been offered to the Commonwealth, and probably in - each of these sites there is land which is held in fee simple. I therefore ask the right honourable member if anything can be done to get the land placed under offer to the Federal Government prior to the choosing of any site, so that we may not, after having chosen a site, be compelled to p i y very clearly for the property which we have to resume.",14
3,Mr BARTON,Unknown," All considerations of that kind will come under the careful review of the Government, who are giving special attention to the question of the site of the federal capital. DISTRIBUTION OF HANSARD.",15
4,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice What annual subscription must be paid by persons who desire to procure Hansa/rd regularly, and whether Ministers will take steps to make public the places and modes and terms of obtaining it.",15
5,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I intend to make the price 3d. per copy, and the cash subscription 4s. per session, and to give publicity to the matters mentioned by the honourable and learned member. NA",15
6,Mr OMALLEY,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether it is the intention of the Government to make the salaries of the Tasmanian Federal civil Servants equal to those received by Victorian officers holding similar appointments.",15
7,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"This question is involved in the Public Service Bill, the second reading of which will be moved on Tuesday next, and which will include provisions for dealing with matters of this nature. IMPERIAL COURT OF APPEAL.",15
8,Mr ISAACS,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether he has any objection to inform the House1. What communications have passed between the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments relative to the establishment of an Imperial Court of Appeal. 2. What instructions (if any) have been given to Mr Justice Hodges regarding .the Conference to be held with reference to the matter.",15
9,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"(1 ) Communications have taken place on this subject, but as they are confidential, my honourable and learned friend will-see that I am not in a position to disclose them at present. (2) Mr Justice Hodges will represent this Government at the conference, which, it is understood, will be purely consultative. By that I mean that it is expected that, before definite action is taken, there will be further consideration of the subject between the Imperial Government and the Governments of the Dominion and the self-governing States concerned. STATE IMPORTATIONS. Motion (by Mr WILKINSON) proposed- That there be laid before this House a return showing the quantities of the following commodities imported from places beyond the Common' wealth into each of the States now constitutingthe Australian Commonwealth during the three years ending 31st December, 1900 :(a) Maize. (6) Hay,-straw, and chafE, (c) Potatoes. {d) Sugar. (e) Timber (including timber prepared for building purposes, shingles, staves, and empty casks).",15
10,Mr KINGSTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH," The Government have no objection to this motion ; but I should like to repeat my request that honourable members who desire further iuformation will, at the earliest opportunity, indicate what they require, in order to preSERVICE. vent duplication of work. Question resolved in the affirmative. PRAYERS.",15
11,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH," I move That the standing orders should provide that, upon Mr Speaker taking the chair, he shall read, a prayer. I would like to explain why I have ventured to assume 'the responsibility of asking the House to consider this motion. Immediately after the Commonwealth elections I wrote to the head of the denomination with which I am associated, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, asking that body if any steps .were being taken unitedly by the churches to ' secure consideration by Parliament of the need of opening its proceedings by the reading of prayers. I found that the Council of - the Churches, was taking the necessary action, and subsequently I was invited by ""the churches to move a motion. That I felt an honour and a privilege, to which I readily assented, and accordingly I gave notice of this motion. I felt that this action might have been properly provided for in the standing orders, but I found that the Government preferred that it should receive a distinct instruction from .the House,- and I am hopeful that I shall receive the individual port of Ministers. I then interviewed the various churches to get. a personal knowledge of what their views were on the subject. The result was that a circular was issued under which the opinions of the heads of the various religious bodies were placed, I believe, in the' hands of honourable members. The circular was as follows :The Council of Churches in Victoria, deeply impressed with the propriety and necessity of a national recognition of our dependence the blessing of'Almighty Gocl in our prosperity, desires respectfully to urge both Houses of the Federal Parliament that the sittings should be regularly opened wibh suitable form of prayer. To show the practical unanimity with which this desire is expressed, we subjoin communications on the subject from representatives of the different churches, and indulge the hope that you will give monwealth the matter your most favourable considerathe tion. In making this request, we would deprecate any thought of dictation, our motive being entirely to afford information to our lators as to the feeling and desire of the Chrissentiment. tian public on this question. The Archbishop of Sydney and Primate Church, of Australia and Tasmania wrote to ' this was received :effectI desire, on behalf of the Church of England Australia and Tasmania, to express a very earnest hope that the sessions of the Federal Parliament muy be always opened with prayer to Almighty Gocl for His direction and divine blessing. Such a recognition of our dependence upon, and faith in, the Supreme Ruler of the universe is surely public duty which it is befitting for the Houses of Legislature in a Christian Commonwealth perform ; a duty the discharge of which will tend to promote a high standard of political respongious sibility, and to help forward the growth national righteousness. Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne, wrote as follows :As legislators derive their authority ultimately from the Supreme Lawgiver, and are dependent on Him for the knowledge and counsel. and fortitude which are required to "" decree it is fitting and highly advantageous that their deliberations should open with a recognition of the dominion of the Almighty and a humble fully petition for His guidance. I , therefore, earnestly desire that a suitable form of prepared and used at the opening of each session of the Commonwealth Parliament. I shall be prepared to give assistance in drafting or revising such form of prayer as would be acceptable to all who desire the light of Divine wisdom on the deliberations of the people's representatives. The R i g ht Rev. George Tait, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, wrote in these feeling of the people termsI was glad to see on Monday night, as part of I the splendid illumination of our Parliament have Mr Knox. supHouse, the prayer, ""God bless our Commonwealth."" To this prayer, all the people say ""Amen. "" But one of the channels through which God's blessing comes to a nation is righteous and beneficent laws. It seems fitting, therefore, that when our legislators assemble to frame our laws, they should acknowledge their dependence on Almighty God, and seek His guidance and help. I hope that steps will be taken to insert among the standing orders framed for the guidance of the House, one providing that every sitting should be opened with prayer. The Rev. A. IV Edgar, President of the upon Wesleyan Conference, sent the following upon the members of letter:- I beg, on behalf of the Wesleyan Methodist a Churches of Victoria and Tasmania, to suggest that the ordinary sittings of the Federal Parliament, like those of the Legislative Council of the State of Victoria, be opened with prayer. The Constitution Act declares that the Comis undertaken "" ' h u m b l y relying upon blessing of Almighty God."" There was prayer at the open ingot the Parliament last Thursday, and prayer at the beginning of each cbjy's legissession would undoubtedly delight Christian From the Rev. Dr Bevan, Congregational Collins-street, Melbourne, this letter I sincerely hope that the Houses of Parliament in of Australia will see their way to making arrangement for the opening of their sessions by pra3'er. We are certainly a Christian State, and the recognition of our dependence upon God, and our need of His guidance and blessing that, our national life should be strong and lasting, will a be in accordance with the desire and sentiment of the vast majority of our people"". Democratic comto munities as-for example, America-hav e shown that this can be done without infringing the reliliberty of any citizens; and surely the wisdom of and moderation of southern legislators and people will not be incapable of doing that which in a striking and simple, fashion shall make plain our relations to the Lord of Nations by whose strength alone they can be established. I received the following letter from Mr . C. W . Walrond, honorary secretary of the justice,"" Baptist Union of Victoria :- By direction of the Baptist Union I beg respectto forward to you the following resolution, unanimously adopted at the session held at prayer should be Bendigo this week :"" That the Assembly of the Baptist Union, in session assembled, views with much satisfaction the motion tabled in the Senate, and in the House of Representatives, to have the sittings in both Houses dailyopened with prayer, and earnestly hopes and believes that the members will agree thereto."" Other letters representative of the Christian throughout the Commonwealth have been received, aud understand that honourable members received communications from other organizations and religious bodies to that effect. The practice in the State Parliaments has not been uniform. In New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania no prayer has been read; \>\it prayers are read in Queensland and Western Australia, and were read in the Legislative Council of Victoria.",15
12,Sir PHILIP FYSH,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,And Tasmania.,17
13,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Althoug h the practice is uniform in the States, I would venture claim that we ought to look to a wider area of national interest in other great Federamembers tions of the world. We might look to the mother of Parliaments, where, honourable no members are aware, prayers are read in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords. Prayers are also read in each House of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. I may refer to a parallel case with ours. the Uuited States of America, a prayer is read in the House of Representatives and in Senate. In those cases the chaplain the prayer; but I am one of those who believe that it will be better that the prayer, if honourable members approve the motion, should be read by the Speaker, not by any denominational or sectarian representative. I wish to mention that offer came from the Rev. Mr Hughes, cumbent of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, undertaking to read the prayer daily; but I replied expressing my own individual opinion as I have expressed it today. The form of prayer should be entirely unvery sectarian in character, and refer only to the fimdamental truths acknowledged and professed by all Christian people. I believe that no prayer will have more ciate universal acceptance than the Lord's Prayer. What I am anxious to secure is a day by day acknowledgment of our dependence on Almighty God. In our Commonwealth Conable stitution Act that recognition is recited in noble and memorable words, and at the opening of the Parliament hopeful representative prayers for Divine assistance were read. I am sure that those prayers found a ready echo through the length and breadth of this Commonwealth, and through the other civilized countries who watched the birth of our nation. I am persuaded that the we sense of the vast majority of the people Australia will be in favour of the step which the motion proposes, and its acceptance honourable members will be hailed with should general satisfaction. This is a subject which every honourable member, will have already made up his mind, and I am disposed to believe, from the conversations which [52] have had with several honourable members on the subject, that it-will be sanctioned by the majority of the House. I earnestly hope that it will have the unanimous approval of honourable members. As delivered by yourself, sir, I am sure that every honourable member is satisfied that the prayer will be read with reverence and propriety. Speaking from my experience of the Legislative not Council of Victoria, I can say that the to prayer read there at the opening of every sitting was always joined in by all honourable with fitting decorum and with full attendance. I sincerely confess that I possess appropriate fitness for the responsible position of submitting this motion to the House. On the contrary, I have a profound sense of my own inefficiency, and the need for Divine guidance in this and the other responsible In work which is before me. But in the fullest sense I express the earnest hope that the the resolution may find unanimous accepreads tance, in order that we may, with due reverence, acknowledge the sovereignty of the Almighty, and our dependence upon of - Him for guidance in our legislation to the end that it may be wise and liberal legislation, for the good of the whole people, for the an advancement and prosperity of humanity, inand for the cementing together of the brotherhood of the. people of this Commonwealth in fullest loyalty to our King and in fullest loyalty to' our God.",17
14,Mr GLYNN,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH," I have much pleasure in seconding the motion which has been so eloquently and effectively proposed by the honourable member for Koo3 ong. At the same time, I can quite appre7 the motives of the opponents as well as the supporters Of a proposal like this. It seems to me that the supporters of the motion think that the manifestation upon a suitoccasion, of the faith which most of us profess in one form or another, at least once a week, should, as coming from a great body, not only have a salutary influence upon - the daily relations of the members themselves, but be an example to the rising generation whose destinies to an extent we are engaged in moulding. They think that, as on some minor occasions of life, should solicit the descent of "" prevenient of grace,"" and seek regeneration by prayer, a submission to the will of Providence, and an by appeal for guidance to His omniscience, be regarded as an appropriate preface upon to our daily gropings for light. On the other hand, there are some who, taking a less ideal view of the occasion, think it I should be regarded as a purely business one; that the silent prayer of the heart, which open to all who wish to offer it, might, the more voluntary, probably prove more efficacious, and that custom too often tends to lower what should be aspiration into a cold formality. But, Mr. Speaker, we must take human nature as it is, with its many imperfections; we must deal with ourselves as men, liable,' if left alone, to be remiss or to forgetmen who require the reminder of some recurring occasion, or the stimulating sense of community of purpose, to keep them to the regular discharge of their higher obligations. As to the possibility of a prayer becoming mere lifeless formality, the remedy is with ourselves. We can scarcely refuse to do good because we may possibly be tempted to do evil, or make the possibility fall an obstacle to an attempt to rise. of prayer such as the Lord's Prayer in the vised version, as published by the University of Oxford, would be one in which all worence shippers, whatever may be our differences the non-essentials of form and method, could readily join, and we may possibly take from spirit, and the feeling of unity of ultimate aim iuduced by its repetition in common, larger measure of charity aud of mutual tion. It may possibly be that many a whose faith may be somewhat delicate, may remember, that even the ignorant pagan,' who was unable to give form to the object his hopes, still worshipped where he could not fathom; for on the statue of the Egyptian Isis were inscribed the words- "" I am whatpaid ever is, whatever was, whatever shall be, mortal never yet has raised the veil that covers me.""",17
15,Mr OMALLEY,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH," I think the motion should be so amended that only a qualithere fied clergyman of a recognised denomination, paid as a chaplain, should be selected to to this House and offer the prayer. Now, Mr Speaker, I am a man of the world, and I have had a lot of experience. 1 retional member that a few years ago a mace was re_ moved from the Parliament Hous° of Vic-' toria, and I remember also that the mace became one of the objects of ridicule of some of Solomon's lilies in this city.",18
16,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,Order ! The honourable member is now referring to something which has nothing to do with the subject of this debate.,18
17,Mr OMALLEY,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I desired to point out that that occurrence was one about which we ought to think of in the future. 1 recognise that our present Speaker is a just religious man, and I would trust is | in your hands, sir. But while our Speaker as ''s mortal, and will die, the position is the immortal, and will live ou. - Mr Mauger - The present Speaker will a fervent not be the last good man.",18
18,Mr OMALLEY,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,The Speaker will not be the last good man ; but even the man who took the mace from this House might be elected to the House and become Speaker.,18
19,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Order . Ido notthinkthe honourable member is in order in discussing the moral or religious tendencies of either a the present or a future occupant of the Chair. If the honourable member may attribute to the Speaker good qualities, he may attribute bad qualities, and I think both are of a subsequent j highly irregular. A form > Mr OMALLEY - Then how are we to rereach the subject 1 I suppose all of us have been taught to cherish a deep-seated reverfor prayer, but should we retain that in reverence if i u this House we saw a Speaker with whom we had been on the "" spree "" the its night before, praying for us when we ought to be praying for him ? This is a question a that is going to affect our future standtoleraing as a House. If we are prepared to man, have this House opened with prayer we j certainly ought to be prepared to have a chaplain, and pay him like honest men, of and not do it ou the cheap. That is the position I take. In the United States, they open the House with prayer, but there is a chaplain connected with Parliament, and and known as the Chaplain of the House. I u England, there is a paid chaplain, but there is a recognised State church in England, while there is no recognised State church here, and is nothing in the Constitution which says that we should have a chaplain, or that come we should open the proceedings with prayer I would like to ask the legal members of the House whether it would be really constituto have a chaplain and open the House with prayer. If we encroach on the Constitution, may it not be the first breach of which advantage may be taken in future to destroy the liberties of the people 1 I am thoroughly willing to have the House opened with prayer. I do not give second place to any man in the House in my reverence for prayer and for religion ; but I do hope the House will not lend itself to becoming a part of the whole system of veiled hypocrisy which prevails throughoutthe world.",18
20,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,I do not know whether the and honourable member wishes his suggestion to prayers' be put as an amendment.,18
21,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Does the honourable member for Tasmania move an amendment ? Mr OMALLEY"" - I beg to move as an amendment That the word ""he"" after the word "" prayer "" bo omitted, with a view to inserting, in lieu thereof, the words ""a chaplain appointed for purpose,"" that "" a "" be omitted, and that there be inserted before the word ""prayer"" the words "" the Lord's.""",19
22,Mr MCDONALD,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH," I ask your ruling, sir, whether the amendment is in order. The amendment provides for the payment of a chaplain, and should not such a proposal be preceded by a message from the Governor General?",19
23,Mr GB EDWARDS,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,The amendment does not provide for the payment of a chap-' laiu. It will be competent for a chaplain to be appointed without payment.,19
24,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,There will be plenty willing to perform the service gratuitously.,19
25,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"On the point of order raised by the honourable member for Kennedy, I may call the aitention of honourable members to the fact that this motion is simply a recommendation to the Standing Orders Committee. It will be necessary before the Standing Orders Committee can make any definite provision that some appropriation should be arranged for, but there is no objection whatever ou that ground to the motion proceeding in its present form. As to the point raised by the honourable member for South Sydney, it would be quite competent for the House at a later stage to make a further amendment.",19
26,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH," Before the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'M alley, proposed his amendment, I had been considering whether this motion would not take a more acceptable form to members generally if it provided that the question be referred to the Standing Orders Committee instead of the House practically ordering that committee to prepare a standing order. Honorable MEMBERS - No , no.",19
27,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I am not going to move any such amendment; there is, therefore, no cause for alarm. The amendment which has been piit from the Chair precludes me from doing so if I wished, and I had grave doubts whether I should do so at any time. I am not about to oppose the motion, and, so far as the members of the Government are concerned, I am quite sure-and honourable members will agree with methis ought uot to be made a Cabinet question. Therefore, if there are any differences of opinion in the Cabinet on the subject-as to which I have not consulted my colleagues-ther e will be none the less friendship between its ' members. Although 1 do not oppose the motion, I have my doubts whether ordinances of this that kind do really tend to the improvement of morality and the inculcation of piety. I have my doubts whether, apart from those prayers we say in church, we should not adopt the advice which is given by a very high teacher, who told us to pray in our closet. I recognise, however, that there are very large differences of opinion on the subject. I know that a large number of those who have their doubts as to the propriety of these ordinances are not so offeuded in their religious susceptibilities if they are carried out, as those would be who demand that ordinances of this kind should be observed if their wishes were not complied with. That beiug so, I am inclined to give way to the course which is least offensive to the religious susceptibilities of the public, and, therefore, to assent to a proposition of this kind. But I do hope this House, will not ask for the appointment of a chaplain. Honorable MEJEBERS - Hear , hear.",19
28,Mr BARTON,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I think members generally approved of the course which was taken at the opening of the Federal Parliament, in the reading of the' prayers by His Excellency the Governor General aud in His Excellency's swearing in the members of Parliament. That course was taken in order that there might be no religious quarrel on the subject. To appoint a chaplain of any denomination, unless we are so eminently successful as to find a religious chaplain of no denomination, would only go to feed those religious quarrels of which we have had more than enough in the country which ought to have the least of them-Australia . I therefore hope, quite irrespective of the question of salary which the honourable member for Kennedy has raised, that there will be no thought of appointing a chaplain, and that the prayer read will be purely unsectarian, and one acceptable to the feelings and wishes of members of every denomination in the community as well as to honourable members in this House. I believe in the suggestion contained in the amendment, that the prayer should be the Lord's prayer-nothin g more and nothing less- a prayer which can be accepted by the Unitarian, and which contains no request of the Almighty which a member of the Hebrew faith could not readily accept. A prayer which is of the broadest, which for that reason appeals in the strongest degree to our common feeling of humanity and our common reverence for our Maker, is the kind of prayer which should be adopted; and I hope no other prayer will be thought of by the Standing Orders Committee. For . myself, I shall vote for the motion without the amendment. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLA N (Wentworth). - I follow tire Prime Minister in his view, that this is neither a party question nor a Cabinet question, but one upon which every honourable member must vote according to his owu conscience. If we can gather anything from the speech of the mover of the resolution, this matter has not been a question of today. A movement has been going on for some time in order to bring about this result. I should have had more hesitation in coming to a decision on this question if it had not been the consequence orcorollary of a movement which was initiated during the sittings of the Federal Convention. Honourable members will recollect that it was the great.desire of a large body of our .fellow citizens-if not an overwhelming majority - that there should be some recognition of Almighty God in the Constitution. The beginning of our Constitution saysWhereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, &c. I do think that if this motion is not a necessary corollary, it is at least a reasonable consequence of the introduction into the Constitution of that clause, and whilst I , myself, do not feel very strongly upon it, I think, in view of the strong feeling of the great mass of our fellow countrymen, that we have no reasonable grouuds upon which to oppose it. Mr W. H. GROOM (Darling Downs) - I hope that the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr OMalley, will not press the amendment. Coming from Queensland, I may say that in the first session of Parliament, which was held there in 1860, a motion was moved by the late Mr Henry Jordan, a Nonconformist, that the proceedings of Parliament should be opened by prayer. The prayer suggested theu was a prayer for the High Court of Parliament, adapted to the position of the State Parliament of Queensland. That prayer has been read by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and by the President of the Legislative Council from that time up to the present, and has met with universal concurrence. Of course we are .aware that no two minds are constituted alike, and that eveiy man has his own opinions with regard to religious matters. I u the Parliament of Queensland there are some honourable members with peculiar ideas on the subject, and if they have any objection to the course taken by Parliament, they generally walk outside the Bar of the House whilst the prayer is being read, so that the religious susceptibilities of honourable members are not in any way offended. I agree with what has been suggested by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr OMalley, that the Lord's prayer would be an appropriate one with which to open the proceed'ings of the House. It embraces no religious dognia. It is, as the Prime Minister has observed, one which appeals to the common humanity of all of us.",19
29,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,-It is socialistic.,20
30,Mr WH GROOM,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is socialistic, and wasdrafted by thegreatest social reformer that the world has ever known. Myprincipal reason in rising was to ask the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, not to press the amendment for the appointment of a paid chaplain. I am aware that the Speaker of the House of Commons appoints his own chaplain, and that the chaplain continues in office during the Speaker's term. But in England there is a recognised State Church, and a State clergyman is therefore appointed. But the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Malley, must also know that the very fact that a chaplain is so appointed has given very great offence to other denominations, and seeing that we have no recognised - State religion we ought not to follow in the footsteps of the mother country. I have sufficient confidence in the people of the Commonwealth, and in their choice of representatives, to believe that the gentleman whom they elect as their Speaker will always be a fit and proper person to read the Lord's prayer.",20
31,Mr OMALLEY,TASMANIAN COMMONWEALTH,"In deference to the wishes of honourable members. I will withdraw the amendment.  honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, having withdrawn his amendment, I think it is advisable to set out clearly in this motion what the particular prayer should be, and in order to obtain an expression of opinion from honourable members on that point I move That, after the word "" read,"" in the second line of the resolution, the words ""a prayer"" be omitted, with a view to the insertion in their place of the words "" The Lord's Prayer."" Mr V. L. SOLOMON (South Australia) I ask the honourable member for South Aus ment. If this matter is to be left to the Stand ing Orders Committee, I presume that, as it will need the concurrence of the House later on when embodied in a standing order, it will be very much better to leave it to the Standing Orders Committee to present a suitable form of prayer, such as would not be objectionable to any section of the Commonwealth community. That would be very much better than dictating in the resolution the speoial form of prayer known as The Lord's Prayer. Personally, from my standpoint, I can see no objection to The Lord s Praye r whatever, but at the same time we must consider the view of others who may have a different opinion. I think that the prayer should be such as would be unobjectionable to all sections of the community. I therefore ask the honourable member not to press the amendment, but to leave the motionin the exact form in which it has been proposed by the honourable member for Kooyong. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Original question resolved in the affirmative. NA",20
32,Mr KNOX,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I move That there be laid before this House a return (to be compiled from the latest available statistics) giving the following information:-(1 ) A list of the manufacturing industries operating in the several States of the Commonwealth, distinguishing; as to respective States. (2) The number of factories operating under each industry. (3) The average number of persons employed in each industry, distinguishing as to males and females. (4) The average wages paid to the persons employed in each industry, also distinguishing as to males and females. (5) The rate of Customs or Excise duty by which the several industries are at present protected in each of the States. I do not desire to take up the time of the House, because the Minister for Trade and Customs has been good enough to say that this information will be supplied. I will, therefore, content myself with simply moving the resolution as it stands. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLA N (Wentworth)' - I think this may be an opportune time for asking the Government in what way they intend to compile their statistics. There is a State statistician in each of the States, and in these matters of manufactures there has always been a difficulty in tabulating the information according to the particular business, which may be called a manufactory. A great deal of these statistics, as a matter of comparison, depend for their value upon their method of compilation, and it would be of great advantage if there were some agreement among the statisticians of the different States as to the basis of these compilations, so that when we made use of them for the sake of argument we would know exactly that they were all compiled on the same basis. I think the information for which the honourable member' asks, like a great many other things in the way of statistics, will be very necessary for the intelligent discussion of the Tariff question : when it comes up; but all statistics depend for their value on their reliability.",21
33,Mr KINGSTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," Ifullyrecognis e what the honourable member says, and we must do the best we can under the circumstances. Statistics are of very little use for the purpose of comparison if not compiled on the same basis. Where there is a difference as regards the basis, we will indicate it in the return.",21
34,Sir PHILIP FYSH,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I think it would be well to amend paragraph No. 5 by including the schedule of exemptions from duty, because we encourage our various industries by exempting a very large INDUSTRIES. quantity of raw material. Unless that is included, the object the honourable member has in view is only partly secured. I submit that the exemptions from duty, as scheduled in the various Customs Acts of the States, is of as much importance as the difference between the rates of duty and excise. I intend to move That after the word "" duty"" (line 15) the words "" and schedule of exemptions therefrom"" be inserted. Mr V. L. SOLOMON (South Australia) I have no doubt this return will be very interesting to most honourable members, but I do not think it goes quite far enough. I desire to move an amendment to paragragh 3, which reads-""The average number of persons employed in each industry, distinguishing as to males and females."" I want to insert the word "" adult,"" and after the word "" females,"" the words "" and male and female children under fourteen years of age,"" so as to get as full a return as we possibly can.",21
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"What about those from 14 to 21 years of age !1 Mr V. L. SOLOMON - They , I presume, will also be shown.",21
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"They would not adults. - MR. GLYNN - Sa y the average number and the age of the persons employed. Mr V. L. SOLOMON- I think the honourable member's suggestion' will meet the whole case. I will move that, after the word "" number,"" there be inserted the words "" and ages."" The paragraph will then read- "" The average number and ages of persons employed in each industry, distinguishing as to males and females.""",22
37,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"What the honourable member wants to know is whether boys or men are employed in these places. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Precisely . ' I want to know whether they are boys, or girls, or adults.",22
38,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,The honourable member does not require the ages of these persons 1 Mr V. L. SOLOMON - No .,22
39,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"The honourable member wants to know the number of apeach prentices. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - I think I shall the have to put the amendment in another form. I will moveo That before the word "" males "" in paragraphs 3 and 4, there be added the word, "" adult,"" and that at the end of paragraph 3 there be added words, ""and male and female children under and between 14 and 21 respectively."" I will leave it at that. We do not want the number of children at 15 years of age 16 years of age. If we have the aggregate number of males and females up to ingly 14 years bf age, and those between satisfactory 14 and 21 years of age, and the aggretion gate number of adult males and females, think that will be sufficient for all reasonwho able purposes. Amendment agreed to. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - An amendment will also be necessary in paragraph 4, so as to obtain the same information in regard to the average wages paid.",22
40,Mr SPEAKER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"If the House pleases, I will take that as a consequential amendment.",22
41,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," It strikes me that in the form in which this motion stands it will not be of very much use. The return is to be compiled from the latest available statistics, whatever they are. That is a difficulty in itself, because the latest statistics available do not cover the ground we desire. I am sure we have all experienced very considerable difficulty recently in obtaining from be statistics the information we require. To be of any use to us this information must be obtained, as it seems to me, from sources extending over a wider-area than the available statistics. Theu there is another consideration. The motion refers to the average number of persons' employed, and the average wages paid. For what period of time is this average to be calculated ?  the time of compiling the returns.",22
42,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"What is the average number at a particular time t We can have the actual number at a particular time, but the average number must extend over some period.",22
43,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,Le t it be for the latest year.,22
44,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"But the motion does not say so. It is so indefinite that it cannot be worked out. Some information should also be obtained as to the minimum wage paid in industry to adults and children respectively. This is necessary, because when matter comes to be investigated we willfind that at the root of many of the troubles we are considering is the question of the minimum wage. I therefore beg to move That the following be added to the motion :the 6. The minimum wages paid in each industry 14 to adults and to children respectively.",22
45,Mr MAUGER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"Melbourne Ports),-In - seconding the amendment, I desire to say or that I agree with the honourable member for Indi, when he states th.it it will be exceeddifficult to collect these statistics on a basis. Por instance, on the quesof wages I find that some firms include I the wages paid to managers and foremen, receive perhaps £10, £ 8 , or £ 6 per week. By that means they bring up the average very considerably. Others exclude the salaries of such employees. To get at the correct figures it will be necessary to obtain the ages and the average paid in the respective divisions of labour. Unless we have uniformity the return will be of very little value.",22
46,Mr SPEAKER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"If this amendment is inserted it will exclude the proposed amendment to paragraph 5, which was temporarily withdrawn.",22
47,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,It is immaterial to me in what order my amendment is placed.,22
48,Mr SPEAKER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,Ver y well; I shall put it in this form :4A - The minimum rate of wage paid in each industry to adults and children respectively.,22
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," Before the resolution is carried I should like to point out that it will be necessary to have the factories and the classes of employment placed under headings. During a discussion in relation to factories which took place the other night, exception was taken, very justly, I think, to any comparison between the hands employed in each State without designating exactly the divisions of labour in which they were employed. I should like it to be understood that in this return a heading is to be given to each industry.",23
50,Mr SPEAKER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,That will be necessary under the motion as it stands. Amendment agreed to.,23
51,Sir PHILIP FYSH,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to moveThab the motion be amended by the insertion sifter the woid "" d u t y "" in paragraph 5 of the words "" and the schedule of exemptions therefrom.""",23
52,Mr THOMSON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I the would draw the attention of the mover this motion to the fact that the information which he asks for in division either cannot be given or will be given in such a form as will - be quite misleading to the House. It refers to ""the rate of customs or excise duty by which the several industries are at present protected in each of the States."" suppose that what is desired to be arrived at is what are the duties on the articles produced by each of the industries in each mation. State, but the motion will not achieve that result. How can statisticians say, for instance, what are the ingredients of duced by some of these industries? How can they say what is the duty, or by how much a particular article produced certain factory is protected? They cannot go into these details, and yet to comply with the motion they will have to do so or else to furnish a misleading return. The only thing that should be asked for is the customs and excise duties, or the customs or excise duties in each of the States on the article manufactured therein.",23
53,Sir PHILIP FYSH,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,Is not that information definitely asked for in paragraph 5 of the motion ?,23
54,Mr THOMSON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,No . The paragraph to .which the honourable member refers reads-The rate of customs or excise duty by which the several industries are at in each of the States. By asking for that information the honorTo able member for Kooyong asks that the question of how much protection is provided by these duties be entered into.,23
55,Mr KINGSTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,That can be ascertained by finding out what the customs duties on the manufactured articles are.,23
56,Mr THOMSON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"Not necessarily; because, as the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, has pointed out, the degree of protection afforded to an industry depends very much upon the terms upon which the raw materials used in it are admittedwhether they are admitted free or have to pay d u t y ; and. it will be impossible for the statisticians to ascertain exactly what are the raw materials which are used in the production of certain manufactured articles. I thiuk that it would be better to ask for the information by making the motion readThe rate of customs or excise duty on the articles in use by such industry in each of the States. I think that that would carry out the intention of the mover, and, in asking for the information in that way, we do not go into question of protection at all. If the of motion is made to read in that way, the amendment of the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, will be unnecessary. The honourable member is trying to arrive at something which he believes the mover of the motion wants to arrive at; but if we. ask for the rate of the duties of customs I and excise, and"" of customs or excise on the articles produced by these industries in each State, we shall get the necessary infor",23
57,Sir PHILIP FYSH,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,I think that the statisticians of the various States will know the articles prowhat is wauted.,23
58,Mr THOMSON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"If the mover of the motion has no objection, I would suggest by a that it be amended as I propose.",23
59,Mr KNOX,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I am deeply grateful to honourable members for assisting to make this return of statistical value; but I do not agree with the view of the honourable member who has just spoken. I think that the motion, as it stands, asks for the information that we want to obtain-that is, the rate of the duties by which each industry in the various States is supported or assisted. If the motion was worded as the honourable member for North Sydney suggests, I think it would tend to defeat the object we have in view.",23
60,Mr THOMSON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,I have no desire to press present protected my suggestion.,23
61,Mr WH GROOM,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"Darling Downs) my mind the amendment of the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, is more valuable than the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney. From the discussion to which we have listened it would appear that only the States of Victoria and New South Wales are concerned in this matter; we have not heard a word about the other States. Now, in Queensland we have adopted a policy of our own, which is quite distinct from that of any of the other States; a policy which we think is beneficial to our interests, aud which, by establishing our industries, has given employment to. hundreds and thousands of our population. Under this policy we remitted, in 1896, £50,000 worth of duties, chiefly duties ou raw material. If the motion is not amended as the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, has proposed, there will not be a woid about this exemption in the return which is being moved for. I have some knowledge of the difficulty of collecting these returns, and I know that in the State of Queensland alone a great many supernumerary clerks will have to be appointed to undertake the, work of obtaining this information, because they are now preparing for the meeting of the State Parliament, and if the honourable member thinks that the return will be ready in time to enable this House to use the information in connection with the discussion on the proposed Tariffs, he will be very much disappointed. If the House had been sitting in January last, and the honourable member had moved for the information theu, the return would probably be nearing completion now, and we might have hoped to obtain the information by the end of June or the beginning of J u l y ; but, under present circumstances, I think that a great deal of the information which is being asked for will not reach us before the end of November, by which time. I hope the Tariff question will be pretty well settled. In my opinion the amendment of the honourable member for Tasmania (Sir Philip Fysh) meets the difficulty which the honourable member for North Sydney has suggested, far better than his own proposition does, and I hope that the honourable member for Kooyong will accept it.",23
62,Mr EWING,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," It seems to me that it would be sufficient if paragraph 5 were made to readThe rate of customs or excise duty in each the States. The words "" by which the several industries are at present protected"" are really surplusage, being merely explanatory of the action of these customs and excise duties, and it seems to me that if honourable members get the information which has been asked for in regard to the rate of these duties, they will be able to draw their own inferences as to their effect qtiite as well as the statisticians could draw such inferences for them. I think that if the honourable member for Kooyong agrees to the omission of the words to which I refer, it will end the debate. I do not intend to press for their omission; I make the suggestion for the honourable member's cousideration.",24
63,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"Tasmania) If I understand the reason which has actuated the' honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, in moving the amendment, it seems to me that it will not do what he wishes to do, but will to a great extent make the return abortive. If he seeks to show the extent to which the various industries of the States are protected by the exemption of the raw products imported for use in their manufacture, that information should be asked for by adding auother paragraph to the motion-""The extent to which the exemptions of duty protect the several industries in the State."" The object of the amendment is, I assume, to show the extent to which our manufactures are protected by the admission of raw products duty free. If that be not the object, I cannot see why the amendment has been moved. Amendment agreed to.",24
64,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I had no intention of interfering with this motion; but, as it seems to me to have developed into an attempt to obtain information which will assist various fiscal doctrines, and as I observe that a number of honourable members are endeavouring to cast the motion in such a form that the facts elicited will be such as they can hereafter use for the purpose of showing us that what they have told us before was true, I propose to add a sixth paragraph to deal with the difference of opinion which has for many years existed between the statisticians of the different colonies. For many years it was the practice of politicians to refer to the number of manufactories in the various States. We used to hear from the Victorian protectionists that the New South Wales freeof traders were including every blacksmith's shop under the head of a manufactory. Statisticians got over that difficulty by ascertaining what the horse-power of the different manufactories was. I propose to insert a sixth heading giving the horse-power of the manufactories in existence in the respective States. That will give us some idea of the difference between a blacksmith's shop and a manufactory, which probably gives occupation to 100 or 500 persons. I move That the motion be amended by the addition of the following paragraph:-""7 . The horse-power of the factories in existence in the respective States.""  think tl\at if we want to make this return complete, we need not go any further than has been proposed. A return showing the number of factories will not be correct unless it starts on a proper basis-unles s it shows the number of hands. If I read this motion aright, it does not in any way stipulate as to what shall constitute a factory. If in one State, one man constitutes a factory, and if in another State four is the minimum number, honourable members can see how delusive the return will be for comparative purposes. I would suggest that this further sub-sectiou be added"" And the minimum number of employees which constitutes a factory in each State be stated.""",24
65,Mr KINGSTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,They will proceed on the same basis.  the statists in preparing the return will distinguish between a factory in a State where four is the minimum aud a factory in another State where one man constitutes a factory,25
66,Mr KINGSTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,They will have to proceed on the same basis.  alt right. .,25
67,Mr KNOX,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," May I be permitted to explain to the House that the statisticians agreed in 1896 as to what should be regarded as a factory. Their definition of factories is as follows :All establishments employing four hands or upwards in the manufacture of articles either for the trade, or for stock, or for individual orders must be returned; also all establishments with less than four hands, where machinery worked by steain, gas, electric, water, wind, or horse power is used; as well as all industries of an unusual or interesting character.",25
68,Mr MAUGEB,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I am riot going to offer any objection to the motion, but I would suggest that it might be possible to get complete data from the information derived from the census. Surely an appeal from the Minister for Trade and Customs to the various States would elicit data far more reliable and uniform than any data based ou factory statistics. We all agree that the present system is unsatisfactory. It is not a bit of use compiling the return unless, so far as different States are concerned, it is prepared on the same basis. .1 would suggest to whoever may compile the information that he should, as far as possible, rely on the census. Amendment agreed to.",25
69,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I u order to make the return as complete and fair as we can, I beg to move That the motion be amended by the addition of the following paragraph-""The return to covei-.the years 1898, 1899, and 1900, separately distinguishing each, and wherever later or more complete information is available from sources other than official statistics, such information shall be given, and the sources mentioned."" Mr HUME . COOK (Bourke) - I rise to second the amendment. Unless we get reliable information the whole return will be practically valueless. If we get an assurance from the Minister for Customs that the statistics will be arranged on a uni form basis so that they will be really com parable, it will be Satisfactory to the House But if the statistics are to be compiled just as the ordinary statistics are compiled in each State we shall be no further forward than we are by comparing the records of the State statisticians. What we want is to get something which will be really reliable, and based on figures and facts which are compiled in au exactly similar way in each State. If we get that assurance, together with certain specific orders, I think that the information will be of use and will be reliable ; without it it will not.",25
70,Mr BABTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," Without any reflection on my honourable friends who have moved amendments, I do hope that this will be the last one moved on this motion. I take it that the object of the motion is to procure some information that will be placed in the hands of honourable members before they discuss the Tariff.",25
71,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,W o were invited to move amendments.,25
72,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"I am not raising an objection, but I want to point this out in case there may be any more amendments. Without naming a day for the introduction of the Tariff-whic h is a secret so momentous that I am sure I shall not be expected to disclose it - I think I may say that the return to this motion may run a very close, or almost neck and neck, race with the Tariff, and will be last if we have much more added to the motion in the way of research. There is so much to be done under the various heads, so much information to be collected, especially by a Commonwealth which has not yet had time to turn round or .. look about for a statistician even, which has so many Acts of Parliament to pass before it can take up the Tariff, notwithstanding its eagerness to deal with that question, and it means to deal with it this session-that the position is a difficult one. If with all the work we have on hand we have to make researches of the most laborious character, with the help only of the statistical departments of the various States, which differ in the basis on which they collect their statistics, he would be a fortunate man indeed who could get the information which has already been asked for, before the'Tariff is brought in. That is the point I want to emphasize - We shall do all we can to prepare this return in time. We shall uot play with it.. We shall endeavour to get it and have it in the hands of honorablo members. But if it happens that the task is one which, cannot be performed in time for the introduction of the Tariff, I want to throw out this note of warning, we shall not hold ourselves responsible same time wo shall do everything we can. to meet the views of honourable members. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in. the affirmative. Ordered-That there he laid before this House a return (to be compiled from the latest available statistics) giving the following information :1. A list of the manufacturing industries operating in the several States of the Commonwealth distinguishing as to respective States. 2. The number of factories operating under each industry. 3. The average number of persons employed in each industry, distinguishing as to adult males and females, all male and female children under fourteen and between 14 and 21 respectively. 4. The average wages paid to the persons employed in each industry, also distinguishing as to adult males and females, and male and female children under 14 and between 14 and 21 respectively. 6. The minimum rate of wage paid to adults and to children respectively. fi. The rate of customs or excise duty and the schedule of exemptions therefrom by which the several industries are at present protected in each of the States. 7. The horse-power of the factories in existence in the respective States. 8. The return to cover the years 1808, 1899, and 1900, separately distinguishing each, andwherever later or more complete information is available from sources other than official statistics snch information shall be given and the sources mentioned. KATE OF WAGE : HOURS OF LABOUR.",25
73,Mr MAUGER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to move That in the opinion of this of the Government to make provision in all its contracts for the payment of a minimum rate of wage, and for the fixing of a maximum number of hours of labour. I do not propose to detaiu the House with auy lengthy remarks. Honourable members will know that the principle of a minimum wage has been adopted by the London County Council, a large number of municipal councils all over the world, and the British House of Commons. So far back as 1893, when Mr Campbell Banner/mannow leader of the Opposition-wa s a responsible Minister, and was speaking in the name-of the Government, he saidWhen we say we agree to the proposition contained in the amendment, we mean that the Government should show themselves to be amongst the best employers of labour in the country; that they should be, if I may be permitted the expression, in the first flight of employers. . . . I accept in the fullest sense the principle that the terms of Government employment should be beyond reproach. We have ceased bo believe in what are known as competition or starvation wages. At the Mr BARTON (Hunter-Minister ' for External Affairs) - Will my honourable friend pardon me for a moment ? This is a motion which it will take some hours to discuss. There is no possibility of the debate upon it being concluded this afternoon. There is upon the notice paper, however, other business sufficient to occupy the remaining time until the House adjourns. May I suggest to my honourable friend that he should allow this motion to stand over, without concluding his speech, so that the remaining business may be concluded before the adjournment. Otherwise, the danger may be that the honourable member may be left without a quorum.",26

79,Mr MAUGER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to move That in the opinion of this House it is the duty of the Government to make such arrangements as will ensure, at least, one day's rest in seven for "" each of its employees.

97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,Cannot the honourable member draw the attention of the Government to specific cases without occupying the time of the House with this motion %,27
98,Mr MAUGER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,I think.we should lay it down as a principle that this Commonwealth will permit every employee to have at least one day's rest in seven ? I propose the niotiou without any further comment.,27
99,Mr HUME COOK,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to the second the motion. I think we should affirm the principle, at the outset, that at least one clay's rest in seven shall be given to every employee of the Commonwealth. A practice bas grown up in Victoria, at any rate-and here I speak of a State about which I know something-of employing meu continuously ou Sunday labour. They arc not paid extra wages for this work, but they are occasionally given time off. This is a practice which should be deprecated. If Sunday labour is necessary-and I would have as little of it as possible-the men who do it should receive extra pay; and under all circumstances every man should have one clay off in seven. That means that in place of working some men at high pressure, a greater number of men will be employed,. For these reasons, I am strongly in favour of the motion, and I hope it will commend itself to the judgment of the Ministry and the House.",27
100,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I am in sympathy with theobject of this motion, and so also, I am sure, are my colleagues in the Government; but whether it will be desirable to affirm it i i i its present form, inay be another question.

101,Mr MAUGER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,Certainl y not.,27
102,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"Because, if that were so, it would be impossible to carry on some of the operations of government.

103,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"I believe that it really does. At the outset, however, the question is largely a financial one. The Federal Government have taken over three large depart of ments, and may before long have to take over another, viz., Quarantine and Light-houess. There is a vast number of emyloyes in the Customs and Postal departments. tinanoial operations of these departments are considerable. Especially is this the case with the Postal department. Government cannot take upon itself to make this reform as a lightning change. It cannot be clone in an instant. But notwithstanding the question of expense, the Government is ready to make arrangements of the kind desired, as soon as a fair opportunity will admit, if that is what the honourable member means. Mr M.AUGER - Hear , hear.",27
104,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"If the honourable member will accept an amendment, I shall be prepared to recommend the House to adopt the motion.

109,Mr MAHON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to move .as an amendment That after the word ""employees"" there be inserted the words ""and that as far as possible no public servant be called upon to work more than 44 hours a week. """,28
110,Mr SPEAKER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"I cannot accept that as an amendment to the motion. It raises quite a new issue. Does the honourable member wish to speak to the motion as amended 1 the Mr Mahon - No further than to say that I was not aware at the time. I proposed the amendment that it raised a new issue. The amendment is certainly an addition, but, at the same time, it seems a necessary corollary to the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I merely wish to say, further, that members ou this side of (lie House, as well as myself, are undoubtedly in Favour of the motion. We think it eminently a reasonable proposal that Government employees should have at least owe day's rest in every seven, and I hope it will be carried out as soon as possible. I am quite sure that the motion will be supported quite as cordially on this side as on the other side of the House. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. STATE IMPORTATIONS.

The actual mean of such quantities per head of the mean population of each State for the same period. 3. The duty value (in one sum) upon an uniform Tariff of such mean quantities for each State separately, and the mean for Australia of the six separate duty values so ascertained. Honourable members will see this motion, like that just paused by the House, is submitted in order to obtain information, whioh, I understand, the Prime Minister is willing to afford.",28
111,Mr THOMSON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that no duty is paid on kerosene in New South Wales, and that in consequence the motion, as worded, will not give the honourable member the information he desires. The honourable member desires information as to the quarititiesof the articles mentioned on which duties are paid in each State, the actual mean of such quantities per head of population, and what a uniform Tariff would yield on the actual mean.  kerosene out. Mr THOMSON,-If what I have stated be the information desired, the honourable member can obtain it by inserting in paragraph 1 the words ""and the quantities imported of each article.""",29
112,Mr KINGSTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"If the honourable member takes the quantity entered for home consumption, ho will get what he wants.",29
113,Mr SPEAKER,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"I would suggest that the honourable member insert the words"" The quantities imported duty free."" Mr THOMSON,- I will act on the suggestion of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and ask that the words ""and the quantities entered for home consumption "" - be inserted after the word ""paid."" Perhaps I had bettor leave the honourable gentleman to submit an amendment.",29
114,Mr KINGSTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," ! take the position to be that goods are entered for home consumption, whether duty be paid or not, and' if the motion read""the quantities entered for home consumption every year of the five years' period,"" <fcc, the honourable member will get the information he wants. I beg to move That the words ""upon which customs aud excise duties have beon paid ""be omitted, with a view to the insertion in lieu thereof of the words "" entered for homo consumption."" Amendment agreed .to. Question, as amended; resolved in the affirmative. WOMEN VOTERS.

Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. PUBLIC SERVICE. .",29
116,Mr HUME COOK,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to move That a return for each department of the Commonwealth (Customs, Defence, &c.) bo laid before this House, showing-(1 ) Separately, the number of persons engaged in special, professional, clerical, aud non-clerical duties; and the totals, under each head ; (2) The yearly salaries and wages paid in each division of each department, und the totals ; (3) A comparative statement of the maximum and minimum remuneration given in each State for all classes of work of a corresponding character. I have altered the motion slightly from its original form, for the sufficient reason that. it would have entailed much moro work than will be necessary if the House agrees to the motion in its present form. My object is to follow on the lines of the Public Service Bill which has just been introduced, and in which civil servants have been classified in four divisions under the headings of special, professional, clorical, and non-clerical. The motion will enable us to get the return asked for in time to discuss it in connection with the Public Service Bill. To-day the honorablo member for Tasmania (Mr. O'Malley) asked a question for the purpose of eliciting certain information. Numbers of honourable mombcrs no doubt have been plagued and pestered as to the rates of salary to be paid. The Government doubtless have had the information prepared for themselves, otherwise I do not understand how they could bavo arrived at any specific salary to bo paid throughout the Commonwealth. 1 only ask that honourable members shall be placed in possession of the same information as the Government must have - obtained for themselves in connection with the Public Servico Bill. Mr 'BARTON (Hunter-Minister External Affairs) - May I ask the honourable member to inform the House what is intended by the words ""Customs, Ac.'""! Is it intended to limit the return to Customs and Defence, or what does the honourable member wish to be included 1",29
117,Mr HUME COOK,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G,"I mean the transferred departments. The words "" Customs, Defence, ifec,"" ore merely explanatory.",30
118,Mr OMALLEY,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I second the motion, and 1 want to say right here that the salaries paid in Tasmania, are simply disgraceful.",30
119,Mr ISAACS,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I would direct attention to paragraph 3 of the motion, I apprehend that my honourable friend wishes to know the remuneration given by the Government or each State for the particular classes - of work mentioned, otherwise the return will -.cover a very extensive field. - Mr HUME COOK - Certainly . Question resolved.in the affirmative. SESSIONAL COMMITTEES.",30
120,Mr BARTON,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," 1 beg to move That the Standing Orders Committee, the Library :Committce, and the House Committee have leave to sit during any adjournment of the House and to confer with the committees of the Senate appointed for similar purposes. - This.is the ordinary formal motion, and I wish to limit it to the Standing Orders Committee, the Library Committee, and the House - Committee The Printing Committee in the Senate has - not the authority to confer. I had intended to cover the four committees, but under the circumstances I cannot do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr BARTON) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",30
121,Mr CONROY,STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURIN G," I beg to call attention to the fact that the second readings of .the Judiciary Bill and of the High Court .Procedure Bill are set down for Tuesday next, and-that no copies of those Bills have . yet been furnished to honourable members. - Mr BARTON - The second reading of those Bills will not be moved until copies have been distributed. I may tell the honourable member that it is neoesBary to get Supply as soon as possible, and I believe that the Supply Bill will be ready to be gone on with on Tuesday. If Supply is speedily granted, then the Minister for Home Affairs will move for the second reading of the Public Service Bill. In the meantime the other Bills will be put in circulation as rapidly as Defence, possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. departments House adjourned at 3.50 p.m.",30
