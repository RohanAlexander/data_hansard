We are probably one of the most face of the earth at the moment because people part of it. Croatia has a beautiful coastline, but we portunity offered by the full length of that coastline Europe just a short distance away, is just away from tens of millions of people, all with this beautiful coastline.

The opportunities for skiing and matic there as they are on the Austrian side. given a thought to the existence of the Slovenian again, this is a great opportunity for Australian time and for our enterprises Something I thought about also in Slovenia its name; I have not written that down in straight to Venice. That just shows how close have this beautiful, big coastline, those Alps it really is right in the centre. We are talking when we say ‘central' Europe it really is fantastically opment opportunities, there is a big market.

Just assist in a places like Croatia, Slovenia or Slovakia, able to do something in Hungary. The Czech doubt about that. People from all over Europe The member for Fadden spoke about the Hungary. The thing that got me was the demand from page 32 of the report: Kangaroo meat, which is used in sausages, salami, lar that supply has not kept up with demand as restaurants on their menus. Kangaroo meat is in big demand. I really like taste that commends itself. If you ask me, attitude towards kangaroo meat consumption. our beef products. There is a great awareness Making sausages is a big traditional industry They love Australian beef. The more Australian opportunity for us, but that again raises the EU. Let us consider accession to the EU. One of portunity at the moment is that absolutely pumped into these countries seeking accession accession, the amount of money that flows in in Australia. It is going to be a challenge for that news to those people. If they can do that, those vessels, and something that I think could for tourism and skiing in the Tatra Mountains of Slovakia, there is a great deal of unemploywithin the old Soviet tank-making factothey do not exist anymore.
