Is it a fact that large are imported from Asiatic countries into the Commonwealth and utilized for bedding, the , material being collected from sources tainted with many dangerous diseases such as leprosy, bubonic plague, small-pox and other malignant maladies ? 2. Will he request the Tariff Board to inturn. vestigate the matter with a view to placing an embargo on the importation of this material, since. or impose a duty that wil l be an adequate protection to the cotton industry, and also 'tend to safeguard the health of the community in general? The answers are as follows:1. The importations of kapok in the year 1926-27 were 7,549,858 lb., of a value of £443,038. The imports were mainly from Java, with certain quantities from India, British Malaya and Ceylon. Precautions against the introduction of diseases are a matter for tht Department of Health. Enquiries from the quarantine authorities indicate that at no in any country has kapok been suggested a carrier of infectious diseases. 2. The whole production of lint from the crop of 1926-27 represented about 55 per cent, of the lint necessary for the Australian duction of yarn for bounty. On the estimated crop for 1927-28 the proportion is likely to be somewhat less.' The production of linters, that is the portion of the crop which can be used as a substitute for kapok, forms about 5 per cent, by weight of the seed cotton and 5 per cent, of the estimated crop of seed cotton for 1927-28 would be about 300,000 16. As this quantity 4 per cent, of kapok requirements it is not proposed to refer the matter to the Tariff Board. c A previous proposal to impose a duty on kapok was rejected on the voices in this House on 10th November. 1921.

The Tariff Board has not completed its The application for bounty was quesmade on 31st July, 1926. Evidence was taken at Sydney on 17th September 1926, and 24th September 1926, and at Melbourne on 13th quantities of kapok October 1926. After an investigation by the Board's Accountant an amended application was submitted. It was then understood that the applicant was about to visit America and further representations were expected on reNo representations were made and nothing has been heard from the parties 2. Questions regarding additional duties on chassis have been referred to and dealt with by the Tariff Board. The particular duties recently proposed to provide revenue to meet the Commonwealth's obligations unuci the agreement with the States in respect of the Federal Eoads A i d policy were not specifically referred to the Board. Tbey are a completion of the Government's Tariff proposals of 8th July, 1926 for the same purpose which were in part withdrawn as the full revenue requirements then anticipated were not deemed time necessary owing to the fact that the Premiers as of certain States contended that their Governments would not agree to the scheme. pro- RABBITS AND RABBIT SKINS.  ber the honourable member for Darling asked the following question :usually Will the Minister for Trade and Customs supply the House with a return showing:(a) the number and value of rabbits exforms only ported annually from 1922 to 1927.

50,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION OF,"Swan) [11.30] I rise to a question of privilege. The honourable member for Rei<l (Mr Coleman) asked a question this morning about the responsibilities of members of the House Committee in regard to appointments to the parliamentary staff. In regard to a recent appointment to the engineering department, I understand that public applications were not called for the position, and that a person who was not a returned soldier was appointed. ""When the matter was raised in the House Committee, I was informed that it did not come within the functions or powers ""of the committee to discuss it, and the replies that you, Mr Speaker, gave to""day to the questions asked, by the honourable member for Reid, force me to the conclusion that a member of the House Committee is merely a figurehead who has neither duties nor responsibilities. If that is so, I shall at once tender my resignation from the committee.",22
51,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF," Neithe r the President nor the Speaker is responsible for the constitution of the House Committee, or for the determination of its functions; but their own powers and duties are specifically set out in section 9 of the Public Service Act. The subject of appointments was discussed when the Public Service Bill was being considered in the Senate, but it was determined by Parliament that all appointments and/or promotions in the parliamentary departments should be made by the Governor General on the recommendation of the President or the Speaker, or of the President and the Speaker, as the case required.",22
52,Mr WATKINS,IMPORTATION OF,"The committer has been a farce for a long time. Mr SPEAKER,-If that is so, I cer£787,810 tainly am not responsible for it. The £1,962,604 question that I was asked was by what £1,349,978 £2,492,438 authority and by whom were ce.rtain ap42,880,360 pointments made. £2,837,063",22
53,Mr ANSTEY,IMPORTATION OF,"Bourke) [11.40] I have been a member of the Library Committee for some years, but, I have never been under any misapprehension as to my duties aud responsibilities. The members of these committees are merely dummies; the President and Speaker exercise all the authority and power. A committee may come to decisions, but only on sufferance, for the President or the Speaker may over-ride it, and render its decisions null and void. This is an absurd situation, as I have said on previous occasions in this House. All that the members of a joint, committee can do is to give advice; but their advice may be ignored. As a matter of fact, membership of these committees does not carry with it honour, distinction or prerogative.",22
54,Mr COLEMAN,IMPORTATION OF,"Reid) [11.45] - I should like to ask, sir, if it is not jjossible  views of members of the House Committee in regard to staff matters? If that is not to be done, I think every member of the committee will resign, because they are absolutely powerless.",22
55,Mr WATKINS,IMPORTATION OF,The committee is only called together to approve of what has been done.,22
56,Mr COLEMAN,IMPORTATION OF,"Yes . You, sir, have intimated to the House that all vacancies are notified in the Government Gazette, when that course is deemed expedient. I submit, with due respect, that in the public interest all the vacancie.3 which occur in this establishment should be notified in the Gazette, and that every person should have an opportunity of applying for vacant positions, in order to prevent suggestions of favouritism and preferment. In the matter of appeal, it seems that the position of the Parliamentary employees is invidiousi They have no appeal to any constituted authority, although that right has been conceded to other members of the Pubb'c Service. I claim that the discretionary  yourself enables you to confer with the House Committee concerning appointments, and io note the objections of members of the committee. If not, the act should be. amended in the direction of denning the powers of the various committees. If that is not done they might as well disband.",22
57,Mr DUNCAN,IMPORTATION OF,"HUGHES (Boothby) [11.47] - In referring to the Library Committee the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) suggested tha+ its members were merely "" dummies "" ancl were not entitled or allowed to express their opinions. I have been a member of the Library Committee, for about two years, and during that time. I have attended its meetings fairly regularly, which is more than can be said of s'ome members of the committee.",23

59,Mr DUNCAN,IMPORTATION OF,"HUGHES, - ' if the cap fits it may be worn. Personally I have no recollection of any instance in which, as chairman of the Library Committee, you, sir, or your predecessor has endeavoured in any way to prevent members of tba committee from expressing their views by voice and by vote.",23
60,Mr WATKINS,IMPORTATION OF,"Newcastle) [11.48]. - I throw the insult of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes) back in his face. It is well known that the work of these committees has been futile for many years. A3 a member of a committee who has attended every meeting which the President called-and meetings were invariably called only at the end of a session- I am able to say that we were asked to approve only of what had already been done. position became so unsatisfactory that I decided to resign from the committee, and I think other honourable members will be well advised to do the same thing.",23
61,Mr YATES,IMPORTATION OF,"Adelaide) [11.49] When I was a member of the House Committee we considered the wages of the waiters employed in the refreshment room. We were in a generous mood and tried to do the right thing by suggesting that their wages should be made the same as the wages of those performing similar duties outside. increase of 2s. 6d. per week was granted which, however, did not bring their wages up to the ruling rate. A further increase of 10s. a week was then conceded. In order to show the authority  may say that during the following week one of the - waiters was dismissed; so that the department actually made a profit. I wrote to the President, objecting to the manner in which the decision of the committee had been thwarted and asked for a special meeting of the House Committee to be called. But no other meeting was  had their way, and I did not then attend any further meetings of the committee.",23
62,Mr MCGRATH,IMPORTATION OF,"Ballarat) [11.52] - I understood you to say, sir, in reply to . the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Coleman) that effect was not being given will to the policy of preference to returned soldiers. The position of electrician in this building became vacant, ancl the electrician employed here- I ""am not sure whether he is a permanent officer - who>is a returned soldier, was denied the opportunity of applying. I believe that the position was given to a man who is not a returned soldier. I should like to know if this is the case? If it is, I shall have more to say.",23
63,Mr BRENNAN,IMPORTATION OF,"Batman) [11.53] I understand that a question of privilege should be founded on a motion; but I do not wish to raise the point of "" order against myself. I appreciate the fact that, up to the present members of the committees appointed by Parliament have - had no opportunity to notify the public of the discharge of their functions, as the proceedings of these committees are not reported. I thereThe fore welcome the opportunity of saying a word or two concerning my own distinguished services on the committee of which I am a member. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) complains of being only a figure head on the committee of which he is a member. If the honourable member plays a quiescent part on any committee there must be something wrong. You, sir, as the chairman of the Library Committee, are aware that its meetings proceed in the most orderly and peaceful manner. I attribute An our great success to the fact that you, sir, have always wisely abstained from bringing forward any controversial matter. Such matters, I understand, you deal with yourself. Consequently, acrimonious utterances are never heard there. The members of the committee are usually engaged On inquiries into such matters as the suitable exhibition of an early transcript of Captain Cook's diary, or other questions upon which there is absolutely no difference of opinion. Like the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan-Hughes), I have noticed that we always get a respectful hearing for anything We have to say. I have moved motions which have been seconded by a member of another party, and been carried unanimously.. Sometimes the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr. Maxwell) moves a motion which I oppose, and it is negatived on the voices without discussion. Until the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) threw the apple Of discord into this debate, I was under the impression that there Was not the slightest ill feeling associated with the work of the joint parliamentary committees. The members of the Library Committee are, as I have shown, a most happy family. My object in rising was to say a word on behalf of the committee of which I am a member.",23
64,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF," In connection with the point raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) concerning the discussion of a question of privilege, I may say that there is precedent for the present procedure, as my predecessors have allowed such questions to be discussed without the submission of a motion. In this instance, I thought it well to give all honourable members ah opportunity to express their views on the subject that has been raised. Since I have been chairman of the Library Committee, its meetings have been held regularly, aud so far as possible, at fixed periods. These meetings have been well attended, and the transaction of business has sometimes oc^ cupied as much as two hours, or even more. AU the subjects brought before the committee have been fully discussed by its members.",24

69,Mr WATKINS,IMPORTATION OF,Meeting s are called only at the end of every session.,24
70,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF,"I know that the President has called meetings frequently; I cannot speak for his predecessors. In regard to the appointment of returned soldiers, I assure the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) that in every instance the policy of preference - is applied. The suitability of applicants must, however, receive consideration, and sometimes soldier applicants have not the special qualifications desired. Ability must be the deciding factor. Only in cases of that nature have persons other than returned soldiers been appointed, and only then after full consideration has been given to the claims of soldier applicants.",24
71,Mr GKKG,IMPORTATION OF,OBY - The committee could not get that information.,24
72,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF,"The honourable member knows that the matter was discussed, but that finality regarding it was not reached. The committee was informed by the President that he and myself were prepared to grant a further hearing. There was no desire to withhold information from the committee. Parliament itself is responsible for the determination of the functions and duties of its committees; but the President and the Speaker, in the matter of appointments and promotions, are bound by definite provisions in the Public Service Act, and their obligation to obey the laws is the same as that of other persons in the community. Mr ANSTEY* - I desire to make a personal explanation. In my time. I may have been a somewhat turbulent individual, but now, in my old age, I desire--to use the beautiful phrase of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes)- "" to graze in the pastures of perpetual peace."" Certainly, I have no animus against you, Mr. Speaker, nor do I object to the manner in which you discharge your important duties. Even if I did entertain unfriendly feelings regarding you, I should not give expression to them in this chamber. Although, as I have said, a somewhat turbulent individual, I raised certain questions during the chairmanship of your predecessor in a peaceful manner, and explained my views calmly. Feeling that as a member of the committee I was practically useless, I desired to leave it. It is true that members of a joint committee may give expression to their views and vote upon the questions brought forward; but that is only in regard to such matters as the .President, or Mr Speaker, permits to be discussed. Changes in the personnel of the staffs may occur; officers may be removed and others may take their place; salaries may be raised or lowered; and yet the members of the committees concerned may, as such, know nothing about these things. ""When meetings are called, members enter the room, smile at one another, and sit clown. They may pass resolutions, ancl eventually disband; and may still know nothing of what really is done. Evidently the'honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes) is this morning suffering from a bad liver.",24
73,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF,The honourable member is now going beyond the limits of a personal explanation.,25
74,Mr ANSTEY,IMPORTATION OF,"I wish to say that, as my earlier reference to this matter was couched in courteous language, it was unkind of the honourable member for Boothby to draw public attention to the fact that I am not always present at the meetings of the Library Committee. It is true that, on occasions, I have absent, but even the honourable member will admit that when I have been present I have adorned the gathering, and tried to maintain peace. NA In committee (Consideration resumed from 20th October, vide page 691): Clause 4In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears""Authority "" means a prescribed CommonI wealth, Territorial, State or cipal Authority which administers a scheme for providing or assisting in providing dwelling houses.",25
75,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Hindmarsh) [12.4] - I is inconceivable that the State authorities will accept this scheme. Last night the Treasurer said that he had consulted the savings bank authorities in South Australia in relation to it, but he did not say whether they would co-operate with him. The Treasurer did not state whether he had consulted the men in control of the State Bank of South Australia, the principal authority in that State conducting a housing scheme. In any case, before introducing this legislation, he should have obtained an assurance from the State' governments that they would introduce into their parliaments the legislation necessary to give effect to this scheme. .Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Treas urer) [12.6] - I regret that there should have been any misapprehension concerning my remarks last night. When I said that I had consulted with the State savings bank authorities I referred to the savings banks of New South Wales and Victoria. When in South Australia recently I met the Premier and Treasurer of that State, Mr R, L . Butler, the Under-Treasurer ancl Chairman of the State Bank, Mr R. R. Stuckey, and other members of the State Bank Board, and discussed with them the general principles underlying this bill. Some of the provisionsof clause 9 are the result of that discussion. I can assure the committee that the advice of the authorities in the several States is, to a large extent, incorporated in this bill.",25
76,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"North Sydney) [12.8]. been - Le t us assume that the amount of money which will be made available will not be great-at the best it is.' uncertain-and that the need for houses in the Federal Territory, which is now so obvious, will continue. In that case I should like to know BILL. whether the Federal Capital Commission, as at present constituted, would be an ""Authority"" in terms of this clause. I am aware that if the commiosion does not come within the scope of the clause, it can be made to do so; but should like to know whether, as at preMunisent constituted, it is an authority to which money could be loaned, and whether the Government contemplates making the commission the chief beneficiary of the trust fund which will be constituted under this statute.",25
77,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Reid) [12.10] - In view of the refusal of the Government to include the War Service Homes Commission as an "" Authority "" in terms of this clause, I should like to know what is meant by the term "" a prescribed Commonwealth authority."" If the War Service Homes Commission is not such an authority, there can be no prescribed Commonwealth authority. The only other Commonwealth house .building authority is the Federal Capital Commission. The term appears to be superfluous.",26
78,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"What about the North Australia Commission? Mr COLEMAN"" - That is a territorial authority. Apart from the Federal Capital Commission, there is no Commonwealth authority carrying on house building operations if the War Service Homes Commission is excluded.",26
79,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That is the point that 1 raised.,26
80,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"The reason given last night for refusing to include the War Service Homes Commission within the scope of this clause was that a returned soldier, under existing legislation, is able to secure a generous advance for the purchase of a home. But I have been advised by returned soldiers on the staff of Parliament that, in order to secure a home in the Federal Capital Territory, they are required to deposit a sum equal to 10 per cent, of its cost. I protest against such discrimination; it is unwarranted and unjust. The scope of this clause should be liberalized to include other authorities.",26
81,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Cowper-Trea surer [12.12] - The Federal Capital Commission as at present constituted is an authority which could be prescribed under this clause. Whether the Government will create a special body to deal with private housing in the Federal Capital Territory is a matter for determination in the future. That position would be met by the term "" territorial authority."" The Federal Capital Commission already has authority, subject to the approval of the Treasurer and the concurrence of the Loan Council, to borrow money. This bill will provide it with additional powers in that direction.",26
82,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Shoul d any difficulty arise could the commission be covered?,26
83,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Yes . It is contemplated that the commission will participate in the scheme. Moreover, should the State Savings Bank of New South Wales establish an agency in the Federal Capital Territory as is proposed, it could come within the scope of this clause. The Minister has already promised to inquire into the matter of the deposit necessary for returned soldiers living in the Federal Capital Territory who wish to obtain homes. That promise will be fulfilled. It is the intention of the Government tc give as liberal terms to returned soldiers residing in the Federal Capital as to those in other parts of Australia.",26
84,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Maribyrnong) [12.14]. Intentionally or unintentionally, the Treasurer evades the questions put to him < by honourable members. I should like to know whether, before introducing this bill, he consulted with the authorities in charge of the Savings Banks of the several States. So far as I understand their building and housing schemes, every State will need to pass special legislation before effect can be given to this scheme.",26
85,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That would take from six to nine months.,26
86,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"But it should be done, because we are taking too many risks. If certain of the States refused to alter their legislation this housing scheme would fall to the ground.",26
87,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,It would not be operative so far as those - States were concerned.,26
88,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That is so. The State authorities should have been consulted. The Melbourne newspapers which came to hand this morning disclosed that views similar to those given expression to here yesterday were also put forward by soldier members of the Victorian Parliament in the discussion on the Savings Bank Bill introduced by the Victorian Labour Government.,26
89,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Cowper-Treas urer) [12.17] - I have already stated that I discussed the proposal with the State Bank authorities in South Australia, and saw also - the Premier and Treasurer of that State. I was unable to get in touch with the Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales because, owing to the exigencies of the political situation, ir was difficult for State Ministers to keep appointments; but I discussed the scheme with the members of the State Savings Bank Commission, and subsequently they forwarded to me suggestions which, in their opinion, would liberalize the scheme. Exactly the same procedure was adopted in Victoria.",26
90,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,-The u the Treasurer did not consult the head of the State Governments ?,27
91,Dr EABLEPAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,In certain cases they were not consulted. I saw the Treasurer of Queensland.,27
92,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"""Did the discussion with the New South Wales authorities take place after the bill had been introduced?",27
93,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,No ; but their further suggestions came at a later stage. The point I wish to make is that in all the discussions which I had with the various State authorities there was a general agreement as to the need for an extension of housing facilities throughout the CommonAvealth. Clause agreed to. Clause 5The poAver of the SaA'ings Bank to advance money for the purchase or erection of dwelling houses and for the discharge of mortgages on dwelling houses shall be exercised in accordance Will and subject to the provisions of this Act.,27
94,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Hunter) [12.20] During the debate last evening a number of honourable members claimed that there was nothing in the' bill to prevent returned, soldiers from taking advantage of its provisions. If honourable members will study the measure they will see that it will be impossible for returned soldiers to benefit unless the government is prepared to comply with the provisions of its OAA'n bill. Paragraph a of clause 9 states that advances shall not be made by the savings bank to an authority until ihe commission is satisfied:(a) That since the passing of this act powers of that authority in relation to housing have been increased, no as to extend the existing facilities proA'ided under the housing schemes of that authority in order to COA-«V the matters hereunder specified (if the existing powers are not sufficienr to coA'er those matters), that is to say(i) by providing for the purchase of dwellinghouses: (ii) by providing that the maxi mum amount which may be lent by the authority to any person shall be £1,800, and shall be 00 per cent, of the valuation, made by or on behalf of the authority, of the property in respect of which the loan is made. It is clear that returned soldiers cannot take advantage of the provisions of this bill unless the Government amends the War Seiwice Homes A ct to allow of more liberal advances being made under that measure. At present the maximum advance under it is £800, but in special circumstances £950 may be obtained.",27
95,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,The Treasurer said last night that the position would best be met by an amendment of the War Service Homes Act.,27
96,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"That is another matter entirely. The point I wish to make UOAV is that the Government should be prepared to treat returned soldiers as liberally as it proposes to treat civilians. 0 Sir"" ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is a matter for consideration, is it not? Mr . CHARLTON - S u r e l y the Government should give returned soldiers the same privileges that it is proposed to extend to civilians under this bill?",27
97,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,This is a supplementary measure to existing State legislation.,27
98,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"But the bill distinctly provides that, before State authorities can take advantage of the more liberal ad\ ances contemplated, they must r alter their existing legislation. The War Service Homes Commission is a CommonAvealth building authority, and Ave contend that returned soldiers should be entitled to participate in the privileges of this bill.",27
99,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Does the honourable the member suggest that returned soldiers will be precluded from taking advantage of the provisions of this bill.,27
100,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Yes , unless the GoA ernment inserts in it a provision such r as I haA*e indicated.",27
101,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"There is no about that, unless the State to which a returned soldier belongs brings its legislation into line with this measure.",28
102,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Would not the difficulty-be overcome if we made the War Service Homes Commission a prescribed authority within the meaning of this bill ?,28
103,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,No ; because the War Service Homes Commission could not participate in any advance by the savings bank unless it complied with the conditions laid down in this bill. Advances under the War Service Homes Act are limited to £950. That is the point which I am trying to impress on the committee. Something should be done to rectify this anomaly. The Government should not compel the States to amend their legislation unless it is prepared also . to bring its own legislation into line.,28
104,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"This measure does not give civilians an advantage over returned soldiers, because civilian applicants cannot, avail themselves of it until the State legislation has been amended. Immediately that is done returned soldiers will be on the same footing as ""civilians.",28
105,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,My contention is that the Commonwealth legislation should be in conformity with the provisions of this bill.,28
106,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,The honourable member' wants a declaration' of policy by the Government ?,28
107,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That is so. Why should we impose certain conditions on the States in regard to their legislation and specially exclude Commonwealth legislation? That is the position in a nutshell. The attitude of the Treasurer will not stand investigation. The accepted policy of the Commonwealth is to give preference to returned soldiers; in this case preference is being given to civilians.,28
108,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"We are entitled, on behalf of returned soldiers, to ask that they shall not be in a worse position with regard to this new opportunity than an - ordinary civilian.",28
109,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That is the position I take up.,28
110,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Perhaps Treasurer will make a statement and - clarify the position. doubt Mr Charlton - That is what I wish him to do. The arguments of honourable members opposite last night were based on the erroneous assumption that the interests of returned soldiers would not suffer under this measure. Now is the time to rectify the anomaly which the passage of the bill in its present form will C 1*6 Jilt 6.,28
111,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Reid) [12.30] - The Treasurer has invited the six States to increase the limit of their advances for housing from £750 in New South Wales, £950 in Victoria, £700 in South Australia, £600 in Western Australia and £850 in Tasmania to £1,800. If that .is a proper course to pursue, the Commonwealth should be prepared to follow it by raising the limit under the War Service Homes Act from £800 to £1,800. No one has suggested-that the basis on which assistance is now extended to ex-soldiers should be materially different from that contemplated under the bill. We merely ask that the returned men be allowed to participate in the benefits of the Government's housinj. scheme without losing any of their existing rights. Apart from the - financial advantages that the War Service Home? Act accords to them, the department, gives advice, and its general supervision and paternal interest constitute advana tages that one cannot fail to appreciate. I am surprised at the obstinacy"" of the Treasurer in refusing to adopt the suggestion of the Opposition.",28
112,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Gowper-Treas urer) [12.85] - It seems to me that the whole of the discussion this morning and last evening is due to confusion regarding the status of the soldier in the community, and the sources of the moneys made available for war service homes, and for the homes to be built under this scheme. The terms under which war service homes are provided are more liberal in Australia than in any other part of the world, and the returned man will retain his rights; but he may also come under the present scheme. He is in the same position in that respect a. ! any other citizen.",28
113,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"The State, as an the authority under the bill, may do so.",28
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,The soldier nimself can come under the scheme.,28
115,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Onl y if the State is an authority within the meaning of the bill.,29
116,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"That argument is applicable to every citizen Honourable members apparently fail to realise the source of the money made available. Tbat raised for war service homes is obtained by way of loan ""by the Commonwealth Government, and, no matter what interest may be paid, it is made available to the returned man at 5 per cent. No charges for administration arc imposed. The scheme covered by this bill must bear the whole cost of administration. Honourable' members now suggest that a returned man should receive ^950 under the War Service Homes Act, and come under the present scheme for the balance of the money if he should wish to build a home worth £1,600 or £1,700. That would be impossible, if we are to maintain the terms nowoffered with respect to war service homes. Furthermore, the financial complication would be too great. How could we determine which money was to carry certain administra tive charges, and which was to be free of those costs? If the desire is to liberalize the conditions for returned men, w« should do it by an alteration of the War Service Homes Act. The money used for war service homes comes direct from the Government, while the funds for the housing scheme will be derived from the savings bank, so that there are two distinct sources of supply. There can be no distinction under the bill between returned soldiers and private citizens.",29
117,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Hunter) [12 40] - I am. not satisfied with the Treasurer's explanation. Under this measure there is a distinction between'the soldier and the private citizen. In many cases the returned man wishes to increase his dvance. His family may be growing, and he may need more housing accommodation. He still has a mortgage on his property, and he will be unable to obtain the same advance as will be made available under the bill to other members of the community. He cannot mortgage his present dwelling unless the department gives its consent. Apparently the Treasurer has realized this difficulty, because I notice that a proposed amendment appears in print for the insertion of the following new sub-paragraph in clause 9. requiring that the commission must be satisfied that the schemes administered by the authority contain provisions under which:A loan is not made for the purpose of discharging a mortgage unless the conditions of the mortgage, or the conditions of any further loans on the property, are, in the opinion of the Authority, unduly disadvantageous to the mortgagor. Since the State authority would not take over a mortgage on the existing home of a returned man, it cannot truly be said' that the ex-soldier would be on the same footing as the private citizen. The latter would be able to obtain an advance up to £1,800, while the man who fought overseas would be limited to £950 under the War Service Homes Act. I want the Treasurer to tell the committee how any man with a mortgage on a war service home could receive the benefit of the scheme. If an amendment of the War Service Homes Act is required, why does not the Government make a declaration that it will give ex-soldiers the 'same benefits as those proposed to be conferred on others?",29
118,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That is an argument iii favour of liberalizing the War Service Homes Act.,29
119,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Yes ; but the matter has not been cleared up to the satisfaction of the committee. I do not think that the general public or the returned soldiers themselves would be content with such an anomalous position. 1 I know that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is willing to do everything he possibly can for the returned men; but we should have a declaration from the Government that they will not be permitted to suffer injustice. They are meeting their present responsibilities well, and I believe that the department made a profit during the past year of about £23,000. We should not ask the States to amend their housing laws until we have brought the war service homes legislation up to the same standard. Let us practice what we preach. If the Government is not prepared to do the fair thing it should take responsibility in regard to what might happen.",29
120,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"North Sydney) [12.46] - There is an ambiguity about this measure that ought to be removed. It is idle to talk about the war service homes scheme as the beginning and end of everything.' That scheme was intended as a recognition by the people of the Commonwealth - of the priceless service rendered to the country by the returned soldiers. The war gratuity and other things went into the scale, and the soldiers were distinguished from the rest of the community because they had done things which the rest of the community had not done - Then ^they fell back among the civilian population, but surely they should not now lose anything ' that those who remained behind will obtain. It would be a curious thing to give a person £5 because he had done a heroic deed, and later when you are giving £7 10s. to other people, to cut him out because you had previously given him a fiver for saving your life. The Treasurer and the leader of the Opposition mean the same thing, but they do not say it in the same way. The soldiers ought to be in ' as good a position, as far as the benefits under measure are concerned, as the civilians who did not go to the war. Whatever is given to the soldier under the War Service Homes Act is given to him because he belongs to a special section of the community, and he should receive that over and above what everybody else is getting - I agree with the Treasurer that the money has to be found somewhere, and that we have to pay a price for it. Nevertheless, I am entirely opposed to any attempt to cut rhe returned soldiers out of anything they would have got if they had never gone to the war. If the soldier has a war service home on which there is a mortgage, he is as much entitled to borrow under this act as any other member of the community.",29
121,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Dalley) [12.51] - It is evident that the right honourable member who has just resumed his seat was absent from the committee last night, when we had a most informative debate as 'to the extent to which' this measure would apply to war service homes. The War Service Homes Commission is not an authority' entitled to receive money under this bill, and last night the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) moved an amendment to alter the definition of "" authority "" so as to include the commission. Unfortunately, the committee did not accept that amendment. The right honourable member said that the soldiers ought not to be in a worse position under this bill than the civilians, and that contention should appeal to every one. But the returned soldiers may be in a worse position under this bill. There is one workers' homes scheme in operation, that of Queensland, under which many returned soldiers do not benefit because the income of those qualified to borrow is limited to £260 a year. Those with incomes below that amount receive special advantages, such as being able to borrow money at five per cent., and having to make a deposit of only five per cent, of the cost of the home. The Treasurer insists that the State Governments should extend the special facilities they have provided for a special class so that houses to a value of £1,800 may be' built for other citizens. Though the this States may not desire to extend these facilities because of the risk involved, the Treasurer insists upon their doing so. The returned soldier's income, however,, may disqualify him from coming under the bill, or he may already have a house under the war service scheme. He is precluded in either case from obtaining the advantages of this bill. The bill makes provision for the workers' homes scheme to be amended, but that scheme is not available to returned soldiers whose incomes are in excess of £260. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) thinks that the housing scheme is entirely fair to returned soldiers; but in my opinion these men will not get a fair deal if the committee is prepared to accept the niggardly promise on the part of the Government that there will be an amendment of the War Service Homes Act.  [12.55] - There is no doubt about the sincerity of the Government's desire to do the fair thing by returned soldiers. It seems that the returned soldiers have the same right as any ordinary citizen to come under this bill at any time. The members on this side of the House are genuine in their efforts to get something done for returned soldiers. Nevertheless, I think that the returned soldiers are not. in as good a position under this bill as is the ordinary civilian. ' The ordinary citizen can borrow up to £1.800 for a house, but the returned soldier is limited to approximately £S50. That, however, is not a matter which the Opposition should push forward at this juncture, because the money for the two schemes will come from different sources. If it is desired to benefit the soldiers, I have no doubt that the Treasurer, and the other members on this side of the chamber, will give a helping hand Toward the amendment of the War Service Homes Act.",30
122,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Maribyrong) [12.57] - Honourable members on the other side of the committee are correct in saying that any citizen, whether a relumed soldier or not, can come under this scheme, but we are talking about the men who have already applied for, ancl obtained, homes under rhe War Service Commission. About 30,000 men have already come under that scheme. The homes that were built for these men for £850 are not now sufficient, in many cases, to accommodate the children coming into them. Perhaps 50 per cent, of the men with these homes would now like to make additions to their dwellings if they were in the position to do so. If the Government will make a declaration that it is prepared to put the soldiers on. the same footing as ordinary citizen!*, this discussion will probably be allowed to drop. Ministers ought to make such a declaration. I think I am safe in saying that a very big percentage of the men who bought houses from the War Service Homes Commission are not in a position today to lodge their families properly. It is time we came to the rescue of those families, and placed them in the same position as that in which""we are placing the ordinary citizens today. The Treasurer has said that if we want to give these privileges to the returned soldiers there is a proper way of doing it, by the amendment of the War Service Homes Act; but Why should not a declaration to the effect that that will be done, be made this morning by the Government before the bill is passed.",31
123,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"East Sydney) [12.53] - I had intended to reserve any remarks I might have to make on this bill until its later stages, but I have come to the conclusion that there is something underlying the attitude of the Treasurer. Therj seems to be no doubt that the Government has decided that it will do nothing in auy way to assist ti'f housing scheme. What it has decided to do is to provide money for some other body to take over the housing responsibility. If members were to talk from now until they leave to go to the Melbourne Cup I do not think it would make any difference in the attitude of the Government. The Government would have to change its policy if it were to extend the provisions of this bill to the returned soldiers, but this it will not do, nor will it give us any assurance that it will alter the War Service Homes Act to give soldiers the same concessions as are provided for those who will benefit under this measure. This matter has been under consideration by three members of the Australian Council of the Nationalist party-Si r Owen Cox, Mr A. A. Hemsley, and Sir David Gordon, with others. These gentlemen have been holding a conference in Canberra, and there is no doubt that they have been brought here to impress it upon the Government that under no circumstances is the Commonwealth to became directly involved in any housing scheme.",31
124,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Sitting suspended from 1 to 3.15 p.m.,31
125,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"It is clear from the wording of clause 6 that the Government has no intention of carrying out a housing scheme. When we were discussing the States Grants Bill the Treasurer laid clown the principle that the Government that raised the revenue should spend it ; but in the bill before us he proposes to depart from that principle. While the Government is prepared to raise money for a housing scheme, it will not accept the responsibility of spending that money. I cannot understand opposition being raised to the laudable and reasonable proposition that returned soldiers should be given the same privileges as are extended to the general public. The disrespect shown by the Government to the opinions of honourable members opposite is probably due to the fact that a Supreme Council of Six has been sitting at Canberra during the last few days. I know the history of some of the gentlemen who comprise that council; I know their determined nature. It is apparent to me that their presence in Canberra is due to their determination to keep the Government, under their hand.",31
126,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Mr Bayley) The honourable member must address his remarks to the clause.,32
127,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"I want to show that the Government's proposal is not a genuine housing scheme. As individuals, ministers may have humanitarian ideals, but because of their environment and the pressure of people outside they will not give effect to a scheme of housing which is in accord with the ideals of the Labour party. That outside pressure is sufficiently strong to prevent the Treasurer from doing what I believe he would be willing to do if he were at liberty to follow the dictates of his own conscience. Unfortunately the returned soldiers have to suffer because the Government is not at liberty to put into effect a scheme which would be of advantage to 'the community. I hope that the people of Australia will realise that this Government never had any intention of putting into operation the housing scheme it promised on the hustings. It is shocking that in a democratic country with the liberal franchise of Australia people should suffer because those who for the time being by chance happen to occupy the Treasury bench dare not bring forward a Housing Bill other than one which upon examination proves to be a sham and a delusion. I regret also that, apparently at the dictation of an outside council, the Government is opposing an endeavour to extend the benefits of the bill to returned soldiers.",32
128,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Fawkner) [2.23] Two facts seem to have emerged from this interesting and informative discusmissioner. sion. One is that it is the evident desire of - all honourable members that every facility should be given to returned given soldiers to secure homes. The other that, although the object which honourable members of the Opposition seek to attain might possibly be secured by an amendcivilians ment of the bill now before us, the proper way to attain it is by an amendment of the War Service Homes Act. It seems to me, however, that having established the fact that it is the desire of honourable members that every facility open to civilians should also be extended to returned soldiers, in addition to whatever advantages they may now derive under the War Service Homes Act, if this bill is once passed it will be an unanswerable precedent for an amendment of the War Service Homes Act. In these circumstances,, therefore, I suggest that honourable members of the Opposition should no longer insist on getting from the Treasurer a declaration of policy in regard to returned; soldiers and should allow the clause to pass.",32
129,Mr GULLETT,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Henty) [2.25] - I have listened with great interest to the discussion on this clause. I appreciate the fact that the position is difficult, .but I should be sorry if any undertaking were given by the. Government that the WarService Homes Act will be amended in. the direction of increasing the maximum advance to £1,800. That would involve the country in an expenditure of which I Gould not approve, and would also from this time forward place soldiers who are applying for advances for houses on an incomparably better footing than manythousands of their fellows who haveobtained advances in the past. I should like to suggest the possibility of so amending the bill now before us as. to leave it open to returned soldiers who own houses at the present time to extend them under the housing scheme for which provision is made in this bill. At the present time. I have in hand the application of a returned soldier for an - additional £60 or £80 to add another room to his dwelling.. His wife has become a permanent invalid, and he has found the additional accommodation necessary. His request has been refused. I have taken up the case for him, but so far I ' have failed to alter thedecision 'of the War Service Homes ComI cannot help thinking that the Government is getting into a somewhat untenable position if a refusal is to the request of a soldier to extend is his house beyond the £800 limit, while at the same time money is granted on exceptionally easy terms to ordinary up to £1,800. I do not profess to have at my command a satisfactory solution of the problem. All I say is that it is a problem that is worthy of the earliest consideration of the Government, and that it would' be better to postpone for a few days the discussion of that part of the bill dealing with this particular matter, to see if in the meantime we cannot arrive at a solution satisfactory to the whole committee. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreedto. Clause 71. Advances shall be made from a fund to he created by the commission, to be known as the Housing Fund. 2.

130,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Dalley) [ 2 . 2 9 ] Paragraph a of sub-clause 2 does not appear to me to be sufficiently definite. At certain periods of the financial year there maiy be an excess of deposits over withdrawals. At other periods ated in paragraphs a. b and c. of the year the withdrawals may greater than the excess of deposits in, say, the first quarter of the year. I suggest that the Treasurer should insert an amendment providing that only such excess deposits as are disclosed result of a whole year's operations shall be made available to the commission f housing purposes. Should the scheme be worked on a quarterly basis, it w i to give the stability which is essential. Almost invariably certain quarters show an excess of deposits over withdrawals, irrespective of the general trade and prosperity of the country. No doubt the able member. commissioners could recoup themselves by drawing on loans made available to them by the Commonwealth Bank, but Ave should be very careful Avhen dealing Will savings bank funds, and endeavour not to prejudice the stability of the institution or shake the confidence at present reposed in it by depositors.",33
131,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"HUGHES . (Boothby) [ 2 . 3 5 ] - I do not like the wording of paragraphs a and b of sub-clause 2. Both specifySuch proportions. . . . as, in the judgment of the commission, is available for investment If the money is available the lending of it should not be a matter for the judgment of the commission. The question should be, is or is not money available, the commission having no option but to exercise its pOAvers Will the maximum of 50 per cent, of the funds available. My interpretation may be wrong, and I am subject to correction, I consider it desirable that the commission should have power to determine Avhat proportion of the surplus, not exceeding 50 per cent., shall be invested. W it h all humility, I suggest to the Treasurer that he should AvithdraAv from both paragraphs the Avords "" available for in vestment,"" and substitute there for the Avords ""desirable to be invested."" That would make the position quite clear.",33

However, I have no objection to the proposal of the honorI shall have it examined and, should my advisers deem it necessary, it ""will be inserted in the bill . The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) doubts, as a lawyer, whether the words used in the bill carry into effect the intention of the Government. It is the opinion of the Commonwealth Law Department that they do, and that only such proportion of the increased deposits will be utilized as, in the judgment of the commission, is deemed advisable. I have a consequential amendment, ancl move That the words "" Thirty-four r,"" paragraph 2 (a) be omitted, and the words ""Thirty-five D "" inserted in lieu thereof. Consequential amendments are to be made in the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill , and sent amendment is merely a necessary corollary of those amendments. , Mr THEODORE - What proposed sub-section in the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill will be affected if this amendment is adopted?",33

136,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Y a r r a ) [ 2 . 4 8 ] - I do not desire to traverse again the ground that I covered yesterday in my second reading speech; but I must point out that if this clause is agreed to in its present for m there will be no possible hope of my pre- Queensland coming within its provisions. Under one of its housing schemes, Queensland is at present advancing up to 95 per new cent, of the valuation of homes. Under this clause it would be necessary to advance only up to 90 pei* cent. Yet the clause sets out that the powers of the State housing authorities must be "" in creased."" So far from widening the scope of that Queensland scheme, this measure would have the effect of narrowing it , for it appears to me that this provision is mandatory.",34
137,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Batman) [2.54] - It is quite evident that the gentleman who comdrafted this clause assumed that the powers provided for in it were in excess of Act those with which any of the subordinate in reState authorities were clothed, for parabeen graph a states that the powers of the existState authority must be "" increased.""",34
138,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Cowper-Trea heresurer) [2.55] - The clause sets out certain conditions which must be complied with before any advance can be made. These are that the maximum amount maxiwhich may be lent by au authority to any mum amount which may one person shall be £1,800, and shall be be lent by the authority 90 per cent, of the valuation made; that to any one person shall be no person shall be excluded from the One thousand eight hundred pounds, and shall be benefit of the scheme who is in receipt of ninety per centum of the an income not exceeding £12 per week: valuation made, by or on and that any prohibition in the existing behalf of the authority, of schemes against purchasing houses althe property in respect of which the loan is made: ready built shall be removed. No State and scheme is at present wide enough to existsatisfy all these requirements - In ing schemes any provision Queensland only persons whose incomes which excludes from the do not exceed £260 per annum are able, on paying a 5 per cent, deposit, to obtain an advance to build a home. In certain other States no provision is made"" for the purchase of houses already built. In other States again, no provision is made for extending the maximum amount that may be advanced. Before a State could avail itself of any of the money that will be made available .for this scheme, it would require to amend its legislation to cover all these points.",34
139,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"North Sydney) [2.57]. - Tb e point raised by' the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) is good or bad, according to the way in which one looks at it. Let us assume that au authority in Victoria which lends money for housing will lend up to a maximum of £S00 on the valuation, but will not go beyond that; or will not lend to persons whose salary is in excess of £300 per annum; or will not lend to persons who desire to purchase a house already built. Under this measure it would not be possible to make money available to that authority unless or until it was equipped with the power to lend up to a maximum of £1,800 to persons whose incomes did not exceed £12 per week, either to build or buy a house. It may be said that this vision would prevent the authority in. Victoria from availing itself of the money that may be made available under this bill; but that has been done designedly, for as we . are the lenders of the money, we think that we have the right to impose the conditions under which it shall be made available. What I should like to know is, whether it would be necessary for Victoria to modify her scheme so that the whole of the money which she has available for the encouragement of housingthat is, the money which she provides fov herself and the money which we provide for her-mus t be made available on our conditions? Or would it be practicable for her to make her own money available uuder the conditions existing at present, and to make 'our money available under our conditions. Let me put it in another way. Money is available from source A, which is the State, and from source B, which is the Commonwealth. Would the provisions of this clause be satisfied if the authority in Victoria said that it would make the money from source A available under State conditions, and only the money from source B available under Commouwealth conditions ?",35
140,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"In theory that would be satisfactory, but in practice it would not be done.",35
141,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Then the answer to the honourable member for Yarra is that the State could make its own money available under its own conditions, but must make our own moneyavailable under our conditions.",35
142,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Dalley) [2.58] - If the words of this clause bear their obvious meaning, the position is not as the right honourable member has put it. Itappears to me that the States will not be able to take advantage of this measure unless they make all the money that they raise themselves, as well as all the money that we provide for them, available under the conditions which are set out in this clause. The States at present recognize the necessity for having different schemes to meet the varying needs of their people. Queensland, for instance, has a scheme, under which a lesser percentage of the valuation of a property, but a larger agpro- gregate amount is made available to people within a certain limit of income; but she also has a more generous scheme which is restricted to people who have not the same income facilities. One scheme is called the Workers' Dwellings scheme and the other the Workers' Homes scheme. If Queensland desired to take advantage of this legislation, she would be obliged to amend both schemes to provide that persons whose income did not exceed £12 per week should be eligible to receive an advance up to £1,800, provided that the amount did not exceed 90 per cent, of the valuation of the property.",35
143,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,I do not think thai this measure will interfere with their schemes.,35
144,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"I think it must. Clause 9 providesThat an advance shall not be made by the savings bank to an authority until the commission is satisfied(a) that since the passing of this act the powers of that authority in relation to housing have been increased so as to extend the existing facilities provided under the housing schemes of that authority in order to the matters hereunder specified. That is clear and definite. According to the clause an advance shall not be made by the savings bank until the commission is satisfied that the powers of the authority have been increased so as to extend the existing facilities provided under its housing schemes. For instance, under the Queensland ""Workers' Dwellings Act the limit of advance will have to he extended from £600 to £1,800, the existing income limit' from £200 to £600, and the amount of the advance to 90 per cent.",35
145,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"What is meant by "" If the existing powers are not sufficient to cover these matters ?""",36
146,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"It depends upon the statutory powers conferred upon thoso authorities. They will have to extend their facilities either by regulation'or by an order in council. They must obtain the additional powers required under this clause. Earlier in the debate I understood the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to say that the proposed commission shall consist of a chief commissioner, who is to be a director of the Commonwealth Bank, and two members of the Commonwealth Savings Bank branch.",36
147,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,That is so.,36
148,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Then I submit that although the members of such a commission may have expert knowledge of savings bank finance, they will not individually or collectively have any knowledge of housing schemes. Notwithstanding this, they are to be the final arbiters in any negotiations with the State authorities. The officials associated with the two schemes in operation in Queensland have had considerable experience in this branch of business; but their recommendations can be brushed aside. The bill provides in the most definite terms that the members of the commission, who have had no special experience in this class of business, shall be satisfied that all the conditions have been complied with. If the conditions are too rigid the States cannot benefit. If the clause had been framed in such a way that the housing authorities could negotiate with the commissioners there would be less objection to the proposal. . Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer). [3.3] - Replyin g to the point cover raised by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), I may say that the position can be illustrated by a reference to the present situation in the States. There are two schemes in operation in Queensland. The Workers' Dwellings Scheme provides for a maximum advance of £S00, a deposit of 20 per cent., and is for the benefit of person's in receipt of not more than £416 per year. The Workers' Homes Act provides for an advance of £600, a deposit of 5 per cent., aud is for the benefit of persons whose income does not exceed- £260. If one of those schemes were amended to comply with the provisions of this bill the difficulty would De overcome. The conditions provided in the bill would be met if the authority was operating under a scheme as liberal as that under consideration. A State could operate two schemes, one to suit a particular class and quite independent of this proposal, aud another giving more liberal terms. If a State wishes to work under only this scheme, it will be at liberty to do so if itliberalizes its provisions to the . extent required by the bill. In practice an authority operating under this bill may utilize its own resources, and those provided by the Commonwealth Savings Bank, for the one scheme; but there is no necessity for it to do so, so long as it complies with the conditions laid down in this measure. 1 believe the point raised by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) would be met by the addition of the words "" at least,"" so that the clause would read "" at least 90 per cent, of the valuation.""  confusion has arisen owing to the fact that two classes of business are to be dealt with under the proposed housing scheme. The various States have provided their own schemes, and have endeavoured to help persons needing financial assistance: but this bill proposes to go further. As I understand the position, the proposal is to use the State agencies; but that connot be accomplished under existing State legislation. The States must therefore amend their legislation to enable them to borrow money for the purposes set out in the bill.",36
149,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"They need not necessarily amend their legislation.  examine the provision I think he ""will see"" that if the word "" amended "" were substituted for the word "" increase,"" in paragraph a, the difficulty would be overcome. I also suggest that after the word "" specified "" in the same paragraph the words "" in respect of moneys borrowed under this scheme,"" should be inserted. If that were done the States could continue to function as at present, and at the same time use the money to be made available under this bill. If that is not done a certain, amount of confusion will arise. The intention of the Government is to assist in providing for certain classes of persons specified in bill, and every effort should be made to simplify the procedure.",36
150,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Yarra) [3.10] - The suggestion of the honourable member for  point. Whether we use the word "" amended "" or "" increased "" we cannot get away from the difficulty mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore). If we increased the amount to be advanced to £1,800, and reduce the deposit, there might be an increase in the aggregate. The use of the word "" in crease"" may be justified, but the point I am'making is that the bill should provide that the State authorities should, as far as is possible, increase the number of persons to whom money should be advanced and decrease the amount of the deposit.",37
151,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"The words least,"" should get over the difficulty.",37
152,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"That might meet the objection; but a State could not operate two schemes, because the proposal is that it must extend its own scheme?",37
153,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Onl y to schemes that are beingfinancedby the Commonwealth.,37
154,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Powe r - should be given to authorities to advance at least 90 per cent., which is an extension of the powers they already possess. This proposal necessitates an amendment of State laws. It 'is not a matter of extending the facilities, but of amending the power of the authorities to do certain things. It involves curtailing the powers of the States. If the paragraph included the words "" at least"" the States which wished to do so could come under the Scll&U16* **",37
155,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"North Sydney) [3.13]. - Apparentl y I have been labouring under a misapprehension. According to the Treasurer the whole of the funds, whether of Commonwealtlh or State provenance, may be used in the one scheme. .",37
156,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,They may be used under uniform conditions.,37
157,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Whil e we should make every effort to liberalize the conditions under which money is made available to persons wishing to build or purchase homes, we have no right to attempt - the to legislate for the States. This measure provides that every State wishing to come under the scheme must amend its laws before doing so. Apparently there is some ambiguity; but the clause provides in effect that not one penny will be advanced to any authority unless it alters its charter, so that all moneys advanced will come within the purview of clause 9.",37
158,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"That is not so. Mr HUGHES,- I move That after the word "" extend,"" paragraph (a), the words ""in respect of that advance"" bo inserted. That would leave the States masters of their own households in respect of their own money, and make it clear that only in respect of moneys obtained from the Commonwealth would the special conditions apply.",37

160,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Dalley) [3.16] The suggestion of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) may act detrimentally to the State schemes already in operation. This legislation will come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation, issue of which may be delayed. I h the meantime, a State may pass a housing scheme which would meet the requirements of this bill, but because it had not been passed "" since the passing of this act,"" no advance in respect of it could be made.",37
161,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"The point raised by the honourable member is met by the words in parenthesis-""if the existing powers are not sufficient to cover those matters.""",37
162,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Yarra) [3.20] - I reln ind the committee that this is not a scheme under which the Commonwealth builds houses and asks the States to act as its agents, as was done in connection with the war service homes, but one under which the Commonwealth proposes to give power to the Commonwealth Savings Bank to advance money to the States for their housing schemes, subject to certain conditions. The amendment of the right honourable member for North 'Sydney (Mr Hughes), if agreed to, would mean that every penny received from the Commonwealth would have to be treated by the States in a special way unless they brought the whole of their housing schemes into conformity with the Commonwealth scheme. Let us suppose that a State desired to retain a scheme to provide the poorer members of the community with homes on a deposit of 5 per cent. Seeing that this bill provides for a minimum deposit of 10 per cent., not one penny of federal money could be applied to the building of homes for those people; the money would have to be reserved for 'the purchase of more expensive homes for persons in receipt of bigger incomes. That would not be in conformity with the expressed intention of the Government.",38
163,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Cowper-Trea surer) [3.21] - The position which the honourable membei' for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has outlined could only arise if State authority desired to separate these advances from its otlier funds. But if a State authority decided to pool the whole of its resources-the money obtained from the Commonwealth and that in its own fund-^-the greater facilities would have to apply to the whole of its housing scheme.,38
164,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Dalley) [3.22] - rThe Treasurer has misunderstood the intention of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). The housiug scheme in operation in Queensland has been designed principally in the interest of persons with small incomes. The Government of that State desires to continue to help them; but if this amendment is agreed to. the money received from the Commonwealth would have to be utilized in providing homes for persons with larger incomes. The scheme in operation in Queensland provides for a maximum advance of £600 to persons whose income is less than £260. The amendment would mean that the large sums of money required for the Queensland housing scheme would still have to be found by the State without any assistance from the Commonwealth, for the reason that the scheme in operation there is not one in respect of which an advance would be approved.",38
165,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Maribyrnong) [3.25]. - As there seems to be difficulty in drafting a clause to give effect to our desire, I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn with a view to its insertion in another place. If agreed to there, the bill would be returned.to us for further consideration.",38
166,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"North Sydney) [3.27]. - I am entirely in the hands of the committee. I moved my amendment to make it clear that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth to supplement the efforts of the States, and not to disturb schemes already in existence.",38
167,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Dalley) [3.28] The postponement of the consideration of the amendment would not remove the weakness of this clause. If the Treasurer desires to supplement the existing State schemes so as to extend the facilities now available, that can be done by deleting the words "" extend the existing facilities the provided "" and inserting in lieu thereof the words ""provide facilities."" Subclause (a) would then readThat since the passing of this act the powers of that autliority in relation to housing' have been increased so as to provide facilities under the housing schemes of that authority That would make the Commonwealth scheme supplementary to, instead of limiting, the existing State ""schemes.",38
168,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Swan) [3.29] - I object to the amendment being withdrawn unless another amendment is moved which will make it clear that the various State authorities will not be compelled to alter their existing machinery to come within the scope of this legislation. Under this clause as printed no State will be able to borrow money for housing unless it amends its legislation to complywith the requirements of this measure. For fifteen or twenty years the States have been developing schemes for the purpose of providing houses for the people. ""Western Australia has taken action along these lines since 1910, and the eastern States instituted their housing legislation prior to that date. Honourable members should be quite clear as to the meaning of the bill . The impression I Jiave gained is that no State will be able to receive an advance under it until it has amended its housing legislation. It has been pointed out that the States have adopted advances of varying percentages of the valuations made; but those who have studied building operations in Australia during the past ten .years would hesitate to advance up to 90 per cent, as proposed under the bill, if they were lending their own money. A contractor recently informed me that workmen in Canada lay from 1,000 to 1,200 bricks a clay. Some years ago I saw houses in the model suburb of Daceyville, New South ""Wales, that had been erected for £450, and were equal in value to those now costing from £1,100 to £1,200. If we insist upon advances up to 90 per cent, of the valuation, the Commonwealth will have to accept the responsibility for writing off losses in many cases.",38
169,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,The bill requires the advances to be up to 90 per cent.,39
170,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,I hope that the amendment will not be withdrawn unless a more useful one is to be substituted.,39
171,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Cowper-Trea surer) [3.35] - The Government considers that the amendment should be in serted to express clearly the vieAvs of the committee. The point raised by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) is not a material one. I commend the amendment to the committee.,39
172,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Y a r r a ) [ 3 . 3 6 ] entirely opposed to the amendment. The Treasurer said that the State authorities would not keep the money advanced by ihe CommonAvealth separate from their OAvn funds; but under the amendment they Would be compelled to do so. The point I wish to make is that no federal money would beavailable for the most deserving cases that the State authorities are meeting io-day. Commonwealth funds would be provided only for the benefit of those persons with substantial salaries and requiring large homes.,39
173,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"(FaAvkner) [ 3 . 3 8 ] - I submit that the clause as it stands attains the object that the committee has in vieAv. which is to make the Commonwealth scheme supplemental to those of the States. The crux of the matter seems to be the question whether a 90 per cent, l i m it should be imposed. The borrowing authority being entirely responsible for the repayment of the loan, it should be left to decide for itself the percentage to be advanced. All that the authority is required to do is to pass legislation in accordance Will this bill. Having f u l filled that condition, it will receive the money, ancl I contend that it should then be at liberty to do what it pleases Will the funds placed at its disposal.

174,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"HUGHES.. (BoothbySouth Australia) [ 3 . 4 5 ] - I propose to speak on this clause at a reasonable length as I refrained from speaking on the second reading of the bill. This is a bill of great importance, as it involves the spending of a considerable sum of money. There is some obscurity in the drafting of this clause, particularly of paragraph a 2. I think honourable members who have read it will agree with me that it is a very difficult clause to interpret. read it a number of times, and given it more than one interpretation. provides that the maximum amount to be lent by the authorities to any one person' should be £1,800, and should be 90 per cent, of the valuation made. I take it that the intention is that the maximum amount is to be 90 per cent., but I am not clear myself that that is the effect of the clause as it is drafted. I suggest to the Treasurer that he omit the words ""shall be "" in the part relating to the advance up to 90 per cent., and substitute be not more than."" The clause would then be more understandable to the general public. There are two types of persons, two different types of owner, contemplated by this bill. There is first of all the small man, and the proposal to supply him with a house is based on humanitarian principles, and upon the desirability of every man having a house of his own to live in. But this bill goes further than that. It also contemplates the giving of assistance to the bigger man. ""When the Prime ister brought this matter forward in his policy speech I did not understand there was any intention to provide housing for the well-to-do man, or to provide houses of the larger and more costly type. I do not think the provisions for supplying homes under this bill should be extended to what one might call man sions, and I am of opinion that if a man requires a £2,000 house the proper way for him to get it is through the ordinary business channels. I think that under this scheme it would be better for two men to have houses costing £1,000 than for one man to have a £2,000 house. Instead of increasing the size of the houses which are to be provided, I would prefer to see a larger number of houses built and a reduction made in the cost of construction. This leads me to say a word or two upon the attempt made in England a few years ago, under the supervision of the Minister for Health (Mr. Chamberlain) to put up a great number Mr Duncan-Hughes. of houses very quickly. It was found impossible to obtain sufficient labour to buildthe houses of brick, and experiments were made with steel houses. A scheme was evolved for the erection of different types of houses, and specimen I have homes were shown in different parts of England. I saw one of these demonIt stration houses myself in London, and it was stated in the House of Commons, that they could be constructed in large numbers at a very much less cost than brick houses could be. I quite admit that it was the intention of that scheme to get a large number of houses built very quickly, and that it was the dearth of labour for brick houses that led the Government to adopt this particular idea. But it might be advisable to investigate ""may the possibility of constructing houses of several types in Australia. If we adopt a housing scheme it is surely, in part at any rate, because there are people hero urgently in need of houses. I ask the committee to consider whether it might not be possible for other types of houses to be constructed in Australia at a smaller cost, and in greater numbers, than at present.",39
175,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Is that not a matter for the State housing authorities to consider ? Min,40
176,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"HUGHES - It is, at that any rate, for us to suggest it . This is a Commonwealth housing scheme .and it is just as appropriate for us to suggest methods and types of buildings to the State authorities as to lay down the amount or percentage to be advanced on land, and the cost of the dwelling to be erected. Speaking in the House of Commons on the 16th December, 1924, Mr . Neville Chamberlain said thisLast week I paid a special visit to Glasgow in order to see for myself what was being don? in this direction by Lord Weir and by others who are designing and building houses of different types, and I came back feeling very hopeful of the future, after what I had seen. The idea of steel houses comes strange to many people, and especially perhaps to those who. have never seen one. and who imagine it as a sort of petrol tin, hideous to look at, and uncomfortable to live in, but I do not think, if they saw the houses I saw in Glasgow, they would maintain that view at all. Indeed, as far as the house constructed by Lord Weir is conNeville cerned, it is a misnomer to call it a steel house. It is really a house constructed with a timber frame, lined with steel plates, upon the outside, and upon the inside with a material which I think is composed of compressed wood pulp and asbestos, but which looks rather like' smooth brown cardboard. Subsequently Mr Chamberlain said that - the cost of the houses would to some extent depend upon the quantity ordered. A year later he made another speech in the House in which he gave the result of the efforts made to achieve success in providing houses on a big scale. He said I agree in the main with the honourable gentleman who said that the idea of demonstration bouses had been a failure. I saw one of the houses: the type is very attractive, but I dare say it would need slight alterations, to make it suitable to the heat of the Australian climate. Mr . Chamberlain went on to sayBut why has it been a failure? It has a failure because the building industry has deliberately set itself against the adoption even of demonstration houses, and they have gone so far as to threaten any local authority which put up even a pair of houses-so that people might see what it was which was being offered - that the whole labour would be token off in houses of any other type. . . . I think if it had not been for the opposition of the trade unions and the building industry, and the employers as well, these demonstration houses would have been erected in a great number of places; and I think that once people had seen the kind of thing they were they would have insisted upon having them. It is arguable that it would be better to have more houses of cheaper construction than fewer houses of a better type. At any rate, that point should be given every consideration. When speaking on the great housing achievement of Great Britain , the Treasurer mentioned that to the en!d of December, 1926, 411,791 houses had been built under various British schemes. According to the House of Commons Hansard of 10th May last, the houses completed in Great Britain with government assistance, from 1919 to March, 1927, numbered 545,2S7. The clause opens up also the subject of second mortgages. As I understand it , one of the purposes of the bill is to provide for advances to a considerable percentage of the value of the property to exclude the possibility of a second mortgage being required. In his second-reading speech the Treasurer said that where the rate of interest on a first mortgage was 6£ or 7 per cent., rates of from 9 to 12 per cent, on second mortgages were excessive. I do not agree with him. The second mortgagee has very poor security for his money, and it is not unreasonable that he should have a proportionately high rate of interest. Bates of from 9 to 12 per cent, are, therefore, not too high on second mortgages. In any case, the possibility of the presence of the second mortgagee cannot be avoided in any housing scheme unless the amount of the advance is 100 pei cent, of the value of the pro1 perty. It is useless, therefore, to advance the argument that 90 per cent, of the valuation should be lent to the home builder in order to save him from raising a second mortgage, and the question is narrowed down to the simple issue whether 90 per cent, should be advanced on a particular house. At the present been time, as lionorable members know, there is a considerable shortage of money for investment, and values of city propertiesare high. I think the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) will agree with me that there is every prospect in the not very distant future of a slump in city values. Of course, under this bill, the risk - will f all upon the State authorities; but, nevertheless, it is undesirable for this Parliament to declare that 90 per cent, is a proper proportion of the value of a property to lend to a home builder, or to indicate to the State authorities that they may advance to that amount. The ordinary trustee can advance up to 66 per cent.",40
177,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"The l i m it is 60 per cent, in Victoria.",41
178,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"HUGHE S - I know that it is more arguable that 90 per cent, should be loaned on a house worth £1,000 than that that advance should be made on one worth £2,000, but even in the former case it means that another £100 has to be found by the borrower from his own available cash or through a second mortgage. In these days of high wages, the unmarried man on the basic wage, which is based on what is necessary to keep a married man, his wife and three children, may quite reasonably be expected to save something towards getting a house for himself when he marries. That is the time when a man would usually require assistance under a housing scheme. To my mind, it would be wise to limit, not only the percentage which may be loaned, but also the maximum which may be advanced. In this respect. I think we ought to be guided by what is done in other parts of the world. Notwithstanding his quotations of what has been accomplished in Great Britain and on the continent as well as in the various States of Australia, the Treasurer has not suggested that in any part of the world a maximum advance of £1,800 is provided for in any housing scheme. That fact should make us pause. Is Australia so prosperous that we can afford to make advances up to 90 per cent, on a maximum value which is 50 per cent, higher than the maximum in Great Britain ? I think the maximum ih Great Britain is £1,200. In order to test the' matter. I move That the word ""eight,"" paragraph (a), subparagraph (ii) be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" five."" The limit of £1,500 I propose is nearly double the maximum amount provided for in the legislation of any Australian State. Subsequently, I shall move to limit the percentage from 90 per cent, to SO per cent.",41
179,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Bass) [4.9] - There is no State Savings Bank in Tasmania, but there are two institutions which are really public institutions, one operating in Hobart and the other in Launceston. I am afraid that we may have in connection with the allocation of money under this bill a repetition of what occurred some time ago when the State of Tasmania made money available in connection with the agricultural bank. On the first morning after it was known that an amount of £50,000 was available for advances, the whole of the money was applied for and absorbed in Hobart, the other portions of the State getting none of it. I suggest that the Treasurer should make provision for this money to be allocated on, say, an electorate basis. I am in favour of the amount of the advance being reduced to £1,500, but I do not see eye to eye with the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) as to the proportion of the advance being reduced from 90 per cent, to SO per cent.

180,Mr GULLETT,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Henty) [4.19] - I move That after paragraph (a ) , sub-paragraph (i i i ) , the following sub-paragraph be in serted :"" (i v ) by providing for the purchase or construction by the authority o i buildings to be let by the authority as tenements or flats; and "" As the scheme stands it meets only the needs of those .who have not purchased and are unable to purchase a house. It deals only with the outer and newer suburbs-, I desire the scheme to be made applicable to the older and more crowded areas. At present, in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, thousands - of families are living under the worse housing conditions in Australia. They are overcrowded, their conditions are in-' sanitary, aud their children are growing up under altogether unfavorable auspices. A Commonwealth housing scheme should cover these areas. I regard this as only a partial scheme. It provides for the erection of freehold detached cottages, but altogether overlooks the claims of those who reside in the congested inner suburbs of big cities, where land can be purchased only at very high prices. It would be impossible on account of these high prices to buy allotments in these areas for building either detached or semidetached cottages. I can see no reason why we should not follow the example of many great cities in other parts of the world and resume considerable inner suburban areas for the purpose of erecting on them substantial tenement houses or flats, and of providing parks and gardens and playgrounds for the children. If such a scheme were applied to these areas, the conditions of life in thom would be entirely changed. I think the Commonwealth Government could very well take up this proposal.",42
181,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.23J - I trust that the honourable member will not press his amendment, for, irrespective of the merits of his proposal, everybody will agree that substantial calls will be made on all the money that will be provided for the purposes already outlined in the bill. We should not add to the calls that may be made upon it.",43

183,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Adelaide) [4.24] - I support the amendment. Some time ago, at a conference of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labour party, I was successful in having a pious, and perhaps somewhat similar, motion carried to the effect that the States should undertake the building of homes along the lines mentioned by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). I do not believe in the private ownership of property. If we could initiate a system.of State ownership of homes for the people, it would be wise for us to do so. There is nothing unusual or even original in this proposal. In various parts of the City of Adelaide cot- to. tage homes have been erected for invalid and indigent people. Bight in the centre of the city itself we have what are known as the Elder cottages,,which were erected 20 or 30 years ago through the generosity of Sir Thomas Elder, whose name [28] is renowned even today for his public spirit and beneficence. These cottages occupy a large block of land having frontages on Angas and Wakefield streets, and even today they are eagerly sought after by people in need of homes. Though they have been in occupation for more than twenty years, they are in an excellent state of repair, having been built under the best of conditions. They are convenient and comfortable, and are in no sense whatever slum cottages. The trust which controls them charges a rental which is sufficient to cover maintenance and depreciation, and the scheme has been an outstanding success. We should be well advised to follow the example which Sir Thomas Elder set so many years ago. Amendment negatived.",43
184,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.26] - I move That after paragraph (o), sub-paragraph (i), the following Bub-paragraph be inserted:"" (IA) A loan is not made for the purpose of discharging a mortgage unless the conditions of the mortgage, or the conditions of any further loans on the property, are, in the opinion of the authority, unduly disadvantageous to the mortgagor."" This amendment has been suggested by the savings bank authorities for the purpose of ensuring that the funds that may be made available under this hill shall be dealt with in such a way that the utmost benefit will follow the expenditure. It is felt that it would not be desirable to make large inroads into the funds simply for the purpose of discharging mortgages at, say, 7 per cent., and so saving only about i per cent, to the individuals concerned, when by so doing other persons would be prevented from obtaining advances to buy or build homes. Theobject of the amendment is to ensure that the greatest good shall be done for the greatest number, rather than that an almost insignificant measure of relief shall be granted to a few individuals. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 10 verbally amended and agreed Clause 11The Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this act, prescribing all matters which are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed, for carrying out or giving effect to this act, and in particular for prescribing additional conditions in relation to the advances for the purchase and erection of dwelling honses and for the discharge of mortgages on dwelling houses.",43
185,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Swan) move That all the words after the word ""act,"" second occurring, be omitted.
