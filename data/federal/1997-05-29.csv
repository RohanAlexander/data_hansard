2,Mrs MOYLAN,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to allow Australia to adhere to the International Monetary Fund's new arrangements to borrow and to simplify the framework for conducting and recording Australia's other financial transactions with the IMP. The new arrangements to borrow, NAB, were developed following the financial crisis in Mexico in late 1994. The Mexican crisis prompted concerns about the adequacy of the IMF's resources in the event of possible future crises affecting the international monetary system, in view of the growing size and integration of international financial markets. The NAB will double the IMP's capacity to borrow to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system. Honourable members will be aware that Australia played a key role in the development of the NAB-a role with which we can be justly proud. The establishment of the NAB as the IMP's principal borrowing facility will be a milestone for the institution and the international monetary system. Importantly, it will enhance the IMP's ability to safeguard the international monetary system. The NAB is open to all IMF members that have the capacity, and are willing, to support the international monetary system and participants will have equal rights and responsibilities. These two features will do much to ensure that the NAB will be a central element in the management of the international financial system into the next century. The wider participation of member countries in the NAB appropriately reflects the changing structure of the world economy. 1997 Under the NAB, the IMF will be able to borrow up to SDR34 billion, or about $A61 billion, from the NAB participants. Australia's share of these credit arrangements is SDR810 million, or about $A 1.5 billion. In the event of a call, Australia would lend directly to the IMF and would receive a claim against the fund. The bill provides that any loan to the IMF will be paid out of the consolidated revenue fund. Under the NAB, there is scope for Australia to opt out of calls if the government determines that we will not be able to meet them because of our present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position. We may also, on the basis of a balance of payments need, require early repayment of part or all of any loan we have made to the IMP. Mr Speaker, Australia undertakes a number of regular financial transactions with the IMP. These include the receipt of interest on special drawing right holdings, interest payments on the use of special drawing rights, quota payments and remuneration received for the use of Australian dollars by the IMP. The bill introduces a simplified framework for the conduct and recording of these transactions. Under the existing arrangements, some of Australia's financial transactions with the IMF are conducted by the transfer of special drawing rights between the Commonwealth and the Reserve Bank and corresponding changes in the bank's retransfer liability to the Commonwealth. Under the new framework, the Commonwealth would purchase and sell all the SDRs required to undertake these transactions with the fund. This will provide for a more transparent and cost efficient framework for such transactions. It is desirable that these changes be introduced at the same time as Australia takes up its membership of the new arrangements to borrow to ensure that all of these transactions are conducted in a consistent framework. The amendments proposed in the bill will have no impact on the Commonwealth budget. The changes proposed to the conduct of Australia's financial transactions with the fund affect transactions which are, by accepted international standards, classified as financing transactions. Any loan by the Commonwealth to the IMF under the NAB would also be classified as a financing transaction because loans to the IMF represent monetary assets. The participants in the NAB have agreed that they will meet once a year, in addition to any meetings needed for activation, renewal or amendment of the NAB. The objective of these meetings is to review and discuss macroeconomic and financial market developments, especially those that could have an impact on the stability of the international financial system and lead to a possible need for the fund to seek supplementary resources. This is potentially an important new forum for consideration of these issues. The chairmanship of the NAB will rotate between participants and Australia is expected to provide the first chairman. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA (INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWINGS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",13
3,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"This legislation comes in under the guise of an infrastructure borrowings bill but it is a bill that freezes any further development on infrastructure. This is a government that has undertaken a massive attack on Australia's infrastructure development. It is an attack on industry development, it is an attack on regional development and it is an attack on jobs. It represents one of the great betrayals of the government, having been so comprehensively elected to this parliament to govern by a huge majority through regional Australia with a promise that they would do better for regional Australia, with a promise in particular that they would do something to encourage infrastructure development. There have been many betrayals of regional Australia but the attack on infrastructure development stands amongst the highest of them because there must be a commitment to sensible infrastructure, a commitment to opening up the land, whether it be in terms of road or rail-transport distribution, if you like-or whether it be in terms of the provision of energy-gas, electricity or whatever: the sorts of things the cities take for granted that do not exist in the regions. Because they do not exist, you cannot get economic diversity. That is why you need infrastructure. That is why you need a government that is committed to encouraging that infrastructure; not supplying it totally, not funding the lot, but giving encouragement and incentive, a partnership with the private sector, to get those important infrastructure developments going. When Labor was in office we had a number of initiatives in place to support infrastructure development. One of them was the infrastructure fund; another was the tax concessions for investment by the private sector in infrastructure development-a schemeÂ· called the infrastructure bonds; and another was the tax concessionality to superannuation funds and the encouragement to establish pooled development funds so that people from regions could invest in superannuation funds and have those funds, in tum, re-invested in their region. These were a number of the initiatives that Labor had-not the total suite of things, but important initiatives nevertheless. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is the person who, as one of his first acts, abolished his department. That his why we refer to him only as the minister for transport these days, because he has abolished his own department. He not only abolished his own department but also abolished the infrastructure fund. Having made a commitment at the last election to keep it, he abolished it-wiped it out completely. And do you know what his explanation was at the time he abolished it? These were his words: 'There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development.' This comes from the minister with responsibility for regional development. But worse, he is a member of the National Party. In fact, some talk of him as a future leader. He is amongst those plotting at the moment against their leader, Tim Fischer. I think that with his performance this week he has not advanced his case all that well. We must ask ourselves this question: if the National Party does not stand for regional development, what does it stand for? Here we have an aspirant for leadership of the National Party, given responsibility for regional development, abolishing his department and abolishing the fund, and saying that there is no clear rationale and no role for the Commonwealth in regional economic development. Well, I tell you what: it is a statement that has had huge resonance in the regions because they see this government as not being committed to regional development. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill is another example of that lack of commitment. The Labor Party believes there is a role for government in regional development-not just one level of government, but all levels of government. There has to be a commitment by governments to support regional development. There has to be a partnership between those levels of government-between federal government, state government and local government. There has to be a drawing in of private sector investment. There has to be a pooling of the approach to get our regions opened up and give them the opportunity to develop to the best of their potential and, importantly, to keep their communities cohesive, to give them access by road and rail, to give them access to energy at the same cost as is being provided to the cities, and to give them access to communications type infrastructure. But this government, in this bill, has frozen infrastructure bonds. I referred earlier to what Labor introduced by way of the infrastructure bonds-an important mechanism for attracting private sector investment in regional infrastructure. This was a tax mechanism to encourage investment. Essentially, the principle is pretty simple. If you are investing in infrastructure, there is a long lead time before you get a return. Therefore, there is not the ability to claim the tax deductions associated with the initial capital investment from a cash flow, because it does not exist until later down the track. There is a huge up-front cost. The purpose of the bonds was essentially to be able to give the tax deduction up front to the investor so that it could lower the cost of capital associated with the infrastructure development-a very important initiative. It is not reducing the tax burden; it is just shifting the point at which it is paid. But what has this government done? It has frozen that scheme. We have had 75 projects in the pipeline waiting for approval over the past 14 months. The government took 12 months to make a decision about those 75 projects and after 12 months the best it could do was freeze them. Great leadership; terrific leadership! It is a great signal to the regions: get on with the task, develop your initiatives, operate as if the law exists for you. Then, having made all the hard yards, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) comes out with a press release-he does not even come into the parliament to debate it-and freezes the fund. So here are these projects which have been waiting for 12 months up to February of this year for the go ahead. The Treasurer goes out and makes an announcement, 'I have got a good announcement for you: we are going to freeze them. You cannot do anything.' But more is to come: 'We will come out with a decision in the budget that announces an alternative scheme.' So, (a) they have frozen them, and (b) they have to wait another three months before they see what type of scheme may result. A new scheme has been announced in the budget-it is not the subject of this debate here now but it connects with it and so I will refer to it briefly-whereby the amount of money available under the infrastructure bond approach has been reduced. Under Labor's proposal it was worth about $200 million. This government have capped it at $75 million, which has reduced it by two-thirds. The second thing they have done is limit the types of projects that can qualify to just road and rail. No-one is arguing against the fact that road and rail are important for regional economic development-but so too is power generation, so too is communications infrastructure, so too is wharf development in those regions that have waterfront properties. These are the sorts of infrastructures that matter to regions. What type of lunacy seeks to include only road and rail? This is the mentality of a government that does not understand what is going on in the regions, does not understand that there is a huge preparedness to invest in a whole range of activities. If anyone has any doubt, look at the list of projects that have been put on hold. Look at the list of the 75 projects to date-and this is just the first cut. There is a whole raft of them: power generation, pipelines, electricity generation, wharf terminal upgrades and water storage activities. These are the sorts of infrastructures that matter to regions, not just road and rail. So why will we have a scheme that so limits it? But I return to this bill: essentially this does not advance anything. This bill does not even introduce that bit, which is deficient. This bill simply freezes all development. In the process of freezing all development, it has frozen some very significant projects which, in themselves, had been given certification. Not all of them on this list of 75 that I have referred to, at the stage of the freezing, had been given certification. That was the process that they had to go through. What they had to do was get certification, then there was a process by which some of them had to get a letter of approval, and then final certification. Some of them had gone through those stages, yet some of those projects are still frozen by this bill. Two initiatives got up, as I understand it. One was the Brisbane airport rail link. You have to ask how that actually qualified because the actual detail of that proposal is not even known. But there was, no doubt, pressure from somewhere in the system that gave that a particular tick. I would be interested to know from the minister, if he is prepared to come into the House and explain, why it got the tick and others have not. But there was also an operation down at Bairnsdale. I am not arguing against those getting in. I am simply arguing for fair treatment for the others that have got through the certification stage-in particular the Redbank power station. I know the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will be referring to that later in the debate. It is a very significant initiative for the Hunter. We all know how this government has decimated its future by failing to act in relation to the steel industry. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who four weeks ago said he was going to visit the place soon and offer an apology to the region, still has not gone. He is still in hiding from the region. Yesterday, when we sought to bring this on for debate in the House he gagged it. Some concern for the Hunter. What a fraud! This is a government that talks about the need for regional development, expresses unctuous concern for the people in regions, but will do nothing. It will not lift a finger to help them. It will not even pick up the phone to John bill Prescott of BHP and say, 'Can we sit down and talk about the future of the steel industry?' The reality is that BHP is going to invest in steel making around the world. Why isn't it going to invest here? It promised an arc furnace in Newcastle at some stage in the future-the latest technology. It has invested in an arc furnace, but it has invested in Ohio, USA, because that country has offered it tax breaks; it has offered it free land; it has been prepared to sit down and work out what is needed to attract that investment. This government will not. This government is hands-off: hands-off the brakes, hands-off the steering wheel, let it rip and see what happens. You can see what is happening in the Hunter and Newcastle. You can see the lives that are being decimated. You can see the futures that are being destroyed. You can see the hope ebbing out of the system. These are people that have made a commitment to their region and they expect a commitment in tum from the government, but they are not getting it. One of the initiatives, as I say, is the Redbank power station. This is a major initiative, one the private sector is prepared to fund but it can only get up if the infrastructure bonds apply, because that does reduce the up-front cost of the capital. This is a power station that will use coal tailings as its feed stock; in other words, it is using waste coal. It is environmentally more sound. It is also using technology for the generation of the electricity which is 15 per cent more efficient in terms of ozone emissions; in other words, there is less coming out and polluting the atmosphere. This is an investment that makes environmental sense, not just economic sense. But it has been frozen. It was given what was considered to be approval, the go ahead, yet this bill freezes it. Where is the commitment to the Hunter? Where is the commitment by this government to encouraging and assisting investments to go ahead? I tell you what: no wonder the regions are turning on you. You have no understanding of what the particular needs of those regions are. We are moving amendment to this bill-the first stage of assault on this government's attack on regions to try to claw back the initiativesprojects, that will see four of those projects get the ahead. These are the projects that, as I understand it, have gone through the certification stage: Redbank, which I have made some reference to; the Oakey power station; the Parkeston power station in Kalgoorlie, Western Australalways is; and the Port Stephens sewage processing facility. This bill freezes them; our amend the ment will unfreeze them. When the next of attack on regional infrastructure-the budget measure that restricts those projects that can qualify and limits the amount money they can claim--comes before this parliament, we will be seeking to amend again so that these other projects that were the list can qualify. The problem is that a lot of those projects that the financiers are prepared to back will now become non-viable because the infrasive structure bonds will not be applicable to them. Either they will not be able to access enough money from the pool or they will not be in the category of road and rail. We will be seeking, firstly, to lift the amount that is available and, secondly, to open up those sorts of initiatives and the types of things that can qualify. There is another thing that this bill does, that is, to terminate the infrastructure borrowing scheme which was introduced by Labor as part of our One nation statement. We introduced this because private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against private provision of infrastructure. It involved assisting private sector involvement by a modification of the tax system. Private sector investment was historically impeded because the initial year's losses generated by most of the projects could not be offset against the other income of the investors unless the project was undertaken by a single investor only as part of a wholly regions to enable owned company. The sheer size of most infrastructure projects meant that no Australian company was big enough to undertake the project on their an own. It is generally commercially advantaour geous to have partners as they provide the the expertise that is so often needed. These though, would not confront the tax go problem that I talked about before. The IBS, this scheme that we introduced, overcame the problem by reducing the cost of infrastructure finance by effectively transferring the tax benefit of the tax deductibility of interest from borrower to lender. The projects were assessed by a statutory authority. We made sure that they were arms-length from government and set up criteria by which wave the schemes had to be measured. That system was starting to function very effectively. There were some problems with of it, and Labor announced when we were in office that the IBS would cease to be availit able for urban roads from late 1995-a in decision, I might say, that was rejected by the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now the Treasurer. There was also some evidence that aggrestax planning was creeping into the marketing of IBS at the retail level. These were matters that did warrant addressing and we were doing that. Whilst we were prepared to address limiting those clever operators who could exploit the system, we were still keen on keeping the system going because it was responding to a market failure need. It was responding to what the financial institutions were telling us needed to be addressed. We were prepared to cap, we were prepared to limit the types of investors that could get into the system. But we would not have frozen the scheme. What this government has done is throw the baby out with the bathwater. Every time the Treasury gets worried about the cost to government it trots out the same excuse to this government as it did to us. They never liked these schemes and you will have the same problem in government trying to get your initiatives up as we did because essentially Treasury does not believe in them. That is the truth of it. The only way you are going to overcome that, quite frankly, is to have a government and a Treasurer prepared to stand up to them, to have a cabinet that understands the importance of them and tackles the Treasury on the practicality and not just the theory. We were saying, 'Yes, by all means close off the rorts, but don't end the scheme.' But that is exactly what Treasurer Costello did. He used the tired old excuse of Treasury since time immemorial-'If the revenue forgone starts to get too great in our estimates, let's call it a rort and abolish it.' Pretty simple, but pretty effective in terms of this Treasurer, because that is what he has done. It was the same approach he used to tax syndication: an announcement by way of press release-again, no announcement in the parliament-to end the syndicated taxation research, asserting that the scheme was being rorted. We challenged him time and time again in this parliament to produce the examples of rorts and he did not produce one. He actually put out a press release at the time of his announcement with some examples, as he called them, of the tax rorts, but as we questioned his department not one of those examples was actual. The Treasurer was using the Wright family-the fictitious family that was rorting the social security system. Peter Costello found that they were into tax syndication. Not one example was actual. When we had that debate in the parliament, and it went for a number of hours, he was sitting at the table that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is sitting at now, hanging his head in shame signing Christmas cards. We challenged him and gave him opportunity time and time again to get up at the dispatch box and give us the examples of where the rorts were. He could not produce one example, yet that is the basis on which you have frozen this scheme as well-same excuse, no evidence, and the impact is devastating for regional Australia. It is a shameful approach for a government. This is a government that has not got ideas, not got intelligence and not got the moral fortitude to actuaIIy work through initiatives and see if they mean something for regions. This is a government bereft of ideas. Its only notion of governing is getting the bottom line down, regardless of the consequences. That is not good enough for a nation like ours that has natural resources, that has good infrastructure in the main but needs to develop it, that has the technology and that has the skills. What it needs is the ability to bring it together, and one of the things that will bring it together is investment in infrastructure. That is why we are not only opposing this legislation and seeking to move the amendment but also will be seeking in this and the other house to oppose the subsequent scheme that, we understand, will come forward. I mentioned before the importance of assisting infrastructure development in a number of ways. I have spoken at some length about the infrastructure bonds, which were one of the arrows in the quiver that Labor had for encouraging regional development. Another was the infrastructure fund, which this current government promised to keep but abolished. I just want to give an example of how that infrastructure fund worked. A very good example is the Orana gas pipeline, which is an infrastructure development sought to be funded in the DubboParkes area, essentially to supply energy at Sydney-competitive prices to western New South Wales so that the region can attract manufacturing businesses such as food processing companies and the like. The cost of that investment was some $44 million, and the financial sector was prepared to fund it if it was $42 million. In other words, it was just short by $2 million. Essentially, the infrastructure fund under Labor funded that $2 million, and so the pipeline was able to go ahead-this, I might add, in circumstances in which the financial sector was operating on the basis of the infrastructure bonds being in place. So they went ahead, developed a proposal, and included the infrastructure bonds in the financing arrangement, and we approved the $2 million from the infrastructure fund. Interestingly enough, when the Howard government came to power, that $2 million also could have been at risk. The problem and the trouble for the government, which dearly would have loved to have got its grubby little hands on it and taken it back into Treasury, was that we had already signed off on it. That pipeline was able to go ahead only because of the money that Labor had committed-money that the Liberals wanted to take away from them and that the National Party could not have cared less about. That is the difference between us and you in terms of regional development, but the fact of the matter is that this pipeline, whilst the first stages of it have been built, cannot now be extended to the 255 kilometres of pipeline that run from Marsden through the cities of Forbes, Parkes and Dubbo. It is a project that has been on the drawing board for five years. It has got the support of the regional development board, the state government, local councils and regions. AGL, which has spent five years in community consultations on the project, got the Commonwealth to formally support it on 9 February 1996-that is when they realised that they could not take the $2 million off them-and the community thought that the wait was over. But one year and five days later, having given the approval back in February 1996, the government withdrew it. This is great government! This is the government that does not know what it is doing. This is the government that comes in here and says to people, 'We support regional development', but effectively mocks them because whenever it comes to actually supporting the proposals it is not there delivering. The Orana gas pipeline is not something that Canberra thought up and said, 'Let us have an initiative that might help out there and we will stick a pipeline in.' This is something that has come from the community. It is not something that governments simply say-'We will develop a proposal and we will fund it regardless of the consequences.' It has got to stack up. It has got to be supported by the private sector. But government has got a role to play-it is this leverage of government; it is the ability to use the programs to deal yourself in and to make yourselves relevant; that is what government is about. What is the purpose of getting elected to just rule off bottom lines? What is the purpose of getting elected if you are not going to do something to advance the interests of the nation? What is the purpose of believing that all you have to do is to manage the budget and the rest will follow? It does not work that way . You have to get your hands dirty, to get out amongst the regions, to understand their needs, to work with them, to understand the initiatives, to put them through the financial rigour, and to make sure the proposals stack up, but in the end to give them confidence that you are prepared to back them. Labor is prepared to back the regions. That is why we have already announced that we will re-establish that regional infrastructure fund, the one that made the Orana gas pipeline happen, the one that, for the sake of $2 million, generated $44 million of investment. That is smart government. That is the proper use of government resources. That is committing yourself to the region and not just promising wish lists. So what you have done? You have got a Federation Fund; you will go around the place and build a few museums in marginal seats because you are looking pretty shaky. You talk about our whiteboard-this will be a huge screen like the MCG's big scoreboard: 'Have we got a scheme for you!' - big star. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) may not be here, but he will get a project. But people just do not want museums. Th-y. - a-t infrastructure and it is these sorts of InItIatIves that will help them get it. Labor is committed to the re-establishment of the infrastructure fund. Labor will move this amendment in the House to make sure that four important projects that got certification can go ahead. Two ha-e been given the tick. Why can't the other four be given the tick? If this government has got any decency, it will allow those four to go ahead. (Time expired)",14
4,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have just listened very carefully to the contribution by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill. We heard regional development mentioned probably every minute of the last 30 minutes. Where did he end up? The MCG. The member for Hotham, after his long personal journey from school in - elbourne to university in Melbourne to President of the ACTU in Melbourne, has suddenly discovered the regions outside of Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. After the last election, the Australian Labor Party became a party for Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. Outside those cities they hold something like 11 of the 90odd seats. The member for Hotham, as shadow minister for regional development, has had to rediscover the regions. In fact, he, along with the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), has become something like the Leyland brothers of the 1990s. Every week he gets a letter from a new region, he discovers a new region-such as Adelaide, Bendigo or Newcastle-and has a look at that region. What he should have said is that in the last two months of the operation of the infrastructure borrowings scheme the Development Allowance Authority had assessed that benefit was going not actually to infrastructure but to financial packages and also to those who were on the highest marginal tax rate. Treasury estimated that, if all those projects went ahead, there would be something like a $4 billion cost to the budget. If the ALP opposes the closing off of the infrastructure borrowings scheme then they should be able to say where they are going to raise that $4 billion extra in tax or where they are going to cut $4 billion from government outlays. There were 12 projects with applications to the infrastructure borrowings scheme between 1994 and 1996. In July and August of last year there were 71 applications. - o there - as a huge explosion and not all of It was - omg to infrastructure. This government Will be closing off the infrastructure borrowings scheme, which dates back to Paul Keating's One Nation statement, and it will be replacing it with a $75 million capped fund and the $1 billion Federation Fund. The bill gives effect to the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 14 February this year that the infrastructure borrowings concession would be abolished from 12 p.m. on that day. The amendments contained in the bill prevent the lodging of any new infrastructure borrowing applications after that time, the issue of any further infrastructure borrowing certificates and the variation of conditions underlying existing certificates after that time that increase tax benefits. The amendments will not otherwise affect already issued certificates. In other words, the bill is aimed at preventing the abuse of the infrastructure .borro.wings taxation concession-a rort which, If not attended to, would have serious ramifications on government revenue of something like $4 billion. The Treasurer is on the public record as saying that the government is obviously very keen to encourage infrastructural investment but that the taxpayer is entitled to know that the tax support which is facilitating an infrastructural development scheme is not wasteful from the revenue point of view. The Treasurer stated in his press conference on 14 February this year: We're doing all of this because if the revenue foregone is in the billions or more, somebody - as got to make up and if it's made. - p by b-tthng taxpayers they just pay more an- It s - ot faIr t-at it be made up on the outlays Side WIth battlmg allowance receivers ... This is a question of the Government ... looking after the interests of the battling taxpayer and the person who's - onestly receiving entitlements which they're entitled to receive. To understand this bill one has to understand the history of infrastructure investment in this country-that is, how traditional methods of funding public infrastructure investments have come under pressure over the last decade. Put simply, in an attempt to reduce our current account deficit and our associated reliance on overseas savings by increasing public sector savings, Australian governments have realised that they have restricted public finance for building or maintaining infrastructure. Both Commonwealth and state governments have dealt with the restriction of funds by transferring the responsibility of infrastructure finance onto the private sector. In examining the decline in Australia's public capital spending in recent years, Ms Julie Smith, a consultant to the Department of the Parliamentary Library's Economics, Commerce and Industrial Relations Group, introduced her 1994 research paper by asking whether current levels of infrastructure investment were too low or whether the public sector was unjustifiably reducing its investment in public assets. Julie Smith's question was a good one. What has happened to public infrastructure funding in Australia and why is it an issue worthy of continued research? In using the term 'infrastructure', I refer to transport, communications and energy networks, but it is also worthwhile noting that the social capital of the country can also be defined more widely to include the likes of publicly owned education, health and prison facilities. It is a fact that since the mid-1980s there has been a sharp reduction in Australian public capital spending and that this sharp reduction follows a gradual decline in public capital spending over previous decades. For example, public capital formation is now around four per cent of GDP compared with more than eight per cent in the 1960s. Infrastructure spending in Australia has traditionally been financed by public borrowing and paid for by various combinations of state and federal taxation and charges on users of public services. While responsibility for infrastructure investment tends to lie with Australian state and local governments and their enterprises, such investment has largely been funded both directly and indirectly by the Commonwealth government. The problem for contemporary infrastructural development and renewal is that the transfer of Commonwealth revenues to state and local governments and public enterprises has nearly halved in the last eight years. Over that same period, aggregate public sector borrowing has been curtailed. That assault on public debt is linked to the sound fiscal policy pursued by this government, wherein it irecognised that it is important for our economic well-being that we increase national savings and reduce the external account imbalance. In reflecting on the current level of public infrastructure spending, Smith outlined in her paper three areas of concern. The first area of concern is whether investment in new infrastructure has been sufficient to keep up with needs during the rapid population and economic growth of the 1980s, with the possibility of an urgent backlog of new public infrastructure investment to be funded in the near future. The second area of concern is whether sufficient provision had been made for the repair, maintenance and, ultimately, replacement of existing assets, some of which are nearing the end of their economic life, with significant maintenance and replacement costs in the foreseeable future. In some cases shortage of capital funds has resulted in the deferral of maintenance, reducing the economic life of infrastructure assets. In other words, in the case of roads, for example, too much emphasis has been on maintenance and too little on expanding network capacity. The third area of concern is how future funding needs will be affected by economic and demographic change requiring different focus, forms or location of infrastructure, new production and pricing technologies, and the increased cost of higher standards to protect the natural environment against effects of economic growth and population expansion. Perceived political limits to taxation and rates, combined with the current fixation with limiting borrowing to reduce already relatively small public sector debt levels, point to continued shortages of government capital funds for infrastructure. Traditionally, infrastructure projects have been popular with Australian governments and with the Australian people. Apart from being large employers of labour, it is commonly recognised that infrastructure investment contributes to the productivity of private sector growth. In a recent article in the Australian entitled 'Employers in a welfare state' on Thursday, 15 May 1997, Simon Longstaff, the Executive Director of the St James Ethics Centre, made the following point: The idea that the community should provide significant financial assistance to business is nothing new. If one adds the value of direct subsidies to the cost of providing the infrastructure business needs, then the community already provides a huge amount of money to augment the funds of shareholders. Few would argue that the community's investment is a poor one. There is an implicit logic to the arrangement. In retum for massive investment by the community, business plays a vital role in increasing the stock of common good to be enjoyed by society-jobs, wealth and a host of other goods. The problem that Australian governments now have is a shortage of funds or, more particularly, a shortage of savings. Not surprisingly it is a problem that the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, also faced. Steeped in the recession that we had to have, Paul Keating's One Nation statement-launched in February 1992-was an attempt to revive the economy. Unfortunately, the One Nation statement was only a reflection of the same opportunism which characterised Paul Keating's rise to the prime ministership. That is to say, knowing that Bill Ludwig and the Queensland Right, the Victorian Right and certain influential members of the Western Australian Rightsuch as the current Leader of the Opposition-were loath to support him against Bob Hawke, Paul, desperate for the top job, sold out and began cutting deals with the Left. In the process of schmoozing the Left, Paul Keating was forced to make certain commitments that were integral components of the Left's agenda; hence the peculiar document One Nation. In One Nation, Paul discovered infrastructure. Just as one of his best mates, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), had enjoyed considerable notoriety with the Sydney monorail, Paul decided it was his turn. As outlined before, faced with a lack of funds, Paul turned to the concept of infrastructure borrowings. According to John Kavanagh, writing in Business Review Weekly of 2 July, 1993, Keating's development finance and infrastructure bond initiative was a fizzer. We have heard the member for Hotham talking about how great it was. At the time it was a fizzer. To quote directly from the article: The slow take off of many of the government's initiatives has been well documented, but One Nation has other problems that are just coming to light. The package included two tax-advantaged investment incentives: pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds. So far, not a single dollar has been invested through these vehicles. The major drawbacks for institutional investors were the cumbersome conditions and restrictions that operated on the funds. As a result, in 1994 the Keating government made certain amendments to the concept of infrastructure borrowings as part of that other doomed statement, Working Nation. Under the infrastructure borrowings tax concession, the person who borrows funds forgoes the right to use the interest paid on those borrowings as a tax deduction and in return the lender-that is, the person who receives the interest-gets that interest tax exempt. According to the Treasurer in the press conference on 14 February this year: The object of that arrangement was for borrowers for whom tax deductions are not necessarily useful because in stand alone projects, they may not have had revenue streams to use them up, would pass the value of those tax concessions to lenders who in return would give lower interest rates to the borrowers and enable infrastructure to go ahead. In the period between 1994, when the Development Allowance Authority assumed responsibility for this, up until 30 June 1996, it had issued certificates in respect of 12 projects with a total borrowing of $4 billion and it had six applications on hand. But in the months of July and August last year, when there was some speculation that the infrastructure borrowings scheme might end, it received 71 applications. So in the previous two years it had 12 certifications with six applications pending. In the two months leading up to 20 August, there were 71 applications for estimated infrastructure borrowings of around $21 billion to $22 billion. In responding to this fervour for infrastructure projects running all over Australia, the Treasurer closed the scheme to new applications on 10 September last year. At the same time, the Treasurer instructed the Development Allowance Authority to investigate all of the applications. According to estimates prepared by the DAA, if all of those applications were certified and the projects went ahead, the cost to revenue over the next three years would be $4 billion. The authority further advised that if any of the applications were amended to make them more tax aggressive, the cost could be substantially higher. To quote again from the Treasurer's press conference statement: What the investigation by the Development Allowance Authority also shows is that the benefits in the re-engineered schemes are principally being accessed by financial packages and high marginal taxpayers, or people who would be otherwise high marginal taxpayers, not the developers concerned. For example, a person could be offered $500,000 worth of infrastructure borrowings. They also take a loan to buy those infrastructure borrowings. They pay interest in advance on the loan. They pay a management fee, and that requires $585,000. The loan which they take is $549,000 and they pay $36,000. They resell the bond back to the lender who gives them the loan and that extinguishes the loan. The interest they pay on the loan to buy the infrastructure bond is deductible, as is the management fee. As a result of that transaction, for an investment of $36,000, they get $85,000 worth of tax deductions. So if the ALP opposes closing off this infrastructure borrowings scheme, then it is defending a rort. On the top marginal rate, the return is worth $41,582. In this particular example, you buy the bond on 28 June for $36,000. You get $85,000 worth of deductions in that financial year, which is worth a return of $41,000 after tax. You can re-buy the same bond in the next financial year and get the deductions again. On 27 February, the Deputy Chairman of major infrastructure financier Macquarie Bank was reported in the Australian Financial Review as saying: The Government was right in stopping infrastructure bonds a couple of weeks ago because there was a lot of double dipping going on by creative tax planners, and they had to put a stop to it. Addressing the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne on 26 February, Mr Cox was also reported as saying: Infrastructure as an asset class has strong appeal to institutions because of the stability and duration of its cash flow and the fact that the revenue is often inflation indexed . . . The Australian market is rapidly accepting this new asset class. Bearing that in mind, the government in its recent budget decided to introduce a new tax rebate-$75 million-to continue Commonwealth support of private sector provision of public infrastructure. The program will be open for applications for assistance in respect of, amongst other projects, private land transport infrastructure projects. That $75 million capped infrastructure fund, together with the $1 billion Federation Fund which will allow projects of national significance to be built over the next four years, I think means that the 1906 idea of a rail link from Adelaide to Darwin now has a real chance of going ahead. There are not many competing projects for infrastructure in South Australia and the Northern Territory. That, I think, should be the recommendation of the South Australian government and the Northern Territory government as being the infrastructure project they would like to go ahead with under the $1 billion Federation Fund. At first blush, the $75 million tax rebate looks like the old one in that it will permit resident infrastructure financiers to apply for a tax rebate on interest received from infrastructure providers in return for the infrastructure providers forgoing the tax deductibility on that interest. That will benefit infrastructure providers because financiers will be able to offer lower rates of interest or other benefits. The rate of the rebate will be set at the lower end of the financier's current year marginal tax rate or 36 per cent and will be available in respect of the grossed up amount of interest on borrowings that is returned as income by the financier. However, the most important aspect of this new rebate is that it is not tradeable. If the loan interest is assigned to another entity, neither the assignee nor the assignor will be eligible for the rebate from the time of the assignment. The cost to the budget of the rebate will be capped at $75 million per annum, including running costs. Once this cap has been reached, further rebates will not be approved. There will be no avenue of appeal against government decisions on a project's eligibility. Other measures designed to prevent the rorts that operated under the former government's infrastructure borrowings rebate is that at stage 1 projects will be examined to determine whether they fall into an eligible category for assistance, involve genuine private provision of new public infrastructure and have been subject to benefit-cost analysis. At stage 2 the basis for assessment will be commercial viability, supporting commercial references, the impact of tax benefits on the project and the estimated present value of the cost to the revenue of the tax rebate being granted to the project relative to the present value of the total project expenditure. Quite obviously, another reference point for assessment will be the consistency of the proposed investment with any relevant Commonwealth or state policy or planning objectives. The program will have effect from 1997-98 with approval for rebates first being granted in respect of applications received by 31 December 1997. It is my understanding that the Commissioner for Taxation will shortly be calling for applications. I commend this bill to the House.",20
5,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill. I propose to speak to the general framework of the bill and to make some comment on the decisions announced by the government in the budget which are directly linked to this particular proposal. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the shadow minister for industry and regional development, circulated some amendments at the conclusion of his contribution which will be dealt with in the consideration in detail stage. I hope to join that debate and make some observations on that occasion. In general tenns, the House should be fully aware of the very adverse consequences for Australia's economic development generally, and in its regions, of this bill and the parallel decision that relates to it which has been made in the budget. There are two significant aspects that need to be appreciated. The first is that-in one sense overtly, but in another sense by sleight of hand-the government is very seriously denuding the amount of funds available as incentives to private industry for infrastructure investment. The program that was in place under the former government was in the order of $200 million. The government asserts, in the course of its budget propaganda, for want of a better description, that the replacement program is in the order of $75 million. It is $75 million by the end of the fourth outlay year. In the first two years, it is $37.5 million. So what you see in terms of a commitment by the government to give private industry incentives to engage in the improvement of infrastructure by private capital investment, is that the incentive goes from about $200 million to $37.5 million. The second key point linked to this legislation is that when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced in September of 1996 and subsequently in February of this year the proposed changes to the particular infrastructure bonds program, he indicated that in this year's budget a replacement program would be designated. In addition to the serious denuding of the funds available, there is a very clear public policy error that has been made by the government in restricting the program in the future to road and rail infrastructure only. Wearing my shadow minister for resources and energy cap, what this does is effectively knock out any energy or power projects. It knocks out any gas pipeline infrastructure. It knocks out any power co-generation plant proposal or project. Why is that important? Why is that an important point to make? Why is doing that of adverse consequences to Australia's economic development? Why does it have such adverse consequences to the prospects for investment, prosperity and employment in the future? One of the things that on this side of the House we have continually been in favour of, is doing what we can as a government, as a nation, as a community, to maximise the capacity of Australia to engage in downstream processing. As might be expected, being the member for Perth, I grew up in Western Australia. Of all of the states Western Australia is the most rich in minerals and resources. For many years in the ALP in Western Australia we have been saying, 'Why can't we go from digging it up and shipping it offshore to adding value and engaging in downstream processing?' Over the years a number of reasons have been given to me. One in the 1970s and 1980s was: because the dollar was regulated it was impossible to make the long-term commitments. The dollar is now no longer regulated. In the eighties people used to say to me the reason that downstream processing is so difficult, so hard, is the cost of energy. If you bring the cost of energy down, if you bring the price of energy down, then we have a chance. When you ask people in a minerals commodity industry who do engage in downstream processing, 'How can you downstream process,' they say a range of things, but you can crystallise them in the following ways. Firstly, they say, 'There is no magic wand.' I agree with that; there is no magic wand. Secondly, they say that a lot depends on the market and the margins, and that is understandable. Then they will talk about infrastructure. You cannot get a quality resource project going unless you have a number of things. Firstly, you need the quality resource. Then you need access to it. Then you need the infrastructure to develop it. So infrastructure is important. Then they will say to you, 'If you want to go from a quality resource, having access to it, digging it up, to add value to it, the next important thing is the cost of energy.' What have we been trying to do over the years? We have been trying to bring down the cost of energy. In my own state, in Western Australia, we have seen the development of the Dampier to Bunbury gas pipeline linked to the North West Shelf joint venture partners liquefied natural gas plant. What we have seen in recent days in Western Australia is a decision by the state government to sell the gas pipeline and in the year commencing 2001 open up the opportunity or the possibility of a second gas pipeline from the north-west of Western Australia to the south. I think the state government has probably got it about 75 to 85 per cent right. If I had a quibble with the decision announced recently by the state resources development minister, Colin Barnett, it would be that he should have allowed invitations or expressions of interests for the construction of a second pipeline immediately, not hold it back until the year commencing 2001. That is in a sense an aside. The key point is that that decision has been made in the main with bipartisan support because that will lead to the reduction of the cost of energy. Competition and open access to that energy supply will bring the costs down. Why is that important? Why is it important to have cheaper gas coming from the north west of Western Australia to the south west? It is not just the north west of Western Australia that is resource rich; the south west of Western Australia is also resource rich. The cost of gas is important to the alumina and bauxite industry, which we also find in the south-west of Western Australia, and it is important to the mineral sands industry, which we also find in the south-west of Western Australia. The alumina and bauxite industry of Western Australia effectively takes up-and I am happy to be corrected on the precise figureabout 10 per cent of the world market. It is a world class quality industry. The mineral sands industry of Western Australia is regarded by very many of its competitors as the world leader. If we want to go further, if we want to make sure that we keep that world market share, if we want to try to do better, then one thing that is important to both of those industries is the cost of energy and the cost of infrastructure. The same occurs in Queensland. I am not as familiar with the Queensland situation as I am with Western Australia-but it will not be too long before I am, let me assure my Queensland colleagues. After Western Australia, Queensland is the state which is the next most resource rich. What do we find in Queensland? If you take the area around Mount Isa you find an area which is rich in world class base metal commodities-zinc, lead, copper and some gold. Mount Isa has been a world class facility for a number of years. We now find in Queensland a number of gas pipeline proposals. We have a proposal by AGL to build a gas pipeline from the Ballera gas station in the south-west corner of Queensland feeding off the Santos field in South Australia from the Cooper Basin to build a pipeline to Mount Isa. That will bring cheaper energy to Mount Isa. That will enable continuing development of Mount Isa. It will also, by coincidence, enable Western Mining Corporation to establish a fertiliser plant feedstock from the gas energy you have a perfect example of the capacity of Of a cheaper energy source-a cheaper energy project supply-and infrastructure to keep quality no mineral resource projects going and also add some value through some downstream proTax cessing. Possibly the most promising in terms of its long-lasting ability to add to the potential of Queensland as a rich mineral resource state and to do downstream processing is the proposed Chevron gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Townsville and Gladstone. Why is that important? Well, if you get a cheap energy source going down to Gladstone, then Comalco has a chance of getting up its alumina refinery. You also have the Korea Zinc project in Townsville. There is an element of chicken and egg about all of this. Queensland has a chance of getting up those projects, but they are dependent on the cheap energy source. There is a prospect of getting the pipeline up, but that is linked to the demand which is linked to those projects. Why are these points important in the context of this bill? This bill sends a message from the government to private industry in this country, to the private investment community, to the minerals and resource industries, to downstream processors of those commodities and to manufacturing industry. It sends the message: 'This is a government which does not believe there is a role for government in providing incentives for private enterprise to build infrastructure, linked to making energy costs cheaper, linked to downstream processing, linked to jobs, linked to exports.' That is the key here. What do we find? We find a slashing of the incentives to private enterprise from $200 million to effectively $37.5 million and we find the exclusion of the energy projects I have referred to. The chief executive of the Australian Gas Association, Mr Ian Woodward, wrote to me earlier this month, and he made some similar points. The letter states: ... the new Tax Rebate is capped at $75 million; with only $37.5 million available in 1997/98 it is likely that only a very limited number of proposals would actually gain access to the Tax Rebate (especially as $22 billion of infrastructure have using current applications with the DAA). source. There He goes on to say: even greater concern is the decision to limit new applications to road and rail only. There is justification to exclude other types of projects such as gas pipelines from the new Infrastructure Rebate Program. The rationale for this approach is not provided nor understandable given Australia's substantial need for private sector investment in a wide array of infrastructure including energy projects. Mr Woodward goes on to say: Your attention is drawn to a number of facts relating to the natural gas sector: The levels of projected gas demand, especially in states such as Queensland and New South Wales, require extensive new pipeline infrastructure to be built to provide supplies for the early part of next century. Australia's gas infrastructure is relatively immature by world comparison. New infrastructure projects are required to facilitate interstate gas trade through an integrated grid, as well as to support the competitive and deregulated energy market envisaged under the Government's competition policy reforms. Infrastructure is the key to this particular industry. Earlier this week, members may have noticed that the Australian Gas Association released its annual gas supply and demand study, which forecast a trebling of natural gas consumption in the period to 2030. It asserted-I think there is a lot of strength in it-that natural gas will be Australia's fastest growing energy source to 2030. The report also referred to the 'critical and imminent need for investment decisions on long-term gas infrastructure projects, like pipelines'. At precisely that point in the cycle, where you want a commitment to infrastructure, where you want a commitment to lower energy costs, when there is a huge and growing demand and potential for gas as a feedstock for downstream processing, when the relevant association is saying, 'We now need some long-term commitments made for investment in this infrastructure', the government knocks it out. Of the $2.2 billion worth of potential projects which had approached the authority before or in the course of the Treasurer making his decisions, the government says, 'We'll slip you $37.5 million, but only if you are road and rail. Forget about energy. Forget about co-generation power stations. Forget about downstream processing. Forget at--)ut infrastructure which will help develop rural and regional Australia. Forget about infrastructure which will assist in the creation of jobs and the development of Australia as a world-class minerals and resources nation with a greater capacity for downstream processing.' That is the approach that this particular bill takes. I have referred to a couple of particular pipelines-the situation in Western Australia and Queensland. The central west pipeline proposal in New South Wales will also, I think, be adversely affected by this particular arrangement. It may well still go ahead, but it will probably go ahead on the basis of a six-inch gas pipeline rather than an eight-inch gas pipeline. Why is that important? That is important because if you have an eight-inch gas pipeline through the central west you have some chance of getting gas to the New England area. So that pipeline will probably go ahead, but it will not go ahead with the quality that it could have had. That central west pipeline is a project which AGL is involved in. It will certainly mean that the New England region, particularly Tamworth, will not be fed with gas as it ought to be. There are a couple of co-generation power station proposals which I think are worthy of mentioning in passing. The Redbank power station in the Hunter and Queensland's Oakey power station are projects which will potentially be adversely affected by what the government is proposing and for the reasons that I have outlined by providing cheaper energy and helping to ensure that industry, particularly the minerals and resources industry, has the capacity or the chance for downstream processing. These are all adverse consequences. I noticed that the Business Council of Australia, in its post-budget press release, had this to say about the government's decision on infrastructure bonds: It is nevertheless disappointed with the replacement measures announced in the Budget and views them as inequitable and likely to introduce unpredictability into the private sector provision of infrastructure. The inadequacy of the expenditure cap on the rebate and limiting the eligibility to road and rail projects brings into question the Government's vision of a competitive economy and the role the private sector is expected to play in providing and operating infrastructure in Australia. That is a pretty searing and damning indictment. For all the reasons that I have outlined, I associate myself with those remarks and associate myself with the remarks made by the member for Hotham, the shadow minister for industry, and I hope, subject to the timing of the debate, to be making a few technical remarks in the course of the consideration in detail stage.",24
6,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I think that there are many in Australia who seek to hike back to the days of Snowy Mountain schemes and great infrastructure projects and the vision they say those projects played in Australia. In part, that is true, but in this day and age the Australian people have a huge debt to pay off which they did not participate in. I believe that job availability and opportunities for youth, the functionality of families and the capacity of families to exist, care for the aged, health costs and things like that are the main centres of focus for Australians. There is not really the same imperative in their outlook for large projects of the type of the Snowy Mountain project. Many elements of the remarks of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) would lead us to think that the solution to many of Australia's problems are grand projects and grand infrastructure activity. In particular, I took him to say in his presentation that only with massive government intervention into Newcastle could some of those problems be solved. In my view, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) made a very interesting speech because he seemed to distance himself from those remarks in a very basic and thoughtful manner. He was more realistic about the opportunities for Australia to take on large projects and really directed his attention to how we could achieve those projects using alternative methods rather than total government involvement and total government directed investment. The debate in Australia is really: how do we as a nation achieve things without having to take money from taxpayers, put it into government coffers and then redirect it at government whim into projects that the government endorses? What we are really doing as a nation is drawing on the creativity, inventiveness and drive of the total Australian population rather than saying, as the Labor Party has traditionaIly said, that all of the brains, all of the brilliance, all of the drive and all of the direction for the future of Australia lies vested in Canberra amongst a few politicians. That is absolutely not true. One has to go back only 14 or 15 months to see how untrue that is and to realise that of the activity of the Australian Labor Party and the government of Paul Keating directed to new work opportunities, to Working Nation, to infrastructure bonds and all of those sorts of things could not produce anything but disastrous results. In fact, if all of those schemes had been successful, there would still not have been enough capacity in Australia for us to take on large infrastructure projects and successfully carry them through. In fact, the member for Hotham and the Australian Labor Party are battling to identify successful projects that are related and that have been brought about by their activity and by the introduction of the infrastructure borrowing bonds process. On 5 December 1995 I put it to the House-and I think I was the only one on my side or amongst all members of the House to say-that I believed that the decision to introduce infrastructure borrowing bonds was a bad decision by the government and was a decision which would lead to misdirection of resources. It did not favour any input from the marketplace or the needs of the country but really sought to provide a favoured treatment-a tax funded treatment-for projects that were dreamt up to gain a tax advantage. That has proved to be the case. It has been proved over the last three years that the proposal of the government of the day-the Labor Party-for infrastructure borrowings was a failure, simply because it left things so open that people were able to capitalise on the tax concessions in such a way that the infrastructure projects that were so dear to the heart of the Labor Party did not go ahead. Instead, the tax advantages flowed to people making investment3 and manipulating the funds. That is a shame, because their goal and their purpose were laudable enough, even though I believe misdirected. But it is a double penalty when your misdirected intentions fail, and the failure of the project has been rectified by the new government where the tax rorts have been cancelled out and a new process put in place. At the same time, however, I would like to point out to the House that the real benefits all of the change of government can be seen in the figures coming through on the way in which new capital expenditure, new investment, is taking place in Australia today. One only has to look at the March quarter results of new capital expenditure to see that there has been a 40 per cent increase in the estimates of capital expenditure for this year. I acknowledge that this is not people investing in every instance in big projects such as ports and gas pipelines, but it is people investing in income generating activity such as new plant and equipment, improvements to their offices, their factories and their farms. This is driving ahead the opportunity for Australians to take advantage of a better way of life. It is not government funded. Total business investment rose strongly in March, the quarter that we have just finished, to its highest level since the survey commenced in June 1987. So for the first time for a decade new capital investment is starting to rise to a level where it will generate growth, activity and opportunities for Australians in jobs and in expanded export opportunity, increased efficiency and productivity. That is something that was not able to be achieved by huge concessions made to infrastructure borrowings and infrastructure funding. So one has to look at the total input to this nation to be able to ascertain precisely how well government policy is working. Equipment spending has also reached its highest level since the survey began. Equipment spending is a pretty important aspect, because capital expenditure can include things like aircraft and other things which are imported, but the equipment spending is really the basis of new and future production. It does give an indication of confidence in the future for those making the investment. It does give an indication of the prospects for job improvement and for new opportunities for Australia. We now have had the third quarter of growth in capital expenditure and we have reached an historic high. That must continue. But at the same time as removing the rorts that were implicit and perfectly predictable in the previous government's infrastructure borrowing scheme this government has now introduced changes by introducing the infrastructure borrowing tax rebate-a much cleaner and easier way of giving a concession, if one needs to give concessions to large projects. Certainly, the demands on the financier and the investor are more rigid than was previously the case. But I guess the thing that I applaud more than anything else is the accountability that has been built into the process by the current government. It is all very well for the Australian Labor Party to say that there is a whole bunch of 'what ifs?' - 'What if we had done this?' or 'Maybe if we had done something else we could have achieved more.' They had a chance for 13 years. It is the first time in 10 years that we have seen a big increase in capital expenditure, and now we have seen a sensible infrastructure borrowing scheme that can generate $2 billion worth of investment. The start-up is $37 million, and in 1999 it will be $75 million-which will produce $2 billion worth of capital investment, because it will encourage the mix of private sector funds with the tax concession given by the Australian taxpayer. The fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, if there were no concession of this type the Australian taxpayer would be $75 million better off. But I do believe that the $75 million is about all that Australians are prepared to pay in this day and age for infrastructure. Most of them are more concerned about their family circumstances and the prospects for their kids than they are about infrastructure. They do believe-and I endorse that thought-that the circumstances ought to be such that private enterprise is encouraged to do these things and not to have the hand of government on all advances Australia wants to make. When we took the rorts out of the system, there was a cry from the Labor Party. I participated in that debate and pointed out to them that they were wrong again. It did not seem to make any difference to the member for Hotham, who keeps raving about Newcastle and whether ministers should go up there or not. It is purely a political process; he is not applying his mind to the future needs of the nation. I think that the member for Perth and other members in this chamber are providing a very welcome intellectual input to this process, and I want to compliment them on that. I hope they subsume those ahead of them, because I think that the attempt at that sort of political point scoring by the member for Hotham just does not really cut the mustard, because it does not really register with the people of Newcastle. They understand the circumstances and they know that he is engaged in political point scoring, because it was his policies that brought about the circumstances we have today in Newcastle. What he is proposing, I think, in some nebulous way, is some rescue package which was tried time and time again by the Australian Labor Party when they were in office and failed. When we first brought changes to this process and the House debated the Infrastruclogical ture Certificate Cancellation Tax Bill, pointed out to the House that, if we going to give concessions, they needed to be directed. By the proposals announced in the budget, they are well directed. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) gave good notice of this. There can be no claim by Australian Labor Party that there should be greater support for private provision of infrathis structure; nor should there be infrastructure borrowings, applications pending or anything like that have been harshly dealt with because they have all been taken care of within the budget process. For simple outlay of $75 million, the eligible categories for new public infrastructure road and rail projects and their related facilifeasibility ties, the projects that had applications infrastructure borrowings pending at the time of the 14 February announcement and extenideas sions of projects that had previously been certified for infrastructure borrowings use. is a perfectly reasonable transitional arrangepsychedelic ment. The other condition that applies, and it is important one, is that only genuine private sector proponents who provide new public infrastructure will be able to access the tax to require. rebate. Private sector proponents will be able to access the rebate only if they pass the tests contained in section 5IAD and division 16D of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a proper, rigorous approach: are the funds really going to be used for the purposes for which the investors say they will be used? ThereThe fore, we have the accountability process built back into the system. It is reasonable, it is directed and it is focused. It meets the needs for infrastructure activity, particularly within the categories of rail and road, because if there is any impediment in the cost structure of Australia today to our capacity to compete it is the infrastructure costs related to transportation. We suffer huge penalties for the distances that our goods have to be moved, and then, having moved them around within Australia, there is the cost of transhipping them overseas if they are being exported. So the directed approach being taken by the government is in light of the stage we are at, in light I of our development and needs and the neglect were that has occurred over the years. People have said in this House, 'If only you could build a railway line from Adelaide to Darwin many of our problems would be solved.' The line is halfway there, but the the problems are not half solved, so I think a rigorous economic test needs to be applied to process, and that is what the government any claim that has said it will do. As to stage 2 of this proposal, only projects which have fully satisfied the requirements of stage I-that is, rail and road, in transition a and genuine private investment met-and have satisfied additional assessments as to the are viability of the project from a commercial viewpoint will be assessed. Therefor fore, there will not be a rebate for those projects which are pie-in-the-sky sorts of that may attract a tax concession but which will not produce results. We are not It going to have jojoba sorts of activities or the ostrich farm type investments that are so speculative in rail and road. They will an not be part of this government's regime. They will have to pass the viability test, and I think that is a reasonable thing for the government As to the extent to which the project should not proceed without the rebate, another test that will be applied is whether there is a need for a rebate. Could the commercial investors go ahead without taxpayer support is one of the questions that they will have to answer. extent to which the tax benefits arising from the rebate flow to the infrastructure proponent is also significant because we will not be allowing investors to reap the benefit; the tax concessions must be directed into the nuts and bolts, the bricks and mortar, of the project so that the project itself gains the benefit. In practical terms it means that, if under normal circumstances you can build 10 kilometres of freeway without the rebate, you ought to be able to build 12 or 15 kilometres of freeway with the rebate. So the advantage of the tax rebate will be directed. I welcome this change because it is starting to get things back on the road. But I do draw the attention of the House to the fact that this important measure-now well directed, now under control-is linked to private sector capital investment. It is only when the two go together that we will get a real multiplication factor in the capacity of Australia because some concession for infrastructure-for roads and rail and maybe other things eventuallymay be needed from government. I really believe that the true emphasis is on giving people who have goals and visions of their own a capacity to do what they want. That can only come from a healthy economy where people are content and forward looking, not from a regressive, overtaxed, restricted economy with a huge debt around its neck. That is the direction this government is taking the nation-not to debt but to success and profit.",27
7,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"-It was extraordinary to hear the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill, express his opposition to infrastructure bonds on the basis that they come from a philosophy that all wisdom resides in Canberra, as though infrastructure bonds were some kind of socialist plot, when anyone who studies the issue understands that the purpose of infrastructure bonds is to facilitate private investment in infrastructure-which, until now, has been traditionally conducted by governments. Governments have built roads, railways, airports and the like. The express purpose of the infrastructure bonds has been to enable private sector investment in those projects. So to endeavour to characterise them as some kind of socialist plot really is laughable. But I guess the member for Mitchell had to contribute something different from his previous contributions on this issue. Last year, when the House was debating the Development Allowance Authority legislation and considering similar issues, the member for Mitchell said that people: . . . are sick of having one million unemployed. They are sick of a bankruptcy level where around 12,000 or 14,000 companies go bust a year. They are sick of Australia having a record foreign debt You would not want to mention that this year-unemployment has gone up, bankruptcies have gone up by over 20 per cent and foreign debt has gone up. So we did not hear anything from the member for Mitchell about unemployment, bankruptcies or foreign debt, and I do not expect that we will this year. It will be interesting to do a word search and find how many government members mention unemployment, bankruptcies or foreign debt this year. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill pulls out the rug from under infrastructure bonds. I believe that a lack of support for infrastructure means that we have stopped looking ahead to the 21 st century. To pull out the rug from under infrastructure investments is typical of this government's lack of vision. It is a smallminded government with a small-minded Prime Minister, totally lacking the vision of former Prime Minister Keating. It is something that must be seen in the context of the government's withdrawal from research and development, its withdrawal from export market development grants, from DIFF, from regional development and the cuts in higher education places. All of these things add up to a lack of industry policy and a lack of vision for Australia in the next century. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) calls every tax concession, every measure of industry policy, a tax rort. This was the same strategy used in the termination of the research and development syndication arrangements and the superannuation surcharge. Certainly, there are some problems with high income earners and financiers abusing the infrastructure bond system. That is why, as Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) announced specific anti-avoidance provisions to counter these schemes. The infrastructure bond arrangements were cardully designed by Labor to ensure that they could not involve large-scale rorting as the cost to the revenue was capped by regulation. The limits were set at $150 million for 1996-97 and $200 million for 1997-98. Indeed, it was precisely these provisions that the Treasurer invoked in September last year when he suspended the operation of the infrastructure bond arrangements for 1996-97. This proposal is a dramatic overreaction. If the infrastructure bond system was being rorted, the system should be tightened up, not abolished. The Treasurer acknowledged that not all applicants for infrastructure bond certification were rorting the system. Nevertheless, Labor will be cooperative and agree to pass the legislation. Clearly, if the ment is not prepared to provide any money to fund it, it is difficult to do otherwise. But there are transitional problems. As a result of the termination of the infrastructure bond arrangements, a number of important national projects have now been thrown into doubt by the action of the Treasurer. Labor is concerned to ensure that major new infrastructure projects are facilitated and believes that the government has an obligation to ensure that these projects become a reality. The government's mooted new arrangements for infrastructure need to be adequate to ensure that genuine projects that have been in the pipeline and are now in limbo in terms of infrastructure bonds are not unfairly disadvantaged. Important regional development projects in the Hunter Valley and in Queensland which were very close to certification have now been threatened, thereby threatening the jobs growth and regional development accompanying those projects. Labor's amendments are designed to achieve certainty in this area. I would like to take the House back to the debate on these issues at the time of the Development Allowance Authority amendments. Some people, I dare say, have short memories and need to be reminded of this discussion. The Treasurer was asked questions by government members-referred to as dorothy dixers-about infrastructure bonds. In his response to those questions, Treasurer Costello complained about the Labor Party opposing infrastructure bonds for urban road projects. He said: This is an opposition that, out of pure spite and without any principle whatsoever, is trying to place at risk 18 projects in the mining industry; lOin the tourism industry; six in electricity, gas and water; four in manufacturing; and three in transport and storage. He complained that we were trying to prevent $2.5 billion worth of projects going ahead. He said there was no basis on which he could excise one object of those infrastructure borrowings. He described Labor as 'destroying job opportunities for Australians'. This was said when we were proposing to cut infrastructure bonds for urban roads. We now find the Treasurer killing off the whole governscheme. What does that say about him? He was asked a question by the member for Cook (Mr Mutch), to which he responded that the government was determined to allow developers of urban road projects to proceed with certainty. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was also asked a question from the government side, to which he responded as follows: This government has also reintroduced infrastructure bonds to enable the private sector to fund roads around Australia such as the eastern distributor in Sydney announced by the New South Wales government only last week. What did the previous government do? The previous Labor government axed infrastructure bonds for roads. Oh dear! Just three weeks after the Minister for Transport and Regional Development made that observation, the Treasurer announced, on 12 September, that there would be no further applications for infrastructure bonds entertained or considered, completely pulling the rug out from under the minister for transport. He also indicated that at the conclusion of the current financial year the opportunities would open again in relation to infrastructure bonds. We can now see that he was wrong again. Last year the opposition explained its position concerning infrastructure bonds for urban road projects. But I want to go through that issue again because I think it is important that the House and the community have a proper understanding of it. We were concerned that the urban road projects being funded and supported through infrastructure bonds were having a number of effects which were totally inappropriate in terms of good public policy. We had a report from the EPAC task force on private sector infrastructure which expressed some concern about infrastructure bonds, but in particular they were critical of the use of infrastructure bonds for urban roads. They did that because they said that both the transaction costs and the regulatory risks were higher when private sector capital was used to build this infrastructure than would be the case where there was the normal development of roads by way of public sector borrowings and contracting out of the actual construction arrangements. They noted the additional substantial costs of raising capital, the legal costs involved in putting together financial arrangements, and the financial consultant costs, which were millions of dollars. They found that the legal and financial costs involved in putting together the overall financial plan was a much more expensive business where private sector capital was involved than was the case with the public sector and that there was considerable regulatory risk. The operation of a private sector road in association with a public sector network of roads introduces diseconomies and the need to make sure that the private sector road was profitable and did not fall over. This is precisely what we have seen in Melbourne with the City Link project: you have traffic being funnelled into the toll road to make sure that that project is viable, at the expense of the public sector roads that have been built and funded by taxpayers that are operating around it. With City Link we have Footscray Road, a major road into the city, being downgraded to two lanes in each direction between the Flinders Street extension and Dudley Street, Boundary Road being downgraded to one lane in each direction, Batman Avenue being absolutely closed west of the Morrell Bridge and the bridge itself being closed in Anderson Street, Alexandra Avenue being downgraded to one lane in each direction-and so on. You have this whole series of road narrowings or closures around the centre of Melbourne in order to funnel traffic into City Link. In my view, that is an absurd piece of public policy. It was extraordinary to read the response of the then minister for roads in the Victorian parliament to these changes. He was telling motorists that they had to pay a toll on the freeway now because it was a new freeway and it has been widened from four lanes to eight, and that is a great thing. The minister said that Footscray Road, which has been narrowed from eight lanes to four, could become a nice boulevard. No doubt it could, but it is designed to serve a transport purpose. If you want to follow that sort of logic through, then Tullamarine Freeway itself could become a nice boulevard too and be cut in half. It is an absurd piece of transport planning. We have been able to see the way the City Link project has operated in practice. Recently, the Macquarie Bank indicated in a report to its shareholders that it had made a $36 million profit from the financing of the City Link project. I also note that Macquarie Bank made a $60,000 donation in 1995-96 to the Liberal Party, as reported by its federal secretariat-a pretty good investment. But it is hard for me, or anyone else, to comprehend how the Macquarie Bank making $36 million clear profit for its shareholders is of benefit to the motorists whose road tolls for City Link are paying for that profit, or how this benefits the taxpayers who are subsidising that profit in terms of the concessional taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds. In my view, it is not the purpose of roads to make profits for Macquarie Bank shareholders and that shows up the failure of this kind of arrangement in so far as it applies to urban roads. As we see the City Link project unfold, all kinds of other adverse externalities appear. For example, there are residents in Strathmore and Pascoe Vale, living near the Tullamarine Freeway, who now have the 'For Sale' signs out on their houses. There is no question that, with the City Link works going on right next door to them, they will suffer a substantial financial penalty in trying to sell their homes at this time. A number of residents are still trying to sell their homes, which reflects just how concerned they are at the noise coming from the construction work going on now and at how close the widened freeway will be to their homes. There have been statements made to local newspapers by residents in, for example, Loeman Street, Strathmore. One said that his house was mainly on the market because of noise fears. Residents in that street, which backs onto the freeway, believed that they were going to be getting five-metre barriers when, in fact, they are now going to be half that size. Ironically, there are residents in Pascoe Vale South, in Greenbank Crescent, who either have or want to put their homes on the market because of noise barriers which in their case are proposed to be 11 metres high. I am told that 11 metres is higher than the Berlin Wall and will in fact block out the sun and reduce their street to a cold, damp hole. Here we have a lot of externalities coming from the City Link project which these people have to put up with. As the construction works are proceeding, they go on very loud and clear, very close to students at Strathmore secondary college. It is a matter of concern to says: me that those VCE students are now preparing for their mid-year exams under those conditions. What have we got now? We have got a government which, having criticised us for our position on infrastructure bonds for urban roads, has decided to terminate the whole scheme. We have before us a bill which proposes to terminate the infrastructure borrowing scheme announced by Labor and introduced by Labor as part of the One Nation statement. Private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against private provision of infrastructure, so Labor listened and introduced this scheme as a result. It has assisted private sector involvement in infrastructure projects by modifying the tax system. The sheer size of a lot of infrastructure projects worth hundreds of millions or billions projects. of dollars has meant that no Australian company has been big enough to undertake that project on its own. It is generally commercially advantageous to have partners who provide expertise in various specialist aspects of the project, for example, financiers, construction, engineering services and so on. It is natural that those projects are undertaken by consortia, and these projects then do have considerable taxation problems. We believe that the principle has been of substantial value in this community. We have supported it accordingly. We believe that the government is substantially overreacting. It is a major blow to regional Australia to find these projects potentially being cancelled. More than $21 billion worth of substantial infrastructure projects are now in danger, something like 147 projects which had been lodged with the Development Allowance Authority: 44 in New South Wales, 23 in Victoria, 38 in Queensland, 23 in Western Australia, lOin South Australia and four in Tasmania. A substantial number of projects have been put in jeopardy as a result of this decision. As for the government's replacement scheme announced in the budget, I draw the attention of the House to the response of the Australian Constructors Association, which NA NA The Federal Government's budget announcement of a new rebate scheme for private infrastructure borrowings demonstrated a lack of policy vision, the President of the Australian Constructors Association and Chief Executive of Leighton Holdings ... said today. ""As the fundamental building block of an efficient economy, infrastructure is crucial to Australia's economic prospects. With Governments no longer having the means to ensure our national infrastructure requirements are met, it is incumbent upon them to encourage private sector involvement."" He goes on to say: ""While the ACA accepted the Government's reasons for abandoning Infrastructure Bonds, the replacement scheme announced in last week's budget had the hallmarks of tokenism, particularly in its restriction of eligibility to road and rail As the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) pointed out, a whole series of infrastructure projects in important areas such as communications, electricity, ports and wharves will not be eligible for this kind of assistance. This from the government and the Treasurer who said to us last year, 'You can't single out road projects and say they are inappropriate for infrastructure bonds.' They come in here and say, 'Our scheme is only going to apply to road and rail, and in addition it is going to be substantially capped.' As a result it is not able to provide anywhere near the benefit that Labor's One nation scheme provided. The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development said: Â· .. it was dismayed by the Government's decision to abolish the bonds scheme, which had expedited more than $4 billion in infrastructure construction. Their chief executive said: Â· .. the recent surge in private investment in infrastructure provided a much-needed boost to a range of run-down infrastructure services such as urban roads and decentralised power projects. He said that the decision by the government to abandon this: Â· .. was made without any consultation with industry. As well as throwing the investment community here into disarray, it sends a very confused signal to investors off-shore, who provide vital capital to strengthen and maintain its stock of infrastructure. Those are not my words but the words of those involved in providing private sector investment and who ought to be playing a significant role in providing infrastructure for this nation in the 21 st century. This is one of many reasons why the government's budget has been regarded as a damp squib and why the opposition is to move amendments that I urge the House to support. (Time expired)",31
8,Mr ROSS CAMERON,LACKS VISION,"I listened with interest if also with exasperation to the carping negativity of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who has brought to the debate, in his own words, a 'damp squib'. There is a good story to tell in the provision of privately financed infrastructure in this country. It is an exciting and important story and it is one that this government will have an intimate and ongoing commitment to over the months, years and I hope decades ahead. Infrastructure comprises those key assets of the community which make the economy as a whole much more efficient. They are the core assets of power, water, roads, rail, ports and airports. If you look at their place and importance in the evolution of nations and indeed civilisations, you could certainly argue that the provision of quality infrastructure has been one of the secrets to the quality of life which all of us enjoy today. The historian Paul Johnson in his book the Birth of the Modern writes about John MCAdam, the man who discovered how to make good roads cheaply, and suggests that 'this was one of the magical keys to modernity'. MCAdam was a road builder and an engineer. Besides his practical gifts as an engineer he also had a gift for financing and public for working out how to fund the community's demand for ever better infrastructure. He organised the communities of England into small trusts which were responsible for raising the money for the construction and ongoing maintenance of the roads. He had a practical genius that extended in this area of financing, for example, to the construction of high quality toll booths which allowed the government and the local municipalities to employ a more honest citizen to collect the tolls and thereby preserve a greater proportion of the revenues. Johnson goes on in his analysis of the impact of infrastructure and the building of modern states to an assessment of the contribution of Thomas Telford, the poet, architect, engineer and bridge and canal builder. He describes Telford as the 'supreme engineerarchitect of the sublime'. He gives him the highest praise of anyone in his 1,200-page book when he says of Telford, 'He was perhaps the most remarkable man of all in an age of great men.' The thing about Telford and MCAdam is that they were building on a road network which was pre-established in the Roman period. The expression 'All roads lead to Rome' has a literal as well as a metaphorical dimension, and the reality is that the world's first truly imperial power was based upon the capacity of the Romans to project power over long distances at high speed through the Roman road network. Likewise, the Roman propensity for the building of sewerage systems, aqueducts and those fundamental services which lift the whole quality of life of the citizenry was in no small part responsible for the emergence of Rome as the world's first great imperial state. The thing about infrastructure is its fundamentally democratic quality. Its impact is on the living standards of the whole community, not on those of some elite few. For example, an Australian family on average weekly earnings today would enjoy considerably higher levels of mobility, domestic convenience, safety, hygiene and health than the most exalted member of the landed aristocracy a century or two ago. The rise in life expectancy around the world, especially in the more developed countries, is in no small part due to the quality of the infrastructure that serves the community as a whole. Infrastructure, particularly private ture, has other benefits. For example, in Australia it is building depth in our equity markets, which to date have been regrettably thin and lacking in diversity. It is providing investors with a new class of investment which has the characteristics of a tradeable fixed interest security, and it builds a sense of ownership and entrepreneurship among the working people of this nation. The private infrastructure experience of Australia to date, which has been considerable, is likewise building the nation's export capability. I note that the previous speaker, the member for Wills, was critical of the Macquarie Bank for its contribution to the campaign funds of the Liberal Party. I note with interest that one of the largest individual donors to the Australian Labor Party is the Transfield group. I do not bring a kind of cynical imputation of bad faith or poor motives to Transfield. I regard it as one of Australia's great corporations. Both in the past and in its more recently divided form, doing both defence and civil engineering works, it has made a fantastic contribution to the development of this country's infrastructure and, in this present context, importantly the infrastructure of the emerging nations of the region around us. I note, for example, the much discussed Friendship Bridge in Laos which was brought about with great assistance from former Prime Minister Hawke, but nonetheless it is merely one example. Transfield is building bridges and power stations all over Asia, largely on the back of its experience in the delivery of privately financed infrastructure in Australia. If you take another construction company, CMPS&F, it now has a thousand employees around Australia. On the basis of its experience in building the M4 toll road in Sydney, which was privately financed, and currently the waste treatment plant at Lidcombe, it is active in the countries of Thailand, Indonesia, China, Kiribati and Papua New Guinea, taking with it the expertise that it gained in the delivery of infrastructure here in Australia. If you take a market like China, the world's largest infrastructure market, one project alone, the Three Gorges Dam, will cost $18 infrastruc- billion to construct. I was delighted when the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) announced yesterday that a third Australian law firm, Blake Dawson Waldron, had been granted a licence to practise law in China. That firm is jointly sponsoring an institute called the Australia China Centre for BOT Research with the East China University of Politics and Law. That is a critical step forward because we are profiling Australian expertise in this area of privately funded infrastructure-buildoperate-transfer infrastructure-in the largest infrastructure market in the world. The sponsoring of that study centre follows the award by the World Bank of a contract to an Australian lawyer, Mr Larry Jackson of Blake Dawson Waldron, to advise China's Ministry of Finance on the writing of model BOT contracts for tolled highways throughout China. Likewise, the firm has been appointed by the United Nations International Development Organisation to advise the State Planning Commission of China on the formation of model contracts for privately financed water treatment plants. We are witnessing here the accumulation of expertise in privately financed infrastructure projects in this country providing a powerful springboard for the projection of Australian exports, particularly the export of services and brain power into the region around us. Infrastructure is one of those sectors that unequivocally requires leadership on the part of governments. That is so as a product of this democratic quality of infrastructure. Inevitably, in the construction phase you have a small number of people who are quite adversely affected by the construction process but also a huge number of the community who will benefit but in a much more diffuse way. In terms of the democratic dynamic, that involves huge amounts of protests and obstruction in the construction and development phase of infrastructure, but huge benefits after the project has actually been completed. The result is that, unless you have strong leadership by governments, you can wind up in a situation where the community has a kind of infrastructure gridlock where nothing can get built. As a result, the progress of the community can be substantially retarded. Something like the building of a second airport in Sydney is a classic example of this. As someone in the affected electorate of Parramatta, I see all of the communities mobilising and the quality of the debate getting increasingly irrational, and my biggest fear is not of one outcome or the other but that there might be no outcome-that the level of community objection to a second airport, wherever sited, may be so high that we simply will not have a second airport. You will not have hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the streets over that outcome, but you will find increasingly over the next decade that opportunities for Sydney will pass us by. Opportunities for employment in western Sydney will be lost to Brisbane and Melbourne but, more particularly, to our regional neighbours in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Shanghai. We must have the courage to bite the bullet and provide the real leadership necessary to deliver these infrastructure projects which, as I say, serve the community as a whole and the economy as a whole. This piece of legislation is a tightening up, a reform, of the previous scheme. It follows the introduction of a tax preference infrastructure borrowing allowance in the 1992 One Nation program. Many of the benefits of the infrastructure borrowings program have gone to infrastructure projects around Australia in exactly the way the scheme was intended. I could cite, for example, the M2 motorwaywhich services the northern boundary of my electorate--or the Eastern Distributor toll road in Sydney, the Smithfield, Osborne and Collinsville power stations and Melbourne's City Link project, all of which were fairly orthodox expressions of the infrastructure borrowings program. However, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) rightly recognised that, due to the sloppy drafting of the previous legislation, loopholes had emerged and that the scheme was being used for purposes which were beyond the intent of the original legislation. The Treasurer has taken the appropriate step of tightening up the terms of the scheme. Having said that, I am not one of those who is critical of the private sector for their conduct in this regard. I regard the energy, the innovation and the commitment to efficiency and to finding every possible competitive edge, which is a feature of the private economy, as being one of its strengths and providing a source of energy and power which drives the whole community-indeed the whole civilisation-forward. In that regard, I am an advocate of the view more eloquently expressed by Sir Garfield Barwick as Chief Justice of the High Court, formerly Attorney-General in this place and, in my view, his most distinguished role of all, as federal member for Parramatta. Sir Garfield was an advocate of the principle that individuals are not under any kind of obligation to implement or uphold government policy in relation to taxation. Their obligation is to uphold the law and they are entirely at liberty to minimise their tax obligations to government so long as they uphold the law. I would like to quote from Sir Garfield's judgment in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Westraders Pty Ltd in 1979. In that judgment Sir Garfield stated: Because of the employment of the provisions of the Act to produce a very large diminution of tax, the case affords an occasion to point out the respective functions of the parliament and of the courts in relation to the imposition of taxation. It is for the parliament to specify, and to do so, in my opinion, as far as language will pennit, with unambiguous clarity, the circumstances which will attract an obligation on the part of the citizen to pay tax. The function of the court is to interpret and apply the language in which the parliament has specified those circumstances. The court is to do so detennining the meaning of the words employed by the parliament according to the intention of the parliament which is discoverable from the language used by the parliament. Importantly, Sir Garfield concludes by saying: It is not for the court to mould or to attempt to mould the language of the statute so as to produce some result which it might be thought the ment may have intended to achieve, though expressed in the actual language employed. One could extend the logic to the role and duty of the citizen which, in my view, apsary proaches a moral duty to minimise his or her tax obligations. Sir Garfield concluded saying that this principle 'is basic to the maintenance of a free society'. He stated: . . . the freedom to choose the form of transaction into which he shall enter is basic to the mainteThat nance of a free society. Our task is to draft laws with sufficient clarity and specificity to ensure that the purpose the intention of the act is fulfilled and require the citizenry, if you like, to seconddelivering guess our intention and to uphold the policy Australians. of the government. So I regard it as an entirely appropriate response by the Treasurer to now step in and fill the void created by the drafting of the former government to produce a scheme which actually effects its intended result. Infrastructure is worthy of special treatment under our tax system for all the reasons have outlined and because of the particular financing characteristics of infrastructure class of transaction. I note that infrastructure, by very definition, is capital intensive and involves a long-term revenue stream. Many infrastructure projects do not become tax positive until after 10 years of operation. M2 motorway just completed took 2V2 years to construct with a capital cost of about $600 million. Over 2V2 years the sponsor consorI tium, the proponents, were constantly expendthat ing resources, but they had no revenue against which to claim the tax deduction. The purpose of the scheme, therefore, is to produce greater tax symmetry among the players in these major infrastructure projects and, as the member for Wills rightly pointed out, to reflect the fact that Australia does not have a sufficient number of BHPs, large corporations, which have within their own umbrella sufficient diversity of sources of revenue in order to be able to cross-match the favourable tax treatment of their losses on one project with their revenues on another. It underlines the fact that big is not necessarily bad. Australia needs some major corporaparliations with deep pockets and substantial not industrial muscle. If we had more of those corporations, we would not be so reliant on measures such as this-nonetheless a necesmeasure considering the lack of maturity and the lack of capital depth of Australian by commercial organisations. Governments of all persuasions have demonstrated a reluctance to invest in infrastructure to the level required by the community . is why we are looking more and more to the private sector to step in and take up the slack. I want to congratulate the private sector and players in Australian infrastructure who, in not to my view, have done an exceptional job in this higher quality of life to all The government's ongoing commitment of about $75 million a year worth of tax concessions is a substantial one. Had we been left in a stronger fiscal position by the previous administration we would no doubt have made a more generous contribution, but when you are wrestling with $100 billion worth of I Commonwealth debt on a budget of $140 billion, one's room to move is considerably as a circumscribed. So I do not apologise for the apparent modesty of the scheme. In terms of our current fiscal position, it in fact reflects a very substantial commitment by this government to the development of privately financed The infrastructure in this country. I salute and congratulate the private proponents of infrastructure throughout Australia. congratulate them on their success in taking expertise into our regional markets. I congratulate the Treasurer on what is a measured, judicious, appropriate reform, but nonenonetheless a signal of our continued high level of commitment to the vital private provision of infrastructure.  a.m.)-We are debating today the amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act, which will have the effect of winding up the tax concession provided for infrastructure borrowings. This particular measure dates back to the former government, particularly to its One Nation statement, which was issued in 1992, and the measure was further extended in the Working Nation statement in 1994. It formed a key element in those two statements. At the time of One Nation and Working Nation most attention was given to the labour market measures to assist the unemployed, but both those statements contained substantial other components dealing with the economic needs of the country and stimulating investment and infrastructure, both through this sort of proposal to encourage private investment in infrastructure and through direct public investment in infrastructure, which was a key part of that. The rationale there was both a short-term one, to provide a cyclical boost through capital investment when we were experiencing a recession, and also there was an acknowledgment involved there that as a country we needed to investment more in infrastructure. There were certain features of the way in which our budgetary accounting conventions operated, which provided a disincentive, particularly to public investment in infrastructure. Infrastructure investment is very important from the point of view of national economic welfare. There is now some very substantial evidence that links growth in national economic productivity to adequate infrastructure provision. There has been a major study done in the United States covering particularly the Reagan years, which links a slowdown in productivity growth in that country over a period of about a decade to the running down of public infrastructure investment. It is very important, and I suppose the economists would say that there are substantial external benefits from investment in infrastructure; these are benefits that a private investor might not entirely capture. For example, if you build a new road, the beneficiaries of building that road are not just those who use it but also the people who live on adjoining roads who experience a reduction in traffic or who use adjoining roads and consequently experience fewer delays as they go about their business and so forth. There is a whole raft of these sorts of external benefits from infrastructure investment, and I think it is clear that there is a significant case for public subsidy and public stimulus for infrastructure investment. As I said, that can take the form of either direct participation by the public sector through investing on its own account, or providing funds to other entities, whether they be state governments, for example-obviously, a proportion of general recurrent assistance to the states ends up being spent on infrastructure projects-or universities. Since we incorporated the capital program for universities into university operating grants back in 1994, a proportion of those funds obviously ends up on capital projects. So governments can directly stimulate and provide funds for capital investment. But what this concession sought to do was to increase the level of private sector investment in infrastructure. It is interesting to look down the list of projects which are potentially affected by this. In my electorate, I am quite interested in the proposed extension to the light rail project, which will extend the network out to Leichhardt and Lilyfield. I think that is a proposal that has major benefits. It is a classic example again of where infrastructure investment produces external benefits. In this case, for example, there will be reduced traffic congestion and also reduced air pollution in a densely populated inner-city area. That light rail project is costing around $170 million. I would hope that, under the replacement proposal which the government is putting up, which is confined to land transport projects, it would be able to continue to be supported. Nonetheless, it is a concern that there seems to be some doubt about that. A few years ago the former member for Fraser, John Langmore, chaired a committee which looked at Australia's performance in public infrastructure investment. His committee produced a report which, in a sense, made rather depressing reading because it showed a steadily declining share of GDP being devoted to infrastructure projects. At the time, I think the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who was then the Treasurer, argued as against that view that, to a substantial extent, that decline in public infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP was offset by a growth in private infrastructure investment. There was a substitution in a number of areas over time. I think there is undoubtedly a substantial element of truth in that. What it does, I suppose, is highlight the importance of measures which are designed to foster and encourage private investment in infrastructure. In thinking about the volume and the extent of public infrastructure investment, one has to realise that the issue is not just the volume of funds going in but also how efficiently infrastructure is utilised. You have to ensure that you do not spend money on wasteful projects. To return to my own experience a couple of years ago with higher education, the separate higher education capital program funds were incorporated into the general recurrent operating grants provided to universities. The idea was to ensure that universities were able to contemplate different alternatives to achieve their teaching and research objectives. If they could achieve their objectives not by building a new building but by investing in some information technology infrastructure that might enable people to undertake studies at a distance, from home or from work, then we needed a structure of funding that provided every incentive for them to do that. In doing that, I think we ensured there was no wasteful use of infrastructure. Under the old schema, a major building project would be like manna from heaven. A university would be awarded this and would be able to spend money on it with no consideration of how effectively it would use it. It is very important that there be measures to ensure that infrastructure is well utilised. Obviously, the Hilmer type reforms and competition policy are, in part, about ensuring that. If you look at the overall structure of infrastructure investment, our budgetary conventions tend to provide an in-built bias against direct public infrastructure investment because large, lumpy projects come off both the headline and the underlying deficit in the short term. There is no concept of amortisation of that investment. Hopefully, as the move is made to place the budgetary accounting framework on an accruals basis, that sort of distortion will tend to be diminished. For the time being, at least, there is that inherent factor biasing government decisions against an appropriate level of capital investment. Consequently, that means that part of the burden of ensuring an adequate level of such investment is taken up by the private sector. I now tum to the specific measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill, which, as I said at the outset, involve amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove the infrastructure borrowings concession. I have indicated the history of this. It originated with the former government's One Nation and Working Nation statements. It was a key element in those statements. The object of the exercise was to provide a concession which would, in the first instance, go to lenders for infrastructure projects. But the intention was that the lenders would, in tum, pass on at least part of the benefit to borrowers through lower borrowing costs. I suppose it is reasonable to ask, given the substantial budgetary impact, whether it was effective. It is significant to note that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech points to the volume of projects which were under consideration. There were some 71 projects which potentially were worth $21.6 billion. That involved a significant revenue cost if they all ultimately got up. I think there is some indication that the measure was having a significant effect on infrastructure investment. To that extent, for the reasons I have already talked about, and given the factors which tend to lead to underinvestment in such infrastructure, I think that effect is probably a desirable one. The bill obviously proposes to enact a decision to terminate the infrastructure borrowing scheme, which was introduced by Labor. Private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against the private provision of infrastructure. Labor listened at the time and introduced the infrastructure borrowing scheme. The infrastructure borrowing scheme involves assisting private sector involvement in infrastructure projects by modifying the tax system. This private sector investment was historically impeded because the initial year's losses generated by most or all of the projects could not be offset against the other income of the investors, unless the project was taken by a single investor only as part of a wholly owned company group. The sheer size of most infrastructure projects-worth either hundreds of millions or billions of dollars-meant that no Australian company was big enough to undertake the project on their own. It is generally commercially advantageous to have partners, as they provide expertise in various specialist aspects of the project-that is, financiers, construction, engineering services. It is natural that most projects would be undertaken by consortia. These projects would then confront the tax problem which I just mentioned. The infrastructure borrowing scheme overcame this problem by reducing the cost of infrastructure finance by effectively transferring the tax benefit of the tax deductibility of interest from the borrower to the lender. This was achieved by making the interest nondeductible to the borrower and either nonassessable to the lender or assessable but subject to a rebate equal to the company tax rate. This allowed a reduction of the rate of interest in that lenders charge borrowers for infrastructure projects. Projects were assessed by a statutory authority-the Development Allowance Authority, which is at arms-length from the government on their merit and according to statutory criteria. This system was starting to function very effectively as an incentive. There was leverage for significant projects which may not have been delivered for many years, if at all, due to budgetary conditions in the public sector. That said, there were some problems. For example, Labor announced that infrastructure borrowings would cease to be available for urban road projects from late 1995-a decision that was rejected by Treasurer Costello. Secondly, there is some evidence that aggressive tax planning was creeping into the marketing of infrastructure bonds at the retail level. These were matters that warranted being addressed by the government. However, the Treasurer's announcements in February were an overreaction. On 14 February 1997, Treasurer Costello under- announced the government's intention to prevent the lodging of any new infrastructure bond applications, prevent the certification of any more projects under the infrastructure bond arrangements, including those currently before the certification authority-that is, the Development Allowance Authority-and terminate the right of variation of the conditions attaching to existing infrastructure bonds where the tax commissioner considers that this may cause an increased cost to the revenue. Quite literally, he cut the infrastructure bond program off at the knees. There were no warnings and no apologies to those who were not seeking to rort the system. No respect was given to the continuation of normal processing of applications. No thought was given to the impact of the decision on applicants, nor of the delays or the effect on the regions where the infrastructure is planned. During the press conference the Treasurer also flagged that alternative arrangements for infrastructure would be announced in the 1997-98 budget. That new replacement program has now been announced and it is completely inadequate. I will return to this matter later in my remarks. The pretence under which the Treasurer acted was that there was a serious threat to the revenue. What he did not say was that there is already an effective mechanism to cap the revenue cost of the measure-indeed it is a measure that he himself invoked in September 1996. He then claimed that the provisions could be rorted. Labor has stated that we will support any clamp down on rorts, and we will, but the complete cessation of the program is an overreaction. At the press conference the Treasurer stated: The Development Allowance Authority has received legal advice to say that it is not able to refuse certification on the grounds that they are providing undue tax benefits and, as a result, the Government will enact legislation effective from midday today which will prevent any of those applications being certified. Instead of saying that the government will amend the law to grant a discretion to the DAA to reject any applications which are too 'tax aggressive', the Treasurer used this as a pretence to shut down the whole scheme. This is despite the fact that Mr Costello specifically acknowledged at the same press conference: . . . I want to keep stressing not every IB scheme is like what I've described today. There are a lot of IB schemes which are straight up and down in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the law and you know they are people trying to do the right thing and they're getting good investment infrastructure. I want to stress that point. This looks like another Costello con. If you want to obtain savings from a tax expenditure, claim that it is being rorted. Then do not simply tighten the scheme to address any problems; cut the scheme completely to produce savings. Then if anybody wishes to analyse the alleged problems or seeks actual evidence of the claimed rorting, assert that they are supporting tax avoidance. This was the model pursued with the research and development syndication concession and it is also being put in this case. Despite this overreaction, Labor does not seek to defeat this bill. We recognise that the government has made the announcement and that this has, in practice, been implemented. It has thrown the existing rules into chaos but we cannot now undo that chaos. That said, we are concerned about the need for transitional provisions to assist some genuine projects which were well advanced along the certification process, not aimed at rorting the tax system and going to provide desirable regional development opportunities. This is one of the key issues which has been considered by the Senate committee which has examined the legislation. Why should people who have done the right thing be penalised? Why should Australia's reputation as a stable place to invest and do business be threatened as it has been in this instance? This is why we brought down a minority report to the Senate committee report. Which projects have now been threatened by cutting the scheme? I have mentioned the Sydney light rail extension, which is of particular interest to me. I would now like to say a few things about the government's alternative scheme. The government's new scheme was announced in the budget. It was not announced with much fanfare because it is a pale imitation of the arrangements it seeks to replace. It is called the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate. But it really should not be so broadly characterised. It is not a general scheme to assist the provision of private infrastructure in Australia. It is only targeted at land transport projects, although those projects which were left in limbo on 14 February are allowed to apply. This limitation seems extraordinary given that in the same budget we are told that for the savings rebate it is wrong to favour anyone type of saving and we must benefit all types equally. Secondly, the administration has been transferred to the tax commissioner from the DAA. Whilst Labor has no problem with the involvement of the tax commissioner on tax specific matters, I am not sure what expertise the commissioner will bring to the question of infrastructure. Indeed, I wonder if the commissioner actually wants yet another area of responsibility on top of his considerable current responsibilities. The third area of change will be reduction in the rate of concession that will be available to superannuation funds and other taxpayers that face lower nominal rates of tax than the company tax rate. Labor had specifically made IBs more attractive to super funds through the 36 per cent rebate option. This was working in attracting finance from super funds into infrastructure. These changes may put that trend at risk. It continues the inexplicable attack on superannuation that has been engaged in by this Treasurer. The fourth, and arguably the most important change, has been the totally inadequate funding allocated to the concession. The government is allocating $37.5 million in 1997-98 and $75 million in subsequent years. This can be contrasted with the $200 million that Labor had allocated to our IB program. Clearly, many or most of the projects which have been left in limbo will not fit into the tiny allocation. In any event, it appears that there will be no approval of projects under the new arrangements until 1 January 1998. In conclusion, we think what the government is proposing is a poor substitute for the arrangements that we had put in place and which the government intends to peremptorily terminate through the legislation that the House is currently debating.",35
9,Mr WAKELIN,LACKS VISION,"In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997, the reasoning of the government for bringing this bill before the House has been well canvassed. But for the purpose of refreshing my own mind and that of the House, the infrastructure borrowings tax concession was introduced in 1992 in the One Nation statement and expanded in the 1994 Working Nation statement. We understand it is a way of reducing the costs of financing the construction of infrastructure projects. Lenders were eligible for a tax rebate of 36 per cent and the lenders would pass those benefits back to the project via a lower interest rate the borrowings. The Development Allowance Authority had the role of certifying all applications for the concession. We know that between 1994 to 30 June 1996 the DAA issued 12 certificates on borrowings totalling $4 billion. At 30 June 1996 it also had six applications still under consideration. But, in the six weeks before the 1996-97 budget, the Development Allowance Authority received another 71 projects worth around $21.6 billion. If all these applications had been certified the loss in revenue would have exceeded $4 billion. Unfortunately the intent of the concession was undermined by tax aggressive financing arrangements and so some of those applications would see benefits flow not to projects but to financiers. Therefore, on 14 February this year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) cancelled the scheme. As we know, the bill prevents the DAA issuing any certificates past 14 February 1997, but where a project has been told by the DAA that it would be eligible on certain criteria, it may still issue a certificate. The bill also takes into account variations on existing certificates. The introduction of the infrastructure borrowing tax rebates has been well canvassed. A maximum cost to the budget of $75 million per annum, including running costs, has been allocated. This afternoon I propose to go through some of the Labor Party's record on infrastructure and have a look at the practical reality of investment on the ground at the end of the day-getting the product onto the ship or onto the shelves and employing people. One issue of particular interest to my part of the world is the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. If we look at the previous Labor government's record on that issue-we well recall that the Fraser government was going to build it-we see that the then leader of the Labor Party, in campaign mode, came to the Northern Territory and made a special television commercial in which he said: Territorians, you can trust me. The Australian Labor Party is the only party that will build the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. It is history that Mr Hill was commissioned on to write a report, which sought to prove that the railway was not viable and to give the government of the day a way to not proceed. Of course, that is what happened. Over the 13 years of Labor's rule, that matter was raised time and time again, with the railway never to come to fruition. While travelling in the Northern Territory about a month ago, I was interested to talk to the now Chief Minister, Shane Stone. His vision for the Alice Springs-Darwin railway, along with his minister, Mr Coulter, and the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen, is to press on and make every effort to ensure that railway is built. While flying down from Darwin to Alice Springs, I had the pleasure to spend a couple of hours with Shane Stone. He was telling me how important it was to the territory and said he would do all within his power to make sure that project proceeded. I was interested to hear the comments of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) on infrastructure projects-about power, downstream processing, et cetera. I am reminded of one of the great private infrastructure projects in my electorate, Olympic Dam. The now $3.5 billion project has proceeded over nearly the last 10 years with very little government help. Projects are proceeding in this country depending on their natural viability, on the competence of those companies and on the ability of those companies to get projects up and running. In the context of what governments can do to encourage infrastructure, I think it is very important to realise that you can tweak things around the edges but, at the end of the day, it is the viability of the project that is the determining factor. We remember Labor's record on Olympic Dam at Roxby Downs, now a world-class project. Labor did all it could to prevent that mine going ahead. I think we need just a touch of reality in these matters. I will make a comment on the approach of the Treasurer to these things. I have said in this place before that, had I been told 14 months ago what would be achieved by this government, I doubt whether I would have believed it. The Treasurer has set this country on a very strong path, in concert with his cabinet colleagues and very much under the leadership of Prime Minister Howard. It is with great pride that I serve on this side of the House as part of that government. I do not say this in any trite way, because there is a deep sense of appreciation of the efforts that have gone into giving this country the sort of leadership and government which can allow projects like Roxby Downs and many others to proceed. I will not take the House through the detail of the fiscal performance of the government in the 14 short months since its election. I simply remind the people of Australia of the interest rate regime we currently enjoy and of our management of the deficit we inherited. We in this country can look forward to a long period of stability and prosperity as a result of the steps that have been taken. This bill before us today is just one part of many parts which allow us as Australians to consolidate the many benefits that we enjoy as part of the international scene as citizens of the world. The longer I spend in this place the greater appreciation I have of Australia's place in the world. The opportunities that we are looking forward to based on the last 14 months will be, as they say, 'We ain't seen nothing yet.' With those few words, with great pleasure I support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997.",43
10,Mr MCCLELLAND,LACKS VISION,"At the outset, I want to correct a misconception of the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and, perhaps to a degree, the former speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). A number of very successful infrastructure programs were completed under the previous government. I have in front of me a page and a half of programs, and they include programs that the member for Mitchell would no doubt have experienced. For instance, the M2 motorway either goes through or very near his electorate. I would think that he can hear the cars toot on that motorway now. He has most certainly gone through the Sydney airport domestic terminal. If he has walked through Chinatown, he has most certainly stepped upon the light rail link from Pyrmont to Ultimo. There are, as I say, a page and a half of successful programs including airports, water filtration systems, sewage treatment works, power stations and gas projects, to mention a few. It is just not true to say that the program has not been successful. With respect to the member for Mitchell, his point was quite inconsistent with that advanced by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), who congratulated so many private companies for their involvement in successful infrastructure projects. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot cut a system on the basis of saying that the system has not been successful while, at the same time, having members in your own party congratulating those companies that have been involved in infrastructure projects. Again, this demonstrates the false logic and the false reasoning behind the government virtually cutting out the infrastructure borrowing scheme. I say 'virtually cutting out' because their funding is going to facilitate some $2 billion worth of programs whereas, under Labor, there were $22 billion worth of programs in the pipeline-in other words, a 90 per cent reduction of the actual funding which is available. As the member for Parramatta said, infrastructure is essential to society. Indeed, I think he went so far as to refer to the Roman aqueducts and said that successful infrastructure programs have been an ingredient of any successful society. There is no doubt about that. He said that they formed the core assets of the community. There is no doubt about that. He said that those core assets are available to the community as a whole, not just an elite few. There is no doubt about that. He said that infrastructure formed a fundamental place in our lives. He said that the infrastructure that we have very much contributes to our quality of life and, indeed, our life expectancy. And there is no doubt about that. Infrastructure is essential. To pare it back by 90 per cent is, at best, with respect, entirely short-sighted and, at worse, reckless and incompetent government. Infrastructure provides essential requirements for not only the economy but also society. Obviously, the water treatment plants and the power projects to which I have referred are essential for both industry and also for domestic life. Historically, infrastructure was provided almost exclusively by governments. The member for Mitchell said that this legislation was a welcome change from government monopoly of infrastructure. The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) said that the member for Mitchell was almost saying that, until now, there had been some sort of socialist monopoly or control by the former government. Again, with respect to the member for Mitchell, he has not read what the Labor government's program was about. It was precisely that: it was about bringing in private sector investment into infrastructure. It has done that for a number of reasons: to encourage competition with government monopolies to make the services provided by government more efficient and, obviously, to facilitate the construction of infrastructure projects which otherwise would not have gone ahead or, at least, would not have gone ahead for quite some time given budgetary constraints. Getting the private sector involved in infrastructure programs was an initiative of the former government. It is not an initiative of this government. This legislation actually pares back by some 90 per cent that private sector opportunity to invest in infrastructure. There is no doubt that there is a need to provide incentives for investment in infrastructure projects. Traditionally, private sector investment has been weighted towards small projects. Again, by way of example, I refer to the speech by the member for Mitchell, who referred to the importance of capital investment figures. While capital investment is certainly important, it is not the same thing as infrastructure programs. Capital investment is traditionally capital purchases by a single company for their own activities. That capital purchase is then able to be written off or depreciated against that company's profits. That is not the case with infrastructure projects. Usually, they are projects which involve millions and millions of dollars and the combined skill and knowledge of at least tw-ften more than tw-ompanies, given their various areas of expertise. The difference between a capital purchase and an infrastructure project is that once there are two companies involved in a project they cannot write off the substantial losses incurred-particularly during those early years of construction of the infrastructure projectagainst the profits that the respective companies earn in their normal operations. The whole concept of infrastructure projects is one which requires incentives so that companies can have an advantage, during the times of the massive costs that they are incurring, by having some deductibility of those costs and reducing the interest burden that they have to incur in order to successfully undertake the projects. Again, with respect, it is a fundamental flaw in the government's reasoning to equate single one-off investments or capital purchases with the requirements that exist for industry, for the private sector, to invest in infrastructure programs. There has been no doubt that industry, corporations-and you cannot blame themare going to invest where they get the best after tax return. With infrastructure, private sector involvement is at a relatively early stage. It could be either very successful or dramatically unsuccessful, with very heavy loss consequences, given the massive amounts spent on the projects. So you can understand why there will be a reluctance to take those dramatic risks if there are simpler, short-term investments, such as other trading activities or even purchasing shares on the stock exchange, that companies can undertake. Unless there is an incentive provided by government, that is where the predominance of commercial activity is going to be: in those secondary trading activities and share purchases, not in building what the member for Parramatta said was the fundamental capital of our society and what the member for Wills said was building our armoury, our infrastructure, for the next century. The facts of the matter are that the government really does not understand what it is doing. If it does understand what it is doing, then it is to be condemned because it is really, for base accounting reasons, taking away opportunities that Australian workers are going to have not only in terms of participating in the construction of the infrastructure projects but also in terms of utilising the resources that we obtain from these infrastructure projects in the future. The government has, with respect, also been dishonest. Whether it has been deliberately so is a moot point. The assessment that the infrastructure projects in the pipeline-which total some $21.6 billion worth of infrastructure funds available-would result in a revenue loss of $4 billion just does not add up. Moreover, the government has not factored in the important fact that the workers engaged in those projects will pay tax and, on the other side of the equation, the workers engaged in those projects clearly will not be receiving unemployment benefits. When we are looking at the consequences of likely massive unemployment in the Newcastle region, the Redbank power project, for instance, would be an excellent example of the employment creating and hence government revenue creating measures which would have followed. As the shadow minister for industry and regional development said, under the reasoning or guise of removing taxation rorts, the government has thrown the baby out with the bathwater. That is a cliche, I know, but it is the reality. It is a massive assault, as he said, on industry. It is a massive assault on regional development and on jobs. But it is more than that; it is an assault on the quality of life of all Australians. I have in front of me a list of some 147 projects currently awaiting approval. They include a number of essential environmental projects, for instance: the Port Stephens sewage processing facility, the project Z sewage treatment in Sydney, the waste conversion project in Sydney-which is another sewage treatment process-and a sewage processing treatment at Mittagong. There are several other projects: the MCGRATHs Hill sewage treatment for the Hawkesbury area, the Picton sewage treatment and the St Marys sewage treatment plant. Indeed, I recall an expensive campaign of television advertisements late last year regarding the government's oceans policy. It is mouthing one position via its public-funded propaganda but, when it comes to putting money where its propaganda is, it is found wanting. All those treatment projects for sewage going out into our oceans are now at risk because of the government's actions. The fact of the matter is that this government's record simply does not compare with the former government's record. This government is narrow; it is inward-looking; it is literally black and white in terms of balance sheets. The former government contributed $200 million to infrastructure projects and, as well, encouraged private sector investment. The best this government can do is $37.5 million in 1997-98 and a measly $112 million over the following three years. It just does not compare. There is also the 90 per cent paring back of funding assistance for private sector involvement in infrastructure projects. As I have said, as of 14 February, there are 147 projects across Australia that are now at risk. One of the more reprehensible aspects of this legislation is the way in which they have gone about making changes to the infrastructure borrowings regime. If there is one thing that investors require, it is certainty. That is the reason investors choose Australia rather than politically unstable countries in our region. The offhanded and arrogant treatment of genuine, committed, well-researched and planned investments by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is a disgrace, and it will do irreparable damage to our long-term reputation as an investment site. The Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley that my friend and colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will no doubt discuss, together with the Oakey power project in Queensland, are excellent examples of how this government has poorly administered and governed. Those projects had their applications in with the DAA well prior to 10 September 1995 when the Treasurer announced that no further applications would be considered. Since that time the DAA have determined their order of priority-and I am not suggesting any poor judgment on their behalf; they have been processing applications submitted to them prior to 10 September-and any applications which were certified before 14 February are safe, are up and running. However, the DAA had not considered the Redbank or Oakey proposals and hence, as a result of the Treasurer's announcement of 14 February, those projects are out in the cold, despite the fact that lots of effort and lots of money have gone into the preparation of two very worthwhile projects. Those involved in the preparations are entitled to be more than annoyed-they are entitled to be outraged. In any commercial relationship, one thing that people expect is integrity. Walking away from the procedures that were in place shows nothing short of a complete absence of integrity. The business community as a whole is increasingly starting to realise the lack of depth and the lack of genuineness that this government has when it comes to assisting them to contribute to future opportunities for Australians. A further issue of real concern is the fact that the Commissioner for Taxation will now be charged with administering the scheme. It is my understanding that, when the scheme was introduced by the former Labor government in 1992, the Commissioner for Taxation had that role. It was found-with all due respect to appropriate officers in the taxation department-that they just did not have the expertise to assess infrastructure projects, as it is a very specialised area involving a knowledge of engineering, financing and various issues relating to technology. Indeed, I understand that, in that two-year period, only one project-the M5 project-was approved by the Commissioner for Taxation. Even though only $2 billion will be available for infrastructure projects, the mere fact that it will be poorly administered, I fear, will mean that the benefits for Australia will not flow. The government really is incredibly short-sighted and incredibly destructive. It really stands to be condemned for its ignorance and spoiling activities in regard to the future benefits that Australia might have from infrastructure. (Time expired)",44
11,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,LACKS VISION,"I rise today to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill. The infrastructure borrowings tax concession was brought in by the previous government in the 1992 One Nation statement. It had a very worthy aim-to allow companies the reduced cost of borrowings to finance construction of infrastructure projects. The concept was that the borrower would forgo deductions for the cost of borrowings such as interest deductions, while the lender would receive the tax benefit and have the interest earned exempt from tax. The intent was that borrowers who did not have a revenue stream to benefit from tax deductibility would pass this benefit on to the lender. It was basically to be a one-for-one arrangement-a dollar forgone as tax deduction for the borrower given as a dollar gained as a tax deduction for the lender. Had the scheme retained this original and very genuine one-for-one benefit, it would have been a scheme with some integrity for the taxpayer. In 1994 when the Development Allowance Authority assumed responsibility for the program, up until 30 June 1996 there were certificates issued for 12 projects. So, for two years, there were virtually 12 projects. However, in July and August of 1996 there were 71 applications. So in a two-month period there were 71 applications with a total borrowing of $21 billion to $22 billion. The cost to revenue has been estimated at $4 billion over three years. Quite properly, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) closed the scheme to new applications on 10 September 1996 and asked the Development Allowance Authority to investigate. The outcome of that investigation was that some applications, as they always had been, were genuine; others were extremely tax aggressive. I now want to show exactly how aggressive some of those schemes were. The Treasurer has released details of one scheme forwarded to the tax commissioner. The project required funding of $100 million. However, by the time this $100 million had been massaged through interposed companies and packages, the project was worked up to $151 million. The reason for this was that not only was the interest tax deductible but so was the capital gain on the infrastructure borrowing bond. Every time it was on-sold, there was a capital gain and this, as well, was tax deductible. Once it was worked up to $151 million it was offered to retail investors, but not all retail investors-and I will get to that in a moment. The way in which it operated was that a lender would offer, say, $500,000. There would be interest and management fees of $85,000. The person approached would take out a loan for $549,000 and contribute $36,000, bringing the total to $585,000. He would then resell the loan to the lender and extinguish the loan. However, the interest paid on the loan to buy the infrastructure bond is deductible and so is the management fee. So for a personal investment of $36,000 there is now $85,000 worth of tax deduction. It should be remembered that this is the scheme about which the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) used the words 'assault' and 'dishonest'. He is right; it is dishonest, but not in the way he mentioned. I will now examine the scheme in more detail. That $85,000 tax deduction at the top marginal rate is worth, as a return, $41,582. It gets even better: they can buy the bond on 28 June for an investment of $36,000, get $85,000 worth of deductions in that financial year, which is worth a return of $41,582. They resell the loan to the lender and extinguish it, and then they can rebuy the same bond in the next financial year and get the same deduction again. If that is recycling, that is a recycling scheme that is of no use to taxpayers, particularly the low income taxpayers in this country. This scheme was only attractive to those with a minimum taxable income of $ 135,736-not your average battling Aussie. And why was it attractive only for somebody with a minimum taxable income of that amount? Simply because it worked at the highest marginal tax rate of 48.5c in the dollar, and that only works for an income of over $50,000. Because you are buying a tax deduction of $85,000, the minimum taxable income had to be $135,000. In fact, the financial institution which came up with this scheme was helpful enough to print investment details, starting at a minimum taxable income of $135,000, as I have mentioned, and finishing, certainly on this table-one imagines it would go a great deal further-at a minimum taxable income of $466,609. Not exactly a battling Aussie! The investor's contribution, for somebody on half a million dollars, was $177,059. But what was the total income tax deduction at that figure-$416,609. That was an assault on the low income earners and the battling taxpayers in this country. But it gets even better, because for somebody earning a minimum taxable income of $135,000, with an $85,000 tax deduction, through this scheme put out by a financial institution, this brings their taxable income down to $50,000. They are eligible for social security. This particular financial institution was helpful enough to print the Department of Social Security guidelines so that those poor people could claim social security. That is not an assault by the Treasurer or by this government. That is a blatant abuse of the low income taxpayers in this country to allow somebody on such a high taxable income to make use of the tax base of the federal government in that way. I am very pleased that the Treasurer has moved so quickly to ensure that this scheme is restructured in a way that has integrity and a base for low income earners in this country. I want to speak now about the financial institutions in this country. An advertisement in some of the national newspapers in the last few days by one of the major banks accused the Treasurer of bank bashing. I would like to talk about that particular bank and what they have done in one of the small towns in Dawson-Collinsville. That bank had a bank facility in that town for many years. The town, as many do, unfortunately, came upon hard times. The power station closed and there were jobs lost in the mines. The bank closed its facility, but with the full knowledge that the power station was reopening and the mine was going to be taken over by a new contractor. The payroll in that town is now somewhere between $250,000 a week and $350,000 a week, yet that bank closed its banking facility. As well as that, the town there is a fledgling farming industry with 20 to 30 pickers in the season earning $300 a week. How does this particular bank deal with people in the town wanting to access their wages? Obviously this large payroll is paid into accounts and these people-not unreasonably-want to access their wages to settle bills and accounts and spend money with families. The small businesses in that townthe grocery store and the hotel-have to have an EFfPOS facility. In one week they have up to $40,000 drawn out on EFfPOS. That particular bank, of course, is charging small businesses for the privilege of doing what they will not do. The EFfPOS costs $40 per month rental, 1.5 per cent on cash transactions and 3.2 per cent on credit cards. In fact, one of the small businesses in the town of Collinsville will be paying $700 a month because the bank that put an ad in the paper about the Treasurer cannot be bothered to put a banking facility in that small town. The small businesses have insurance premiums to pay, security risks, an overdraft and they have inconvenience to their employees. I certainly will not say that this particular banking facility was the one responsible for this particular scheme, but I will say that the financial institutions in this country should really consider whether, in fact, they can produce schemes which benefit-on a ratio of one to seven in some cases-people with a minimum taxable income of $135,000 and yet charge small businesses in small country towns for doing what they refuse to do any more, which is to provide banking facilities in small communities. One of the women in the community of Collinsville, who is on a pension, has to take a four-hour trip to be able to get a new bank book every time she needs one. She can only access $100 through the EFfPOS facility at the grocery shop. Yet these banks are accusing the Treasurer of bank bashing. The comments made by those on the other side about the government being dishonest in removing this scheme are simply invalid. The taxpayer was not getting value through this existing infrastructure borrowing scheme. If in it had been, as I said, on a one to one ratioa dollar forgone by the borrower as a dollar of benefit to the lender-then fine. But not on a one to seven ratio. All that is doing is benefiting high marginal taxpayers, in terms of their ability to save, to the cost of people on low incomes. Some other taxpayer would have had to bear the cost. I am very pleased that the Treasurer has moved to eliminate abuse and misuse of taxpayers' funds in this manner. However, the Treasurer has put in a scheme to take the place of this particular one. Announced in the budget was the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate, a program which will make up to $75 million per annum, including running costs, available to those who wish to invest in the private sector for projects such as roads, rail and related facilities. This will give successful applicants a tax rebate for interest which has been incurred and certainly will avoid the pitfalls of the original scheme. I would like now very briefly to talk about other incentives in the previous budget for regional areas. I note that in the budget just brought down by the Treasurer there has been a regional focus with over $4 billion in future spending initiatives. Those include, of course, the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate I just mentioned and $800 million for 18,700 kilometres of national highways and roads of national importance in 1996-97. Ninety per cent of that is to be spent on rural roads, creating over 19,000 jobs. There are million for a national survey of bridge quirements to ascertain whether the bridges on the national highway are able to take inprograms, creased loadings. There are $250 million a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund; $48 million for a regional forest agreeare ment; $1.2 million for a regional minerals program looking at the development of new mines and new mineral processing facilities; and $75 million over four years for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, a very welcome initiative in northern QueensIsland land where we have had infestations of the papaya fruit fly. In the last budget there were also very important employment initiatives: $21 million for work for the dole schemes for 10,000 young people in the highest areas of youth unemployment. Of the total of 70 of those schemes, 50 will be in regional areas. There are $20 million to assist through the deture pressed regions program. It will enable those areas where there have been major retrenchabout ments or difficulties to retrain and to diversify their industry base. There are $5.2 million 1997 for a national tourism development program and $14.72 million over seven years for a cooperative research centre for sustainland Treasury. able tourism to look at economic and ecologically sustainable tourist attractions. For families living in regional areas, parinvested ticularly in the area of child care, there an additional 2Y2 thousand places for family day care. For Austudy, particularly for young people in a family where there were two students away from home in tertiary study, there is an opportunity to access an additional $925 per year to assist with the costs of study. This is a very worthwhile recognition of the cost for children in regional areas who not only have to travel but also have to pay for accommodation in tertiary education centres far from home. I was very pleased at many of the initiatives in the budget. We are looking at additional have funds for schooling: four per cent more for schooling in 1997-98, going from $3.6 billion in funding to $3.75 billion. In fact it is very pleasing to see all of the new schools that are being opened. We have recently had one open $11 in the seat of Dawson; a very welcome readdition to the schooling capacity in my electorate. There are $160 million for literacy $156 million for speech learning for needs and $54 million for languages. Some of the best initiatives in the budget those related to indigenous programs$124 million over four years for an indigenous business incentive program to look at Aboriginal communities in rural and remote areas attaining economic independence. There has been a great deal of success at Badu with exports of pearls and lobsters. The Cootha Aboriginal Development Corporation at Cloncurry now has a contract worth some millions of dollars with MIM to transport gold and copper concentrate. Of course, the biggest art export from Australia is Aboriginal art. That is a very worthwhile incentive program. I would now like to tum to some of the projects that would benefit from an infrastrucborrowings scheme such as that brought in by the Treasurer. I would like to speak one of the dams in our area, Urannah, which has had an economic analysis undertakin en by Dr Richard Brown and Jackie Robinson of the University of Central Queensland-two very well respected advisers to the QueensThey have looked at this scheme, using four economic indicators. The return per dollar is the total return in dollars to the were state government that would occur over the life of the project. A 30-year study period is taken for a dam or water storage facility, although such projects have much longer lives than that. This particular dam would return $40.40 for every dollar invested, at a six per cent discount rate, which is a substantial return for the state government. This water storage facility has a return in jobs created of 6,069 jobs. When we are looking at job creation and regional development it is very important to look at programs which are going to open up opportunities for industry in regional areas. There are 22 mines in the Bowen Basin which are at present unable to open because of lack of water. If we had a water storage facility such as the Urannah dam or other water schemes proposed, there would be a tremendous growth in jobs in that area. I am very pleased to see that the Queensland government in its recent budget has also addressed the need for regional infrastructure funding through a water infrastructure task force and funds that are going to be allocated over the next few years for Priority One water storage projects. I commend to the House the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill.",47
12,Mr ROCHER,LACKS VISION,"I want to compliment the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), who managed to use over half her speaking time unchallenged to talk about things which have nothing at all to do with the legislation before the House. But I do understand that as a government backbencher it is hard to get a speaking spot on the budget bills. I heard the honourable member refer to a mild leak of the Commissioner of Taxation published just recently about these dreadful aggressive tax planners. I would ask her, when she gets a moment, to have a look at some of the aggressive tax collection processes adopted by the Commissioner of Taxation-that is, if she is not frightened of a tax audit for her audacity, should she find the need to talk about it. When distributing risk and rewards to the private sector, governments should ensure that returns accruing to the private investors are commensurate with the risks they face, no more and no less. So said the Allen Consulting Group in its submission to the government on a replacement program for the former government's infrastructure borrowings scheme. This report was similar in content to many others submitted to the government. Those who have benefited from the infrastructure borrowings program in the past are typically not seeking a handout. They are not interested in business welfare. Private investors wanted to see a new program introduced that demonstrated a balance between the protection of government revenue and the encouragement of business spending on infrastructure. The former infrastructure borrowings program fulfilled the latter criterion but was subject to abuse under certain tax minimisation schemes. Conversely, it is doubtful whether the new infrastructure borrowings scheme as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the 1997-98 budget will enhance private infrastructure expenditure because of the limited eligibility criteria. In addition to stimulating business investment, a report released in 1996 by Invest Australia found that the original program had brought about substantial benefits to the Australian community. These benefits included lower user charges because of both the reduced cost of infrastructure and an increase in both construction activity and employment. The report also noted that the call on government budgets lessened as private infrastructure expenditure increased and that the sustainable rate of growth of the economy as a whole increased. However, as the Allen Consulting Group recognised, the overall trend in the growth rate of capital stock has continued to fall over the past 30 years. Their submission to the government states that investment in Australia accounted for around 26 per cent of gross domestic product in the 1960s but that by 1995-96 this rate had dropped to approximately 21 per cent. The Allen group suggested that this was largely because of a drop in public sector investment in infrastructure, which has halved to four per cent over the past three decades. This position was echoed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which recently found that Australia's capital productivity has fallen below the OECD mean by as much as 10 per cent. At the same time, however, private sector investment in infrastructure has been on the incline, and its share now accounts for 20 per cent of total infrastructure investment. Despite the fact that the lead time between construction and profitable operation is typically a lengthy one, the private sector has continued to channel resources into the development of infrastructure. Furthermore, despite substantial losses that have to be borne by stand-alone companies during this lead time without them being able to claim a tax deduction, there has not been a drop, nor even a plateau, in private sector infrastructure investment. This was at least in part because of the concept of the former government's infrastructure borrowings scheme. It is widely accepted by economists that nation's rate of investment impacts signifilosses cantly on how quickly an economy can grow. The Allen group summed this up very sucproportion cinctly by saying: Without much doubt, the decline (in infrastructure investment) has led to a decline in Australia's sustainable rate of economic growth. The fact that Australia has seen a consistent decline in public funded infrastructure during the past 30 years should be of real concern all Australians. In a 1993 report entitled Land transport infrastructure: maximising the contribution to economic growth, the importance of land transport infrastructure was emphasised. report found: Road investments ... have a permanent, positive effect on real gross domestic product, investment, consumption and exports. Also, if the balancing of the books continues to be this government's priority in the short term-and there is some argument in favour ing of that-then the onus for infrastructure Australia. expenditure will fall squarely on the shoulders of private investors. The March 1997 submission to the government on infrastructure borrowings from the Australian Constructors Association read in part: Provided the returns to the private sector are commensurate with the risks they take, this is all sound policy. It goes on: However, for this new regime to operate effectively, the taxation system must not contain impediments to private investment, or distort the incentives to undertake some types of investment rather than others. Mr Clive Meller, a tax director at Coopers and Lybrand, recently observed that the removal of the previous infrastructure borrowings program will make it harder and more expensive for indigenous Australian companies to compete with their overseas rivals. Mr Meller noted that this is because construction of high capital value projects often involves a joint venture. Under Australian law, there is the requirement for 100 per cent ownership as a prerequisite to the transfer of any losses to the original companies. In contrast, many foreign companies benefit a from tax laws which allow the joint venture on depreciation or borrowings to be 'absorbed by the contributing companies into their equity interest', and that seems eminently fair. Mr Meller suggests that this contrast in tax law means that investment in infrastructure in Australia would be limited to those few companies with 'extremely deep pockets as well as lots of patience'. The Australian Council for Infrastructure to Development or AUSCID supported this argument and said that the previous infrastructure bonds scheme offset some of these disincentives in the tax system. It was for this reason that AUSCID recommended a replaceThe ment program based on a voucher system, on the grounds that it would 'redress these disincentives in the most accurate and targeted manner' . While it is true that infrastructure borrowings have been used by some high income earners to minimise their tax obligations, it is equally true that the original scheme was largely responsible for stimulatprivate sector infrastructure expenditure in The Allen report identified two arguments for the continued special treatment of investments in infrastructure. The first substantiates a point made earlier, and that is: There is a disincentive for the private sector to invest in infrastructure because of the long lead times and therefore the long periods that private investors must wait until deductible expenses may be claimed against income flows. The second argument is that the report found that large investments tend only to be made by consortia of companies which cannot claim tax expenses against income from other sources. On the whole, industry has been less concerned about the axing of the infrastructure borrowings program than with ensuring that an effective, highly targeted replacement program is introduced. Both the Allen Consulting Group and AUSCID were very specific on this point in their submissions to the Treasurer earlier this year. AUSCID recommended as a matter of priority that the coalition 'urgently enacts measures to introduce an effective incentive to encourage genuine private sector investment in public infrastructure' . The Treasurer was right to support the continuation of the infrastructure borrowings program in his earlier budget. However, the nature of the replacement scheme will mean that only land transport projects will be eligible for exemption in future. Some analysts have argued that this will all but close off the scheme, because most tollways and other projects which would have qualified under the new scheme had already been certitied under the old program. AUSCID was also adamant that the government should consult with industry groups to determine the most effective replacement scheme. Several commentators have criticised the lack of consultation between the government and industry groups prior to the Treasurer's announcement on 14 February 1997 which foreshadowed the demise of infrastructure borrowings. The Australian Financial Review quoted one expert as saying: This decision (to axe the infrastructure borrowings scheme) was made without any consultation with industry . . . as well as throwing the investment community here into disarray, it sends a very confused signal to investors offshore, who provide vital capital to strengthen and infrastructure. This is yet another instance of the coalition failing to convert the rhetoric of opposition into action in government. The globalisation of finance is one factor that has facilitated the increase in private sector infrastructure investment during recent decades. Foreign investment is crucial to the maintenance of infrastructure in Australia because of the limited pool of domestic Australian funds. The former Labor government's much touted pooled developments fund-the PDF initiative-proved to be an unqualified failure. It failed because it did not compensate investors for the additional risk and lack of liquidity associated with investing in the small business sector. The original infrastructure borrowings scheme, while more successful than the PDFs, was neither capped nor appropriately targeted and was abused by a handful of high marginal taxpayers. It was essential that the coalition should introduce an effective replacement program for infrastructure bonds in a timely fashion to prevent the withdrawal of important foreign capital from domestic infrastructure projects. This was noted in the editorial of the Australian Financial Review on 26 September 1996. The editor wrote: To pretend that Australia can establish itself as an important finance centre without bidding for business is both naive and complacent. By failing to confront this reality Australia has let an important opportunity slip past largely by default. The combination of limited domestic funds and the disincentives that are inherent in our tax system left no room for doubt that, without a worthy replacement for the IE scheme, Australia would have been less competitive in the global marketplace as a result of the Treasurer's announcement on 14 February. The submission from the Australian Constructors Association concluded that it was not the infrastructure bonds per se that promoted business investment in infrastructure, but rather: ... a recognition by government that there was a significant problem in the tax system which, left unaltered, would have severely hampered the development of privately provided infrastructure in maintain its stock of Australia. They argued convincingly for the need to have an incentive measure that is stable, certain and which facilitates the mobilisation of investment funds through capital markets. The Treasurer has indicated that the marked increase in the number of applications for infrastructure borrowings in the weeks preceding the last budget was proof of abuse of the former scheme. This is exactly the same argument pursued by the government before it savaged the 150 per cent R&D concession last August. What the Treasurer failed to recognise then, and what he fails to acknowledge now, is that industry responded in this manner because of the lack of certainty about the future of both the R&D and infrastructure borrowings schemes. AUSCID argued that the replacement scheme: ... must have advance certainty and qualification, (because) it is at the investment decision stage that certainty of the benefits is most critical and most effective. A lack of certainty and longevity has also plagued the R&D incentive scheme since its inception. I said during the debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996 that the challenge before the government today is how to maximise interest amongst the investment community and so increase their long-term commitment to funding research and development in Australia. This is equally true of the efforts the government must make to entice business investment in infrastructure. The narrow selection criteria for the new infrastructure borrowings scheme is unlikely to generate anything like the levels of private infrastructure investment necessary to cement our place in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Industry had presented the coalition with several alternatives to the late infrastructure borrowings plans prior to the 1997-98 budget. Clearly, industry favoured the introduction of a voucher system to enhance business infrastructure investment. It favoured the voucher system because it would have allowed the government to control the cost of the program while supporting a large amount of infrastructure investment. The Allen Consulting Group estimated that $5.56 billion in investment would be sustained by vouchers totalling only $200 million each year-a substantial investment boost in anyone's book. Supporters of the voucher proposition also state that the time has come for the coalition to embrace some of the more important micro-economic reform proposals that will continue to ensure an increase in the level of business investment in this country. They argue that the government should not opt to promote investment through selective conferral of benefits on particular projects of particular firms. Benefits should be general in nature so that all potential investment projects in Australia stand to gain. In this way, there are no distortionary effects on economic activity, and everyone is treated fairly. However, as indicated earlier, the new infrastructure borrowings program is to be restricted to supporting only land infrastructure projects. So while organisations, including the Australian Constructors Association, are content with the concept of a tax rebate being at the centre of the new IB program, they are concerned that many legitimate and worthwhile projects will be discarded because of the new guidelines. What the government certainly lacks is a long-term plan to manage infrastructure investment in Australia. Many industry professionals have called on the coalition to establish a national infrastructure advisory council to coordinate the planning of future infrastructure, as well as collect and maintain data. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review on 27 February 1997, Ms Lynne Reeder, a senior policy analyst at the Institute of Engineers, noted that one of the consequences of the decline in public funded infrastructure and the simultaneous rise in business investment has been a loss of recorded technical data. She said that a large body of maintenance information, statistics, operating data and technical expertise was automatically built up and housed in public departments before the decline in government funded infrastructure. She suggested that such formerly comprehensive records are no longer being maintained or are not able to be accessed by public bodies. Ms Reeder believes that this is having a significant negative impact on the maintenance of existing infrastructure, as well as preventing effective long-term planning and decision making.

13,Mr HATTON,LACKS VISION,"In rising to speak in relation to this Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997, I follow the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), and as usual in this place, he has given a considered speech. The most important part of that speech was the fact that he outlined that this coalition government has no long-term plan in relation to infrastructure borrowings and infrastructure expenditure. I might contrast that understanding of infrastructure borrowings and its needs with a speech earlier today in this place by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The honourable member argued that the two key things the coalition government needed to do were to reduce debt and to increase jobs. In arguing that general proposition he said that capital expenditure had gone down under Labor and he outlined an argument, one that had been put previously by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), that in regard to the infrastructure borrowings operating under Labor those programs had been rorts. Because they had been rorts, they had to be done away with and replaced with this amendment bill. He indicated that with $37.5 million of tax rebates this year and $75 million next year it was expected that $2 billion worth of infrastructure spending would be generated. Two billion dollars is a lot of infrastructure spending. This bill replaces Labor's previous measures. There were $21 billion worth of projects on offer under those borrowing programs. The Treasurer, and with him the member for Mitchell, have argued that those programs were primarily rorts. They were not, and they would have provided more than 10 times the amount of infrastructure spending that is on offer from this myopic coalition government. Their core problem in relation to infrastructure spending is that they do not understand, firstly, what infrastructure spending is; secondly, its central importance in the economy as a whole; and, thirdly, the fact that the Commonwealth government of Australia has responsibilities and duties and a central place in terms of pushing forward the infrastructure needs of this nation. So scrap the Labor program that had been in place to provide increased investment expenditure from the private sector in infrastructure programs; completely misrepresent and distort what had been done under great Labor programs in the past such as One Nation, Working Nation and Building Better Cities; and provide a political response allied to much diminished government involvement. If you look at what the coalition is proposing in this bill, it is proposing minor assistance to infrastructure spending in this nation, less than one-tenth of what was on offer under Labor, and that one-tenth in relation to this borrowings bill was apart from the great programs that had been cemented into place and had actual definable, quantifiable, real outcomes in terms of boosting jobs, both in the short and medium term, and in providing for a better infrastructure for this nation. Australia has a number of natural competitive advantages. We have a reliable electricity system, clean water, abundant raw materials and an educated work force. Allied to that, we have a good road and rail network and good seaports. But one thing that was clear to the Labor government was that these needed to be upgraded. If you did not put the money into re-investing in your infrastructure, if you let those degrade, if you did not look at new and better ways to join the ports, the roads and the rails, then you would not be able to get your product to market efficiently either within Australia or overseas. The One Nation program was a core and fundamental attempt to bring, finally, this disparate nation of six separate states with outmoded infrastructure, fragmented and disconnected, together into one truly connected nation where through rail and road transport we could get product from one side of Australia to the other quickly and efficiently. Infrastructure and spending on infrastructure is in fact the binding agent that can really bring Australia together as one entity, one real nation. It is the backbone, sinews and muscles of that national body. That clearly is not understood by the member for Mitchell and this current Treasurer or, if they do understand it, they regard it as not very significant or not important: the problem of reducing debt is much greater than the problem of building infrastructure. If we look at the components of infrastructure and the key role that it plays in any economy, we can argue that it has four central elements. The first of those is that infrastructure is an element of economic growth. Secondly, it plays an important role in achieving social equity in a country. Thirdly, it is important for governing and managing the environment and, fourthly, it is important in terms of the country's competitive position in relation to the rest of the world. Part of the new growth theory states that when a country's level of investment drops, particularly in infrastructure, then so too does its economic growth. Perhaps this is intuitively understood: to achieve any growth you must have an infrastructure in place. There is no use building the best planes in the world unless you have airports to fly them from. However, this fundamental linkage between investment and job creation and growth does not seem to be well understood by this coalition government. I do not think they also understand that one of the key critical elements in infrastructure planning and development is the whole place of location and building nodes around which infrastructure can develop an economic output. Nodes of industry appear or areas of competitive advantage appear, and you can either choose to develop those or you can let them waste away. You can choose to leave it to the free market. You can choose to say that private investors and private companies will know where they want to invest, where they want to build infrastructure and all will be well. Alternatively, you can take the position that Labor took during its time in government. It understood that the federal government of Australia does have a central place in infrastructure spending. That is a place of leadership and it is a place where the federal government should be actively involved. This coalition government, however, I think fails to understand that and it fails to understand it in part because its guiding ideology, expressed in this document-the National Commission of Audit report-sees very little place for infrastructure spending and sees very little place for the Commonwealth government except in a benchmarking and priori tising role. Indeed, at page 200 of that report they state this: The Commonwealth's role in relation to national infrastructure (beyond its GBEs) includes: direct investments or expenditures such as defence and public broadcasting. On that first point, they actually recommend direci expenditures for defence. I have been a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for almost 11 months. In the last year of the Labor government-the year prior to my coming into this parliament-there were 46 references to the public works committee. There have been very few references in the last 11 months. Those references have primarily been for building defence infrastructure and renovating our defence capability. Almost all the trips taken by members of the Public Works Committee to new defence facilities in Western Australia, Darwin and Queensland have been directed towards building infrastructure, because the defence of this Commonwealth needs and requires refreshment and reinvigoration of basic defence foundations. The rest of the public works that the committee used to investigate have disappeared into the ether. Those public works have disappeared into the ether because the coalition government does not believe in direct service provision by the Commonwealth government. It does not believe that government should be directly involved in building the infrastructure of Commonwealth government departments. It does not believe in that because, essentially, it wants to get out of the game, except for infrastructure building in the defence area. The National Commission of Audit also says that there should be incentives for improvements in efficiency of state infrastructure; development in conjunction with the states of a regulatory framework for improving access to any infrastructure; grants to the states for education, health and roads; and, particularly relevant to the bill before us today, taxation incentives such as infrastructure bonds to encourage private sector financing for a number of areas of infrastructure. However, beyond that it recommends virtually no role for the Commonwealth government of Australia. The philosophy underlying this National Commission of Audit and the philosophy underpinning and underlying the first two budgets of this coalition government is that the role of the Commonwealth government of Australia as a central player in infrastructure and as a central player in the development of this country should eventually disappear. The coalition government does not understand that areas of this country become the focus for competition and take advantage of particular infrastructure capabilities and, further, that those nodes compete in a global marketplace. The world is organised around key nodes of infrastructure and these nodes are interconnected. Air travel and shipping are two examples of this. The reality is that we are integrated into a global economy. We need to think strategically so that we are not driven into economic subservience because we do not make the infrastructure commitments that we should. One of the most expensive key areas in terms of developing ourselves economically is the willingness to put money into infrastructure. It is interesting to make a comparison with what has happened in other places in the world. The Japanese, finally-and certainly not before time-have recognised that they need massive infrastructure spending in Japan. They cannot continue to buy up properties overseas and build businesses overseas, when the dramatically depleted infrastructure of Japan needs money spent on it. In fact, last year they spent $270 billion on it: a national government spending national moneys on the infrastructure of its country. A comparison can also be made with the French who, lacking any real idea of the importance of putting their money into infrastructure, spent more on dog food than on the total budget of the city of Paris. The National Commission of Audit said that there should be a great deal of microeconomic reform in a series of areas, but that the Commonwealth government had very little role to play in that. What it fundamentally misunderstands is that this federal government does have a role to play in national infrastructure. That role is directly connected to creating jobs and enhancing the economic growth of this nation. The previous Labor government fully understood that it was incumbent upon them to build one nation and to build better citiesto build a nation whose muscles, sinews, backbone and framework were tied together through the Commonwealth government of Australia spending money on good projects. I might make reference to two key programs. The first of those programs is the building better cities program, introduced by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe. I believe that in this parliament there has been no better program of great infrastructure work done where cooperation between local government bodies, the states and the Commonwealth has been better expressed than under the aegis of the better cities program. This coalition government, both before and since coming to power, pilloried the building better cities program. They therefore pilloried the work that had been done in South Australia with building better cities funds. They therefore pilloried the Advanced Technology Park at Eveleigh in Sydney-a technology park where 5,000 to 6,000 jobs will be gained over time; a technology park which will lead Australia to be at the forefront of almost every other country in the world; and a technology park which is the best located in the world. It would not, and could not, have existed and would not have been in the position, as it is now, to expand its activities, if the state government had not provided the land, and if the money to build the facility had not been provided under the building better cities program. In fact, that program at large has generated 60,000 jobs and raised an additional $3.7 billion worth of investment from the private sector and other levels of government. That program had direct measurable effects. Underpinning it was the notion that the federal government could spend money on infrastructure and that, if it did not do so, noone else would. This has been the case with a variety of projects which have been in the national interest but which the private sector would not take up because it had no interest in them. But in that program the benefits to the wider economy were significant: between $1.5 million and $4 million was gained in growth from every $1 million spent under the better cities program. There are a range of programs under the building better cities program that started the rebuilding of the infrastructure of this nation. For the first time in the history of this country under the regional development programs-so deliberately, utterly and completely axed by this government-disparate regions of Australia were directly connected to this national capital; they saw that they could cooperate, as well as compete, with other regions and saw that the federal government of Australia had a direct and continuing interest in their development. Having been able to see that under Labor, they can now also see, with the destruction of the regional development program, that this coalition government cares nought for the people of Australia and Australian regions in terms of the fundamental rebuilding of the infrastructure of this nation. I would point out that, in terms of the building better cities program, the annual report of the Department of Transport and Regional Development-still misnamed, given the fact that the government have given up the game of regional development-said: The Better Cities Program operated through 26 'area strategies' in cooperation with State and Territory Govemments. The cooperative approach allowed a number of urban management problems to be addressed and resolved more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise have been the case. The Better Cities approach aroused able international interest in the OECD and similar forums. It did not arouse the interest of this coalition government because they canned it. They saw it, and had no interest in it. They typified it and misrepresented it as simply a 'poor Labor program'. But it had entirely observable and beneficial effects. Probably no one program introduced by the former Labor government has been more pilloried than the One Nation program. This government does not have the insight, the sense or the courtesy to recognise the fact that this program really did address the infrastructure needs of this country. In the very first line of the speech made in relation to infrastructure, the former Prime Minister said: A fundamental determinant of Australia's international competitiveness is an efficient infrastructure base. That efficient infrastructure base found its firm expression in the attempt to build a rail link from one side of this country to the other, so that we could take our people and produce efficiently from one side to the other.

15,Mr ANDERSON,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Effectively, these amendments are as discussed in this place the other day. They are described as schedule B amendments from the Senate and are acceptable to the government. They are: firstly, in order that there be clarification that agreements for reserve funding can be entered jointly as well as separately by both the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for the Environment; secondly, in order to establish the Natural Heritage Advisory Committee; thirdly, to change of the name of the board to the Natural Heritage Board; and, fourthly, to make revisions to the preamble.",62
16,Mr KERR,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"This bill, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996, returns for a final time to this House. I thought it was very timely that the first serious piece of press analysis of the effect of the heritage trust appeared today in the Age, with the author of that commentary piece describing the legislation as a 'pea and t-imble trick'. That is a very accurate descriptIOn of the nature of the legislation. In discussing this matter when it a came back from the Senate the other evening, I made the point that, in the first two years of the life of the trust alone, the trust falls some $83 million short of the funding promised by the coalition in its Meeting our Commitments documents. It really is a betrayal of the mandate that was sought from the Australian people. When one considers the linked pledges of the last election: to sell Telstra and establish this fund, and to ensure that the revenues that were provided to the trust were on top of-additional to-the forward estimates of the previous Labor government, and then takes careful stock of what exactly has occurred since those pledges were made, what we find is a betrayal, a complete betrayal, of that electoral mandate. It is not necessary today to rehash all the points I made in debate the other evening. But I do think it is important to look at the credentials of this government as they unravel piece by piece in relation to the environment. It would be remiss of me today if I did not mention a parallel decision that was made in the Senate on the issue of disallowance of regulations which have been established for over 20 years to give the Commonwealth power to protect the environment. Those were the customs prohibited exports regulations, and they have been in existence to do two things: firstly, to ensure that Australia gets adequate prices for its resources; but, secondly, to ensure that there is a framework which enables the Commonwealth to activate its powers where Australia's vital environment interests are at stake. The removal of those Commonwealth export powers has enormous consequences for the management of Australia's environment-and that is a responsibility that the Australian government has now seen fit to abolish. The Commonwealth's control over the export of mineral sand products enabled a previous Liberal coalition government to ban sandmining developments on Fraser Island in Queensland. Under the framework that this government has now adopted, a future coalition Liberal government faced with the same issue, with the same kind of environmental consequences, would be powerless to intervene to protect the environment from such destruction. I think it is as well to reflect on that. The minister now charged with the responsibility for administering these areas of policy is the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer. In the debate when Labor was able to forestall the removal of such regulations on the last occasion, he said, in relation to Fraser Island, that the use of export control powers by the previous Fraser Liberal government to protect that important area-which has now been protected as a world heritage property-was 'an abuse of power'. From a government whose ministers say that the protection of Fraser Island was an abuse of power, one gets the sense of the real priority that this government places on protection of the environment. It also gives some framework to reflect on the way in which the sting has been put in, the con has been perpetrated on the Australian public, with the establishment of a trust which was intended to be supplemental to forward estimates but which has been massively underfunded. The forward estimates that the previous government had put in place provided a framework for significant environmental protection. But what we have seen are clawbacks. Whole ranges of programs which would have been funded under normal recurrent budget arrangements have now been substituted-(Time expired)",62
17,Mr ANDREN,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"I will take only a few minutes of the House's time to make a few comments on this, as I missed the opportunity to do so the other night. I believe that this particular trust, and the legislation that goes with it, is the greatest piece of political environmental trickery that has ever been imposed on an Australian electorate. I said last year in debate on this bill when it was first in this House that $1.1 billion, as it now is, is basically 1.1 billion trees. We are already out there supposedly planting one billion trees, and that program has been chopped short. And barely on the horizon can we see the impact that that planting has made in reversing the huge environmental problems we have. I said then that this trust will go no way towards making any real impact on the 2001 Murray-Darling program; it is really a 2101 project that we should be looking at. We should have made provision for funding for the environmental program of this country that took account of that very fact. And there was always the way it has gone now, of course, of quarantining part of the profits and part of the returns from Telstra, and preserving 23,000 jobs whilst so doing, and funding the environment on an ongoing basis through those means. I would like to again incorporate into Hansard some comments I made back in December on this bill. The Chain Reaction magazine of the Scitech organisation stated: The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a 'blatant and cynical political fraud', a senior Government adviser has admitted to Scitech. He said the policy-the Coalition's claimed answer to rectifying Australia's enormous environmental problems-was 'invented overnight' as a means of attempting to soften potential public reaction against the planned sale of one-third of Telstra. The plan had been essentially devised-as a 'purely political exercise' - by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been 'imposed' on the former shadow Minister ... Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, on ... Senator Robert Hill . . . The adviser said Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy and admitted to the fact that it could not possibly-in its current form or size-make any serious impact on the nation's massive problems of land degradation, ailing rivers, and loss of biodiversity. As an interjection from one member of the House at the time said: that says it all. We are giving with one hand and taking with the other, as was mentioned in relation to this. I notice the financial estimated outlays from the budget this year include savings of $5 million from the landcare program to contribute to the government's fiscal target. This will be achieved by reduced capital works, particularly on infrastructure and sewage treatment projects. Only this week I received a letter from a council in my area saying, 'Where is this support that was once available for sewerage projects in country towns, where the federal government provided a third of the capital funding?, Where is it? A couple of villages in my electorate have serious sewerage problems. They happen to be in the catchment of the Lachlan and the Macquarie system. Are we really serious about the Murray-Darling Basin clean up when we set aside what I believe is a very paltry fund to look at our environmental programs? I oppose this method of funding the environment. I will certainly give it every support out there because it has been passed, but I fear-in fact, I am sure-we will be no better off. How do we fund it meaningfully? Do we sell off more at the end of this program? What then? We have lost 20,000 jobs in a publicly owned institution that was providing us with cutting-edge technology, jobs and expertise. That asset has gone. Do we sell more of our silverware down the track to cope with our environmental problem? The environmental movement is just catching up with the ramifications of this piece of legislation. It is a pity it did not scream earlier during the election campaign, because it is a fraud. The public out there did not want to get rid of Telstra, particularly in the bush. Why did you not have a referendum out there to see? They did not and they still do not want to get rid of it. They have grave doubts about it. They do not believe that this trust will go any way towards scratching the surface, let alone beginning to solve our environmental problems.",63
18,Mr KERR,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"I am delighted with the remarks by the member for Calare (Mr Andren). He accurately reflects the reality of the nature of this trust. Certainly, it is true that those environmentalists who took a walk in the wilderness with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) before this trust was put in place lent their credibility to that process-wrongly-but I suspect none of them would have realised the magnitude of the deception that was about to be played on them. They were wrong to give credibility to what would have been an inadequate process in the first place. Since that process, this government has been falling significantly short of its pre-election commitments: acting deceitfully in the Senate; proposing to extend the life of the trust from five to six years without funding; and withdrawing effectively $42 million per annum from the effective value of the trust. All those elements, together with the reduction of programs in primary industry and a whole range of training and related programs, mean that effectively the resources coming collectively towards the protection of the environment and sustainable development have been reduced rather than enhanced as a result of this government's actions. I commend to all members of this House the article in the Age by Ken Davidson this morning. It brings together the criticisms that are emerging which we have been making in opposition, which the member for Calare has been making and which the environment movement now, through the board of the ACF, has endorsed. I suspect that anybody who had any residual doubts about the credibility of this government would have had them confirmed now, and with these decisions that would render powerless a future coalition government to protect an area like Fraser Island. This coalition risks taking environmental protection back to the 1960s. Rules that have been put in place for over 20 years and that have been the trigger for the Commonwealth for making environmental assessments for mining activities have been tom up. What faith can you have in a government whose minister has been consistently overridden on every occasion when he has had any contest with any of his ministerial colleagues? The government rejected the suggestion that Senator Hill, as the Minister for the Environment, be made chair of the board that was supervising this trust. There has not been one time since he has been the Minister for the Environment where he has actually had a victory for the environment. He is continually being rolled. Senator Parer rolled him on the issue of mining exploration in forest reserves. Mr Anderson, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, rolled him on the quantity of land to be allocated to dedicated forest reserves in the East Gippsland regional forest agreement. The Prime Minister has a tendency to pre-empt the minister's decision. whether it be on the Port Hinchinbrook development or the decision to relocate the Coo de Island chemical storage facility to the Point Lillias Ramsar listed wetlands. This is a record of environmental ineptitude: a weak minister and a process that has fundamentally betrayed the election mandate that this government claimed. It is a deceitful government which showed its deceit most markedly when it went into the Senate on the day the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was about to stand up and announce the budget would be extending the life of the trust with no additional funding-so the effective value of the trust was going to be reduced-and put forward amendments in the Senate without disclosing their nature; it put them forward as technical amendments going to the interest rate that the fund would earn. It deceitfully sought to get those amendments through the parliament without the parliament's attention being drawn to their effect. This is a government whose actions are clouded with deceit and betrayal, whose environmental credibility has gone down point by point by point, which is leading us back to a situation where protection of the environment has the same priority that it received in the 1960s when we did not have available the necessary mechanisms to protect the environment, and whose credibility is now standing at point zero with the Australian community.",64
19,Mr ANDERSON,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,I will confine myself to a few very brief remarks because it really is time we wrapped this up. Those brief remarks will simply be to the effect that plainly what we have just heard and what we heard the other night is the carping of a group of people who now have to justify their resistance to what was quite obviously a more substantial packet than anything our opponents had proposed in terms of the forward estimates-which is an item that Mr Kenneth Davidson from the Age might like to take on board-or had indicated during the election campaign that they intended to spend on their initiatives.,65
20,Mr KERR,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,He's got you stitched up.,65
21,Mr ANDERSON,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"He has not stitched us up, but you have sought to seriously misrepresent the situation as you know it to be. There are a couple of other points that I would seek to make. One is in relation to the claims of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) about the sale of Telstra and the attitude towards it in rural Australia. I remind him that the National Farmers Federation made it quite plain that they believed that the policy we adopted in relation to Telstra amounted to very sound economic policy as well as sound environmental policy, as well they might. There are a couple of other points worth making. If you look at one program, the national landcare program, whilst it was to phase down very considerably in terms of the forward estimates that were made available by the previous government, there was a very substantial drop off. There is a record amount of funding for that this year-$87-odd million. I mention one other point in relation to sewerage works in the Murray-Darling Basin-just to pull apart one argument and to illustrate that what we have had put before us is a pack of cards. Not only has a great deal of sewerage works in the Murray-Darling Basin been undertaken under the national landcare program but programming and funding for such works are still available under the Natural Heritage Trust. I conclude my remarks by pointing out that the people opposite are very welcome to go out and run these lines through the recipients of the grants which will help them really involve themselves in community action, in environmental works, in efforts related to sustainable production and sustainable use of our agricultural lands. They will be laughed out of court for the bitterness and the negativity of their approach when compared with the approaches that they have put forward and money that they intended to spend as reflected in the outlays and as reflected in their campaign promises, which, incidentally, were never funded. No-one has ever told us where the money was going to come from. That really reflects very poorly upon an opposition not prepared to take advantage of something that plainly is very much in the interests of the Australian environment and sustainable agriculture.",65
22,Mr KERR,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"I was compelled to respond to the self-advertised endorsement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) by the National Farmers Federation. It may be that the minister has lost touch with his constituency of late because yesterday the National Farmers Federation issued a press release about the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. It was not expressing glowing support for that fund; it said that the future of that fund is up in the air. The ACF, the other body which speaks for the two constituencies most directly concerned with the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, has basically come out and said it is a pea and thimble trick-the language that was adopted by Kenneth Davidson in the Age. The only people standing up and saying that this fund is anything other than a deceitful slush fund established for cynical electoral purposes, a betrayal of the election commitments given by the coalition pre-election, are coalition ministers themselves. The only people who stand in the Australian community speaking well of this trust no.w a.re. the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his millIOns. It is not difficult to get a self-admiring audience from your own backbench, but if you do not speak honestly to the Australian public, it is hardly surprising that the constituencies that are going to be angered by that process get involved in that debate and start to remind the Australian community of the breach of promises that you have made. If you go back to 'Meeting our commitments' the document that was issued by the now T-easurer (Mr Costello) before the last election, there was a year-by-year expression of the funds that will be delivered through the Natural Heritage Trust. In the first two years alone, the difference between the promise and the actual commitment is $83 million. It is $83 million short between the promise and the commitment. It is hardly surprising in those terms that the National Farmers Federation and the ACF are unlikely bedfellows in criticising the government for its electoral betrayal. I find more than a little amusing the selfdeception that this government is capable of-a government that today, this very day, swept aside the regulations that enabled a previous Liberal coalition gove-ment to step into protect Fraser Island, which we now recognise as a jewel in Australia's natu.ral heritage. We no longer as an Australian government, as an Australian parliament, have that power. We have swept away the very power necessary to protect those most important natural heritage values of our country. Self-admiration carries very little weight with the Australian community. Piece by piece-the mess that this government has made with the environment, its betrayal and its walking away-the jigsaw puzzle is being put together. If you believe that the article by Kenneth Davidson today is the end of the story, just you wait as all those Australians who are expecting you to meet your election commitments realise the depth of the hypocrisy and betrayal that has been perpetrated on the Australian public. Question resolved in the affirmative.",65
23,Mr SPEAKER,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101 A. NA Mining",66
24,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday you told the House that investment in mining in this country had been brought 'virtually to a halt'. Is it not a fact that capital expenditure in mining is up 13 per cent to nearly $7 billion since 1992, mining exploration expenditure is up nine per cent to nearly $2 billion since 1992, and ABARE forecasts new capital expenditure in mining up 25 per cent to over $9 billion this financial year? Prime Minister, why won't you stop misleading the Australian public?",66
25,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I sought to make in the answer I gave yesterday was that the Native Title Act has had a very negative effect on mining investment in Australia, and I stand by that. If you want any evidence, I suggest that the member for Perth have a look around his own state, consult not only the government of Western Austra-is but also t-e opposition in Western Aust-aha, and he. will have an idea of the negative effect of the Native Title Act in its present form on investment in Australia.",66
26,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. The Prime Minister referred to my own state of Western Australia and the mining industry there.

30,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister advise the House what steps the government is taking to meet its election commitments on Sydney airport to maximise flights over water and non-residential areas and to more equitably distribute the burden of aircraft noise?,67
31,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Oh!,67
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Denison, constrain yourself.",67
33,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. He has done a tremendous amount over the last 12 months to try to solve this problem aircraft noise left to us by the former Labor government. The honourable member for Lowe has also worked very vigorously in this area not only for his own electorate but for people outside it in places like Summer Hill. The honourable member for Bradfield, the honourable member for Cook, the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Mitchell have also all worked very hard. I cannot forget to mention the honourable member for Bennelong, who has also worked very vigorously in this area to ensure the concerns of people in Sydney are satisfied regarding aircraft noise. I think anybody who has an interest in what is going on in Sydney would recognise that the former Labor government left a disastrous mess from its mismanagement of the aircraft noise issue in Sydney. We went to the last election with a commitment to accurately share the noise across Sydney, to put a majority of aircraft movements over water and, where aircraft movements had to be over land, that they would be over non-residential areas as far as practicable. We also said that we would take into account the fullest public consultation process possible. As a result of that, I am very pleased to announce to the House today that the government has finalised its long-term operating plan for Mascot airport. As a result of that, our publicly stated policy commitments of an equitable sharing of the noise and a majority of aircraft movements over water will be achieved. Seventeen per cent of aircraft movements will be to the north, down from some 50 per cent under Labor; 15 per cent of aircraft movements to the west; 13 per cent of aircraft movements to the east; and 55 per cent of all aircraft movements will be to the south over water. In addition to that, there will be a rotation of runway operations to ensure that in the course of the day people will get genuine relief from aircraft noise and that in the course of a week they will also get genuine relief. One of the interesting things that comes from this is the fact that, under the new long term operating plan designed by this government, no houses will fall into the 40 ANEF of category. Under the former Labor government, some 150 houses fell into the 40 ANEF category. What that meant was that those houses had to be acquired and demolished. Under Labor's mismanagement of the aircraft noise problem and the management of the airport at Sydney, virtually the whole suburb of Sydenham was destroyed. The whole of Sydenham was bulldozed by the former minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Brereton, and his Labor government. Some 150 houses were identified for purchase and demolition under the former government's mismanagement of Mascot airport. Under this plan, the demolition-the bulldozing-of Sydenham would have been completely and utterly unnecessary. The $34 million that was spent bulldozing Sydenham would not have needed to be spent. That is one of the extraordinary consequences of Labor's mismanagement, and one of the things that will be drawn out as the benefit of our new long-term operating plan for Mascot airport. The real winners in this are people directly to the north of the airport-people in the Labor stronghold suburbs of Sydenham, Marrickville, Stanmore, Petersham, St Peters, Leichhardt and Drummoyne, who were unfairly treated by Labor in government and who are being treated fairly by the coalition in government. The one thing that I find so extraordinary about all this is that all of these measures that are now adopted in the long term operating plan for Sydney were available to the Labor government. They chose not to take it up. As a result, they created a disaster for Sydney. They unfairly treated people in Sydney and that led to the demolition of a whole suburb. Minister for Transport and Regional Development",67
34,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Minister, is it not a fact that the Sydney airport 1800 number you used is reserved for pilots lodging flight plan details prior to take-off, whereas the correct procedure for seeking landing time information at Sydney airport is to call on radio frequency 135.1 megahertz? Is it not a fact that such a radio broadcast can be heard by other pilots whereas the 1800 number cannot? Minister, did you not use the phone because you knew you were doing the wrong thing in attempting to jump the queue and you did not want other pilots to hear you? Minister, why did you not faithfully and bravely tell the truth in this House on Monday?",68
35,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister was saying during the week that the honourable member for Melbourne has brought a certain level of intellectual rigour to the industry policy debate. I say to him that he has introduced a certain element of rigor mortis into the transport policy debate. On this particular matter, the honourable member for Melbourne is referring to a NOTAM, a notice to airmen. Indeed there are two NOTAMs. He chooses to refer to one, which says that information that is required in order to ascertain a landing time at Mascot airport can be acquired through speaking on frequency 135.1. A second NOTAM says that you can acquire the same information on the 1800 freecall number. The NOTAM that the honourable member for Melbourne refers to does not state that you can only acquire that information on 135.1. The second NOTAM says you can acquire the same information on the 1800 free call number. It has been interesting to note the enormous hypocrisy in this debate. Mr Brereton interjecting",68
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kingsford-Smith will go down in flames too if he is not careful.,68
37,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been criticised for using a mobile phone in this circumstance. I note that in the Senate on Monday in debate on this same subject, Senator Collins said: . .. I am not suggesting you cannotthat is, you cannot use a mobile phoneI have done it myself on light aircraft, not on jets. This is indeed not a unique experience. The whole purpose of this is to support the campaign by these disaffected Airservices Australia employees who want to bring back parallel runway operations at Mascot airport which would undo all the good that has been done by the announcements by the government today.",68
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I detect a growing air of disorder in the House today. I now issue a general warning that I reserve the right to take unilateral action. Public Service: Agency Bargaining,68
39,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen a report in today's Canberra Times that the Community and Public Sector Union has reversed its opposition to agency level industrial agreements in the Australian Public Service? What is the significance of this decision?,68
40,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. A key element of our reforms in the Public Service has been to abandon the service wide approach adopted by our predecessors and adopt an agency approach to the industrial arrangements within the APS. In pursuit of its claim, the CPSU has been attempting to run an industrial action campaign against the government, although, I would have to say, with very little support from their membership and certainly at a time when they have been losing members. I think one reason people have been leaving the union is that they have been unhappy with the industrial action mentality of the CPSU. At the same time, our approach has certainly been to talk with the CPSU but also to talk with the rank and file employees within the APS. We have been doing that, for example, at agency level with the service delivery agency. I have been doing it myself, having had 15 to 20 hours of group discussions with APS employees about the way in which we should structure these negotiations. There is no doubt, from the discussions I have had with rank and file employees in the APS, that they welcome the idea of having an agency approach because it gives them a chance to have a say. It gives them a chance to have more flexible arrangements. That can mean that the agency can do a better job and they can have terms and conditions of employment which better suit them. I am very pleased to be able to say to the House that it has been reported widely today that Wendy Caird, on behalf of the CPSU, has said: If the best chance of achieving a good deal for our members is through agency agreements, then that is what we will do ... That is a welcome change because there is no doubt that it is in the best interests of her members to adopt the approach that the government announced back in March. I think the other interesting development now will be to see the reaction that we get from the opposition. They have, as is usual in industrial relations policy, basically been mouthing the directions nominated by the CPSU and the ACTU. Of course, they themselves in government toyed with the idea of an agency approach, but fell into line with the CPSU with a service wide approach knowing in fact that it was not in the best interests of their members. Gary Johns was on the record at one stage as saying: A key management responsibility is to develop, with their staff, a culture within their own agencies where all are committed to clear objectives and outcomes. The development of agency bargains can help to focus on this and provide a framework which builds on the broader program budgeting and accountability framework. It is a step in the right direction. I am not under any misunderstanding about the difficulty and complexity of some of the issues ahead of us, but at least this is a big step in the right direction which will ultimately mean a better deal for public servants and a better deal in terms of the efficient operation of the APS. NA",68
41,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the next questioner I would like, in an unconventional sense, to draw members' attention to a very brave young lady from New South WalesMs Hayley Tull who represents the face of the NBN Children's Cancer Institute of New South Wales. I extend to you, Hayley, a very warm welcome to the parliament. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Unfair Dismissals",69
42,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the actual case of a worker in a small construction company in New South Wales who brought his family down from the country to take a job. Nine months into the job he was dismissed after being told that business was bad, and he was redundant. The worker later discovered that he had been lied to and that he had actually been replaced with a younger worker at lower wage. The court found that the employee had been unfairly dismissed. Why do you say that such a worker should not have a right of appeal?",69
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The remarks that I have made about unfair dismissal laws are based upon a view that the total impact of the existing law, even in its reformed state, is to act as a disincentive on aggregate employment. I would have thought that in its reformed state it is vastly better now than what it was, although in states like New South Wales you still have stubborn, out-of-date views on industrial relations prevailing at a state government level. It is the responsibility of a government to look at the aggregate impact, and that is what we are doing. That is why we believe that changing the law would increase the employment opportunities of more Australians. It is a view that has been endorsed by the only successful Labor leader in Australia at the present time, and that is the New South Wales Premier. It was a view that was acknowledged by the former Prime Minister in the dying days of the election campaign, and it is a view that is attested to by literally thousands of men and women in small business all around Australia. Indigenous Mental Health",69
44,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. What is the government doing to provide opportunities for broader community and corporate involvement in improving indigenous mental health in partnership with Aboriginal Australians?,70
45,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and for his interest in this matter. Last October I announced an action plan which allocated roughly $20 million over four years to develop regional mental health services, provide trauma and grief counselling, improve training of Aboriginal health workers and develop linkages with mainstream services. In developing this program we built on the recommendations of the Ways Forward report, which had been compiled by Professor Beverley Raphael and Sister Pat Swan, and worked closely with Aboriginal health organisations, state and territory governments and representatives of Aboriginal and Islander communities. Although government can do so much, if we are going to make substantial progress it is going to require more than just government action; it is going to require a genuine partnership across government, the community and I also believe the corporate sector. With that in mind, as part of the social and emotional well-being action plan, we provided $1 million in seed funding for a foundation to be established to assist indigenous families and youth. The foundation is to be headed by John Moriaty as Chair, a distinguished Aboriginal businessman and administrator. The board of the foundation will be composed primarily of Aboriginal and Islander people who are leaders in their field and have shown a strong personal commitment to Aboriginal and Islander youth. The corporate sector has responded with enthusiasm, and I very much welcome the involvement of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and also Vic-Health. I am delighted to be able to inform the House that over the weekend the board of BHP has agreed to make a very substantial contribution, both in cash and kind, as a major corporate sponsor of the foundation. We are extremely grateful for this very strong show of support from one of Australia's largest corporations, and I hope it will inspire a much broader range of corporate support. It signifies very strong confidence, both in a partnership approach to health and, more importantly, in the capacity of Aboriginal Australians to take a lead in addressing their own disadvantage. I congratulate BHP and I thank them very much for this involvement. Australian Taxation Office: Late Payments",70
46,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the Treasurer pass on lower interest rate savings to battlers forced to pay an interest rate of 18.5 per cent on late payments to the Australian Taxation Office?,70
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The late payments that are set are set by legislation; they are set with regard to the prevailing requirements at the time the legislation is put in place, and those rates are in some cases variable in accordance with market developments. If you say that there is a particular one that is 18Y2 per cent at the moment, we will have a look at that particular rate and see whether it should be amended in line with the particular variation. Mr MCMullan interjecting",70
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well I am sure you wouldn't know, old son. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, is that last remark consistent with the guidelines that you handed down last Monday, and are you going to enforce them or are they going to be enforced only against us?",70
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hotham. I thought that was probably the concluding remark from the Treasurer, but it is very close to digressing from the guidelines.",70
50,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I heard the Labor Party interject. Who do you think put the legislation in place and maintained it for 13 years? Or let me guess: you were going to amend it in the fifteenth year, were you? If you could only have got there for another two years. Here we have the Labor Party, led by Senator MCMullan over there-the new member for Canberra-self-righteously pontificating on tax act penalties. Is that right? At least the member for Moore has the legitimate right to ask a question.",70
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I just go to the point of relevance, Mr Speaker, and your guidelines.",71
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would encourage the Treasurer to complete his remarks.,71
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said before, I know that there are some of those penalties which are set by reference to market rates. If the member for Moore is complaining about one that is not, I personally believe that it should be, and this government-because it believes that the penalties should be fixed by reference to reasonable commercial rates-will be quite happy to have a look at it. After 13 years of Labor neglect, this government would be quite happy to have a look at it. AFC Abattoir: Workplace Agreements",71
54,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen a report in today's Courier-Mail outlining union claims that the AFC abattoir at Coominya has an Australian workplace agreement which pays less than the award and that the employer used duress? Is he aware of claims by the shadow minister that the AW A is the worse he has seen? What is the actual state of affairs? What benefits will the new agreement bring to the factory and its employees?,71
55,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have certainly seen the reports, and the comments and views of the shadow minister who says that he has seen this agreement. Usually he says that they are secret and that he has not seen them, but I will leave that to one side. In the Australian meat processing industry there is little doubt that we have seen a lack of efficiency which has undermined the opportunities this country ought to be able to provide by way of jobs and export income based on one of our great primary industries. I think the inefficiencies in the industry stem from two factors: firstly, the industrial relations arrangements and, secondly, the level of plant, and in particular the outdated plant. The management of this particular abattoir, AFC, have sought to address these problems. It is a new business. The plant is one of the most modem in the country, and now the industrial arrangements are as well. The company has invested $30 million in the plant. It currently employs 78 people. I am informed that it has expansion plans which would bring another $10 million of investment and another 200 jobs. It is a second supplier to MCDonald's, and it is looking to expand its exports to Asia. Quite frankly, those are the things we want to encourage. What is the reaction of the union puppets opposite? They run the union line that, because the company chose a new form of agreement which avoids protracted negotiations with the union and because the union was not involved, it must disadvantage the workers. Criticism of the AW A is either, to take a charitable view, a result of a lack of understanding or a result of deliberate misinterpretation. For example, the union has seized on the fact that remuneration of workers previously employed at the plant was based on the notoriously inefficient tally system. But the tally system has no application to the new agreement. The union claims that workers signed under duress, but they were all fully appraised of their rights and the terms and conditions of the AW A prior to signature. For an AWA to meet the no disadvantage test applied by the independent statutory office of the Employment Advocate, workers must be' guaranteed to receive pay and conditions no less than that stipulated by the award taken as a whole. The award is set by the Industrial Relations Commission-the independent umpire of these matters. The key point about the AW A is that, above the award floor, pay is largely determined by production. Workers have agreed to enter into a new more flexible arrangement in return for a better deal overall. The agreement is considered to provide take-home pay above the industry standard. The agreement is good for employees, it is good for employers and it is good for regional Australia. Encouraging a system which will see the growth of this industry is in the national interest. For regional Australia, in particular, it gives us the chance to see more jobs and more export income, which surely is in everybody's interests. It does say a lot about the opposition. They had 13 years of wasted opportunities and jobs lost. Now, as workers and employees get together to try to fix up the mess and to come to arrangements that give people the opportunity to get a job, what is your reaction ? Your reaction is to take the propaganda of some union official who has been left out in the cold and use it to attack one of the viable means of actually giving these people a chance of a job in the future. You deserve condemnation for it. Unfair Dismissals",71
56,Mr WILTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the actual case of a worker in a general store and garage in regional Victoria. A few weeks into his long service leave, the worker was diagnosed as having cancer. At that stage the prognosis unknown. His wife phoned the employer to tell him about her husband only to be told that the worker's employment had been terminated. Prime Minister, this worker access to the unfair dismissal provisions. has the government set out to deprive future worker in this situation of their right appeal?",72
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The proposal that the government is advocating-and it will, if disallowed in the Senate, be enveloped in a bill and put to this House, which will, if it is passed through this House, go to the Senateis designed to deal with a situation where a person has been employed for less than 12 months. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister is in serious danger of misleading the House, and I know he would not want to do that. The minister said the exact opposite: the minister said his legislation would be for all workers in all small businesses.",72
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Canberra will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,72
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The regulation was in what relation to a 12-month period. It remains intention of the government to legislate to provide relief to small business. As to the Bougainville. question of the particular case, I would be very grateful if the honourable member would give me the details of that case. I will not endeavour, on the run, to give a legal opinion on it, but it would be my understanding that the reach of the legislation which relates to unfair dismissal would not mean that conduct which is insensitive to that sort of situation could be allowed. Bougainville",72
60,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister :nform the House on the latest developments in Australian aid to Bougainville?,72
61,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I recognise that not only the honourable member but was the people of Townsville do have a particular interest in events in Papua New Guinea and specifically in the troubled province of Bougainville. The Australian government, as had I think all members of the House know, is Why deeply committed to making a constructive any contribution where possible to peace in of Bougainville. I take the opportunity today to inform the House that a joint Papua New Guinea Australian planning mission recently visited Bougainville during the course of this month to follow up on my decision to provide additional aid directly to support peace efforts on Bougainville. The mission found that there had been progress in achieving greater stability in some areas of the main island. Importantly, the mission has recommended that Australian aid can support this more peaceful environment through assistance for schools, clinics and district administration as well as training for provincial and district administration. I hope that after the elections, as honourable members will know are about to take place during the course of next month, agreement can be reached with the Papua New Guinea government and also the Bougainville transitional government for an early commencement of I think will be an extremely important the program and a program that can make a serious contribution to the peace process on In addition, significant progress is being made on existing Australian funded restoration and humanitarian activities on Bougainville. Reconstruction work in secure areas is progressing well in the health education and infrastructure sectors with major work on a new Buka hospital and the Buka airport upgrade about to start. Australia is the major donor contributing to the Red Cross program. Our support of $4 million is providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance to about 30,000 families across the main island. In conclusion, I appreciate the interest of the member for Herbert and the trouble he has gone to to ask the question. It is important understand that Australia continues to encourage all parties on Bougainville to work towards peace. Improvement in the security environment would allow implementation of restoration activities throughout the whole province to the benefit of all. Unfair Dismissals",72
62,Mr MOSSFIELD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the actual case of a mechanic working in a small country garage in my state. He was dismissed after he refused the employer's direction to approve a car he had found to be unroadworthy. Why should a worker in this situation, sacked for refusing to break the law, be denied a right of appeal?",73
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Without knowing all of the surrounding details of that case I am not going to do other than repeat the general policy reason as to why the government is proposing to change the law. The general policy reason remains a very valid one-that is, the existing unfair dismissal laws are working against employment increases in small business. That remains the situation. If the honourable member has particular cases with all of the details, not details that he just decide selectively to deliver to the House, we will be happy to look at them.",73
64,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I ask the minister: what initiatives is the government taking to improve the economic outlook for wool growers? Can the minister inform the House of any market developments that could enhance this outlook?,73
65,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday in this place I introduced the Wool International Amendment Bill. It represents a momentous occasion described by the ABC today as 'landmark legislation'. Indeed, it is with very genuine delight that I can record in here today some very welcome and very substantial good news for this nation's very hard-pressed wool growers. The bill will ""see the return of millions of to dollars to wool growers out of Wool International. As the member for Hotham, who has a certain interest in this matter, will recall, back in 1993 we assumed there would be no money to return. In fact, we were still worried about a shortfall. Now we know there will be very substantial sums of money made available to growers again. Secondly, the legislation sets up a process for winding down and then eliminating Wool International. Wool International will go when it has completed its unenviable task of disposing the stockpile. That is enormously welcomed by wool growers the length and breadth of the nation for everything that that represents. It will also provide a range of other services to growers such as financial options so they can make the most of their entitlements-as I say, a significant milestone in the industry's history. While all of this is happening, I know members would be genuinely delighted to know that after six years of losses and in a circumstance where nine out of 10 of the nation's wool growers are still losing money the markets are showing real signs of improving and may very well break the 700c barrier today. Exports of wool are up a whacking 19 may per cent for the nine months ending March 1997. Total exports to China and Hong Kong are up around 30 per cent on last season; Italy up 19 per cent; Taiwan up 23 per cent; India Wool up 26 per cent, and the list goes on. There has been a great deal of hard work put into this by many members of the government-the foreign minister, but the Minister for Trade particularly comes to find. We have seen very substantial reductions in tariffs on the part of the Indians. We are now seeing exports to Mexico, the value adding of Australian product re-exported into America without tariffs at all, and we are seeing other improvements particularly arising out of our meetings with the Chinese Vice Premier over the last few days. Mr Costello--How's the price?",73
66,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The price is up very substantially. There is a long way to go before we are back to the heady days of the late eighties but this is very welcome and a major relief. This major Australian industry is on the way back, taking control of its own improved destiny-not under Labor policies but increasingly aided by and not interfered with by the government. Unfair Dismissals",74
67,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the case of an employee working in a motel in regional New South Wales. The employee was dismissed after she advised the tax office that she was being paid in cash and that tax was not being deducted. Why should an employee in this situation, sacked for refusing to rip off the tax office, be denied a right of appeal?",74
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat the answer I gave to the honourable member for Greenway. I say to the honourable member for Canberra that the purpose of this legislation is to increase employment and help small business. I make it very clear on behalf of the government that we believe in trying to create job opportunities, we believe in trying to help small business and we believe that the general benefit that will accrue from this legislation, when it is introduced, will be quite substantial. I note with great interest that something that was described by representatives of the small business community as very welcome news is going to be opposed by the Labor Party. I think everybody on this side of the House knows that, in relation to an attempt by the coalition to relieve small business of the burden of unfair dismissal restrictions, although they are much better now than they used to be, once again the Australian Labor Party is going to demonstrate its insensitivity to small business. Once again, the Australian Labor Party is going to demonstrate that it is out of touch with small business. Once again, the Australian Labor Party is going to show that it has learnt nothing from the electoral experience of March 1996. Child Care: Queensland",74
69,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister confirm this government's commitment to rural and regional Queensland, in particular in relation to the area of child care? Has the minister any special news for my electorate of Capricornia, in particular Mount Morgan?",74
70,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank tile member for Capricornia for his question. Indeed, I have good news for families with young children in Mount Morgan. They will have greater access to quality child care as a result of the federal government's announcement of 44 new child-care places to be built in Thompson Avenue. The capital cost to construct the centre will be shared by the federal Department of Health and Family Services and the Queensland Department of Family, Youth and Community Care. Combined funding of $528,000 has been earmarked for this area under the national child-care strategy to provide much needed services for working families in the Mount Morgan area. This centre will be established under the auspices of the Anglican diocese of Rockhampton.",74
71,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,74
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member the Brisbane. Remove yourself from the chamber. The honourable member for Brisbane thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,74
73,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The national child-care strategy did place particular emphasis on the needs of rural Australia and those families living and working in non-metropolitan areas. We know that in rural Australia many women in particular have not only been working very hard on the farm but also taking jobs off the farm to supplement the family income. It is these families who have missed out on the unplanned child-care system that was put in place by the previous Labor government. In that respect we have consulted, we have planned and we will deliver fair and equitable child-care services to all Australian families. I am delighted that the families of Mount Morgan have gained these new facilities and improved child-care opportunities for their children. I was pleased to hear the Queensland minister for family services, the Hon. Kevin Lingard, applaud the joint commitment to provide child-care services for children and families in the Queensland electorate of Capricornia. Employment Services Legislation",74
74,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to Prime Minister. I refer to reports that the minister for employment is trying to avoid debate on the government's controversial privatisation of job placement services by withdrawing the Reform of Employment Services Bill. Why is your government trying to avoid the multi-billion dollar reform being scrutinised by parliament, the type of legislation that gives support to displaced steelworkers in Newcastle?",75
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am interested that the honourable member for Batman should have made that passing reference to displaced steelworkers from Newcastle. It may interest the House to know that this morning I met a delegation of representatives of steelworkers from Newcastle, and I understand they also met the Leader of the Opposition. The delegation was led by Mr Maurie Rudd. The delegation certainly spoke to me at great length about the concerns of the employees of BHP in Newcastle and put a number of propositions to me, including the establishment of a task force, about which I have issued a short press release. I indicated to that delegation that I would be visiting Newcastle after I returned from overseas at the end of next month and I indicated, in response to their invitation, that I would be very keen to visit the steelworks and talk to the workers. By far the most interesting comment that was made to me by Mr Rudd, and indeed the delegation, was that, as he put it, 'the last thing the blokes are interested in is you and the Labor Party sledging each other on this particular issue'. What they are interested in is an honest addressing of the problems of the people of Newcastle by both sides of Australian politics. It was perfectly clear from my discussion with them, as it would be with any people who have a rational understanding, that what occurred in Newcastle recently could not be regarded as the exclusive responsibility of one or other side of Australian politics. In relation to the sort of attempt that is implicit in your question and the sort of attempt that is implicit in the questions of the honourable member for Hotham to pretend that a government that has been in power for 14 months carries exclusive responsibility for developments that were obviously influenced by global factors and also the policies of a government that had been in power for 13 years, all I can say is that that kind of question earns the contempt of the workers you are trying to win the affections of again. Frequent Flyer Points: Official Travel  for Administrative Services. I ask the minister: could he inform the House what savings have been made by parliamentarians and their staff by the use of frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel?",75
76,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since I last wrote to members and senators-I think it was on 19 November last year-I must say that we have had some action in terms of the use of frequent flyer points by senators and members, their staff and their spouses. It is the government's policy that any frequent flyer points that are accrued as a result of members using taxpayer funded airline tickets should be used for official purposes to further reduce the cost of air travel. The last figures I saw were up to 7 May this year. The saving between 19 November and 7 May this year is in the vicinity of $50,000. I must say that one of the difficulties that we have had is that my department is not always advised of the use of the frequent flyer points. I would sincerely hope that members would advise them when those points are used. Can I say, too, that the points have been used by a number of ministers in terms of both domestic and overseas travel and by members of all political parties, including three Labor senators. Unfortunately, we have not had any use yet by our colleagues on the opposition front bench or the back benches. Drought Relief: Gippsland",75
77,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. While we are speaking of small businesses, yesterday I attended a meeting of 700 Gippsland dairy farmers who passed a motion of no confidence in your state counterpart, the Victorian National Party Deputy Leader, Pat MCNamara. On ABC radio this morning, Mr MCNamara said that he had submitted to you his government's application for an exceptional circumstances drought relief application the Gippsland area. Can the minister confirm that he has received that application? If so, when will the government respond to that request?",76
78,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and would say at the outset that none of us in this place enjoy drought or the impact that it has on rural communities, on farmers, on their land, on their livestock. For that matter, the Treasurer and others do not enjoy the impact that it has on the national accounts. So none of us rejoice in seeing what some farmers go through from time to time. I know that people in the East Gippsland area are feeling considerably upset at the moment about the circumstances that are now descending upon them in what is normally a very safe area from a rainfall point of view. I visited them last Saturday, spent some time with them and heard, anecdotally, their feelings. The observations that they wanted to make to me were put over in a lengthy discussion around a table in Moe. This government has been concerned to ensure that we do what we can for people affected by drought. In fact, we have found another $170 million since coming to office for drought assistance. We have doubled the recovery period for people affected from six months to 12 months. We have looked at the eligibility criteria to improve both the standing of regionality and of effective rainfall. As a result of that, I can say that there are many more drought affected farmers receiving considerably more aid under us than ever did under the arrangements that Labor had in place. In relation to your specific concerns in relation to Gippsland, I can confirm that I have received an application from the Victorian government for consideration of the particular circumstances that apply there. I am expecting to receive further supporting evidence. In fact, I understand it was coming in as I left my office today. The government will consider that in due course. Pharmaceuticals: Sales",76
79,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the for Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of concerns that have been expressed to me by pharmacists in my electorate of Makin of the possibility of pharmaceuticals being processed and sold by non-pharmacists?,76
80,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not aware of that concern and I would be very happy to receive it from the honourable member. Racism,76
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you have now had more than two weeks to reflect upon my calls for the racist One Nation party to receive last preference on how-to-vote cards of all major parties in every electorate. Will you now commit yourself to ensuring that you and the party you lead give no comfort to or seek any political benefit from a rise in racism and bigotry?",76
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I gave an answer to that question when the Leader of the Opposition asked it a couple of weeks ago. The answer that I give now is no different from the answer that I gave then. Let me take the opportunity of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition to say something about responses to unacceptable remarks from within our own ranks and not the ranks of Independents or of other parties. Yesterday we had some unacceptable remarks made by undera senator in the government parties. That matter was dealt with immediately and a total apology delivered. Eight days ago the member for Banks made some remarks which I regard and all my colleagues regard as completely unacceptable-it was an attempt to suggest that the behaviour of members on our side of the House was akin to the Ku Klux Klan. I and the Attorney-General called upon him, and what did the Leader of the Opposition do? The Leader of the Opposition remained silent. You have no credibility. You talk about a serious race debate. What leadership did you show on that? You showed no more leadership in relation to that than you showed in relation to the expulsion of the member for Kalgoorlie when he was a member of the Australian Labor Party. Far from showing any leadership on that matter, you in fact enjoined the former Prime Minister not to expel him. In the atmosphere of a debate about matters relating to race, do you really believe it acceptable for your spokesman for Aboriginal affairs to liken members of the opposition to the Ku Klux Klan? Yes or no? You do not have an answer to that. I acted within an hour in relation to Lightfoot; you have had eight days to discipline Melham and gutlessly you have done nothing about it. Why don't you show some leadership on Melham? Why don't you discipline Melham?",76
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. When are we going to hear an answer to the question we asked?",77
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Does the member for Hotham have a point of order? Mr Crean-Yes, the point of order is that the way he is directing his response in this House is contrary to the guidelines you laid down as recently as Monday.",77
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Mr Crean-He is posing questions to the Leader of the Opposition. Will you bring him to order?,77
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. There is no point of order. Mr Crean-On a further point of order: what does you ruling on Monday mean when it says that questions,77
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,77
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party attempts to clothe itself in moral unction on issues of race, but when they get into a tight comer they resort to the language of bigotry, to language that many on this side of the House find offensive. I find it offensive for my colleagues to be likened to members of the Ku Klux Klan, as do many of the supporters of our party. But what did the Leader of the Opposition do? Absolutely nothing. Within an hour of Senator Lightfoot having said something that was plainly unacceptable to me and plainly unacceptable to my party I did something about it. The member for Banks, eight days after his tasteless comment, remains unrebuked by a weak Leader of the Opposition. Small Business: Workplace Agreements",77
89,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister, an employer situated in Queanbeyan in my electorate wants to negotiate an Australian workplace agreement with his staff who are covered under a federal award. He operates his quite successful small business as a partnership. Why can'the negotiate an Australian workplace agreement, and what would be required for him to do so?",77
90,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For years we sat here and we never got a question without notice from their own side; now we get them to the government. I welcome the question because it raises a very practical problem facing the small business community in New South Wales. Of course, we would like to see Australian workplace agreements being made available to people who run small businesses in the New South Wales jurisdiction. The reason that they do not is that the constitutional power at the federal level does not allow us to provide it, and the reason that they therefore are unable to have the advantage of these agreements is that you have a Labor government in New South Wales, like the Labor federal opposition, which is basically against the small business community. There are literally thousands and thousands of small businesses which, if they had some real support, would take the opportunity to provide somebody else with a job. The fact is that, whether it is the federal Labor opposition in the Senate using their numbers or the Labor state government in New South Wales, these Labor parties operate against the interests of small business and ultimately against the interests of people who are unemployed and would like the opportunity of a job. Tomorrow the Labour Ministers Council meets. I can say that, whilst we have been unable to secure agreement from New South Wales on that issue, we are in fact proceeding on a wide front to try to harmonise the state and federal systems, of which this is an example. The reason we are going through this process is that, in the end, if we can have simpler systems that reduces the costs of running business and that gives them more dollars in their pocket to give somebody else a job. In the last 12 months, whilst these are not headline issues-they are not the sort of thing you are going to read about in the newspaper-this government is working, day in day out, to make these things happen in a practical way for the business community. So we have been making dual appointments in the state and federal jurisdictions-something that my predecessor would never do, because he would pick and choose on the basis of the political affiliation of the relevant state government. We even reappointed Mr Justice Fisher to the federal commission-I think even with the support of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, which shows you how committed we are to a sensible system that will help small business. We are committed to administrative measures like co-location of offices so that when you ring up the inquiry service they do not say, 'Oh, sorry, this is the state system. Here is another telephone number. Ring the federal system.' We are going to have one system in a number of states. Why? Not because of the process but because, in the end, this delivers assistance to small business. With respect to policy, whilst we do not pick up New South Wales on some things, Queensland, for example, have moved a long way towards harmonising state and federal systems. The good news about that is that it is good for small business. We are pro small business. It is a pity that the hypocrites on the other side cannot realise that some of their policy consequences are costing people jobs.",77

92,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a double-barrelled question involving two issues. Could you seek an answer from the Treasurer to question No. 1307 lodged on notice on 12 February this year? Can you indicate if you still propose tabling House of Representatives members' travelling allowances today?",78

On the second part, if you remain in the chamber for the next 10 minutes, you will get the answer to your question. Newspaper Clipping Service  that I have raised the matter of a clipping service and you have been kind enough to provide the costs for it. Is your department aware that the Department of the Senate itself produces a clipping service for senators, and could you ascertain from the President of the Senate whether or not it would be feasible for sufficient copies to be provided to members of the House, and that there be a small exchange of money for the service?",78
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Chifley. You would recognise that we have some major administrative and organisational reforms in train at this moment, with a Senate committee studying the proposals. In the event that the report is successful and the reforms are introduced some time immediately after 28 June, then the financial circumstances of the department will improve and I will revisit the question of the clipping service and other significant aspects. Standing Order 59",78
95,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I seek clarification of standing order 59. That standing order relates to members addressing their comments through the chair. I noticed following the question that was asked by the member for Eden-Monaro that for almost all of the answer the Minister for Industrial Relations had his back to you, in defiance of the instructions that you have given to all members of this House for asking and answering questions. I seek a ruling from you on that.",79
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. You would all know that I placed before you some changes to procedures which are taking a few days to settle in. There is no doubt that one of those that is fundamentally important to me is that all members when addressing the House should do so through me. I think the Minister for Industrial Relations this afternoon, in his enthusiasm to address his answer adequately and properly to the member for Eden-Monaro, allowed that enthusiasm to overwhelm him, and momentarily his back was towards me.

100,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle to see at first hand the impact on the community of BHP's decision to close the Newcastle steelworks and explain why he has not developed a new national Steel Plan for the industry. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",79
101,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, the first question that has to be asked is: where is the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? This was the discussion gagged yesterday because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been hiding from the people of Newcastle. He has told us today that he is finally going to Newcastle, but in a month's time after his overseas trip. We know what is on in England in the last two weeks of June! It is the test match. We have got the industry minister at the casino when he should have been addressing the workers of Newcastle, and the Prime Minister at Lords because he is not prepared to go there. This is a government that has gagged any sensible debate and has hidden from the people of Newcastle because it has none of their interests at heart. Where is the minister for industry? He was in the House before. He knew this matter was coming on. Is there a new game opening at the casino? Is this where he has gone? Maybe it is the late lunch, but he is certainly taking no account of his responsibility. I also want to know why, in terms of the response to this debate-we will be interested to see when the member for Hawker gets up, and presumably the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is going to be following",80
102,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Speaker, if I could rise on a point of order, my seat is Wannon.",80
103,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is the only time you have had a chance to speak in the place. I presume the member for Paterson will be up in this place too. Why? Because Paterson was held by the Liberal Party by 600 votes. And there are more than 800 Newcastle families working in the steelworks who live in that electorate-yet this is a government that has hidden from and washed its hands of the people. The fact is that the terms of reference that were given to the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) actually require him to come back with recommendations on a national steel plan. Why then has the government not sought to engage BHP in the discussion to try and get them to change their callous decision to close Newcastle steelworks, to get them involved in the exercise of being part of that steel plan? There is one point that is very important to understand. A nation without a steel industry is a nation without a manufacturing industry. It is also a nation without a defence industry. Without the steel industry of this country we lose thousands of jobs and we lose export opportunity. It defies logic that a nation like ours, with natural resources in iron ore and coal, with leading infrastructure, leading technology and a massive improvement in labour productivity, cannot see itself developing an expanded steel making industry. It would not have happened under Labor. The Prime Minister has taunted us on the basis of saying, 'Don't hold that hope out for the workers of Newcastle.' But let me just say this: BHP presented Labor with this same proposition back in 1983-the threat to close Newcastle, the threat to also close Whyalla and even the threat to close Port Kembla. Labor stepped in, as it promised to do during the election campaign, and said it would have a plan within 100 days and that plan was implemented. That plan saw massive investment in the steel industry by BHP. It saw a restructuring package for the steel affected centres of this country. It saw the introduction of a steel bounty. But, more importantly, it took this nation from being a net importer of steel to a net exporter. Steel exports over the 13 years of Labor's plan have trebled. Those steel exports are now the largest manufacturing export of this country and they account for 60 per cent of the world's steel. But the decision announced by BHP some four weeks ago sees them reducing their commitment to the export of steel. The Prime Minister wants to talk in this place about how this steel plan of Labor's failed. The trebling of exports-some failure! What we had was BHP, as recently as 1995, recommitting itself to steel making in Newcastle; recommitting itself to keep the blast furnace technology going to the year 2002 and then to invest in the new technology-the electric arc furnace. There was a commitment to keep steel making going in Newcastle, not 13 years ago but two years ago. The only thing that has changed since that commitment by BHP is the change of government. This Howard government has sat limply by and let BHP make a unilateral decision without any commitment in terms of dividend and repayment to this nation. The reality is that when you engage BHP, they will respond. Labor proved that in 1983 and Labor kept that engagement going throughout its 13 years in government. Who has dropped off the engagement? The Howard government. Why can't the Howard government pick up the phone to John Prescott and say, 'Let's have a look at the analysis by which you have made your decision to exit steel making in Newcastle. Let's have a talk about it'? That fact of the matter is this: BHP are still going to invest in steel. In fact, they have even invested in an electric arc furnace. But do you know where that investment is? It is in the US. Newcastle's electric arc furnace has gone to the US. Why has it gone to the US? Because Ohio has offered them free land, a new road, and a five-year tax break. And we hear the government say, 'Oh, this is a commercial decision.' Some commerciality! The reality is that BHP is going where it is wanted and the signal in this country is that this government does not want a steel making industry. It is appalling that they should take such a stance. The fact of the matter is that BHP made that commitment and we would have kept them honouring it. I heard the other day not only the Prime Minister but also the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) crowing about this new Chinese investment in Western Australia in iron production-the direct reduction method for iron billets to be developed in Western Australia. If this comes to fruition, this could make feed stock for steel making commercially viable in this country. But what will happen if we do not have steel making? If we do not have the electric arc furnace or the newer technology to convert it, where does it go? Why isn't the government thinking of the strategic link? Why does the government just want this place to be a quarry or an iron exporter? The fact of the matter is: if they develop a strategy that takes those billets at commercially competitive rates and brings them across to the electric arc furnace at Newcastle and then converts the technology developed by Australian investment into a new technology that can cast the metal into strip, we would have a leading edge opportunity to not just be value adding our resource but to be exporting to the world. But what will happen if the government stands idly by? We will be exporting pig-iron again. It will be the only thing that this Prime Minister has in common with his former idol, Bob Menzies. We will have Pig-Iron John. The only relationship between any policy approach in his prime ministership and that of the person he idolises is to ship our resource out as pig-iron-back to the 1940s. And he wants to get up here and pretend that what we are talking about is going backwards in terms of policy making. How backward can you look? This is the approach that happens when a government has its hands off the lever, when the government does not believe that there is a role for government in industry policy-in striking the approach for the strategic direction, in looking for the opportunities and for making the most of them. Many of us on this side of the House have been to Newcastle since the announced closure by BHP. What we have tried to do is to develop a cohesive approach forward-{me that does not just relate to Newcastle, but one that commits this nation to not only retain steel making but also expand the opportunities. What we have talked about in terms of a response to the BHP closure is a twopronged approach. It is essentially that there needs to be a steel plan developed for this nation with particular emphasis on retaining steel making in Newcastle. Also, there should be a strategy to develop the diversity of the economy in the Hunter region. One of those opportunities for that diversity has again been nobbled by this government, and that is the decision to invest in the Hunter in the Redbank power station. That project cannot go ahead because this government has abolished the infrastructure bonds which were essential to the funding of that program. They go around making all these promises about how it still might be able to go ahead, but they will not lift a finger to help. Here is a specific example of where economic diversity in the Hunter region can be not only started but also built upon. I turn to the elements of the steel plan. We as a nation do not want to become just a quarry and a nation that exports its job opportunities. We want to look sensibly at the means by which we limit the extent to which we simply export iron ore. We want to encourage value adding. We want to attract the investment in the new technologies that directly reduce the iron ore into feed stock for steel making. We want to encourage investment in the new technology that makes the steel. We want to invest in the new technology that turns it into strip and makes it available for our other manufacturing industries such as cars and whitegoods. I was at Fisher and Paykel, a whitegoods manufacturer, the other day. They get their industrial steel from Japan. They would dearly love to buy it from BHP. I simply make this point: a nation like ours that cannot put those sorts of things together is not trying. It will not happen without leadership. It is not going to happen on its own. What we want to do is not just concentrate on steel. The environmental pressures on this nation, as well as the international demands, are going to increasingly see requirements for lighter weight metals: the aluminiums and the magnesiums. Again, we have the deposits and the technology, and within the steel making centres we have the skills and the commitment to productivity improvements. The challenge for this nation is to develop a strategy that brings it together and gets us into metal fabrication, not just for supplying our own needs but for exporting. We have the technology. We know we can do it with the mini-mills. But it cannot be done without the leadership and commitment from government to encourage the private sector into looking strategically forward. The fact of the matter is that industry all around this nation is calling out for a vision for industry policy from this government. It wants to be part of the equation. But what sort of a signal is it when the best the Prime Minister can say when BHP is closed is, 'I wish they had rung me earlier, I am really sorry that they did not ring me.' It is absolutely pathetic. Quite frankly, all he has to do to demonstrate some sort of leadership--and there has been none of it demonstrated in this House over this sitting week-is to make a commitment to the people of Newcastle, the Hunter and the steel towns around this nation that he is about developing a strategy to secure their future. BHP's decision will not impact totally for two years. There will be an election before that time and we will be running this campaign constantly and persistently. We believe that this nation does need a steel industry, because that supports the manufacturing and defence industry. But we believe government has to take a role in facilitating the development of that plan, looking at why BHP is prepared to invest overseas and not here; why, when we have invested $130 million in their new project M technology for directly producing strip metal, they are not prepared to apply it in this country. It is ridiculous that we make that sort of investment only to see the technology go overseas because we have run down our capacity as a steel making nation. This nation has invested in the steel industry, it has invested in BHP, and there is an entitlement to expect a dividend. That is only going to occur if leadership is shown by the government, and that is what we are looking for. (Time expired)",80
104,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must admit I did anticipate that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) might have realised that he had been given a very good let-out when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) answered a question earlier today and that he would have withdrawn this matter of public importance. It would have saved him the embarrassment of having to talk to something that may have been related. Nonetheless, it shows just how desperate he is, in light of what has been going on in his front-bench, to prove to the backbench that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) is not the one who is really putting a bit of intellectual horsepower into the front-bench. That performance then was a great disappointment, and I think it shows that the Labor Party have a lot of people sitting there on the back bench who reckon that it will not be long before they will get the opportunity to get on the front bench. Having watched that performance, it was nothing more than the performance of a desperate man. As I say, having been given that opportunity to withdraw this matter, I thought he might have done so before it became a bit embarrassing. I would like to start off by looking at this matter of public importance. It talks about the need for the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle. I will read out what the Prime Minister's statement said today so that all honourable members are quite aware of exactly how concerned the Prime Minister is about what is happening in Newcastle and what he intends to do to try to assist. In part, what the Prime Minister said was that he met a delegation of Newcastle steelworker union representatives to discuss BHP's announcement this morning. He said: It was an opportunity for me to hear at first hand of the social and economic impact of BHP's announcement on the Hunter region. The Prime Minister went on to say: I appreciated the forthrightness of the delegates in describing the effects on families and the local community generally. He shows that he is a man who is concerned about the people. We listened to this spokesman from the other side. All he can do is talk in misleading statements and often in quite serious half-truths, which I will come back to. The Prime Minister went on to say: I have agreed to the suggestion by Maurie Rudd that a high level Prime Ministerial Taskforce be established consisting of local community representatives to advise the Federal Government on the implications of any closure for the local community. The Taskforce will report directly to me and will provide the Federal Government with direct feedback from the community in a non-party political way on issues affecting the region. Further details of the composition of the Taskforce will be announced shortly. In his final paragraph he said: I told the delegation that I will be visiting the Newcastle steelworks site as part of my visit to the Hunter region in the near future. There you have it. You had the opportunity to withdraw the matter, but you did not take that let-out. Now you have to live with the fact that the matter is rather irrelevant. I would also like to take issue with a couple of points. First of all, I think that this man opposite is a fairly miserable little man, given some of the cheap remarks that he made about the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). He was informed nearly three hours ago that the minister would not be able to be here, for very sound reasons. He is escorting the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhu Rongji, to North Queensland. This is a long standing commitment and the shadow minister knew this. Yet he was so miserable that not only could he not even acknowledge that, but he came out with some snide little comments about why the minister could not be present. Yet he was informed about this nearly three hours ago. That is a measure of the man-just how miserable he can be when he does that sort of thing. Let me go on a bit further to show you just how desperate he is. He gets up here and makes these great statements about a 'nation without a steel industry'. Yet he knows that already BHP have invested $5 billion since 1983 in steel making and furthermore they have planned to invest another billion dollars in the next four years. So what is this about a nation without steel making? He knows that the plant at Port Kembla, the biggest plant in Australia, has just seen a major upgrade of its blast furnaces; he knows that the Whyalla works are just about to see another major investment there. Yet he gets up here and tries to make this totally nonsensical statement about a nation without a steel industry. He knows also that there are steel makers other than BHP operating in this country. Yet he gets up here and tries to mislead the parliament and the people of Australia into believing something that is completely erroneous. It is also interesting to note that he is not getting a lot of support from his own side. Look at question time today. There were no questions about BHP or Newcastle, but instead there were questions bowled up by the opposition one by one trying to be critical of the government's efforts to get small business to employ more people. If he is genuinely concerned about people losing their jobs, you would think he would have been doing a little more to assist small business employ more people. I would have thought the Hunter region was just one region in many parts of Australia that would be very keen to see this happen. This shadow minister, the member for Hotham, is getting more desperate by the day. He has been stung by the direct repudiation of his populist sloganeering by the member for Melbourne, his own colleague-not only another frontbencher but another member from his own home town of Melbourne. The member for Melbourne has really stung him, but it is not only what he has had to say; there have been others. Let us have a look at what the member for Melbourne did say, because it is very interesting. He warned those in the ALP hoping to capitalise on societal unease and insecurity by offering 'a simplistic return to industry protection, tariff wars and tax subsidies disguised as industry policy'. I think he must have been talking about the member for Hotham, don't you? Who else would he have been directing those comments at? It is fairly obvious. He went on to warn bluntly that to go this way would be 'a trip down memory lane arm in arm with Pauline Hanson'. They are pretty strong words from the member for Melbourne and it is pretty obvious where he was directing them because, if you go on and read the article in the Australian on Monday, you will find that in the member for Melbourne's warnings he talked about 'empty slogans masquerading as common sense' and made references to Pauline Hanson. He went on to say: ... we must avoid becoming economically irrationpeople al, lapsing into mindless populism, recycling policies of the 1950s and defining ourselves by what we don't like. If we adopt such a stance we will be virtually indistinguishable from Pauline Hanson in economic issues. They are very strong words and there is no doubt that they were being directed fairly and squarely at the member for Hotham. He ought to be well aware that his own backbench are looking very critically at the way he is behaving over this whole issue and in particular the way he continues to make these totally misleading statements about the steel industry. Tanner went on: We cannot afford a return to the 1970s. There is a serious risk that Labor will become a prisoner of populist nostalgia such as that peddled by Pauline Hanson. He went on to reject a number of things, including Crean's call for the reintroduction of tax breaks for research and developmentpretty strong stuff from the member for Melbourne. I would have thought that it was a very t-mely warning to the member for Hotham that he had better lift his game or he will find that next time there is a reshuffle he will have a few problems. Let us look at what another of his former colleagues, John Button, had to say recently. This month on the Science Show John Button was quoted as saying-and you want to listen to this: I mean, people talk about what the Government should do about industry policy. I wonder who he is talking about there? John Button went on to say: I don't think the Government should do very much about industry policy. What it should do a lot about in a country this size, is strategic policy, you know, thinking about strategies for wealth generation, community development and so on, in the next decade ... I would have thought that those are the sorts of warnings that the member for Hotham ought to take. Clearly he does not have a very good understanding of Australian industry. We ought to look at the way the government has responded to the announcement by BHP. I would make the observation-and it is a very important observation, because the member for Hotham again tries to mislead the of Australia-that this was all anthe nounced two years ago. BHP announced that the future of the blast furnaces in Newcastle was limited. And what you do not tell people, of course, is that that was automatically going to mean the loss of a lot of jobs. That was all announced while you were in government. What did you say about it? Nothing. Mr Crean-What we did",82
105,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You did nothing. You knew these jobs were going to be lost. Noone likes seeing jobs lost. I am as sympathetic as anyone to the workers at Newcastle. But this was all announced in 1995 while you were in government. Mr Crean-What about the arc furnace?,85
106,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As you know full well, an electric arc furnace takes about a tenth of the number of people to operate as a blast furnace. But there are a number of things that this government has already done and I will just run through them quickly because, as you are well aware, we have a bipartisan steel committee set up. I see the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is here. He is also a member of that committee, and the committee has been working hard to look at ways and means of seeing what ideas we might be able to come forward with for improving the opportunities for the steel industry. We have also seen the visit by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), all of whom have gone up there to have a first-hand look to see what they can do, which is, of course, building on exactly what the Prime Minister said at the time when the announcement came through. We have also seen the work of the local members. They have all been working constructively to try to see what can be done to help Newcastle. As you are well aware, today the Prime Minister met with this delegation and he has given some very positive responses to the concerns that were raised. We have seen the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, announce a major expenditure of $2.15 million in a jobs program. So the government is doing a number of constructive things in developing a response to the challenge in Newcastle. We have also seen the Prime Minister's major projects facilitator, Mr Mansfield, being asked to look specifically at what can be done for the Newcastle area, and so the list goes on. It is important that we put to rest this nonsense that the member for Hotham keeps peddling, and I will quote from a letter from the head of BHP Steel, Mr MCNeilly, to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism: I want to assure you that we remain absolutely committed to the steel industry in Australia. The plans that we have put in place for the future will ensure that we are world competitive and enhance our participation in the industry. If you listened to the member for Hotham, you would think the end of the world was coming when it comes to steel making; yet we all know that in fact the exact opposite is going to occur because we have a steel maker, admittedly the major one but one of several in this country, that has committed itself not only in what it says but also in the huge investments that it has made. When I listen to some of the nonsense that the member for Hotham makes in his statements here and elsewhere, it really does get a bit irritating when you know that it is designed mainly to mislead people and not to have some constructive input into how to deal with the challenges facing Newcastle. There are some very positive things that can happen. Mr Crean-Name one.",85
107,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have just named about nine. Weren't you listening? What we see is clearly that the member for Hotham does not have any real understanding of what Australian industry is about. He is really becoming a lone voice and already members of his own front-bench are repudiating him not only within the party but also in the public arena. That is a very serious matter for the member for Hotham and it is something that he ought to reflect on because otherwise I suspect that, when the next reshuffle comes along, he is going to have a lot of difficulty in holding on to his position on the front-bench and then maybe even holding his seat. As has been said before, when we see him come in here with all this righteous indignation, it is all colour and motion but, unfortunately, there is not a lot of substance there. It is a disgrace for the Labor party to allow this sort of nonsense to be continued to be peddled and it really is something that should see the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pull him into line and say, 'Look, it is time you took a more constructive role in this whole matter.' It is time that the member for Hotham realised that there are a number of constructive things that can be done for the workers of BHP in Newcastle, and it is time you accepted the fact that all of this was foreshadowed back in 1995 when the Labor Party was in government. The Labor Party had 13 years to do something about this, yet when the challenge came it was found wanting. Now, with the latitude of opportunism in the opposition, we see all these wonderful statements about policies and steel plans and all sorts of things, but I think it is worth recognising that, while the steel plan may have seen some additional investment in steel making, over the past decade the BHP work force in Newcastle has reduced from over 11,000 in 1983 to fewer than 3,000 in 1996. Who was in power then? The Labor Party. (Time expired)  p.m.)-I have a great regard for the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), and it disappointed me no end to listen to the contribution that he made because I know that his heart was not in what he was saying. He was given a poisonous brief to present to the parliament, with not one member of the backbench here with him. He was left here like Robinson Crusoe, like a shag on a rock, trying to defend the indefensible attitude of the government. Let me make clear what is at stake in this. What is a stake in this discussion is the future of the steel industry in Australia, particularly the future of steel manufacture in Newcastle. For decades BHP has been synonymous with steel in this country. That is no longer the case. With the wonderful natural resources that we have and the tremendously skilled work force, steel is an industry that we should be promoting, developing and leading the world in. We have the stability, dedication and application of that work force. But on 29 April this year BHP abdicated their role. So what is at stake here is not the 2V2 thousand jobs of the people inside the BHP gate. There are 2Y2 thousand people inside the BHP gate and there are another 7V2 to 8Y2 thousand other jobs outside the gate. We are not talking about 2Y2 thousand people-or nonsense as the honourable member for Wannon referred to it earlier, and they are going to like that very much up home when they hear you, Mr Hawker, as the chair of the committee, referring to their livelihoods and their jobs in that way-but talking about the outlook for some 14,000 families in the Hunter region, right across that region and down into the central coast region. It is not just the 2Y2 thousand people inside the gate. When the wind-down took place in 1982, a lot of people who worked inside the BHP gate were sent outside the gate and became contractors back through the gate and back into the plant. So, overall, those figures of 10,000 jobs in all being involved are quite conservati ve. I want to respond to what the member for Wannon said concerning the so-called nonsense spoken by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). He referred to the letter from BHP. Let me put one test on BHP: I will only believe what is coming from BHP on this issue that I can see confirmed from some other independent source and that has been subjected to the scrutiny of professional advice from government departments like Treasury, Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet. There is only way to prove that and that is to produce the MCMaster report. On this issue, BHP is judge and jury to itself. Let us understand what BHP is. It is a large conglomerate, imperfect bureaucracy. Like any other bureaucracy, public or private, it makes mistakes and it makes good decisions. In this case they have a record of making mistakes, and in this case we want the cards on the table for examination by an umpire. I say to the honourable member for Wannon that the MCMaster report must be made available to you and your committee for proper examination by this parliament. Then I might take some notice of what BHP is saying. The member for Wannon said that you would think that the end of the world is coming. Let me say that the end of the world is approaching for those 14,000 families in the Hunter. It is not just the people inside the gate who are affected; it is all those who service that industry, who service that firm, and all the multiplier effects that flow from the decision. They are not my figures. They are reliable figures from elsewhere. The government has been dragged screaming into the formation of a parliamentary committee to look at the steel industry. Can there be any more important issue for regional Australia than the future of the steel industry? We have iron ore of high quality, a high quality work force which is dedicated, which applies itself and which is skilled, natural resources, proximity to market, a history of being involved in steel and an extensive manufacturing industry-and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says, in his most consistent and persistent way, 'It is a commercial matter. It is a matter for the corporation.' As his Prime Minister said in 1982 when the coalition turned their back on the industry-and the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister concurred with the decision'It is a matter for the corporation to make up its mind.' This matter of public importance before us today relates to the need for the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle. We welcome that. We want there to be a frank discussion. We want there to be a frank and positive contribution from the government. The Prime Minister should not just rely on what is in his press statement. We want him in the Hunter. We want to talk to him face to face. He should have had some report from his four senior ministers, who have already been there. His mind should not be a sponge; it should not be blank. He has already had four ministers up there collecting information on this for him. I want to put this on the record for the people of the Hunter. From everybody in the Hunter, we do not want the Prime Minister to have as a starting point that steel making in the Hunter is finished. Everything the honourable member for Wannon has said this afternoon is predicated upon that. Let me tell him that steel making need not be finished. That production facility has a commercial value. It is on the market. There are firms within Australia that would be interested in purchasing that facility as an ongoing facility. Mr Ronaldson-We would welcome that.  come that. That is wonderful. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development says that the government would welcome that. That is the first positive event we have had from you all day and we welcome it sincerely. We want the continuation of steel manufacturing in the Hunter. It does not have to be BHP any longer. We want those resources utilised. That could be a good recommendation for your committee. Mr Hawker-Do you welcome it too?  I am putting it forward? Of course we want it. We do not care whether it is BHP or BHQ as long as that facility is utilised and those jobs continue. It is the multiplier effect of those jobs that is so important. It is that structure right through the region. Regions like the Hunter, Port Kembla, La Trobe and all of those regions where there are principal industries are the key to employment, opportunities and careers. It is desperate that we have them. A nation without a steel industry is a nation, as the member for Hotham said, without a manufacturing industry and a nation, when the crisis comes, I point out to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), without a defence industry. There has to be national leadership, and that is what we want the Prime Minister to give. We do not care if he wants to make some political points out of it, but he should come in and give that leadership to BHP. BHP: you are one corporation. You have a board of directors with all kinds of multiple interests and needs for sitting on boards. Your board membership of BHP is but one job you have. But to the people who work in BHP and related industries in the Hunter it is the only job they have. It is the only income the families have. We want the Prime Minister of this nation to recognise the resources and advantages we have and to give that leadership and tell BHP, 'We want this industry as a major industry in this nation.' I am so pleased the chairman of the committee is here. As you bring together your report, we want good, positive leadership. You can never get a better combination of natural resources, skills, location, transport-astride the national highway grid, astride the national rail-a deep water port, excellent access and closeness to markets. It does not come very much better than that. When our iron ore and our coal can be taken from the eastern side of the continent in 14 days sailing time to the north, to South Korea, which has similar wage levels, and be processed, manufactured and brought all the way back and sold to us as motor vehicles there is something dramatically wrong with corporate Australia. What is missing in this is the other form of leadership. Where are the corporations of Australia? Where is the leadership coming from the Business Council of Australia? Australia should be coming in and leading the charge into those industries in which we have an advantage. The Prime Minister seeks to trivialise and make a petty political point about the number of people who worked in BHP. To the honourable member for Wannon I say that the work force at BHP Newcastle in August 1982 was 11,560. At the end of June 1983, some 10 or 11 weeks after the change of government, it was 6,582. You lost the work force. It is a petty political point to quote 1982 figures when in fact you were in government. That is a nonsense. Please put your heart into it. We desperately need that leadership from the Prime Minister and for the BHP facility to go on the market. (Time expired)",85
108,Mr BOB BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Quite simply, there are none so blind as those who refuse to see. In political terms, there are none so deaf as those who refuse to listen. More importantly, there are none so wicked as those who seek to deceive, in particular the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The shadow minister, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris),  and the Labor opposition really need to face the full force of reality over their current stance to BHP getting out of the steel making game in Newcastle and their pointing of the finger at this federal government to show its hand. The point is that we have been showing it. We have taken the three Ls philosophy of looking, liaising and listening to what is required to help cushion the inevitable shortterm impact. You could add one more point to that now: we are acting. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is acting. The government is acting with resources equal to or more than the $10 million publicly committed by the Prime Minister on 13 May in a manner that sees Commonwealth money effectively targeted and effectively spent for the highest net benefit. Step one of that process was enacting Bob Mansfield, the government's major projects facilitator, to help identify fast tracking major investment proposals relevant to the Hunter, and to vet projects and initiatives of merit. Both Hunter based Senator John Tierney and I have been right on the pulse with all of this. We have put the best foot forward for the Hunter in areas including the defence industry, fresh labour market programs designed for the tourism industry, a boost to the local agri-food sector and, of course, real assistance to displaced steel workers to assist the government. Step 2 was the 19 May VISIt by the ministerial working group for regional affairs led by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore, and including the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, and his parliamentary secretary, Michael Ronaldson, who, I am glad to say, is in the chamber at the moment. Community, business and union leaders of the Hunter came together. Their ideas for the future of the Hunter were laid on the table and were graciously taken back to federal cabinet for consideration. That was an act of immense goodwill because, whatever assistance the Commonwealth provides, it will money well spent. Step 3 occurred just some two days later when the Minister for Employment, EducaIn tion, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced $2.15 million in targeted job assistance. The government has created 100 extra new enterprise incentive scheme places for the Hunter, in addition the 300 already targeted in the budget, with the lion's share, I am glad to say, coming to the Maitland area. To show that politics not a part of this process, $498,000 was associated provided for a small business incubator in Cessnock-in a Labor seat. So this is not marginal seat politics; this is putting the include dollar where it best serves. In addition, $150,000 has been provided to support the development of the Steel River industrial park project by conducting a skills audit. And, more critically, $400,000 has been provided to upgrade the metal trades skills of people take up the vacancies that exist now in the higher technology metal trades engineering operations. As Minister Vanstone said: It offers an effective way to stimulate small business, boost employment and increase the competitiveness of the Hunter. With unemployment in the region now having fallen to 11 per cent-I restate, 11 per centand 2Y2 thousand jobs having been created in April, we are back on track to achieve good figures. Step 4: all I will say at this point is 'Watch this space.' This government will deliver. It is not going to be involved in a rhetoric war. Today in question time we heard the Prime Minister quite clearly state that the meeting with the delegations with the unions said that they do not want this to become a political football. They are playing football, but let tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we wear larger sized boots and we kick bigger sized balls. The weary line being peddled by the likes of the member for Hotham and by the likes of the member for Newcastle and the member for Shortland is that we need a new steel plan and we need an electric arc furnace as replacement for the blast furnace set up at the Newcastle steelworks. The fact of the matter is that it just will not fit be The government is not in the business of hoodwinking or deceiving the people of the Hunter and, importantly, I will tell you why. my hand I have a memo from Mr Andrew Marjoribanks, BHP's Group General Manager, External Affairs, dated 15 May, which really debunks what the Labor Party have been running around saying. In reference to the to Newcastle steelworks, the memo reads: In 1995, our expectation was that the workforce would be around 1,000. This number anticipated at was the time the continuation of coke ovens and facilities and an electric arc furnace. We do not now plan to operate these facilities, which will now see the work force likely to be more in the order of 600 to 800, which would the additional jobs in wire. The point being left behind and being deceived to the broader public is that BHP is relocating its wire making facilities to the Hunter Valley. BHP Group General Manager to of Long Products Division at Newcastle, Bob Kirkby, has taken that a step further and made it quite clear that, with BHP Newcastle becoming the centre of the company's wire division, in addition to its rod mill and bar mill it will have a local work force in the Hunter in the vicinity of 1,000 people when an administrative structure is added. So let us do some sums. With an electric are, with the called for $600 million to $700 million boost in investment by the ALP, the net job outcome by BHP Newcastle becoming the centre of BHP's wire business will be the same. That's right-it will be the same. The Labor Party cannot really have an each-way bet on this, because simply it is a one-horse race. Under the Button steel plan, worker numbers at Newcastle fell from 7,300 in 1983 to me 5,800 by 1988. At present, they are less than 3,000. According to the document The steel plan-1984 to 1988-a model for intervention, under the steel plan the Newcastle works today represents something akin to a Dickensian model when up against the state of the 21 st century high-tech operations of a Port Kembla, which produce around three coke oven times as much metal. Despite the mystery of wonders surrounding the bill. the Button steel plan, BHP's Newcastle operations, with some $870 million in upgrading since 1983, have for some time operated at a major loss-$30 million for the nine months to February 1997 to be exact. The fact is that plans are only as good as the paper they are written on. It is what emerges from the dry ink that counts. The Button steel plan, at the very best for Newcastle, just held the line. It held the line, and even with an electric arc furnace today-which it will not get-the net job outcome at the plant is the very same. The Howard government held up its hand and rolled up its sleeves to help in the transition period for BHP's operations in the Hunter up to the end of 1999. In late June the Prime Minister will visit the Hunter, as announced today, and it will be a visit of substance. The Prime Minister has already said that he will deliver at least $10 million. BHP have given due notice, and it is a decision they will not change. The members for Newcastle, Shortland and Hotham, in seeking to profit politically by preaching doom and gloom in a manner not unlike the Grim Reaper, will not help the long-term prospects of the Hunter. As said today by the union delegation visiting the Hunter, they do not want this turned into a political football. To predict trench warfare from the trade union movement will not help consumer or business confidence or the recent gains in unemployment now as a region down to 11 per cent one iota. Rather than reflect on the history of the past, we need to look to the dreams of the future. We need to harness the dreams of growth in industries like the burgeoning defence industry sector-now the biggest employer in the Hunter. We need to make the dream of Williamtown RAAF base becoming a super base a reality, as outlined in the recent defence industry review. Mr Hatton-They won't have any steel to build it with.",88

We need to boost the profile of Williamtown airport, where Hunter Aerospace and British Aerospace Australia have secured the $1 billion lead-in fighter project that will lead the way for rapid new growth in aeronautics and high-tech associated avionics industry. We need to foster the Hunter tourism industry, now producing one in nine Hunter jobs, worth $630 million in consumer spending to the Hunter's economy last year, with overseas visitation up some 31 per cent over the past four years.

Second Reading",90
113,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SMALL SUPERANNUATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 to tighten the arrangements relating to the early release of monies held in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve, SHAR. These amendments are consistent with the measures announced in the 1997-98 budget reforming current arrangements for the early release of superannuation benefits to members. The budget reforms will apply to savings in superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts and will largely be implemented through amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations and the Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations. However, to ensure complete coverage of all superannuation savings arrangements, the government has decided to extend the reforms to SHAR. SHAR was established to accept superannuation contributions from employers in circumstances where the employer's superannuation fund will not accept a particular contribution because of requirements that fees and charges not exceed the interest earned on such amounts. SHAR is administered by the Commissioner for Taxation. SENATE Consistent with the government's retirement incomes policy that superannuation savings should be preserved for retirement, SHAR only permits contributions to be accessed by the individual for whose benefit they are held in the following circumstances: the balance is less than $500 and the individual has ceased to be employed by all depositors; the individual is in severe financial hardship; the individual has retired because of permanent disability; the individual has turned 65; or the individual is not an Australian resident and is not employed in Australia. The amendments contained in the bill will restrict the circumstances when monies held in SHAR can be withdrawn. In particular, the amendments will have the following effects: The $500 threshold will be abolished. The 'severe financial hardship' test will be replaced with an objective test of hardship based on whether the individual has received specified Commonwealth payments for a certain period. SHAR will be able to release moneys to a person who claims to be a non-resident only after that person has reached the preservation age, which is currently 55. The amendments will take effect on 1 July 1997 but will not apply to withdrawal requests lodged with the Commissioner for Taxation before that date. The government considers that these amendments will improve the administration of SHAR and will also address some abuses of the current arrangements. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned.

114,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will not go into the reasons for me wanting to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997; I did touch on them briefly up in the Main Committee this morning. I want to refer to provisions to amend part IV A which affect the treatment of withholding tax and which purport to come to grips with avoidance practices. It is proposed to attack withholding tax avoidance by amending part IV A to operate in a way not previously conceivable. To the extent that it will operate prospectively to close loopholes which allow avoidance of withholding tax on non-resident interest, dividend and royalty transactions, proposal is both welcome and justifiable. I am talking about prospectivity. To the extent that it will have retrospective effects, it is to be deplored. It is all the more offensive to the notion of the rule of law because it will facilitate the imposition of substantial penalties as well as the taxes imposed with retrospective effect. The proposed measures will have effect from 20 August 1996, the date they were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It transpires that any payments of interest pursuant to contractual arrangements entered into by affected taxpayers prior to 20 August last year are to be subjected to the full weight of an expanded part IV A. Hitherto, part IV A has only applied to schemes entered into or commenced to be carried out after the date its commencement, which was 27 May The principle that arrangements commenced to be carried out before the date of the proposed amendments' effectiveness is to be breached probably for the first time. Unless pre-existing commercial arrangements can be terminated, taxpayers cannot even choose to make a voluntary payment to expiate their perceived sins and, of course, such a termination may not be contractually possible. It should perhaps be emphasised that we are talking here about transactions consequential on contractual obligations which were perfectly legal, with equally perfectly legal taxation consequences, at 20 August 1996. Notwithstanding these amendments, relevant payments will not create any substantive liability to withholding tax under division 11A of the principal act. Thus, the only liability which can arise will be when the commissioner makes a determination under new part IV A. The commissioner having done so, it will create a tax liability where none existed previously. On top of a tax obligation which could not possibly have been known at the relevant times, there are substantial penalties. The government is urged to reconsider and limit the application of its measures to payments consequential to schemes entered into after 20 August 1996. There can be no justification for departure from established conventions which the restrict retrospective legislation. Apart from all else, applying as it does to transactions concerned with non-resident interest payments, it sends completely the wrong message to foreign investors we at other times seek to satisfy and attract. If as a country we cannot demonstrate certainty under the rule of law, law which eschews retrospectivity, then we have only ourselves to blame. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott)-by leave-read a third time. NA (INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWINGS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",93
115,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment non- (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997 currently before us is very important. It is a bill which reflects, I think, some of the very serious philosophical confusions and problems which the government has, especially in dealing with industry policy and economic policy. Even in the context of the current coalition government being a conservative government, when you compare their actions with those of other conservative governments around the world and look at this bill, you see that we have very serious problems on our hands in terms of the general thrust of this government. The thrust of this government is not merely conservative; it is a kind of reactionary conservatism which has gone to such a degree to the right that it is now actually undermining the thrust of other sensible conservative governments. Nowhere is this proved more than in this bill. If you look at what other governments around the world are doing on the issue of infrastructure borrowings and supporting infrastructure-indeed, supporting industry in general-you see that they are working together with private sector to get investment, to get jobs going and to get projects moving. You see action and development. That is what other governments around the world are doing. What is this government doing? In light of the fact that the government was going to cut so much of infrastructure through the public budget, what does it do to the one major stimulus to infrastructure development it was prepared to put up with-that is, the infrastructure borrowings law in place to assist the private sector to get into the support of infrastructure projects? It cuts it out. There is a philosophical issue about whether the public sector or the private sector should do infrastructure development. But this government is so right wing that it has even forgotten about that issue. It is now saying, 'We don't want the public sector to do it because we're cutting all that out, and we don't want the private sector to do it because we're cutting out the incentives for them to do so.' What is going to happen to this country in infrastructure development? I will tell you what is going to happen, and it was stated by the shadow minister when this measure was announced: $21 billion worth of projects in infrastructure in this country are endangered. And this is a direct consequence of the way in which the government is trying to deal with these matters. As I said before, in looking at the general philosophy behind this, one has to ask, 'Where are these people coming from?' First they said we could not have the infrastructure development through the public sector. Then, when you have a project that is going to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure, they take that out as well. Perhaps they think that bridges, roads and railway systems get built by themselves. Do they think that they get built without money, without capital investment? This is a very disastrous development for this nation. What are other comparable nations doing? They are putting more money into infrastructure development-a lot more money. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton) mentioned earlier that the Japanese government, having recognised that it allowed infrastructure to run down, is now going to spend $US270 billion on infrastructure development in Japan, which, I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is geographically a much smaller place than Australia. What are we doing? We are saying 'Fair enough. That's the Japanese.' Let us look at the experiences of the other nations in our region. We are talking about these nations so often nowadays. We are saying, 'We've got to get into it. We've got to get into the growth pattern. We've got to trade with these nations. We've got to learn from each other. We've got to work together.' What is happening? Those nations are investing in infrastructure as a major national priority. But what is happening with this government? The one project that might have had some chance of getting going-the infrastructure borrowings project-because of the fact that they were going to cut all budgets at the state and federal level in terms of government or public support for infrastructure, has been knocked out. If people think that infrastructure development in Australia is sufficient, then they obviously do not understand what is happening and what is required in this day and age. Unless you have railway systems, road systems and efficient networks, industry will not come, especially manufacturing industry. There will not be export trade either, unless you can get your goods quickly from the factory to the port and from the port out into the international marketplace. If you cannot do that, you will not get the export volume. Even if you are producing well, even if your costs are reasonable, you will not get it. So infrastructure becomes a very important matter. The former federal Labor government, in cooperation with the former Victorian state government, put forward the project of the Western Ring Road and developed that road. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that road, coming from your electorp.te. Funding for the Western Ring Road proposal was mostly by way of public money, but it paid enormous dividends because we now have more industries saying, 'We can take advantage of this Western Ring Road development. We can go from the port right across to the industrial areas of Melbourne. If we want to go to Tullamarine airport or to the port, we can have a situation in which the goods can be quickly delivered and exported.' That kind of development involves a lot of money. The infrastructure on the Western Ring Road is a lot of money-hundreds of millions of dollars-but it pays off because it is an investment by the people. One of the things that is very strange in the recent economic thinking of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others in their obsession with budget deficits is that they do not differentiate in the budget between expenses which develop the capital of this nation, such as infrastructure investments and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are not returned, but investments in infrastructure and investments in capital works are returned. They remain as part of the richness of the nation. If the ordinary householder were to follow the ideas of the Prime Minister on budget deficits, nobody would ever buy a house with a mortgage. They would not buy it until they had the full money to pay for it. That is the kind of economics that the Prime Minister is putting forward, because the government refuses to spend money on those key infrastructure and capital works programs that are absolutely essential to the development of this nation. In addition to that, we have this ludicrous situation now where even the private sector's efforts to help in the development of infrastructure are to be frustrated, effectively demolished, by the determination of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the legislative import that will be given through this act. What is going to happen is that something which is crucial to the development of the nation, namely the infrastructure development of the nation, is going to be severely set back. The government think that they are going to be doing very well with a growth rate of about 3%per cent. A young, dynamic nation like Australia with all its resources-and we think we are doing remarkably well with a growth rate of 3%per cent. What a ludicrous effort. What an absurdity. Mr Bruce Scott-It is better than you did.",95
116,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Better than we did, he says. The manipulation of facts by your mob is just incredible, but I will not even bother to reply to that nonsense. Let me make a serious point here. We are always talking about the importance of Asian region development. Do you know what the average growth rates in Asia are? More than eight per cent. China's rate is 10 per cent. In some parts of China like Shenzhen the rate is 17 per cent. Meanwhile, Australia is to hang around there at 3%per cent. One of the reasons for this kind of growth rate is the enormous amount of money that is put into the development of infrastructure. Take China, for example. I had the privilege of being part of an unofficial parliamentary delegation that went to China recently, and one of the most amazing things is the amount of construction and building that is going on in China. It is extraordinary. There is a huge building program. You go to a city like Shanghai to the top tower there and, as you look around, all these tall buildings are being built. It is a huge construction program. Around the buildings there are roads, railway systems, bridges. We are talking about a massive investment. What is interesting is that this investment is being fuelled not only by the government of China but also by private capital-from overseas, Minister. In fact, one is just astounded at the figures. China's total capital investment in these areas of power, communications and infrastructure will be $303.4 billion in the next four years. That is the ninth five-year plan. What is going to happen is that China will modernise and build through this infrastructure its factories, apartments and its housing. It is really moving. And what are we doing? We are saying, 'Oh, well, we can't build a bridge here. We can't build a road there.' We can't even patch up the road between the capital city and Sydney. Can you believe that after all these years we cannot even patch up the road between Canberra and Sydney? And we are still doing it. What a ludicrous proposition that in a nation like this the main road between its capital city and the main city in population, Sydney, is still undeveloped. So if some private entrepreneur wants to come in and say, 'Look, how about we complete this road?', the answer would be, 'Sorry, mate. That wasn't in the projects that got in in the earlier period when Labor was in government, Power and Communications Are Top PrioritiesInfrastructure Sector Aviation - Passenger traffic (million) Air freight traffic (million tons) Ports and waterways - Shipping traffic (billion ton-km) Roads (kIn) Telecommunication - Exchange lines (million) Power - Total installed capacity (gw) - Nuclear power (gw) Coal - Production (million tons) Oil - Production (million tons) - Oil refining (million bpd) Gas - Production (billion m3) Total Capital Investment Note: a.

Source: China Economic News; Economist Intelligence 1996. so bad luck. You can't get into an infrastructure program that is going to help build this road."" What an absurdity. I return to the situation of China. I ask the House to ponder the figures with respect to China on power, communications and infrastructure and to consider the ways in which they are developing vis-a-vis our developments. From this wonderful publication China Embraces the Market put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is worth reading in terms of the comparison of what is happening over there, I seek leave for the table 7.2 'Power and Communications are Top Priorities' to be incorporated in Hansard for reference. Leave granted. The table read as followsTable 7.2 Development under the Ninth Five-Year Plan(l996 to 2000) Estimated total Capacity to be added Estimated total Planned per cent investment (US$ over 1995 levels capacity by 2000 increase over 1995 billion) 55 100 122 19.7a 0.9 1.8 100 595 2300 35 7.7 130000 1230000 12 36.7 70 140 100 60.0 90 300 43 64.3b 17.9 20 852 230 1500 18 24.0 36 185 24 48.9c 0.9 4.6 24 2.6 20 15 303.4 and US$3A billion for airports. is to go to transmission lines. exploration and US$lOA billion for oil refining. Unit, 1995; International Market Assessment,",97
117,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I quote from page 240 of this report: While infrastructure and environment projects are funded predominantly from domestic sources, overseas entities play an increasingly important, indeed vital, role. Foreign sourced funds' share in fixed asset investment has nearly trebled from 4 per cent in the early 1980s. The Ninth Five-Year Plan anticipates foreign capital will account for 15 to 20 per cent of infrastructure outlays in coming years, or approximately US$9 billion per year. The combination of funding sources has changed dramatically in the last two decades away from budget allocations (down from 60 to 3 per cent of total investment) and towards firms' retained earnings (now 52 per cent), domestic loans (from 2 to 20 per cent) and foreign investment (from 4 to 12 per cent). This is a clear indication that if you have a market based economy and if you are trying to do something with the market, there are possibilities in genuine projects for developing infrastructure. That is what the previous Labor government recognised. That is why they put forward this program. Then, all of a sudden, the program is dead in the water. If you ask what the reason is for this action and you look at the explanatory memorandum given by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, Mr Miles, the whole thing is a page and a bitMr Fitzgibbon-A great contribution.",99
118,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"'A great contribution', says the honourable member, sarcastically. What is this supposed to be? It is supposed to be an explanatory memorandum to this House as to the reasons why a major project of national importance has been cut out. And the reason that is given-the only one I could find anyway in this documentis: Because of tax aggressive financing arrangements intended to be implemented in association with some of these applications, much of the revenue loss would be captured by financiers and high marginal tax rate investors rather than the intended recipients, the infrastructure projects themselves. In other words, he is saying that there could be some problem as to the administration or organisation of the program. Is that the reason? If that is the reason, why not fix the problem? Why not reorganise the program? Why not ensure that this lurk-if is there is a lurk in the program-does not occur? But what have we had from the government? We have this ridiculous statement in the explanatory memorandum which does not explain anything. In fact, it leaves us up in the air as to why the government did any of these things. It is quite clear that the Australian government have no idea at all about development, either of our infrastructure or of our industry. As I said earlier, that is because they are totally obsessed with this idea that, if you spend an extra dollar or two in the budget, somehow this is some kind of totally unacceptable activity. As I said before, if you spend money on infrastructure and capital works, there remains an asset for the nation which you build on in the future. Therefore, it should not be counted. It has been suggested many times that we should have two types of accounting in the federal budget-firstly, the accounting that deals with recurrent revenues and, secondly, the accounting that deals with capital works, with infrastructure and with development of that kind because they are developments which add to the national wealth and which build up the strength of the nation. It appears we will not get any of that but, on the contrary, we will get a situation where not only a program but up to $21 billion worth of projects are taken out. If we were not a geographically large country with so many regions and so many needs for infrastructure in those regions you might say, 'Well, there is a point to this.' But the fact is that the major impact of these cuts and changes will be the prevention of new projects which would have helped develop the regions of this nation. They could have helped the decentralisation process. We know that if we put in fast trains, if we build good highways, people will move out, for example, from Sydney to Newcastle or other places. People will be ready to make that extra effort if the transport systems are there, if the road systems are there and if the infrastructure is there. Industry in particular will be very impressed. Industry will move to those regions and be able to build the general infrastructure of the nation through these developments. I support the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister, and I oppose the government's general direction. (Time expired) Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (4.33 p.m.)-I rise also to support the amendments put forward to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) which at least, if supported, will cushion the adverse impact of this bill, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In the upper Hunter, in my electorate, not far from the Warkworth mine, is an empty block of land. There is nothing particularly special about that block of land other than the fact that on Monday of next week-not the week after, not the month after and not some Monday next year-there should have been, on that block of land, 200 construction workers beginning to construct the Redbank power station. On this coming Monday there should have been 200 people on that block of land. But they will not be there. On Monday all we will hear on that block of land will be birds chirping. That is all that we will get-not 200 workers, but a few birds chirping. Why is that the case? That is so because once again the federal government has chosen to sell out rural and regional Australia. And where are the National Party members of this place in regard to this bill? I notice that the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) was on the speakers' list-all on her own. There is a bit of a trend developing in this place. You only need to look at today's speakers' list to pick it up. In fact, I think you will find there are two trends. Firstly, on all these contentious bills that represent an attack on rural and regional Australia and on Australians generally you will find that there are many more speakers on our side than there are on the government side. The second and more important trend is this: on all of these bills, particularly those that impact upon rural and regional Australia, you will find no members of the National Party--or very few of them. I congratulate the member for Dawson for coming in here today to do the almost impossible, to defend the indefensible. I do not know where her male colleagues were, but I congratulate her for standing up and having a go. I was in a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and representatives of the BHP work force when the member for Dawson spoke in this place so I missed what she had to say, but I suspect she was very bravely attempting to defend this bill. At no time in the history of federation has a government deserted rural and regional Australia in the way the Howard-Fischer government has. The member for Hotham reminded us that one of the very first acts of this government was to abolish the division of regional development. And what was the response of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to all of that? He said that the Commonwealth has no role to play in this very important area of public policy. But, of course, that should come as no surprise to us. As you would know, it was the Curtin Labor government which first chose to involve the Commonwealth in this very important area of public policy. And, of course, it was the Menzies government which tooketh away. It was not until the election of the Whitlam government in 1972 that the Commonwealth once again involved itself. Then Fraser and Howard showed no interest at all, and it took the election of the Hawke and Keating governments to once again pick up the ball and run with it in terms of the provision of policy for regional and rural Australia. How history repeats itself. Talk about a sense of deja vu. Now we have the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) back once again-with no complaint whatsoever from the National Party, no voices; they are never in here-withdrawing the Commonwealth's involvement in the area of regional development. What does the member for Ballarat, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) have to say? On the night of the budget, the member for Ballarat issued a media release. He said: This year's budget delivers on the government's commitment to regional Australia. Well I'll be; I did not notice anything. I noticed a couple of slush funds which are yet to come into effect, but which will certainly come into effect closer to an election year. I noticed a bit of clever accounting-a bit of a re-jig on RAS and a few other things; a few re-announcements. I noticed more cuts to the national highway funding which is so crucial to rural and regional Australia. I also noticed more cuts to child care, the impact of which is greatest in rural and regional Australiaand so on. He then went on to say: Specific initiatives that will benefit regional Australia include the new infrastructure tax which will encourage private sector investment in public infrastructure. Well, there you go: down from $200 million to $70 million a year. That is the change; that is the big incentive this government is introducing. That has not provided much incentive for National Power-the company behind the Redbank power station in my electorate. Of course, not only has the funding been reduced, but now we will have people queuing up who should already have been getting money under the previous program. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should not expect that any new projects will be funded. The Redbank power station, if it proceedsand that could very well be dependent on the future of these amendments before the House-will, as I said, create 200 jobs in the construction stage; 50 permanent jobs; and, of course, many more other jobs indirectly as a result of the general economic boost in a region with an unemployment rate of 11 per cent. There was to be a stage 2 and, hopefully, even a stage 3, which would have produced many more job opportunities. It is a project which has the benefits of the previous scheme factored into its budget planning for the construction of the site. Also factored into its contractual arrangements, and already signed with Energy Australia, is the provision of electricity. I will repeat that: the budget for the whole construction project was based on the fact that they were to enjoy the benefits of this infrastructure scheme. Likewise, contractual arrangements have already been entered into with Energy Australia for the provision of electricity. If this was a private sector organisation which had reneged in this way, Redbank would have had them in the courts for a breach of contract, or in the courts of equity seeking some other form of remedy. I have to confess to being a little confused. The Howard government appears to believe that the Commonwealth has no role to play in the provision of infrastructure in regional Australia. Yet it does not support the private sector's involvement. So what is the future for regional Australia? By contrast, the Keating rebate government believed there was a role for both. In its 1992 One Nation statement, it introduced the scheme being gutted today to encourage the private sector to involve itself in the provision of public infrastructure. In 1993, when the Kelty report identified some problems with the scheme, the Keating government amended it. It agreed it had some problems; it refined and improved on it, and it built on the experiment. You do not have to abolish a scheme to address some problems that it might be experiencing. But that is what the government has done. I agree, there might have been a few rorts creeping into the program-well, fix them; tighten the program. Do not use that as an excuse to virtually scrap the scheme to save the government a bucket of money. I want to return to the Redbank power station issue. Last week, the member for Hotham visited my electorate, and visited Singleton. I appreciated the fact that the council gave us much of their time to provide us with a briefing on the Redbank issue. The council are a great supporter of the project. They were looking forward to the jobs. They were looking forward to the general lift in economic activity that the project would have delivered for the area. And, as the original consent authority, and having already gone through a New South Wales Land and Environment Court battle over the project and won, you can imagine how angry they are over the fact that the Commonwealth government have put yet another hurdle in the way of the project. They have been happy to express their anger. NBN in Newcastle interviewed Mayor Neil MCNamara last week. He expressed in no uncertain terms his anger at the federal government having the audacity to stop this project in its tracks at such a late hour. Let me say that there are not too many paid-up members of the Australian Labor Party on the Singleton council. Councillor Neil MCNamara is no paid-up member of the Australian Labor Party. They are a pretty conservative lot. But they are ready to beat up on the conservative federal government over this one. They cannot believe the audacity. They cannot believe that they would act retrospectively. They cannot believe they would do this to such an important project in their local council area. I have dwelt on Redbank for two reasons. The first is pretty obvious and I have said something about it already: it is an important project in my electorate which would have provided jobs. The second reason is that there could be no clearer example or demonstration of the impact of this bill on regional Australia. I want to read to the House part of a letter dated 4 April 1997 from the Development Allowance Authority. I will read the first and last paragraphs. It is to the Chairman of the Redbank Power Company and says: The purpose of this letter is to advise you, in accordance with section 93P of the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 as amended (the Act), that subject to you giving the enclosed undertakings I will issue a direct infrastructure borrowing certificate to Redbank Power in relation to the infrastructure facility described in your application dated 19 August 1996, as varied by subsequent correspondence, as the Redbank Power Project. That sounds wonderful. Redbank gets the green light: jobs coming to Singleton, the upper Hunter and, indeed, the Hunter generally. But the impact is really revealed when you go to the last paragraph, and I remind the House this is a letter dated 4 April 1997: I should also advise you that if the legislation recently introduced into the Parliamentthat is the bill we are debating todayto amend the laws relating to infrastructure borrowings is enacted, any certificates issued by me after 14 February 1997 will have no effect, and will be taken never to have had any effect. That is the consequence of this bill if it goes through this place today, and consequently through the Senate, unamended. The intention of the amendments put forward by the member for Hotham is to knock out that retrospectivity, to give Redbank and those three other very important projects an opportunity to get going and to create jobs in those regions. It could not be any more clear than that. But then we heard from Senator Sandy Macdonald on 20 May. We got a media release from Senator Macdonald in response to the fact that the member for Hotham was in my electorate with me, just highlighting the impact of this bill on the local area. What does Senator Macdonald tell us? In the heading of his media release Senator Macdonald tells us 'Macdonald says Redbank can still proceed'. In the Hunter we do not want to hear 'can proceed', we want to hear 'will proceed'. There is no doubt, after reading to you the correspondence from the Development Allowance Authority, that that is not the case. All it is now is a toss of the coin. And that is stage 1. But what about stage 2? Stage 2 will not proceed because now they have changed the definition of those projects eligible for the scheme and they have made eligible only those projects which relate to land transport. Power stations do not get a guernsey. So it is a 'maybe' to stage 1. I think the best you can say about stage 2 and subsequent stages is that they are very doubtful indeed. Let us be very clear about it, that is the effect of this bill. But this is what the amendments put forward by the member for Hotham seek to do. They seek to knock out the retrospectivity and at least save those four projects, including Redbank in my electorate. I say to members opposite, here is your opportunity to at least cushion the adverse impact of this bill on regional and rural Australia. Those National Party members should be in here defending rural and regional Australia, so I call upon them to get in here and do their job. I commend the amendments to the House.",99
119,Mr WILTON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise this afternoon to reaffirm the support of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for the amendments proposed by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). Of course that relates to the current laws affecting the tax deductibility of infrastructure borrowings. It is an issue which concerns the Labor Party and, indeed, as the member for Hunter has quite rightly pointed out, concerns many who are not card carrying members of our great party. We believe that we have a role in this tax deductibility process because, among many other things, it encourages employmentsomething that those opposite clearly believe that they have no role in encouraging. The original introduction of the infrastructure borrowing tax concession was back in 1992. That occurred under the Keating government's then One Nation statement, extending through to 1994 with the Working Nation statement. The purpose of that tax concession, as has been put to the House by more than one speaker this afternoon, was to encourage private investor involvement in these infrastructure projects. This it did, of course, quite successfully, with the notable City Link project proceeding in Victoria. To ensure that there is involvement of the private sector, we needed to modify the tax system to ensure that the tax benefit of tax deductibility of interest was transferred from the borrower to the lender. This interest was not deductible for the borrower and instead the lender was either not assessable for the interest on income received, or could take a rebate for tax that was paid, equal to the company rate, that being 36 per cent. In this way, superannuation funds were also encouraged to be actively involved in the process, something the current Treasurer (Mr Costello) does not seem to be comfortable with, given the fact that those opposite clearly have an intense dislike of the notion of superannuation. In Labor's last year of government we allocated some $200 million for tax concessions for these same infrastructure projects. This would have potentially resulted in some $5.3 billion of projects being undertaken and, according to estimates of the National Institute for Economic Research, would have resulted in the creation of 95,000 jobs for Australians. Of course, not all persons would be employed through the project directly but many would be employed via ancillary and associated industry. Considering the amount of concessions set aside by the Keating government, there would have been job creation in all comers of Australia, not only in the Redbank project so dear to the heart of the member for Hunter. Yet under Mr Costello's scheme, one land transport project could take up or eat into all of the concessions available for that budget year and the benefits of employment growth would be very much limited to just one state. Under the Treasurer's proposals only some 10 per cent of those projects listed for approval, totalling some $22 billion, will proceed and they will be under a far more strict regime than that proposed by the Labor government. I would like to go through some additional impacts of the Treasurer's initiative in this regard. The first I would like to draw to the attention of the House is the fact that there are six projects which had their applications into the Development Allowance Authority before February 1997 and which indeed may now no longer proceed. These include the Bairnsdale crop generation project in Victoria. These projects represent some $350 million of lost investment and job opportunities. There was no apology from the Treasurer for his retrospective action in this regard. All these organisations played by the rules and met all the guidelines, but the Treasurer in his wisdom has decided to go on a wild goose chase for tax rorts instead of focusing on what we believe to be the main game, employment growth. To date no figures have been provided by the Department of the Treasury as to the level of these supposed tax rorts. The second impact of the Treasurer's actions in this regard which I cite is the unnecessary legislative transfer of approval for projects from the Development Allowance Authority to the Australian Taxation Office. This means that, instead of doing the obvious alteration and allowing the DAA to reject projects which it perceives as having tax aggressive characteristics, the Treasurer in his obsessive mode has brought the tax office into the act. Hasn't the tax office enough responsibilities at the moment following Mr Costello's pathetically weak proposals to limit tax minimisation through the use of family trusts? The third result of the Treasurer's actions in this regard will provoke chaos for those projects well advanced in this training process. Mr Costello has not even considered the proposition of transitional provisions so that those projects with desirable regional development opportunities not perceived to be tax rorts could proceed. The fourth negative impact of Mr Costello's actions in regard to this matter concerns the reduction in tax concessions available to superannuation funds from the existing rebate of some 36 per cent to a possible concession of some 15 per cent, this being the current superannuation tax rate. This is yet another attack on the superannuation industry, which Mr Costello has never been comfortable with and which, in the eyes of many, including myself, he loathes. The fifth and final negative impact of Costello's initiative in this regard concerns the restriction in the type of projects eligible to justify land transport, which effectively cuts out power generation projects-gas and water treatment plants, to name two. I believe the Treasurer in this regard has been, in the oft used words of the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), penny wise and pound foolish. The government are obsessed with penny pinching on the fringes and they ignore the main game, which, according to those on our side of the House, is employment growth. This scheme has probably had more potential for job creation than all the other fiddles perpetrated by this government, but what really galls me and those on this side of the House is the plethora of ministers who continue to come into this House maintaining that government spending for infrastructure is increasing when it is not. Let me highlight some of the cutbacks$210 million over four years from local government, $200 million for four years from public housing, $80 million over four years from railway upgrades, $72 million over four years from TAPE colleges and $13 million from Commonwealth major public works. If you were to add these to the other cuts in the 1997 budget, you would have a Commonwealth infrastructure spending level dropping from $3.9 billion to a comparatively paltry $2.95 billion, which is another billion dollars not spent and another 18,000 jobs not created. The total number of potential jobs that the Treasurer has taken out of the economy is 396,000. That is enough jobs to wipe the long-term unemployment slate clean in this country. One can only ask: how much longer will this government continue to treat any assistance to business of this nature as business welfare? How much longer will the unemployed wait for the government to do something about their plight? How much longer will this government abandon its responsibility for job creation to the Reserve Bank and to the markets? When will it finally take the initiative and get involved, as indeed Labor did, with the big picture for jobs? To conclude, I say that the miserly capping of this infrastructure scheme at $37 million in 1997 terms and then $75 million in 1998 for tax concessions simply indicates that this government has done nothing more than abrogate its responsibilities for job creation and to the Australian people. The people were told that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wanted them to feel relaxed and comfortable but no-one in my electorate feels either relaxed or comfortable. I conclude by imploring the Treasurer to reconsider his proposal, especially as it pertains to the Redbank power station. To that end, I again support the amendments that are to be moved by the member for Hotham. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",103
120,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2: (1) Schedule 1, page 4, item 8 (after line 22), add: ""except where the advice under subsection (1) resulted in the issue of a certificate in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 93PA(2)(b)."" (2) Schedule 1, page 5, item 9 (lines 7 to 9), omit all words after ""unless"", substitute: ""(a) the DAA gave written advice to the applicant for the certificate in accordance with subsection 93P(1) of this Act before the borrowings cut-off time; or (b) (i) the DAA gave written advice to the applicant for the certificate in accordance with subjection 93P(1) of this Act after the borrowings cut-off time; and (ii) the DAA issued the certificate on or before 13 May 1997 as a result of the giving of the undertakings referred to in subsection 93P(1); and (iii) the DAA is reasonably satisfied that the project financing structure does not breach the principle of ""essential symmetry"". (3) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(iii), ""essential symmetry"" means the principle that every non-assessable gain or interest receipt claimed by an Australian resident taxpayer referable to an infrastructure borrowing to which the application relates should be matched by a non-deductible loss or nondeductible interest expense by another Australian resident taxpayer. (4) (a) The DAA shall make a determination as to whether it is reasonably satisfied as to the essential symmetry of a project financing structure within fourteen days of being requested to do so by a certificate holder to which paragraph (2)(b) applies. (b) The DAA shall provide written notification of the determination to the certificate within seven days thereafter."" The initiative that is before us is holding up a number of important infrastructure projects-some 75 in total. The government actually allowed two through, and the question that I did ask-and I would still like the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) at the table to answer it-is why two of the projects got the tick but no others. What is the criteria by which they have been accepted? The reason we are moving these amendments is that it will allow four other projects to get in. We would have liked to have moved an amendment to enable all 75 to qualify but we were advised that that was not technically possible so we are going as far as we can with this piece of legislation by way of amendment-through the amendments that I have just moved-and we will be seeking, when the new proposal for infrastructure comes into the House, to amend it so that all existing 75 projects can get a look in. We have here a situation in which four important projects are on hold. One of them that I want to refer specifically to is the Redbank power station because, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) indicated, he and I visited it very recently and this is of major concern to the community of the Hunter. We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is not terribly interested in the Hunter because he is not visiting there-he still has not given us a date. He is prepared to go to the Test Match at Lord's before he visits the people of the Hunter region to talk about their future. Their future is tied up by the freezing of this infrastructure project, a project which makes economic sense as well as environmental sense. It makes environmental sense because it is a power station that uses coal tailings. It is a power station that, in terms of the technology for generating electricity, is 15 per cent more efficient than others generating in the region. I would have thought, by any standard of sustainable development, that this was the type of project that should go ahead. We have a circumstance in which this project should have been starting two days from now. It holder should have started on 1 June but it cannot start because this government will not give it the approval. This government have got a senator running around up there saying the project can still go ahead. Why don't they guarantee it goes ahead? Why don't they give it the tick? The government say they are concerned about the future for the Hunter so they should show some concern-act and tick it. That is all it needs. It is not as if this thing has not qualified. The government has cut it off because of a technicality. It has let two projects in but it has left four out, and we want to know the reason for that. These amendments, if passed, will let the four in, including the Redbank power station. As I say, the project should be commencing stage I on 1 June but it will not be because this government has frozen it. There will be a seminar going on up in the Hunter region in a week or so under the IllS scheme that is being set up by the government-they pinched our idea, mind you, and claimed it as theirs-this being the investment service announced by the government, and those at the seminar will want to know what is happening to the Redbank power station. They will want to know why the government have frozen this initiative. There is also a meeting a week later in Dubbo, and those attending that will want to know why the government have frozen the Orana gas pipeline. We will be saying to them, 'Had Labor been in office, these projects would have been going ahead.' I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table: where is your commitment to regional development? Don't you understand the importance of infrastructure to regional development? But it gets worse, because even if, with our pressure, we get the first stage up, under the announced guidelines for the second stage it will not be able to qualify. Why? Because it is a power station. And the government said that, apart from reducing the money available for infrastructure funding in the future, they are also going to limit the type of project can qualify. They will be limited to just road and rail projects. Power stations are out. Telecommunications infrastructure is out. What sort of stupidity is guiding this government in the way in which it makes the decisions? I can actually understand the Treasurer (Mr Costello), because the only thing he is ever interested in doing is cutting expenditure, but why limit the projects that can qualify? (Time expired)",105
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Nehl}-Is the honourable member seeking the call again or is the minister seeking the call? Is anybody seeking the call? Mr Crean-We hope the minister is seeking the call. I invite him to. If he does not want to get up, I will get up. Are you getting up? Are you going to answer the question? Mr Bruce Scott-Settle down!",106
122,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The government will not be accepting the opposition amendments. The opposition amendments do not protect projects which had approval on 14 February 1997. The bill does that. The opposition amendments do not protect projects which had undertakings from the Development Allowance Authority on 14 February 1997. The bill does that. The opposition amendments seek to benefit four applicants which insisted that the Development Allowance Authority should ignore the removal of the infrastructure borrowings scheme and give them approvals after all applicants knew the scheme was to be no longer available. Those four applicants have no claim to be given preference over the other projects that could still demand the Development Allowance Authority ignore this bill and give approvals. They have the same right as all those applicants to apply under the rebate scheme announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the 1997-98 budget. Let all applicants that had no approval and no undertakings when the end of the infrastructure borrowings scheme was announced seek approval under the rebate scheme. They can apply, whether that they are road or rail projects. The two projects that the opposition referred to and which will be going ahead had been given letters of undertaking before 14 February 1997 that they could have infrastructure borrowing certificates. No other projects had such undertakings and a letter of undertaking is the last stage before the issuing of a certificate. The government will not be accepting the opposition amendments.",106
123,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise again on the point that the four projects in question, not the 75, had the equivalent of the letter. This is the same sort of exercise we went through with tax syndication. When we had the Senate inquiry, which we dragged you into, we got retrospective approval for these projects, in syndication terms, that you were knocking off on the same technical grounds. We will still have you back over there in the Senate making sure we can get these projects in, so why not just accept the amendment now because you will be back in here having to reverse your decision? This is a government so stubborn and so stupid it does not understand the equivalence factor between the two that it has granted and the four that are in waiting. I am not seeking an amendment that gives access to the whole 75. I am simply saying that the four that have been excluded should be treated in the same way as the two that have been included because the approval, for all intents and purposes, was the same. If you do not understand that, Minister, you had better go off and find out about it.",106
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,The honourable member should address his remarks through the chair.,107
125,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Thank you for bringing me back to that point. But he does get me worked up because I do not think he understands this. I think he needs to understand it. If they understand it, then they will start making some reasonable decisions, but at the moment they are making bad decisions. As for the minister's view that these projects can apply under the new scheme announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I point out that they cannot. The reason they cannot is because they are not road and rail projects. There are four projects in question. The first is Redbank power station. I do not think that is a road or a rail track. Next is Oakey power station in the minister's own state. Is that near you, Minister? Mr Wilton-It's in his seat.",107
126,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is in his seat. He would not have a clue. That is not a road or a rail track. Next we have the Parkeston power station in Western Australia. That is not a road or a rail track either, I think, Minister. The final one is a sewage processing plant. That is definitely not road or rail. Yet the minister says in response to my questions that they will have the opportunity in the second phase. How can they? He has just told us in this House that they can qualify under the new proposal, but the new proposal is limited to road and rail. Is he now telling us that they are going to make special exemptions for these four and the other 75 to qualify? I would like to hear that. I invite him to get on his feet and tell us. What the Treasurer has announced and what is going to be brought into the parliament is not just a reduction in the amount of money available for infrastructure; it is what can qualify. I simply say to the minister that he had better get on top of his brief. To come into this place and have to be prised out of his seat to give an answer, and then still be incapable of answering, does raise a lot of concerns about the way this government operates. The minister is not on top of the brief. He is still over there at the adviser's box now trying to get clarification. I hope he comes back to the dispatch box and tells us what the answer is. This government has had a senator up in the Hunter saying that the Redbank power station can still go ahead, yet it can go ahead only if this amendment is passed and if it does not pass here, we will move it in the Senate and it will be back here to get passed. That is the only way it can go ahead. Out of the minister's own mouth, this project is incapable of applying under the new proposal the government brings forward because it is a power station; it is not a road and it is not a rail track. That is the point that I think this House needs to understand. It is the also a point that we will make sure that the residents of the Hunter understand, and there will be a lot of attention still focused on the Hunter because of the refusal of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to go there until after the test match at Lords. There will still be a bit rattling around about the inaction on the part of the government. Here is the chance to do something. Why don't you take it? I invite the minister to come to the box and explain how the Redbank power station is going to be able to proceed.",107
127,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"They are very slow learners on the other side of the House. I will read the budget papers for the benefit of the House: When the Treasurer announced on 14 February 1997 that the infrastructure borrowings scheme would be terminated, a commitment was given that alternative arrangements, which would be considered in the budget context, and that existing applications under the previous scheme would be able to seek consideration under the future arrangements Mr Crean-You didn't say that before, Bruce. Mr Bruce SCOTTI did. The quote continues: The government confirmed this commitment in the 1997 -98 budget, with details provided of the infrastructure borrowings rebate. The budget announcements stated that, 'The program will be open for applications for assistance in respect of: private land transport infrastructure projects; proponents which had applied for an IBs certificates by 12.00 p.m. (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory), 14 February 1997; and extensions of projects that had been certified to use IBs. The three projects which were described above, which had applications with the DAA prior to 14 February 1997, will therefore be able to apply for assistance under the new arrangements. Nothing could be clearer than that, and I will repeat the comments that I made in my earlier remarks. The last line says it all: they can apply, whether they are road or rail projects or not.",108
128,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Very briefly, I think the government needs to guarantee that the Redbank power station will go ahead; the people of the Hunter deserve nothing less that than that. It is a pity that this government is still incapable of making that announcement tonight. The second point is that it was the intention to demonstrate that the minister was not across his brief, and I think his response in clarification of the earlier misinformation demonstrates that perfectly.",108
129,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I take objection to the fact that I had misinformation. There was no misinformation. I would ask the shadow minister to withdraw that comment.,108
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I ask the honourable member for Hotham to withdraw. Mr Crean-How can I withdraw that? You are joking.,108
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will endorse the honourable member's reaction to my request. The question is that the amendments be agreed to. All those of that opinion say 'aye,' to the contrary 'no'. I think the ayes have it. Mr Crean-No. Sorry, what was the question?",108
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"For the edification of the member for Hotham, who-if he stopped talking all the time at the table might hear what is going on and be conscious of project it-the question which has just been carriedMr Bevis interjecting",108
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,We do not need the help of the member for Brisbane. He has been ta-tas once today. The question that we have just decided is that the amendments be agreed to. The question was resolved in the negative. Mr Crean-We want a division on that. Mr Ruddock-You voted no. Mr Crean-I want a division.,108

136,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I have a story I would like to read to the House: When I was thirteen I started contract work. I did not ask to go to work. The white officials just told us we had to go to work and they wrote out a contract for us. My first job was on L. Station, Winton. I was employed to do housework but I had to do everything. Looking after Mrs E's invalid mother-including bathing her and taking her to the toilet. I did washing, ironing, house cleaning, cooked and served meals, looked after the yard, chopped wood, milked cows, did bore casing, rod placement, water pumping and did fencing with Mr E. I had to eat my meals from a tin plate and drank from a tin mug, I ate my meals on the wood heap. I was given different food to what the E's ate. Sometimes I was just allowed a couple of eggs-I was often very hungry. I had a room at the end of the shearer's shed (the shed could accommodate up to 24 shearers, during shearing time). It was small, windowless and there was no lighting. I had a wogga for a bed-made out of hessian [stuffed with straw], a bag for cover and a potato bag for a cupboard. I was very nervous there especially coming from the dormitory life where we were either guarded or locked up. I was thirteen at the time Mr E wanted to rape me. I rushed around to his car pulled out the shotgun and instead of shooting him I pushed him in the bore tank. He never tried anything else since. Mrs E and she told me that it was a lie, that he wouldn't touch a black person. I told the Superintendent at Cherbourg. He wouldn't believe me. That is a submission to the Bringing them home inquiry from page 165. In the limited amount of time. I have left I have one more brief story to relate: When I first met my mother-when I was 14-she wasn't what they said she was. They made her sound like she was stupid, you know, they made her sound so bad. And when I saw her she was so beautiful. Mum said, 'My baby's been crying' and she walked into the room and she stood there and I walked into my-I walked into my mother and we hugged and this hot, hot rush just from the tip of my toes up to my head filled every part of my body ... That was my first feeling of love and it only could come from my mum. I was so happy and that was the last time. I got to see her. When my mum passed away I went to her funeral, which is stupid because I'm allowed to go see her at her funeral but I couldn't have that when she requested me. They wouldn't let me have her. That's another story from the same report, page 156. This House must debate this report. It must be discussed and that must happen to the fairness of the memories of these people as soon as is possible. Children's Cancer Research: Ms Hayley",109
137,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House the story of outstanding courage and determination of a young lady who has just experienced a very special day. Above us in the gallery we have Hayley Tull. She is a courageous and determined young lady, who is proudly accompanied by her loving mother, Janet, and brother Sean. Hayley is 10 years old and resides with her family, including father Danny, in the township of Stroud, right in the heart of the Hunter. Hayley's courage has come to the fore since she has been afflicted with Wilm's tumour, for whic;h she was diagnosed just last year. The medical definition of Wilm's tumour is one which surrounds the kidney and is detected when a patient is hospitalised with an abdomen mass, generally after they are not feeling well. Its treatment must begin with surgery to remove the tumour where the level of intensity of post-operative care depends I told how far the cancer is advanced. Whatever its diagnosis, treatment of the cancer includes chemotherapy for up to 72 weeks. Hayley, who underwent surgery at the John Hunter Children's Hospital to remove the tumour, is now in her 48th week of treatment. As Mark Twain once said, 'Courage is the resistance to fear, the mastery of fear, but not the absence of fear.' Hayley's courage should be the shining light to all of us to show how she has faced her challenges head on. But today is Hayley's day and I want to briefly explain why. Late last year Hayley's classmates from Stroud Public School experienced a school adventure which brought them to the nation's capital and to the corridors of power in Parliament House. Sadly, due to her treatment regime, Hayley could not join them. But her classmates did not desert her. They made sure she was in their hearts and on their minds when they came to my Parliament House office and made personal contact with her. It was a special moment as they shared their special day together. Today, as I have said, is Hayley's special day. The experience Hayley's family have gone through with her illness is not an unTull common one in the Hunter. Every nine days a family in our area is told that their child has cancer. Such a diagnosis is always a traumatic experience for any family and the early treatment is usually carried out at the Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick because of the need for consultations with paediatric oncologists. Children are visited once a month at the John Hunter by their oncologist from Sydney, but such travel plans often do not fit with the ups and downs of the child's cancer illness. To their credit, NBN Television in December this year will contribute their substantial financial and emotional commitment towards helping change all that. The 1997 NBN telethon hopes to raise at least $2 million to build the NBN Children's Cancer Institute. The project aims to establish telemedicine links with the Randwick facility. The cancer institute will enable that to evolve and to bring to the Hunter a full-time oncologist. Hayley Tull is the special young lady at the front of what is a truly special Hunter community event; that is, the telethon. Her special day did not happen without the support and goodwill of a number of people, just like the telethon is not the success it is without the people of the Hunter digging deep into their pockets to support children's cancer research. I would like to personally thank Jerry MCGowan of Impulse Airlines, John Solatta of Newcastle Hire Cars, Rydges Hotel here in Canberra, Nerida Walker of the John Hunter Hospital and Jodie MCKay of NBN Television for their contributions to Hayley's special day. To our very own Newcastle Knights, the cast of Hot Shoe Shuffle, local Hunter company Valley Homes, Tom Ford, who has donated the land at Silvan Ridge, and the Disney on Ice production: the 1997 telethon has already reaped real dollars from your generosity. Today, I have been advised that BHP is coming to the party to match, like last time, dollar for dollar the contributions of local steelworkers. This should exceed $10,000. Finally, I wish to bring to your attention and that of the House why Hayley is wearing a hat. The sad reality is that chemotherapy causes rapid hair loss. Indeed, I think some of my close colleagues have probably already lost theirs in sympathy! Mr Speaker, I seek temporary indulgence to put on a hat as a sign of understanding and acceptance, like so many other children are doing, to show that we understand and to show most importantly that we care. God bless you, Hayley. I hope this was a special day for you.",110

139,Mr MUTCH,ADJOURNMENT,"Family history and other researchers will be pleased to hear that the government has agreed to an inquiry into the issue of census information retention. In October last year I moved in private members business a motion calling on the government to establish a public inquiry within 12 months of the 1996 census to examine whether census forms should continue to be destroyed after completion of the census. Following debate on the motion, which received some bipartisan support, I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) seeking the referral of an inquiry on the matter to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, chaired by Kevin Andrews MP and of which I am a member. I am now pleased to report that the Treasurer has responded positively and has written to the chairman of the committee to formally refer the matter. The terms of reference state: ""the Committee shall look at the current practice of destroying name-identified forms collected in population censuses and make recommendations for future censuses taking into account:(a) the effect retention would have on the quality, and hence the value, of data from future censuses and other ABS collections; (b) the privacy concerns relating to the storage and use of name-identified census data; (c) the value of name-identified records for medical, social and genealogical research released after a significant period of time; and (d) the cost of retention. The Treasurer's positive move follows continuing debate on the issue and strong lobbying by interested parties, including Nick Vine Hall of the census working party of the Australian Federation of Family History Organisations, and Michele Stephens of the Australian Family Tree Connections magazine. Retention is also supported by geneticists and demographers, among others, who find identified census information to be of immense value in research and who point out that other countries, such as the UK and the USA, preserve census forms with long-term embargoes on their public release. However, the current view of the Australian Bureau of Statistics is that by promising to destroy the original forms people are more likely to provide honest answers to census questions. On the other hand, members of the Advisory Council on Australian Archives have expressed concern that a major reference source is being lost to the nation. Whatever the outcome of this inquiry, I applaud the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for allowing the question of census retention to be comprehensively evaluated. Anyone who would like to make a submission to the inquiry should forward it to the committee secretary, House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600, phone 06 277 2358 or facsimile 06 277 4773. Bringing Them Home",111
140,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"Dobell) (5.43 p.m.}-I, like many members of this House, realise that one of the most important things to happen this week has been the release of the report by Sir Ronald Wilson and his co-commissioners entitled Bringing Them Home. An extract from the report concerns the story of Jennifer. In particular, I will read a quote about her life growing up in Cootamundra in New South Wales. This is about what was happening to this young girl as she was growing up: Cootamundra in those days was very strict and cruel. The home was overcrowded. Girls were coming and going all the time. The girls were taught reading, writing and arithmetic. All the had to learn to scrub, launder and cook. Mum remembered once a girl who did not move too quick. She was tied to the old bell post and belted continuously. She died that night, still tied to the post, no girl ever knew what happened to the body or where she was buried. Aunty Esther was a big girl for her age, so she was sent out as a cook to work at twelve years of age. Mum being of smaller build was sent out as children's nurse at fourteen. She had responsibility for four young children; one only a baby for 24 hours a day. Mum said they used to put girls ages up if they were big for their age and to send them out to work on properties. Some girls were belted and sexually abused by their masters and sent to the missions to have their babies. Some girls just disappeared never to be seen or heard of again. Eventually after several years Mum was sent to Rose Bay to work. Whilst in Sydney she met her sister Esther who was working in the Chatswood area. As far as 1 know neither Mum or Aunt Esther ever got paid for those hard working years under the Board. My mother often recalled the joyous time Aunty May came to Kempsey to see her sisters and father. The three young women hugged one another and cried with happiness and sadness for their sister and their mother. Early one morning in November 1952 ... Early one morning in November 1952 the manager from Burnt Bridge Mission came to our home with a policeman. 1 could hear him saying to Mum, 'I am taking the two girls and placing them in Cootamundra Home'. My father was saying, 'What right have you?'. The manager said he can do what he likes, they said my father had a bad character (I presume they said this as my father associated with Aboriginal people). They would not let us kiss our father goodbye, 1 will never forget the sad look on his face. He was unwell and he worked very hard all his life as a timber-cutter. This was the last time 1 saw my father, he died within two years after. We were taken to the manger's house at Burnt Bridge. Next morning we were in court. 1 remember the judge saying, 'These girls don't look neglected to me'. The manager was saying all sorts of things. He wanted us placed in Cootamundra Home. So we were sent away not knowing that it would be five years before we came back to Kempsey again. Mum used to write to us every week. Sometimes it would be 2 months before we received the letters, of course they were opened and read first. Sometimes parts would be tom out of letters by matron or whoever was in charge. girls That gives a very clear indication as to what happened to that young Aboriginal woman and some of the circumstances that have taken place during her life. The point I would like to make is that, given the size of this report and the importance of this report, Hansard and parliament can play a very crucial role in ensuring as many Australians as possible have a chance to read extracts from the report. That is why I hope as many members as possible will use their adjournment speeches to read extracts from this report to ensure as many Australians as possible can realise what has happened in Australia in days gone by. The important thing for us as members of this House is to make sure that we are prepared to face up to the past, to admit what has happened and to try to make sure that we can ensure a fundamental reconciliation with Australia's indigenous people. In that way, we can try to move forward and try to address some of the tremendous social, health and employment problems that indigenous people continue to face. Australian Labor Party Officials: Queensland",112
141,Mr MCDOUGALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Griffith) (5.48 p.m.)Queenslanders have been witnessing some amazing scenes over the past few months as two Labor Party heavies fight for control of the powerful AWU. The present incumbent Queensland ALP hit man, Bill Ludwig, and former federal member and leadership contender, Brian Courtice, have maintained their rage in the daily press. As a result, the papers have even run articles of how Mr Ludwig has avoided his tax obligations. But my concern is the shady deals which may not have made the papers. I have documents in my possession which include correspondence concerning a shady deal by Mr Ludwig in relation to his long service leave payments from the union. The amount in question is more than $100,000. But the material I have at hand alleges an even wider net of fraud and political chicanery involving three of Queensland's highest profile ALP figures-namely, Wayne Swan, former member for Lilley and state secretary of the ALP; the present secretary, Mike Kaiser; along with the former ALP candidate for my electorate, Kevin Rudd-all Ludwig loyalists. This trio of AWU and ALP executives, while publicly showing loyalty to Mr Ludwig, have apparently been doing deals with Mr John Della Bosca, the New South Wales ALP secretary. They are protecting their own positions in the event Mr Ludwig is rolled. But there is much more. I believe the accusations being made by me today regarding the former member, Mr Swan, require the closest examination of the government. Mr Swan is officially employed on the staff of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Mr Swan is based in Brisbane and is accommodated allegedly in the office of the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Mr Swan is a Commonwealth funded adviser to the opposition leader. From more than one source I am told that Mr Swan has never done a day's work in the member's office. In fact, he works from the state ALP headquarters in South Brisbane and is, in fact, the de facto state ALP secretary. Mr Swan, while being paid by the Australian taxpayer, is in fact working for the ALP. Surely, that is fraud. I have it on good advice that the Queensland ALP supplies his car, phone and fax services at home, along with audiovisual equipment. Even the Australian media reported Mr Swan going to the UK to assist the Tony Blair campaign. But the story from London is that, when he arrived at the British Labour headquarters describing himself as an Australian senior Labor strategist, he had never been heard of. So the British Labour Party put him to work letterbox dropping in Norfolk. The question must be asked: was Mr Swan on leave from his job in the opposition leader's office during his UK sojourn, or were the Australian taxpayers picking up the tab for his letterbox dropping activities in Norfolk? Are the Australian taxpayers picking up the tab for Mr Swan to continue to run the ALP? Is the Leader of the Opposition an accomplice in what, prima facie, could be fraud on the Commonwealth? What else are the taxpayers being fleeced for, as this highflying great political strategist continues his work for the ALP and possibly a Senate seat? This is the man who lost one of the ALP's safest seats in the last election. If Mr Ludwig and Mr Swan are what they appear to be, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) should launch investigations immediately. If the Leader of the Opposition is a party to any defrauding of the Commonwealth, he must resign. Australian Labor Party Officials: Queensland Bringing Them Home",113
142,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"-I am just amazed that the previous speaker should be bringing these charges against the former honourable member for Lilley. He ought to be reminded of the fact that this is not the first time that the Liberal Party has brought these charges against the former member. Of course, the last time they brought these charges against him on the floor of this House under privilege they were found to be totally unfounded. You will eat your words, Member. It is not the first time that you have gone after the former member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, on the floor of the parliament, and it will not be the last time that your allegations will be found to be totally unfounded. This week in the parliament a momentous report was tabled: the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families entitled Bringing Them Home. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in discussing these matters on the floor of this parliament, was certainly in an emotional state. I challenge any member in this place to open this report and to reflect on some of the experiences of those children and not be totally moved by that situation. Those children were forcibly removed from their parents under assimilationist legislation and they suffered greatly for it. I read an extract from the experiences of one of those children: My mother and brother could speak our language and my father could speak his. I can't speak my language. Aboriginal people weren't allowed to speak their language while white people were around. They had to go out into the bush or talk their lingoes on their own. Aboriginal customs like initiation were not allowed. We could not leave Cherbourg to go to Aboriginal traditional festivals. We could have a corroboree if the Protector issued a permit. It was completely up to him. I never had a chance to learn about my traditional and customary way of life when I was on the reserves. None of us on the floor of this parliament would tolerate and, hopefully, none of us on the floor of this parliament would inflict that situation on any of our children or our neighbour's children. As the report says, 'Many children were told they were unwanted, rejected or that their parents were dead.' The following is confidential evidence from a person who gave evidence to that inquiry: I remember this woman saying to me, 'Your mother's dead, you've got no mother now. That's why you're here with us'. Then about two years after that my mother and my mother's sister all came to The Bungalow but they weren't allowed to visit us because they were black. They had to sneak around onto the hills. Each mother was picking out which they think was their children. And this other girl said, 'Your mother up there'. And because they told me that she was dead, I said, 'No, that's not my mother. I haven't got a black mother'. I read another part of the experience of these children who were taken away from their parents which is well documented in this report: There was a big poster at the end of the dining room and it used to be pointed out to us all the time when religious instruction was going on in the afternoon. They had these Aborigine people sitting at the end of this big wide road and they were playing cards, gambling and drinking. And it had this slogan which they used to read to us and point to us while they're saving us from ourselves and giving our souls to the Lord. It had, 'Wide is the road that leads us into destruction', which lead up into hell. The other side they had these white people, all nicely dressed, leading on this road, and 'Narrow is the road that leads us into the kingdom of life or the kingdom of God'. What a tragedy for the lost generation. What a tragedy for the stolen children. None of us on the floor of this parliament would tolerate that sort of experience for our children. It should never have been allowed for the children of the Aboriginal nation of this country. Employment",113
143,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"Bowman) (5.57 p.m). I rise tonight with some good news, some hopeful news, some news of hope and success. I do not accept, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) spoke of last night, the total admission of failure of employment policy by this government. In my electorate I have a success story where unemployed people are helping themselves to jobs. I was privileged recently to launch the JUICE program-Join Us In Creating Employment. This program is being coordinated by the Redlands Employment and Placement Service, formerly known as Redlands Skillshare, now known as REPS. Participants in the JUICE program have been using bicycles to visit businesses in the Redlands area to ask if there are any job vacancies. At the start of the program, REPS trainers give the participants a course in cold canvassing and""tips on presentation. The participants are then loaded into a minibus with the bikes in tow and taken to various parts of the Redlands. And already the JUICE program is showing signs of success. In the first three weeks, 17 partIcIpants found ten unadvertised job vacancies. Since then, 41 participants have identified 103 unadvertised positions. And if the person who finds the vacancy is not qualified for the position, another participant will be offered the job. The JUICE program is the brainchild of REPS manager, John Conley, although, to be completely honest, John varied the idea from our former DEETYA area manager, Lesley Hale. Lesley, formerly from Victoria, mentioned a program she had seen running, in which participants rode motor scooters. John, in conjunction with his REPS team, modified the idea to pushbikes. Through their efforts, REPS secured an $11,000 grant from this government through the local OLMA committee. With this money, REPS purchased bikes from local bike shop owners, Michael and Ruth Usher, at a very good price. And there has been no looking back. JUICE coordinator, Wayne Webb, has been quoted as saying that the program is boosting the employment opportunities within the Redlands as well as giving job seekers a confidence and motivational boost. I could not agree more. Motivation and confidence are two of the most vital ingredients in successful job seeking. By working on a daily basis with other self-motivated people, all participants get to improve their communication skills and build their self-esteem.",114
