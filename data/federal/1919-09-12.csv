LEAGUE OF NATIONS : LABOUR represented CONFERENCE.",20
3,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I desire to a3k the Acting Leader of the House whether, in view of the fact that the Labour Conference under the League ofNations Covenant will, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), shortly be held at Washington, the Government will take into consideration the advisableness .consulting the trade unions of Australia - with the object of devising means of sending to that Conference men who will fittingly represent them?",20
4,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,WXes. My recollection is that it is an integral part of the.Covenant that the forces of labour and of .capital shall be equally represented in any sueh enterprise.,20

7,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"""Will the Acting Leader of the House state whether there is truth in the report that an Imperial ference is to he beid early next year; if so, whether it is the intention of the Government to send to that Conference representatives of all. political parties, including the Farmers' party?",20
8,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There appears to be no end to the multiplication of parties in almost every country. I am iinable to say for the moment whether there is to be an Imperial Conference early next year.,20
9,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,There has been some talk,20
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Quite so; and I should think it very probable that such Goa Conference will be held. Whatever other Dominion is represented at such a to Conference, it would be a calamity for to Australia to be absent. We are further I away from the heart of the Empire than with is any other Dominion. Representatives conof Canada may cross over in a week for all sorts of consultations with the Imperial Government. I strongly emphasize - the absolute necessity of Australia being at all such Conferences, whenever and wherever they may take place. EXPORT OF HORSE FLESH - ",20
11,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether any person or persons, individually orcollectively, have ' approached theGoof vernment to ask permission for, or to advocate, the exportation of horse flesh?",20

13,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"I am unable to say at the moment what action has been taken. by the Government. I do know, however, that efforts are being made at the other end of the world secure increased refrigerated space the carriage of our meat overseas. If the honourable member will give notice his question, I will furnish him with full answer. PREFERENTIAL TRADE.",21
14,Mr FENTON,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"I desire to ask Minister for the Navy whether he or the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), as the representatives of Australia at the Peace Conference, made any definite proposigiven tion to nations other than Great Britain, overseas. and particularly to France, in regard to preferential trade? If so, will he acquaint the House at the earliest 'possible date of the nature of that proposition?",21
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"My imprestralia, sion is that no such undertaking has'been given to - any nation. I suggest to the honourable member that he give notice .his question; he will then obtain a plete answer from the Prime Minister. CONTROL OF INTER-STATE SHIPPING.",21
16,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Will the Minsituation ister .for the Navy state what steps, - any, have been taken to release Inter-State steamers from Government control?  one which I think I should answer. I ordinary circumstances, the present tem of control will shortly lapse, and the question of whether it should be continued is now being discussed with the can for his own. .steam-ship owners. We have to take every care - that the' Australian coastal service is not denuded of shipping to the inducements offered to ship-owners to send their vessels to other ports where much better freights are offering, where high prices can be obtained for their ships. NA SERVICE. LEAVE TO CLERICAL STAFF, COCKATOO ISLAND. Mr JOHN' THOMSON - On 31st July last, the then Acting Prime Min-' ister (Mr Groom) promised that all temto porary employees in the Commonwealth for service who had been on active service would be given leave to the extent to which of they would have been entitled to it had a they remained in Australia. Will .the Minister for the Navy, in agreement with that promise, give instructions that the same consideration be given to temporary employees on the Clerical Staff the at Cockatoo Naval Dockyards?",21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"Yes , I think every possible consideration should be to those who have "" done their b it "" COOL STORAGE.",21
18,Mr BLAKELEY,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"In view of the congested condition of cool stores in Ausand pending the provision of the insulated shipping space necessary to convey our frozen produce overseas, will the of Goveniment take steps to provide the comnecessary cool storage for rabbits and other frozen produce?",21
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,It is easy to ask that we should begin immediately to duplicate our cool storage buildings. I suggest that the better way to relieve the would be to ship the frozen proi f duce at present in our cool stores.,21
20,Mr MAHONT,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,The better way would be to sell it at cheap rates to the people.,21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,My honourable n friend is always anxious to sell cheaply systhe produce of other people's labour.,21
22,Mr COKSEB,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,And to get as much as he,21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"Exactly . Whenever any one else's labour is involved, he owing will sell it cheaply.",21
24,Mr WEST,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"On a point of order, I suband mit, Mr Speaker, that the Minister is not entitled, in replying to a question, to. debate it, and make a long speech.",21
25,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC," The easiest way to avoid bates on lengthy replies is to refrain interjections which provoke replies. If honourable members do not desire to hear answers to questions, and intimate that fact, Ministers will doubtless refrain from replying to them. I am unable to say what should be the answer made by a Minister to any question put to him. Obviously many questions are of such a nature - as to involve more or less lengthy replies.",22
26,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"I wish only to emphasize the point that I am not in favour of cheap or sweated labour, whewith ther it be that of the rabbit trapper, wheat farmer, or any one else. This country should pay the best wages to everybody.",22
27,Mr BLAKELEY,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,What about my quesDepartment tion? . Sir JOSEPH OOOK- I hope sincerely that we may soon'have more ships to relieve the situation. ALLOWANCE POST OFFICES.,22
28,Mr FLEMING,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"Some little time ago the Postmaster-General promised to look .into the position of allowance postmasters and postmistresses. ""Will he tell the House what has been the result of his inquiry ?",22
29,Mr WEBSTER,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"The matter has. been looked into, with the result that I have decided to remove the cause of the complaints so frequently made by honourable members, that I have been sweating employees of the Department. I have determined, having regard to the financial position, to reduce the hours of service where I cannot increase the rates of pay. That, I think, will be effective DUTY ON CEMENT. '",22
30,Mr NICHOLLS,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,"I u view of the fact that Japan is subsidizing shipping, and that cement from that country can be landed in Australia at 8s. per ton, will the Minister for Trade and Customs see that no reduction oin the duty on oemeffit takes place?",22
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETURNED SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC,The matter has aldeready received my consideration in conr from nexion with the forthcoming Tariff. NA REGIMENTS.,22
32,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister for Defence a question relating to Australian-born soldiers who enlisted in British regiments. . These men were in Great Britain when the war broke out, and, being anxious to volunteer, were induced to join British regiments. They endeavoured afterwards, without success, to secure a transfer to Australian units, the result .that, on their return to the Australia they are treated as British reservists, and are hot entitled to the privilege's extended to members of the A.I.F. in respect of Australian rates of pay and repatriation rights. Will the of Defence take action to remedy this state of 'affaixs?",22
33,Mr WCESE,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,I will submit the matter to the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell). . PEACE LOAN.,22
34,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"In view of the disquieting statement made iby the Acting Prime  prospects of the new loan now being raised, will the Government take into consideration the question of the extent to which that uncertainty may be created by the uneasiness in the public mind as to the Government's attitude towards the Tariff and the protection of Australian industries, and by the fear that Ministers - are intent on plunging the country into a premature election?",22
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"It is perfectly - clear that my friend believes an election 1 is to be held very soon. Honourable members interjecting,,",22
36,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H," Order ! I ask honourable members to allow the Minister, to reply.",22
37,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"I hope and be-' lieve that the people of Australia will undoubtedly have the cash to give us that' loan, and give it in an 'overwhelmingly generous manner. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS, COURT MARTIAL, ON HMAS. "" AUSTRALIA ""-DEPORTATIONS .  orable member for East Sydney (Mr. West) asked a question about the release of the men - who were sentenced for mutiny on the HMAS. Australia, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) did not treat honourable members with that de- ference to which we had been accustomed from the Acting Minister for the Navy  that the Government were doing everything they could in the matter to get the British Admiralty to let these men out of gaol, but his colleague adopted a bellicose attitude, and practically defied honourable members of the Opposition.",22
38,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H," Unde r the cover of making a personal explanation the honourable member is not entitled to reflect on any other honourable member.  What I am not permitted to say now I can say directly the House goes into Committee of Supply. Let me quote the exact words used' by the Minister as recorded by HansardMay I say to my friendsopposite, since they will have it that way, that all the statements they care to make in the House will not influence the Navy to the extent of a hair's breadth",23
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"In the .matter of discipline.  made use of these remarks that I interjected as follows:It is a pity some of them do not sink the ships in Sydney Harbor. That is what they ought to do. It would' make the - Navy take notice of them. My words in cold print would seem to indicatethat I was inciting the men on the Australian Fleet to mutiny and rebellion, but such a thought was as far from my mind as it possibly could be. Having subjected myself to military discipline in my past, I know, asevery other honourable member knows, that discipline must be maintained, mot only in a Fleet, but also among any body of men. Therefore I am sorry that I interjected as I did , seeing that my words bear the construction that T sought to incite the men on / these vessels to mutiny. My only desire was to get them out of gaol.",23
40,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,But the Minister incited the honourable member to say what he did.,23
41,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"I object to that statement. It isout of order, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",23
42,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"The interjection of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. Finlayson) certainly seems to convey a reflection on the Minister for the Navy, and as he takes exception to it, I ask the honourable member to withdraw it. The interjection in itself was disorderly, but the personal nature of it rendered it more so.",23
43,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"I think that my interjection conveyed the right meaning, but if the Minister objects to it , I certainly withdraw it .  Minister's attitude in. answering the question put by the honourable member for East Sydney that fired me, because-1 feel very strongly on this matter. I apologize to' the House for taking up honourable members' time in making this explanation, but in cold print my words bear a construction, that was as far from my intention as the poles are asunder.",23
44,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"Following the graceful example of the honourable mem say a few words of explanation. Some little time ago, on the discussion of a motion for the adjournment of the House to consider the question of deportations, I brought up the case of a person, whom I did not designate by name, but whom I indicated, and whose name I subsequently handed' into the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), who was in charge of the House at the time. I made a complaint in. Tegard to that man and his proposed deportation, and, of course, I made it on good faith and on evidence which I considered was absolutely sufficiently sound to justify it . However, I have found since then, that I had no basis of complaint, as the man had none, and I say now that he was not badly or unfairly treated by the Defence authorities. It is only right that I 1 should doi this. Having such a perfect gallery of excellent grievances, I have no need' to introduce any fictitious ones. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIA L FORCE.",23
45,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"(for Mr . SINCLAIR ) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence,' upon noticeWill the Minister inform the House of1.

The number of mental cases as a result of active service? 4. The number of deceased soldiers who have left dependants?",24
46,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIANS INBRITIS H,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Thirty-five have returned; the number of blind soldiers yet to return is not available. 2. The number of totally incapacitated soldiers in the Australian Imperial Force from a military stand-point up to the present date is, as far as can be ascertained, 12,060. 3. Number of mental cases recorded.is as follows:464 who have served in firing line; 242 who have not served in firing line. 4. No records are available in the Defence Department showing the number of dependants of deceased soldiers. NA APPLICATIONS.",24
47,Dr MALONEY,AMERICAN PATENT,"the Attorney General, upon notice Whether he will, in accordance with a request made to the honourable member for Melbourne by patent agents, supply answers to the following questions:1. Is it a fact that the Commissioner of Patents is still demanding that companies established in America shall answer the following question when applying for patents in Australia, viz.:-""Are you a company (or firm) constituted in and carrying on business in the territory of a State at war with the King""? 2. Will the Attorney-General state whether patents will be refused to American companies if they do not answer what is held to be an out-of-date question? 3. When will the Commissioner of Patents , cease wholly to demand written answers to such questions?",24
48,Mr GROOM,AMERICAN PATENT,"for Mr HUGHES) The answers to the honourable member's qnestions are as follow:\. Yes. The question is asked of every applicant wherever resident. 2. An application will not proceed unless the question is answered. 3. When the present state of war terminates. HENDERSON NAVA L BASE. CASUALTIES. Mr JOHN THOMSON (for Mr . BURCHEL L) asked the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice I. Whether the Government are yet in a position to re-commence operations on the Henderson Naval Base? 2. If not, what are the reasons for delay?",24

50,Mr ATKINSON,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon, noticeHas he, as promised, had inquiries made as to the advisability of establishing a quarantine station at some suitable place in Northern Tasmania ?",24
51,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"As all quarantine restrictions on travel between Tasmania and the mainland have now been withdrawn, the necessity .for the immediate establishment of a quarantine station in Northern Tasmania does not require further con- v sideration. The question of a permanent quarantine station in Northern Tasmania demands careful consideration. No decision has yet been reached. KALGOORLIE - PO RT AUGUSTA . RAILWAY. AMBULANCE ARRANGEMENT. . Mr GROOM - On the 20th ultimo the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) stated in this House It has been the custom bn the East-West Railway line, when any one is sick or injured along the line, to send a message to Port Augusta for the ambulance to wait there for the patient. I am informed that of late this arrangement has been cut out by the Department. Will the Minister for Works and Bailways inquire why, with a view to re-establishing the custom, as it was of great assistance to those who are sick on that long journey, or those injured out in the wilds of Australia? My reply thereto wasI was not aware of the practice having been discontinued. It seems a very proper one to continue, and I shall bring the matter under the notice of the'Railways Commissioner imme- diately. I have meanwhile made inquiries, and am informed by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner that that practice has not been discontinued. SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1919-20.

52,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Hindmarsh) [11.29] - The chief feature of the debate upon this motion has been the manner in which honourable members of the Opposition have constantly referred to the question of profiteering. One would almost imagine from their remarks that they claimed a monopoly of the subject, and that honourable members on the Ministerial side were anxious to see profiteering kept going in perpetuity. Of course, it is quite unnecessary for us to say that we are just as anxious as honourable mem-_ bers opposite to see profiteering brought to as speedy an end as possible; but I am rather inclined to think that the motive influencing honourable members opposite is not so much the desire to get rid of the profiteer as it is to u^e him as a very desirable political card. With the prospect of an early election they believe that it will be a nice cry to put before the electors in order to accentuate the differences between capital and labour. Instead of our having real peace in the community, we shall have as much class hatred as it is possible to bring about.",25
53,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The honourable member is creating class hatred now.,25
54,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"We are all pleased to see the honourable member for Macquarie return to us in health and strength, and he will understand that my remark does not apply to him, but the subject has been brought forward in season and out of season in every debate during the last few months. It is not the profiteering that is troubling honourable members opposite so much. It is the class hatred that, from their point if view, is so desirable for the purposes - of their party propaganda. We hear a great deal about the party being given representation at all .Conferences, but the question is: which party opposite is to be given representation? According to this morning's newspapers, those engaged in the boot trade of Sydney have, to their honour, instituted a Whitley Commission Board, in order to bring about better relations between employers and employed. But in the same issue' we read that the Tradesand Labour Council of Sydney condemns the movement, because its members are anxious, like honourable members opposite, to keep class hatred alive, for the purpose of arousing rebellion in the country. That is their object. If Ave are to have an International Conference, I hope the Government will seriously consider whom they are going to allow to represent Labour on it. Are they going to permit this revolutionary crew, who do not represent Labour, to represent it, or are they going to allow the men behind the Whitley Commission to do so? The two cursed storm centres in Australia are the Trades Hall, Sydney, and the Tivdes Hall, Melbourne. They are keeping up this embittered feeling for their own ends, to the detriment of the welfare of the people of this country. ' Mr WEST - Leave Sydney alone.",25
55,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The honourable member takes his orders from the Sydney Trades Hall. I say emphatically that the section on the other side of the House that professes and claims to represent - Labour does not represent it.' I represent it better than they do. I represent it on the lines of the Whitley Commission, that can save the workers and bring prosperity to this country, and to every other country where it is tried. Now that the question of profiteering has been raised in this debate, let me ask what is the cause of profiteering, and who created rt? This House is very largely responsible. I do not say that the House did it intentionally, but it committed an error of judgment in fixing the rates of tax. in the War-time Profits Tax Act. We did not take the whole of the wartime profits, as we should have done. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs), when Treasurer in a Labour Government, proposed, I think, to take 60 per cent., the 'remaining 40 per cent, to go to the individual. Both in the Caucus and' out of it I w.as in favour of taking every pound of the war-time profits. If a man was eager to make a profit-and every one of us, if in the same position, would be equally guilty-and he knew .that the - Government were going to take 60 per cent, and leave him 40 .per cent., he would .naturally increase his prices iai order to increase his share of the profits. The responsibility for profiteering, if it - exists to the extent claimed by honourable members and the press, rests largely, if not wholly, with this House. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - If you take all a man's profits, there is no incentive for him to work at all.",25
56,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I am speaking of war profits. I think the ultimate solution of this question lies in 'a recognition of principle that all war profits should go to the Treasury. There is a difficulty in dealing with Trusts and Combines, but 1 think we can cope with them by limiting their profits. We could allow them a certain net profit, although I am not prepared at this stage to suggest any definite figure. That is the line on which the House and the country will have to proceed. There should not be high prices in the case of locally-manufactured productions, but until we get back to normal freight conditions, it would be better if some of the oversea commodities, which are absolutely essential to us, were imported solely by the Government, rather than that private individuals should be allowed to make great profits out of them at the expense of the consumers and the public generally. This Parliament and the country must face this question, and the sooner we do it the better. We are not likely to get much assistance from the State Parliaments. Individuals at times grow tired of power, and give it up, but there has never yet been an instance of an organization or combination of interests relaxing its grasp of power unless it is absolutely kicked out. Until the public take up this question of the powers of the Commonwealth and States, the States will never do anything except squabble among themselves, and devise every conceivable scheme to keep the powers they have. We must remodel our Federal Constitution on the lines of the Constitution of Canada. That is the only type of Federation that can be worked under the British connection.",26
57,Mr SAMPSOIT,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Coul d that be done by any amendment of the Constitution as it stands, or would it be necessary to recast the whole position ?",26
58,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I think it would be quite possible, by means of two or three carefully-drafted amendments , but the quickest and most effective way would be a Convention on the same lines as the one which built up our present Constitution. A Constitution like OUTS, which is simply a "" pup "" of the American Constitution, can be worked on. a Republican principle such as obtains in America; but it is utterly impossible to do it under the connection with the British Crown, and as I am strongly in. favour of the British connection, and the the last man to think of having anything else, I consider that OUT best way is to set about putting our own house in order so that our Constitution will be able to work as smoothly as does that of South Africa or Canada. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has shown a great amount of industry and taken a great deal of interest in connection with banking returns, but I would respectfully call his attention to a phase of the question which he appears to overlook. He pays too much attention to' bankers simply as custodians of money, and loses sight of the fact lhat they are also dealers in credit. After we instituted the Australian Note issue, there was a strong feeling, both outside and inside the House, expressed here by Sir William Irvine and others, that we were increasing the issue out of proportion to the gold reserve, and beyond the point of safety. . TheTe was some talk about the danger of a collapse, although fears of that kind were never well-founded. One of the reasons for the present high prices is the tremendous amount of paper o money in circulation all over the world, and the appreciation of gold. A number of professors are wandering about, both here and in other countries, offering quack remedies and nostrums, but all their spouting on tubs cannot doaway with the inevitable working of the economic laws which govern currency. ""We cannot get away from Gresham's law, the effects of which we are now realizing. Of course, the amount of paper money in circulation in Australia is a mere bagatelle, and I am not referring to it at all, nor questioning, the undoubted safety and soundness of our. present currency; but in England, and all the Allied countries, there is a perfect deluge of paper money in existence, and the fact that the exchange value of the English sovereign in New York was 17s. 6d. last week indicates that Gresham's law is in operation. I do not know what the exchange value of the English sovereign in New York is today. I hope it has improved; but it is more likely to have gone down to 1.7s., and that result is only the logical effeGt of the quantity of. paper money that is in circulation. I am giving, not the views of political quacks and mountebanks, but of shrewd men whounderstand the financial position of the world. The position is serious, although I do not say it cannot be got over: It requires careful, calm, and dispassionate review, and no man whooccupies a seat in the Australian Parliament should deliberately inflame the minds of the people outside on the question. Seeing that the people are already suffering enough from high prices, members who address them should at least tell them the truth, and not make statements which aTe a long way from it. It has been suggested that Europe and even Australia will have to live on credit. If that means anything, it means that we shall have practically to live on the production of Australia, both primary and secondary, before it is actually available, by means of bills of credit and so forth. I do not aay that such a. thing could not be done. It can be done, and I believe it will be done; but when a proposal of that kind is seriously put forward as a means of carrying the community through the present troubled times, it is no occasion for political mountebanks to wander about and. inflamethe public mind merely to make party capital for' their own personal ends.. Men who do . that are nothing but a. gang of place-hunters who want power, and care absolutely nothing for the true interests of the country. I do not propose to say any more on the subject of profiteering, but it is a problem that must be, and I believe will be, faced. But we shall face it more effectively if we deal with the matter honestly, and give the outside public the facts of the case. I wish to deal with one matter in. connection, with the administration of. the Trade and Customs Department. A great amount of irritation can be caused through the Government interfering with matters that do not concern them at all. In South Australia, there is strong feeling on account of the action of the Trade and Customs Department in suppressing the sale of the Mattei remedies. Those remedies have been in use in South Australia for a number of years, and many people believe that they have derived much good from them. The agent for them was Mr Wendt, a prominent jeweller in Adelaide. The old gentleman did not seek to make any profit out of the sale of these remedies; he distributed them as a work of lovej and on his death he bequeathed the agency to his son, through whom the people have been able to get the remedies without having to pay any handling cost or middleman's profit. Experts discovered that certain so-called remedies are injurious, and the Customs Act was amended to enable their importation! to be prohibited. If there are any so-called remedies which are injurious, suppress them by all means, and put in gaol those who deal in them. Prison is the proper place for persons who dishonestly make money out of the ailments of their neighbours. The Customs Department obtained the formula of the Mattei remedies, and experts pronounced that they contained nothing that would give any benefit to those who used them. They did not discover that the remedies contained any ingredients that would be injurious to the human system. If patent medicines are doing no harm, why should the Government interfere with their sale? One. of the Mattei remedies contains three or four ingredients which the Government experts say will do nobody any good.. How do they know that? Medical experts profess to. know everything, but when .there is - an epidemic of disease in the community they show they know nothing at all. How can they say that certain ingredients mixed in fixed proportions will not produce beneficial results? layman, say it is impossible for a medical man to make any such positive declaration. In any case, though these patent medicines may not do much good by themselves, yet the people haye faith in them, and that faith helps to effect a cure. Of the thousands of people in Melbourne and other cities who go to 'doctors only half are ill ; the others merely fancy they are ill . To the latter a doctor gives a bottle of coloured water, and as they have faith in that prescription they consider themselves cured in a short time. The reputation of the medicalprofession is maintained by the fact that the doctors cure people who really have no ailments, and it is a profitablegame. In defending the distribution of the Mattei remedies, I have a right to ask why the Government should allow the medical profession to sell coloured water to ppople who merely fancy they are ill . Is not that fraud? I do not blame the medical profession very much; we mustall recognise human nature, and it would be contrary to human nature to refuse to sell to people something they fancy they need. A medical friend of mine said to ine, ""Why blame me? A patient comes to me and says he is ill . I know there nothing the matter with him, but if I - tell him so he goes to another doctor around the corner, who says, ' You will be dead in a week if you do not take my prescription.'"" - Mr NICHOLLS - Does the honourable member include the whole of the medical profession in that description?",26
59,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Yes . Even a doctor on the higher rungs of the profession, who charges £10 10s. for an interview, will not tell a patient that there is nothing the matter with him if by so doing he will jeopardize the' substantial income he is getting from that patient's family ",28
60,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I shall have to introduce the honourable member to my medical adviser. From him he will get good treatment.,28
61,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I am not referring to doctors in their treatment of serious illness. I should be sorry if my reflections were applied to all members of the medical profession in all circumstances. I divide the medical profession into three classes. One-third of the I, a doctors and surgeons ought to be gaoled for getting money under false pretences; others know a little and do small harm; the remainder of the profession are really able men, who can tell by the look of a patient what is the matter with him. They have an instinct for the profession, and .without that instinct no man can be a good physician. I ask .the Government to allow the Mattei remedies to be distributed in South Australia. One man has told me that they have done him a great amount of good. I said that 1 did not think they had done him much good; except in so far as he believed they had. He - insisted that the remedies themselves had actually been efficacious. By"" a little ingenuity he was able to get a supply of these remedies from Italy, but the Customs Department seized them, and will not release them. This Parliament has a right to say that no man shall take advantage of the ailments or the credulity of his neighbours, but when there is a-demand for a patent medicine which the authorities cannot prove to be in any way injurious, this Parliament is going outside its province in prohibiting the distribution of it . Honourable members may think that I am is treating this subject in a spirit of levity, but I remind them of the history of "" the Peculiar People,"" a sect who were, com- mon in London in the sixties. They comprised mostly engine-drivers, firemen, and other employees of the Great Eastern - Railway. They, did not believe in employing the services of a doctor at all; they were harmless, honest, Christian people who followed literally the teaching of the Old Book,, that the Lord will restore those who have faith. The Peculiar People practised that faith, and official returns showed that they were the most healthy community in the East end of London, but they fell foul of the Government through not calling in medical aid in cases of illness amongst infants. I recollect several prosecutions at. the Old Bailey in the. early sixties on charges of manslaughter, because children had died without having received medical attention. The last of tliese cases was tried before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, who stopped the proceedings and asked that the elders of the sect should see him i his room. There he told them that whilst the law did not desire to interfere ware. with their f a it h , they must employ services of a doctor in cases of illness amongst children. On tlieir giving that promise, the accused person was liberated ou bail, and from that date no further prosecutions have taken place. In the old files of the London Daily Telegraph honourable members may read articles written on this subject by the late George Augustus Sala, and they show a record of a community of working people noted for their simple and blameless lives, who were healthier than any other secthan tion of the East E nd population. in Therefore, let no honourable member tell me that there is no power in f a i th cure ailments. How far faith will cure in other cases I cannot say; I merely mention what happened in connection with one sect who practised faith-healing. This Parliament has no right to prevent any person using so-called remedies unremaining less they can be proved to be injurious. I again ask the Government to remove the prohibition on the sale of the Mattei i'G ui G d i",28
62,Dr MALONEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Melbourne) [11.37]. - W it h much that was said by the honorshould able member who has just resumed his seat I absolutely - agree. I wpuld contradict anybody who stated that Mrs. Eddy, the Christian Scientist, has done more good in curing illness than has any body of medical men in the world. I desire, without heat, to continue my remarks on a matter with which I was dealing last evening. I was unable to state then what had been the loss on the have referred to, could be absorbed. Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms. Honwish orable members on both sides have conpay tradicted my statements. In justice myself, I have obtained authentic inforlutely mation for the year 1917-18, and it shows that the .loss was £1,309. The able member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), what we desire. in dealing with this matter, excluded wages, which could hardly be done in connection with anv business concern. would be very easv to conduct a restauand rant in Melbourne and give good food and attention if ' the proprietor had not than the percentage accepted. to pay wages. Therefore I think statement made by the honourable memapproached ber may be reviewed from different points of view. I understand that no rent is paid,- and nothing for lighting, though were accepted. T believe a certain amount is allowed f firing. Further, no expense is incurred u for cutlery, except in the way of replacements, or for linen, crockery, or glassI f honourable members desire a the club, which they sometimes are accused of enjoying here, let them contribute to. its upkeep. It has been thought by some that I objected to paying the prices asked in the Refreshment Rooms; but that I have never done. I have objected, however, to a difference being made between the price asked from - a member for meals and the price charged in the case of others who are 'permitted to use the Refreshment and Rooms. People outside, perhaps more we do, regard it as an honour to dine Parliament. House; and I am sure that no . honourable, member would object if a to little extra were charged in the case of visitors - I have not the figures for this year, because the accounts have not been audited up to SOth June. There may be great loss .experienced in the event of the Houses suddenly adjourning, and no one to partake of the meals; and I suggest that the proper method, under the circumstances, would be either to donate the food to soriie charitable institution, or enter into a contract with a city caterer who could make use of it . Personally, I like to see the experiment tried of permitting the Refreshment Rooms staff, not who have been here for some years, and are all steady, reliable men, to for m a small co-operative company amongst themselves to carry out the necessary catering. If that were done, this little company could also have a restaurant in the city, where any waste, such as that I I to emphasize that honourable members full value for what they receive in the to Refreshment Rooms; and it is an absofalse idea, which is entertained widely outside, that we have here a nice honorlittle club, where we can eat and drink I believe that some 700,000 men offered It their military services to Australia; I notice from the records that the percentage refused was larger This, of the course, would become accentuated as we the end of the war, and ou: younger men were going away. Of the 700,000 men who offered, soine 430,000 These figures show that or at least 70 per cent, of our available men of military age offered their services. We have been told by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that of our war expenditure of £350,000,000, we may possibly receive £50,000,000 by way of indemnity. Before. the war the wealth of Australia was estimated at £1,200,000,000, and since the war we have been told by our Statist and other authorities that the wealth has more than doubled. ""We may-take the cost of the war at £400,000,000, and the present'wealth of Australia at not less than £1,600,000,000. Honourable members, of course, will recognise that that estimate is only approximate; but could even the wealthiest combine of capitalists in the world, headed by Rockefeller, with his £200,000,000, hope to purchase Australia for even double the present valuation t As a matter of fact, we, as a people, would not permit it. If we allow 33 pel oent. on the £1,600,000,000, we have £520,000,000. That, I recognise, is a very large 'amount; so we may allow 25 per cent., representing £400,000,000, which would pay every penny of the debt incurred for the war, and afford substantial.relief to every man, woman, and child who, at the present time, are in some cases being unfairly taxed. ""We must all agree that the soldiers, in their interview with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) yesterday, "" h it the nail on the head""; and I am glad to observe that the honourable gentleman, in regard to the hand-weaving of ANZAC tweeds, gave the. men an answer that would have bpen given long ago in. this House if the common-sense ability of the Treasurer (Mr Watt) had been at the disposal of the Department. ""We all know that many of our returned men are not getting a fair chance.. Some, blessed with good luckor, shall I say, influence-ca n obtain loans from the Repatriation Department, where others with fair claims, who have done good , work, and earned equal honour, are refused. One decent fellow who required £25 for furniture was, after a few weeks' delay, absolutely denied, and another man-on e of the finest physically I ever examined-wa s refused £150, which he desired to devote to the purchase of a fishcurrency ing boat, in order to supply food that is at present sadly needed in Melbourne. Under these circumstances, I ' have ' thought out a plan, which I shall probably bring before the House in the form of a motion at an early date. If this suggesDr Maloney. tion of mine were adopted we could supply a home,, for every returned soldier without the possibility of the Government losing 10 per cent, of the money advanced. The Government would hold the whole of the security in their hand's, and would be able to follow the good example of New South Wales, where, two years ago, I learned that there were 900 war widows who have had no fear of the landlord's knock. In Victoria, which approximates most nearly to New South Wales in the matter of population,, there was only one widow so happily circumstanced, and she had been provided for, at Brunswick, by the kindly contributions of kindly individuals. The motion, of which I shall probably give notice next week, is in the following terms:That in the opinion of this House it is desirable that every returned soldier, sailor, or nurse., who has fought in the fighting line, and who is married, or about to be married, or the widow of those who paid the supreme sacrifice of death, shall be entitled to the use of a house for a rental of ls. per month during the lifetime of such husband or wife, or, in the case of their death leaving children, until the youngest child shall reach 16 years of age. (2) That such ANZAC welcome homes shall be built, where possible, in healthy garden suburbs, where high position, healthy surroundings, and cheap, reasonably-priced land can be obtained, and, where needed (and electricity is obtainable), tram lines to be laid down. (3) That in order to prevent exploitation, the Commonwealth Government enact that compulsory purchase shall be made law on the basis of the land tax valuation of the State and Commonwealth, or either of them, with costs for disturbance to the owners. (4) That on the death of the husband and wife, without leaving children, or where orphans are left, on the youngest reaching 16years, such ANZAC home shall be let or sold, and the assets used to liquidate the ANZAC Home Advance Fund. (.5) Tbat all ANZAC homes be of varied standardized plans, varying insize with number of children. (6) That, in order to finance the ANZAC homes, the Federal G'overnment be empowered' to issue notes, eaT-marked as the ANZAC Homes. Currency Notes, guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government, by the value of the land and houses, and also by the increased f u t u r e value known as the unearned increment. . That these notes be issued and legalized as without interest, and issued as required, and that when any assets were returned* by rents or sales, &c, the value of such asset should be cancelled in ANZAC Home Currency Notes of equal value in order that in the course of time, assisted by the yearly contribution of State and Oommomvealth Governments, the whole issue would be desr.oyed, but the homes would remain as a permanent asset. In my early days I ithought that if we could eliminate the landlord, fairly and justly, it would be a benefit to the community; and in the case of a number of houses of which I was the nominal owner - barrin g a few ""blisters""- I made the tenants their own owners much to their present satisfaction. I also have the happiness to enjoy the good feeling of these people for what I then did. In support - of the suggestion made in the motion I have just read, I should like to give a crete example, which, but for the ability and energy of an American author, would have been lost to the world. I allude to the building of the Guernsey market by means of the issue of currency scrip. In the early days of last century, when money could not be borrowed in London so easily as just prior to the war, the Guernsey people desired to raise capital for the building of their market. At 'Guernsey, at the time, there was a very able Governor, who suggested that, as the people had amongst them brickmakers, - carpenters, stonemasons, and other tradesmen, they should set to work and build the markets themselves. This wise suggestion bore fruit, and in the course <of three or four years the people decided to issue currency scrip for, I believe, £10,000. This scrip the shopkeepers and citizens agreed to accept in currency, and a very ingenious and able scheme was involved. I ought also to mention that the hew municipality agreed to accept the - scrip in payment of rates and taxes. The markets were built, and immediately - every stall was rented, no stalls being allowed in the narrow streets of Guernsey. As the rents were paid for the stalls each year, scrip to that amount was burnt, the occasion being observed as a holiday. As time went on the whole of the scrip was destroyed, and the citizens found themselves in possession of a building for - ever, which yielded them some £500 a year. In the State Parliament, the present Mr Justice Higgins, when a member, had .a return prepared, which showed that Victoria had borrowed some £50,000,000, - and had paid back something over £53,000,000 in interest and a small portion of the capital; but the State still owed about £50,000;000. Had the State Government, in the building of their railways, adopted a plan similar to 'that carried - out in Guernsey, the railways of the State would now be free of 'debt. ""We all know that tShe great trouble with the railways is the immense amount of interest they have to earn; and this, I think, emphasizes the value of the suggestion I am making. If such a plan were adopted under our present circumstances, the Government, in providing for OUT returned soldiers, could not possibly lose any money, for, as I have already said, they con- would hold as security every house and - every acre devoted to that purpose. In addition - to that, "" there would be the increased values of the future, and we all - know how values have gone up. The Government would also have the Knowledge that they were freeing a large number of homes for our citizens. Landlords, after all, are like other business meri. When there are ten. persons after the 'one house, ""up goes the rent. I have met only one man who was prepared not to raise the rents for ""his houses during'the war - period. He was a Jewish gentleman, and when I approached him on the subject, he asked me whether I thought a return of 6 per cent, on his capital was too much to expect ? I replied that I did not think it was. 'He claimed that that was all he was receiving., but when I told him that I was speaking on behalf of something like fifty tenants, and urged him not to put up his rentals, he ultimately agreed not to do so. He inquired, however, why it should have been necessary for me, as a' member of Parliament, to make this request? "" Why , "" he asked, "" does not the Government insist that no rents shall be raised during war time?"" There I leave the matter. Whether a general election takes place almost immediately or not for some months hence, I shall remain true to the pledge I gave at the last general election, that neither by word of mouth nor by a vote would I do anvthing to impose upon the workers of this country the burden of the war loans and interest thereon. They should not be called upon to meet our huge war indebtedness. We are here for only a brief span<on this rock, whirling through space, which we call the earth, but the earth itself will be here for all. time. Mr. Hugh Mahon, when representing Kalgoorlie in 'this House, once submitted a motion that all war debts and interest thereon s'hould be provided for by a special tax on the land. I agree with that proposition. The land will be here when we are but dust and ashes, and it should provide for our war expenditure. If the wealth of Australia today is £1,600,000,000, who will say twenty years hence it will not be £5,000,000,000, I have given brief expression to my views on this subject, and I hope that some one will be able to evolve an even better scheme.  have listened with much interest to the speeches made during this debate, and' particularly to the remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Archibald), regarding the high cost of living, which he showed to be due. to a certain extent to our inflated paper currency. In every European country-there is an inflated paper currency at the present time, and in this respect we are the least offenders. It cannot be denied that the prices of commodities are the highest where the greatest amount of paper currency is in circulation. If we desire to reduce the cost of living, we should deal witlr the question of the* circulation of paper money. If we could devise some means of paying off our notes-""w e might even fund them- I think we should remove one of the causes for the great i crease in prices. In 1914, when our population was practically - what it day, our note circulation amounted to £6,589,798. When the note issue was in the hands of the - private banks, which had a gold backing, our paper circulation was about £4,000,000. but when the Commonwealth printing; press got to work, the paper currency used by the same people as' before increased to a large extent. The notes in circulation jumped from £6,589,798 in 1914 to £19,000,000 in February last, and whereas the banks held £7,000,000 of notes in 1914, they were holding in February last £37,000,000 in notes. Prior to the Commonwealth .note issue we had a gold currency, and any surplus gold was exported as au ordinary commercial commodity. Since then, owing to the war and other causes, the Government have taken possession of practically the whole of our gold, and have substituted for it a paper currency, with the result that a great number of our, banks today have only paper instead of gold reserves, and in clearing, settle in paper instead of gold. They are able, therefore, to extend credits on their paper backing. In . these circumstances a bank. is prepared to extend its credit to five times the amount of its reserves in gold. It is thus made possible for people that to obtain accommodation from the banks against, not a gold, but a paper, currency. That may be all very well from the point ' of view of the convenience of trade, but it has a serious effect upon the Commonwealth. In a leading article published recently . in the Melbourne Herald, it was stated that the trade balance against G-reat B r it a in was £800,000,000, and that the rate of exchange - against the Empire was something like 15 per cent. Let us f o l low up that point, and see to what extent this high rate - of exchange against the Empire affects the cost of living. It means that when we export to the United States of America £100 worth of wool we receive in return only £85 worth of commodities. In other words, the consumers have to pay, not only the duty on the commodities we import, but the 15 per cent, against us in respect of the exchange rate, because the trade balance is against us. This is due to the fact that we have lost our gold currency and have substituted for n - it a paper currency. When these commodities, valued at £85, butf or which we is to have paid £100, reach Australia, the people compete for them with paper money, with the result' that prices go up more than ever. The paper currency permits of this increased competition. In this way prices have gone up to the extent of 50 per cent. The sooner we tackle this question, not only in Australia, but throughout the Empire, the better for our people. The sooner we revert to a gold currency the better it will be for Australia.  member suggest that the paper currency is responsible for the high price of meat?  partly, responsible for the increase in prices. When we give the people of Australia, in place of the goid and paper currency of £6,000,000, which was quit3 sufficient for their purposes a few years ago, a paper currency of £45,000,000, this increased paper currency must necessarily mean increased, competition for goods.",29

64,Mr LAIKDSMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Surely the honourable member does not think that a gold currency of £6;000,000 would be sufficient to- ""cover all the business transactions of 1 Australia?  the Commonwealth took over the noteissue.",33
65,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"At that time, I think, we had a circulation of £10,000,0001  that in 1914, with a gold backing of only 40 per cent., we had a note circulation of only £6,000,000.  was controlled' by the private banks the paper-money incirculation was much loss for the reason that the bank notes issued in any one State were subject to a discount of from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent, in any other State. On the other hand, One can get the full face value of a Commonwealth note in any part of Australia.  note circulation of only £4,000,000 was sufficient for our purposes we had gold 1 as well as notes in circulation,- whereas day we have only paper in circulation. I hope the whole question of the note issueand its bearing on the high cost of living will betackled at an early date. Regardingthequestion of immigration, let me say at once that it should receive the-early and..serious consideration of the Government. While our boys were at the. Front they proved the very best immigration agents we could have had. They spokeof the attractions that Australia held out; and while the iron is hot, I think the Government should send some of our returned soldiers to America, Great Britain, France and other Allied countries to address associations of ex-soldiers of those countries and endeavour to induce the best of them to emigrate to Australia. We have a huge continent, as big as Europe, with only 5,000,000 people init, and every immigrant we get will help to share the burden of debt which is now crushing u's down.",33

The only way in, which we can get out, . of our debt of £350,000,000 is to increase to- production, as much as possible. Yesterday I was pleased to hear several honourable members representing country districts ask the Government to remove the prohibition on. the export of. horseflesh. Someweeks ago, in: response to a request by pastoralists of New South Wales, I submitted the same question to the Minister for Trade and Customs. (Mr. Greene), and. I am pleased that the-horses are havinga good gallop in this Committee.",33

I simply suggest that we should, bepermitted to send horseflesh to: countries where there is - a demandf o r it. I eannot follow the argur ment of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford.) that the exportation of horseflesh from.Austral'is would destroy our beef trade. We export beef, mutton, pork, and rabbi ts-,. and a man who gets beef does not mistake it forpork orrabbit. Why should horseflesh be mistaken for beef,, mutton, or rabbit ? Surely it can be easily distinguished. The exportation of, horseflesh would be one means of enabling us to decrease our great liability. Accorda ing to Mr Knibbs, there were 2,437,000 horses in Australia in 1916. Horses are useful until they are twelve years of age, after which they gradually decline so far as usefulness to man is concerned. Thus 8$ per cent., or 204,000, of our horses put out of use each year, but these are mostly animals useful for fattening. If each horse should realise £12, it would mean £2,448,000 additional income derived by the people of Australia through, the sale of horseflesh. Mr .BAMFOKD - Does it not sound lovely?  mand in Europe for horseflesh. The I m perial authorities sold 17,000 of their aged and crippled horses on the Western Front to French butchers. If the people of Europe want horseflesh, and we can supply it, we ought to be able to send it to them.",33
70,Mr BAMFORD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"They would, rather have beef.  ber for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) told us yesterday that the German prisoners - in England went on strike because they were fed on beef instead of getting their allowance of horseflesh. In 1915, Australia exported 24,107 horses, valued at £459,978, an average of about £19 per head. Those were mostly horses suitable for coaches and gun teams, and the greater part of them were sent to India.",34
71,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Does the honourable member suggest that the horses should be slaughtered in Australia?  other means of dealing with them. They would be slaughtered here and sent away as horseflesh.,34
72,Mr LAIKD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"There is not sufficient shipping.  in the same position in regard to shipping. Normal conditions will soon be established, and then we ought to be able to send away horseflesh just as we send away other flesh. Before the introduction of motor cars, motor lorries, and railways, we had to depend upon horses for means of communication; hut every year now we find motor vehicles and railroads displacing these animals, and motor tractors replacing plough horses on farms. In future, the plough horse will be almost thing of the past; and the question will be to what use our horses can be put. It is far easier to fatten a horse than to fatten a bullock. If a backward store bullock and a comparatively poor horse are put into a good paddock, the horse are will be prime fat in two months, whereas it will take a year to fatten the bullock.. Each year a number of horses become crippled, or are put out of use from other causes. In times of drought they are shot. There is, at the present time, one of the worse droughts on record. Many teamsters and others have been spending every penny they possess in order to keep their horse3 in good condition; but now they have come to the limit of their means, and have been obliged to sacrifice their teams. By compelling the owners of these teams to slaughter their animals and bury them, Australia is losing wealth that otherwise might be a benefit to the community if the Government would only permit the export of horseflesh. In the far-back areas of some of the States there are a lot of brumbies running wild. Mr Kidman stated in Sydney the other day that-he is sending men out to shoot 2,000 of them, because they are a menace to his properties. I noticed the other day that the Police Department of New South Wales sold splendid horses in the township of Carcoar, about 8 miles from where I live, for as low as 5s. per head. I also noticed that a teamster in the township of Rockieigh, in the district of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls), sold sixty splendid draught horses in good condition for £5 per head, because he could not afford to buy fodder for them. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) knows as well as I do that many people have turned their horses out, and that many others have .died on their hands simply for the want of food, owing to the drought. If we had had a market for those horses before the drought reached the ' stage that it afterwards reached, they could all have been put to some commercial use. I was pleased to hear that the Government had decided to make a payment on account of the Wheat Pools. I cannot stress too emphatically ""the importance of the Government considering the present condition of the wheat-growers of Australia. The figures of production for the 1918-19 Pool are: New South ""Wales, 13,801,000 bushels; Victoria, 22,918,000 bushels; South Australia, 20,563,000 bushels; ""Western Australia, 7,341,000 bushels, or a total production of 64,623,000 bushels, a tremendous reduction on previous years. The local consumption of wheat in Australia, at 6 bushels per capita, amounts, roughly, to 30,000,000 bushels. I cannot understand why the Government do not fix the price of wheat to the local millers on the parity of the price ruling abroad. Why should the millers be allowed to obtain wheat at 5s. perbushel, whereas the parity abroad, the f.o.b. price, is 8s. 6d. ? The millers .and local consumers should pay the full oversea parity for whatever wheat they consume.  sixpence?  should pay 8s. 6d. The producers of Australia should receive the uttermost - farthing for their production.  freight before you get that 8s. 6d. That is a monstrous proposition.  of America the guaranteed price was 9s. 2d. per bushel.",34

74,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Macquarie) [12.49]. - I intend to direct my remarks to the Department of the Postmaster-General. I hoped he would be present, so that some notice might be taken of the grievances which I intend to relate. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) referred to grievances similar to, what occur in my electorate. The hours at various telephone offices have been considerably reduced, very much to the inconvenience Of the residents. This is the class treatment meted out to them:SIR,- I have to intimate that, as it sidered that public requirements will be quately met if the hours of attendance telephone office are fixed at three per diem, namely, from 9 a.m. to noon, Monday to day, arrangements have been made accordingly, to take effect on and from the 22nd September, 1010. That is the letteT I received from the Deputy Postmaster-General for New South Wales. A similar reduction of hours has taken place in seventy odd telephone [464}- 2 offices in the electorate of Macquarie. Three hours per day for the telephone is positively useless to the great bulk of country residents. The worker cannot use the telephone between 9 a.m. and noon, because he has to work from 8 a.m. till 5 p.m. The man working on the. land is usually busy from 6 in the morning till 6 at night, and it is not possible for him to leave his work to send a telephone message, so he has to let many important matters go in consequence. A farmer may be working 2 miles away from the post-office, and it is unreasonable to expect him to leave his work at 11 in-the morning to telephone a firm about bags or other requirements before 12 noon. I admit, in fairness to the 'Postmaster General, that regulations have been made and whereby any person can send a telephone message after the fixed hours by paying "" a sum of, I think, 2s. 6d. for the first hour,. and an increased rate after that time. That extra charge goes to the postal attendant, and none of it goes into to pay the funds of the Postal Department. The Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) distinctly said this morning that the hours of country telephone services have been reduced in order to give the attendants at the various offices an increase in pay. His idea, therefore, is that if you reduce the hours of a servant you increase his pay! When the question of sweating was mentioned, the Minister said he was not sweating his employees, because he had reduced their liours from six and seven to three.",35
75,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Are they able to go away?,35
76,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"No . Many of these officials work three hours per day for the Postmaster-General for an allowance of about 5s. per week, and the - Postmasterof General says that is not sweating. He makes out that he is lenient to them, but is conthey cannot take on any other positions, adebecause they cannot fulfil their hours at at the other occupations. They have taken the telephone office on as a sideline, more for Saturthe convenience of the Postmaster-General and the public than for their own benefit and prosperity. The Postmaster-General knows that many of these country postal attendants are on the verge of making an application for an increase in' pay, and, in order to forestall them, he says, "" I will reduce the hours."" Petition after petition has been forwarded to him, protesting against the reduction in the hours,, but, his Department simply replies that under, nocircumstancescan the conditions be. altered, because there, is not sumcient revenue coming, from the particular officesconcernedto 'warrant the Postmaster General in keeping, them, open for longer periods. I have written the Postmaster General repeatedly on the. matter, and have not received a. satisfactory reply in a single instance. On each ,and every occasion, he has said that owing, to the fallin g off of postal business in that locality the hours must be. reduced. I . do. not altogether blame, him. for. this-, because,, in the. majority of. cases,, he doea not. know the conditions which exist in those districts.. tions are made on the recommendation, of. the district postal inspector. He receives a report from, somebody, but who that, is I do not know, 'and then forwards his. recommendation to the. Deputy Postmaster G'eneral, who decides on that recommendation toreduce the hours.. I had' hoped the Postmaster-General would make an. explanation on the question. This is by. no means a triflin g grievance. It affects - practically every country resident,, and bitter complaints are being made d a i ly about the methods adopted by the Postmaster-General's 'Department'. The Minister or his Deputies have also been, advised - that owing drought conditions it is scarcely possible for many country mail contractors to fulfil' their contracts: DeputyPostmaster-General 1 South Wales said that owing to the existing conditions he intended to make some allowance for fodder, and so forth-, but, nothing definite, has. yet been done in that direction, despite the fact, that the mailcontractors have had to face a rise in the: price of chaff from £4 to- £14 per. ton in. many districts.. Corn. has. increased in price, from 4s.. 6d.. to 9s. per bushel,, and many mail contractors are. on the verge of, throwing up their contracts; and allowing the Postmaster-General.or his Deputy to -- run tha job themselves,, if they so desire..",35
77,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,They . are. paying l is . per bag. for chaff in my district.,36
78,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The price in my district runs from 10s-.. 6d. to l is . 6d. It is.not possible for the average contractor to complete hiscontract under those conditions.,36
79,Unknown,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.S0 p.m.,36
80,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I ask for a quorum. [Quorum formed.],36
81,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"When criticism is directed against the administration of any Department the Minister controlling it . should be in the House. On several occasions when I "" have dealt with matters concerning the postal administration the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) has been absent. The complaints I make are not imaginary or trivial grievances, and the least that can be expected of the Postmaster-General is that he shall attend in hisplace and listen to honourable members The altera- with a view to rectifying any wrong. Today the postal service in the country is much inferior to that in the. cities; and. I have every reason to believe that the Minister's own electorate receivesfar moreconsideration than do many other country electorates.",36
82,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"That ought not to. be. Mr NICHOLLS : - It ought not to be, butit. is so. The Minister, has-introduced a system of economy, either: false: or; real,, which is causing inconvenience and hardship to many country residents: The reduction in the. hours of. post-officesa-nd> country telephone exchanges, is-not desired' by the officials in those offices, because to such reduction means lower wages. If the Postmaster-General' had, in his desire toassist the employees, given an increase in. The salaries and a smaller reduction of hours in New no complaint would have been made - I ' have pointed, out previously that, in many country districts the meu employed on the landcannot leave theiTwork early in. order to go tb a post-office and get in touch with the business people, and theresult is that on many occasionsthey areunable-to place orders which' are of great 1 importance to them. Ifthenew system affected only a; few neople no great exception could' betaken to it , because-1 recog-1 nise that it would be hard to maintain, elaborate, postal facilities in every holeaad corner of, Australia. But. the-majority of the* places fromi which serious complaints' come have fairly large populations, the' bulk of whom are primary producers.. They arejust as much entitled to' consideration as are the: city merchants. Uponno* consideration, would the Postr. master-GeneTal attempt to curtail the city postal and telephonic 'conveniences to the extent that he has done in the country. The reduction in ""the hours of country offices is a grave public scandal. For the last twelve months complaints have been made regarding the matter, but despite repeated applications to the Postal Department no satisfaction has been given; .the .only answer of the Postmaster-General has been that it is necessary for him to teconomize in his Department. .is being effected at the .expense and inconvenience of the country producers. I am .certain that all honourable members agree ""that the country telephonic and telegraphic facilities are inadequate, and that the Postmaster-General ought to .extend them, in order to enable country people to conduct their business in the regular and convenient fashion. 'Some considerable time ago I asked in the House whether the Government would .consider - the .advisability of increasing the old-age pension. The r eply I received was .that on account of serious financial obligations the Government could not see'their way clear ito grant such an increase. The consequence is that the old-age pensioner 'is still obliged to live upon :a paltry - pittance. The original pension was 10s. per week, which, on account of the high cost of living and other altered conditions, was increased about three or four years ago to 12s. 6d. per week. If the pensioner was entitled to that increase three years ago he is certainly entitled to another increase of 5s. at the present time. have prepared a list of the necessary commodities that the pensioner can purchase with his allowance of 12s. 6d. per week, and I feel sure that it is applicable to nine out of ten cases. The first outgoing which he has to meet, if he does not live in a tent, is rent, for which I have allowed 2s. 6d. as a minimum.",36
83,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Pensioner s cannot get accommodation for 2s. 6d. per week.,37
84,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Those who are wholly dependent upon their pensions cannot pay more. For meat I have allowed 3s. 9d. per week, bread Is., sugar 7d., tea 9d., tobacco Is., newspaper 6d., fuel 2s. Those items total 12s. l d . per week. No honourable member will deny that those are bare necessities. No pensioner should be expected to live with in those limits of expenditure, but that is as far as the pension will enable him to go. W it h an additional 5s. per week the pensioners could buy only - vegetables, clothes, and blankets. They .could not afford to pay more than 2s. for vegetables and another 2s - for blankets and clothes. Consequently even with a pension of 5s. - they would be in pitiable circumstances. If the Government can recklessly spend money-and nobody can deny that that has been done-.the y ought to be able to give to""these old people who have ""blazed the track "" the means of reasonably comEconomy fortable living. Many of the old people who today are receiving 12s. 6d. per week are justly entitled to considerably more for-the labour they performed in the early days of Australia. I have 'visited many of these old people and noted 'the conditions under which they live. No honourable member would care to see his - relatives living under the - same conditions.",37
85,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Do not 'their relatives do anything for them ?,37
86,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Many of them have no - relatives to whom they can look for assistance; they are wholly dependent upon the amount the Commonwealth pays - them.,37
87,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"In any case, the relatives may be in poor circumstances. Mr NICHOLLS : - V e r y often that is the case. It is the"" duty of the Government to protect as far as possible those old men and women who have pioneered this country. The 10s. per week paid when the pensions were first instituted was more beneficial than £ 1 at the preI sent time, in view of the decreased purchasing power of money. It may be said by some that these old people should utilize their energies and time in gardening, and so forth.",37
88,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,They cannot get land - enough.,37
89,Mr NICHOLLS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"That is so. Then, again, if any old-age pensioner happens to get a job at 21s. or 22s. a week his pension is stopped. I have known repeated cases of old ladies drawing a pension for four or five years, and it then being discovered that their husbands, up to the last twelve months of the period, had been earning £2 or £ 1 10s. per ""week. When the husband himself applied for a pension it was in many cases granted, but the amount overdrawn by his wife was deducted. There are many cases of pensioners living on 18s. or 19s. a fortnight, simply because of an error of this kind made in the early stages. I hope the claims of the old-age pensioners will receive more careful consideration than in the past. I should now like to refer briefly to the pensions beingmeted out to our returned soldiers. In many cases these pensions are satisfactory, but in others much hardship is involved. If a man returns from the Pront minus a leg or an arm, he really is totally incapacitated, because he would find it impossible to compete with the average worker on the labour market. The pension allowed to a single man for an in j u ry of this kind is 22s. 6d. per week, which is totally inadequate to maintain him. Of course,'if he is a married man a certain allowance is made for his wife and each of his children; but the single man is certainly not compensated for the hardships that he has undergone. Such men ought to be given sufficient to maintain them in common decency, and I hope their case ""will receive more favourable consideration.",37
90,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Denison) [2.55]. - I have listened with great interest to the. discussion, from which I gather that the great desire of honourable members is to insure the 'prosperity of Australia. Prosperity, in my opinion, can only be created by a thorough organization of our methods of production, and it is my intention this afternoon to suggest to the Government that they should deal Will a question which will have to be' dealt with at au early stage if Ave are to progress as Ave desire. I refer to the provision of better means of communication with the Old World by cable, or, preferably, by Avireless. This is a subject to which 1 - have given much attention, and I have arrived at the opinion that Ave could encourage commerce and create trade Avithin our shores if Ave had better and cheaper means of communication That Ave have not proper means at the present time Avas clearly demonstrated during the recent terrible war, when we found our cables very much congested, and business consequently considerably hampered. It was impossible to communicate Will any promptitude Will those people abroad Avho are desirous of obtaining our products. The three cables over which all our messages must go are quite inadequate even in normal times such as we may expect. The splendid work done by our men at the Pront, in protecting Prance, Belgium, and Australia, have given us an advertisement such as we never had before, and I am convinced that our population is going to increase and our commerce grow. We should be in no way hampered by in adequate means of communication, and no one can deny that the cable service, is noAv not only inadequate, but too costly. The charge for cable messages to the United Kingdom is 3s. a word; to France it is 3s. 6d. by the Pacific route, and 3s. by the Eastern; to Italy , by the Pacific, 3s. 9d., by the Eastern, 3s.; to Spaiin and Portugal, by the Pacific, 4s. O^d., and 4s. I d . , and by the Eastern, 3s.; to China, by the Pacific, 6s. l i d . , by the Eastern, 2s. 6d.; to Japan, by the Pacific, 7s. 4^d., by the Eastern, 3s. 8 d . ; to India, the Pacific offers no' service, and the charge by the Eastern, the only route, is 2s. 6d.; to Java, by the Pacific, 6s. 10d., by the Eastern, 2s. 6d.; to Egypt, by the only route available, the charge is 3s. 5 d . ; to South Africa , the loAvest charge is 2s. 2d.; to Canada, by the Pacific, 2s. 4d.j and to the United States of America, 2s. 4d. If by. any chance our line to Canada were to break down, there is only the costly United States route at 4s, The charge to South America is from 3s. l | d . to 9s. 3^d. per Avord. We have already Avorked up a big trade Will many of these countries I have mentioned, particularly Java, and that trade 1 A\-ill go on increasing. The energetic people of Australia are intensely in terested in the development of the eastern tinfields, and they have been Avell reAvarded for their courage.in undertaking the venture. W it h South America, again, better communication is necessary. It Would be invaluable to business people. We hope to build up a very big trade with China; but our means of communication with that country is not what it should be. It is of no use for us to send out Trade Conunissioners to other countries if AVC are not able to assure business men that there is at their disposal an easy means of communication Will those countries. The cost of procuring goods is charged to the consumer eventually, and the cost of our communication Will the Old World adds materially 'to our cost of living. In my opinion, the time has arrived when, by the appointment of a commission of experts, or some other means, steps should be taken by the Government to bring about the establishment of commercial wireless in Australia. Speaking from memory, I think that for the last ten years there' has heen communication established by a wireless system between Ireland and Canada, and there is now also a system working from Carnarvon, in Wales, to New Jersey, in the United States of America. The latter system is worked, not only with wireless apparatus, but is connected up with land lines, and it is possible now to send a telegraphic message from London to New Yor k in the course of a few minutes. It is dimcult to say what might have happened during the war had it not been for the existence of this splendid means of communication between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. We have practically no commercial wireless system establislied in Australia. Some honourable members may consider that the establishment of such a system is impracticable; but wireless telegraphy has long gone past the experimental stage. One of Marconi's engineers has made a most wonderful discovery. He has found that what is known as static electricity, or the disturbance of the ether by lightning, operates vertically, whilst the current sent out by ether waves operates horizontally. This engineer has invented a most wonderful machine, now part of the wireless apparatus, which prevents the static electricity-the high potential lightning current-fro m interfering at any time with the electrical current generated and used for wireless telegraphy. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was in the Old Country, he was able to send a message to Australia traversing approximately 12,000 miles, by means of this wonderful system. Its development here would considerably reduce the cost of our communication with the Old World. It is difficult to estimate what it would mean to the business people of Australia, and to consumers in this country, if Ave could bring down the cost of livin g by the adoption of scientific means of communication of this kind. In proof of what I am saying, I quote the following statement reported to have been made by Mr Godfrey . Isaacs, managing director of the Marconi Company:.Assuming a distance of 6,000 or 12,000 miles, and a traffic of 10,000 words a day, at the rate of 2s. a word, that would give the wireless a very handsome profit. So soon as possible the rate would be reduced to ls. 6d. a word, and he believed that the traffic would correspondingly increase, and/ would reach nearly 20,000 words a day. When it reached 40,000 words a day,, a Is. rate would be introduced, and when it reached 80,000 words a day, a rate of 3d. per word would lie charged, and would give the same receipts as the 2s. rate, and the 3d. rate would compare with the 3s. per word cable rate of today for such a volume of business. That demonstrates the value of the adoption of this scientific means of communication. Are we in Australia going to stand still in this matter? I am not concerned as to who controls the wireless system; but surely the Government are not going to adopt - a dog-in-the-manger policy. If they will not undertake this important work themselves, they should let some one else undertake it . I do not know how far the Marconi Company may be protected in their possession of the highly scientific machinery I have referred, to; but they seem to have been the principal electrical engineers who had the courage to devote their time and money to experimenting with a view to making possible the efficient wireless communication to which I , have referred. I can quite understand that the Commonwealth Government could not afford to go in for such elaborate experiments as the Marconi Company have undertaken. In the first place, the Government have not ' at their disposal the necessary highly qualified engineers, whilst at the head of the Marconi Company there is the in ventor of the wireless system, or the man who put to practical use the discovery made by another very brilliant man. many years ago, and made it possible to have communication on land and sea without metallic connection. I ask the Government to give this matter their earnest consideration. The Acting Treasurer  sired to .finish the consideration of the Bill this afternoon, and I shall, therefore, be very brief in what I have to say. .",38
91,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I do not think that the Minister has the slightest hope of being able to do so.  on which theB ill has been under consideration.,39
92,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The matter with which I am dealing is one which I regard as of the utmost importance. I never criticise the Government in this - House without offering some suggestion which, if adopted, will in . my opinion, enable them to' do something beneficial for the. community. If we - are to progress as we desire, and to produce the wealth which is so necessary to enable us to ,pay our - enormous debt, we must have improved means of communication with the rest of the world. If we had this cheap means of communication which I am advocating, Australian representatives of the English press would be - able to send information to the Old World - which would give Australia the promin-ence we desire, and would let people >abroad - know how things here .actually are - every advancement made. MT. POYNTON;-What would be the use - of sending a message by wireless which the people, for whom it is not intended »could - get?",39
93,Mr LATED SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The Minister puts a question to me which I am very pleased to answer. Wireless telegraphy has now been brought to such a high - pitch of .perfection ''that - means are adopted for tuning ""wireless instruments one witih another. The high potential instrument in 'the Old Country would 'have - such an enormous pressure behind --it that no - other wireless'system could cut - into its - messages. 'It could be easily arranged for instruments of the Navy with - lower voltage - to come in at a - time to be - agreed upon.  sages in .America during the war.",40
94,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"That may be so, but - that' cutting in was stopped - during the war. The Government could take power ""by Aet of Parliament,' not only to fix the rate per word - to be charged, but to impose certain restrictions. I fail to understand how it would be possible for the Government to control the monopoly here. It would - be necessary for them to have a world monopoly, but they can have no influence or control - outside Australia. We are told by scientists of the day that improvements in wireless telephony are such that we shall be .able .within the next - six .months to speakwith London. A few days ago an aeronaut flying at an .altitude of 5,000 feet over New York was able, by .means of wireless telephony, to speak .with people in the streets of that city. Instead - of .trying - to block scientists to market. in every way, we ought to encourage .them to continue their excellent work. My views with regard to Government monopolies are well known. Every great enterprise likely to become a monopoly should, in my opinion, be controlled by the State; but I am not going to stand by the State when it .attempts to .stem the - tide of progress by 'preventing ihe establishment of a scientific industry, in our midst. I hope that Ministers will :give this inatter the consideration that it warrants. My only regret is that my .time is so limited that I cannot deal fully with it. I have made electricity a life-long study, and keep myself in ""touch with I do not agree with ""the honourable mem of our war liabilities, people who come here are likely to be overburdened with debt. Those who settle in Australia ""wall be as free from debt and as well off as any people in the world. If we let it go forth that this is - the best country in Which to settle, we shall secure all the immigrants we want. I was delighted to hear the Minister  this morning, in 'answer to a question, that the Government were taking aafion with .the object of retaining oiir coastal shipping. Tasmania has suffered anore than enough by reason of the shortage of shipping, but it would have suffered far more if ordinary competition had been .allowed to continue, and ship-owners had been free .to withdraw their vessels from the Australian coastal service. I do mot criticise the Government because of aaiy shortage of shipping from which we have suffered, because I realise that, had our Inter-Sfcate shipping been open to the competition of the world, and free from Government control, it would not have remained here. As the result of the action taken by the Government, we secured a much better service than would .otherwise have been possible. I ..hope that by ' .amicable arrangement with the shipping companies, they will be able to insure to the island State, of which I am a representative, as well as to other parts of the Commonwealth whose trade and . commerce depend so largely upon shipping facilities, the means of communication necessary to enable us to get our products - Mr .TUDOR (Yarr.a.) [3.15] - Yester day I informed the Minister in charge of  to submit an amendment, .and I propose to do so now, not with a view to delaying - the passing of Supply today, but to enable .a vote to be taken on the question of whether or not there should be a further inquiry into the .purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works. On several occasions the honourable member for Capricoriiia (Mr Higgs) and I have asked questions regarding that inquiry, and I am anxious that there should be a vote on the subject. I , therefore, propose to - move'That the 'following words be added :- "" and that the 'Government appoint a High Court Judge or .other Judge to inquire fully into the purchase-of - the Shaw Wireless Works, .and that the .inquiry be open to .the public .and the press.'' The CHAIRMAN ^ (Hon. J. 'M. ""Chanter) - The - honourable member will .not be in order in moving to attach any condition to the grant of Supply. He may move for a reduction of the vote, but he cannot move to impose a condition. It is laid down that the Committee cannot attach - a condition or expression of opinion to such a motion, or alter .the destination of the .proposed vote. The honourable member may move either a't this stage-or in Oommittee on the Bill to :r-educe the amount.",40
95,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Then I shall move That - the proposed vote of £6,088,542 be seduced by £1. This amendment will .allow honourable 'members .an ooportivnity to vote on the question of whether there should be a further inquiry into the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works. It will be remembered that, as the result of aji iniq.uiry ""which took place last year, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jensen), then Minister for Trade .and Customs, - was gazetted out of office, and that a member of another place, who was also a representative of Tasmania, resigned his:seat. The inquiry on that occasion was a secret one, and we have not had an opportunity to discuss the report of the Commission which conducted it. In submitting it to the House and moving that it be printed, the then Acting Prime - Minister (Mr Watt) made a speech, and was followed later hy the honourable member for Bass, who : .defended himself from the imputations made against him in - the report. No other honourable member, however, had - an opportunity to deal with it. I moved the adjournment of the debate on 'the - motion '"" That the report be printed,"" and since then the question has not been - before this Parliament. I maintain that - we have a right to deal with it. The report was more widely read by honourable members than any other report that has been presented to this Parliament. Mr 'LAIRD SMITH - I hope that Senator Gardiner's speech on the report.has also been widely read ",41
96,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I hope so. We were not given - any information as to who were examined by the Commission. Although at the time of the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works I was a Minister of the Crown, I - was absolutely ignorant of the charges made before the Commission. .It - could have 'examined my banking account just as it examined the. banking-accounts of others, with the object of ascertaining - whether it w.as inflated. Mr - GREGORY - Doe 3 not the honourable member think that an inquiry was needed?",41
97,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I do hot urge that it - was. unnecessary. I am asking now that there should be a further inquiry, and I - am 'confident that had a vote been taken at the close of the speech made by the 'honourable member for Bass, the House would have unanimously decided .that the matter should, not be allowed tostand where it was.'",41
98,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"It certainly should not have been allowed to stand where it was. - Mr TUDOR - Quite so-. The honourable member for Bass was gazetted out of office on 13th December last. The matter was referred to by the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in moving the adjournment of the House that day, and his remarks are recorded on page 9296 of Hansard. Mr - Jensen spoke on the 18th December, and on the 19th of the same month I asked a question as to whether furtherinquiry was to be made. The honour of every member of Parliament is concerned in this matter, and particularly every member of the Ministry at that time. I , as an ex-Minister, emphatically say that the matter cannot be allowed to remain where it is. Several othernames were mentioned besides that of Senator Long, who has resigned, and that of Mr Jensen, who made his defence in this Parliament. Ex-Senator Long resigned on the 20th December, 1918, and at 1.30 a.m. on the same date this House and another place adjourned. On the 23rd January Mr Jensen left this country to go abroad, .and the Ministry's decision - was not known until the 7th February-fiftee n days after. Immediately the decision of the Government was made known, the exMinisters drafted the following letter to the Acting Prime Minister:The Parliament of the Gommonwealth. House of Representatives, Melbourne, 7th February, 1919. The Hon. W. A . Watt, M.P., Acting Prime Minister, Commonwealth of Australia. Dear Sir, We, the undersigned, members of the Hughes Cabinet at the time of the purchase of the ShawWireless Works, respectfully request that your Government will reconsider its decision to make no further inquiry into the said purchase. We are not satisfied ""with the secret nature of the inquiry conducted by the members of the Royal Commission on. Navy and Defence Administration, and we are of opinion that only an investigation by a Judge or Judges of the High Court of Australia-me n accustomed to s i ft and weigh evidence, to admit relevant statements, and to reject that which is irreler vant-wil l satisfy public opinion- Further, we submit that an inquiry into matters affecting the honour of members of the Parliament should be held in open Court. We have nothing to conceal, and we invite the strictest and fullest investigation. Hoping for an early reply, we are, Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) ALIIERT GARDINER, formerly Vice President of the Executive Council. FRANK G. TUDOR, formerly for - Customs. KING O'MAI.L'EV, formerly for Home Affairs. W. G. HIGGS, formerly Treasurer. That letter was written immediately the Government decided there was to be no further inquiry.",41
99,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Althoug h the letter was dated 7th February, 1919, it was not despatched, or at least it was not received, until some time later.",42
100,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I can explain that quite easily. Senator Gardiner was in the country at the time, and it was written immediately after the Government made their decision.",42
101,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The letter was received on or about 24th March.,42
102,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Were all the members mentioned Ministers when the wireless works were purchased?,42
103,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Yes , when they were purchased by the Hughes Cabinet, some time during 1916, and that is why we desire a full inquiry. The Minister for Works and Railways has stated that our letter was not received by the Government until about the 24th March. Immediately the Government announced their intention of not holding any further inquiry, the letter I have read was despatched to Senator Gardiner, who was in the country, and it took some time, to obtain his signature. It did not arrive in Melbourne promptly, but so soon as it did it was signed by the others, and forwarded to the then Acting Prime Minister. . The communication was sent after the Government had decided that ho further inquiry should be held. We ask for a full and open inquiry, because we consider we are entitled to it. I have nothing to conceal in connection with this or any other transaction that took place while I was a member'of that Cabinet, and the same applies to the other members. I hope there will be a full and open inquiry, because the Government cannot afford to allow the matter to stand where it is. A question was asked the other day. as to whether the report of Admiral Jellicoe on the wireless installation in Sydney, could not be made public. At the present juncture I am not concerned very much whether the purchase of the Shaw Minister Wireless Works was a good or a bad bargain, but I am concerned with the Minister honour of members of Parliament. It is right to have a full and proper investigation, and that no suspicion should rest on any member of the late Cabinet. Every member should be given an opportunity of clearing himself, and thus preventing any suspicion resting upon him. Ex-Senator Long, who has already gone out of public life, is anxious that further inquiry should be made. He said that until the report was presented he did not know the nature of the evidence given against him.",42
104,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,That is not borne out by his own admissions.,42
105,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I am giving you his own statement.,42
106,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I am giving you facts, and you should he careful in the statement you are making.",43
107,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I am giving you his statement. Ex-Senator Long assures me that he was not aware of the evidence given against him by, I think, a couple of ladies..",43
108,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,He was present 'at the inquiry.,43
109,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,He was not present except when he was a witness.,43
110,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I would like the honourable member to see the evidence.,43
111,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I have read it.,43
112,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I can supply details to show that the. honourable member's statement is not correct.,43
113,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I suppose that report was read as closely as were many other similar reports, and that is 'not saying much, because such documents usually find their way into the'waste-paper basket.",43
114,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,He cross-examined no less than seven witnesses himself.,43
115,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Ver y likely; but hte was not at the inquiry when evidence was givenagainst him. Ex-Senator Long hasinformed me that he was not aware of the nature of some of the evidence given against him until he saw the report.,43
116,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The evidence was taken in shorthand, and, was made available to him after it had been transcribed",43
117,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I am giving the gentleman's own statement. ""We have heard Mr Jensen's statement concerning this matter, and I am anxious that there should be a f u ll inquiry, which we as members of Parliament and public men, are entitled to. I was hoping that I would have an opportunity of moving an amendment without interfering with the Supply Bill, but as you have informed me, Mr Chanter, that I cannot do so unless I move for a reduction of the vote by £1, I have been compelled to pursue this course.",43
118,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.28] - The request of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) is that there should be a further inquiry into the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works which, as he pointed out, was effected in August, 1916, when he and the colleagues he has mentioned were members of the Cabinet. In reply, I wonld remind the honourable member that, in the first place, the Commission was appointed under the Royal Commissions Act, and had full and complete power to conduct the inquiry to the fullest possible extent. The Commission had power to call such witnesses as it desired, and to conduct its proceedings as it thought fit. In exercising its discretion, the Commission decided to examine witnesses in camera, but, after taking evidence, the facts elicited and the evidence were made public.",43
119,Mr BURCHELL,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The whole of the evi.denoe ?,43
120,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Yes .,43
121,Mr BURCHELL,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I understood there was some secret evidence taken.,43
122,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"No ; not at this inquiry, of which the evidence has been published. From the time the first witness was called in this inquiry, all the evidence taken was printed and is contained in-the report which has been circulated. The whole of the exhibits were not printed, but they were made accessible to any honourable member who desired to see them.",43
123,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The public are not allowed to see them. Mr ""GROOM - They were available for the persons concerned to see them. I have no desire to bring the name of ex-Senator Long into the matter unduly, - but I am compelled to say that there is no justification for the statement that he was not advised as to the date of the holding of the inquiry.",43
124,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,He told me that he was not aware of much of the evidence. },43
125,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"It is true that he did not appear on the first day, but let me read this from page 31 of the report of the Royal CommissionThe Gltairmm (to Senator Long) - If you. would prefer it, you can leave your questions until tomorrow, and, in the meantime, examine this transcript. He refers there to the evidence taken on the first day. Senator Long - I should be very glad to adopt the suggestion. The whole thing has been sprung on me, and I may be very glad to avail myself of the evidence of Mr Cornwell and the other evidence which is presented to .the Commission. - Mr Starke - I think it a reasonable request for the Commission to grant. The Chairman - Yes ; we are only too pleased to afford you the facility of reading the evidence, and if you wish to be represented by counsel you may. They could not do more. other - instances to show the part that ex-Senator Long took in the proceedings, and there is an indication showing that he had perused the evidence. According to page 47 of the report ex-Senator Long .examined Mr Cornwell as follows: I want to 'ask you just one - or two questions .concerning the conversation that I had with you on some date .at Kandwick, and also as to one or two matters, statements that you made in - reply to Mr.'Starke. Mr Starke suggested, that you were very suspicious-of me, is-that so'? There is other evidence to show that he was. present and took part in the cross examination of seven witnesses-Senato r Russell, on page 41 of the' report, Mr .  Mr Cornwell 'on page 47, Senator Gardiner on page -52, Mr B u r r on pages 53 and 54, and Miss Hoad on page 67. The view - taken by the Government is ithat the whole matter was thoroughly .and completely investigated by the Royal Commission, .and, as there is 'no possibility of further facts.being elicited, there is no justification for further inquiry. According to Hansard of the 10th De-cember, 19.18, '.page 8992, the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) saidThe Government have consulted .the chairman 'and secretary of the Gommission and the law advisers of the Commission as to whether a further investigation of any kind would elicit any - additional information relating to the transaction, and in each case the answer was an emphatic .negative. But the Government did not let the matter rest-there.",43
126,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,That was three days before the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jensen) was gazetted out of office.,44
127,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I was just about to explain that. It was subsequently that the honourable member for Bass addressed the House, and a long debate took place in the Senate, and afterwards the Government reconsidered the matter in order to ascertain if there was any justification for. further inquiry regarding transaction. It came to the. conclusion, after consulting with the law authorities, who were given a free hand in the matter, that .no such justification existed. The Royal Commission had absolute control of the conduct of its in quiry. It had the fullest authority under the Royal Commissions A ct to make the most complete investigation, and in order to assist it to do so the Government, at the request of the Chairman, had I can give placed at its disposal the services of the Assistant Crown - Solicitor, and .eminent counsel in the person of Mr H . E . Starke. The object of the Government was to have :the fullest investigation made. A f t e r the House adjourned at the - end of last year, Cabinet again referred the case to the Commonwealth's legal advisers 'to see whether any advantage would be gained by a further inquiry regarding the transaction, and whether it was at .all possible to elicit further facts that would elucidate the .matter, or furnish additional information.. Mr. Starke replied that the (Royal Commission on the Administration uf the Navy Department had made a complete and exhaustive inquiry, and - that he - was .still of the same opinion - as previously, - and - that he could not BUg.g.est-any line of in q u i r y that might elicit .further information.",44
128,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"What is the opinion of the Government .at ""the present .time 1",44
129,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"We have not altered our opinion; we hold there is no advantage ""to be gained - from holding another in q u i r y into .the 'matter. The whole case ""has been 'thoroughly investigated, and all material facts, - likely to be of -'assistance to a - Royal Commission in forming a j u d gment, have 'been elicited by the inquiry - already held.",44
130,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"-What was the decision of the Royal Commission ? . Mr GROOM - The duty of the Royal - Commissionwas to inquire and report upon the facts. The Commissioners f u l filled that duty, and' the honourable member will - see tlieir findings set out at length in their report. How could we do more than was done ? The Opinion of the legal officers of the Government waa that no inquiry could elicit any furthe r facts than those which had already been ascertained. On 8th February last the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) made an announcement which it is only the righ t I should - put on record in the following terms: The public will remember - that the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works was thoroughly investigated by theT-toyal Commission on Navy and Defence Administration - The Commission, which exercised very wide powers under the terms of the appointment and the provisions of the Royal Commissions Act, presented a comprehensive report, accompanied by a full record of the evidence taken. As-a result, Mr. Jensenwas removed from the Government, and - Senator Long tendered his resignation from the ""Senate.",44
131,Dr MALONEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,It is an insult to the Minister that there is no quorum in the chamber.,45
132,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,That is not the honourable member's motive.,45
133,Dr MALONEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"It is my motive, cause I believe the Minister: is endeavouring to smother something. fowled.']",45
134,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The then Acting Prime Minister continuedAt the request of the Government, eminent Gounscl and the Assistant Grown Solicitor, who both assisted, the Commissioner throughout, the whole ol the examination, have conr sidercdthc question of a further investigation. Their opinion having only just reached the Attorney-General's Department, Cabinet this week carefully reviewed, the whole, question. Counsel advised, that the. matter had been completely and exhaustively investigated, and that there were no further lines of inquiry which would be likely to elicit any fresh facts. Cabinet therefore approved of the recommendation of the Acting Attorney-General that no further inquiry should be held. The position "" of Senator Long, however, as announced by me in/the House, was specially referred to coun1 sel and. the Assistant Crown Solicitor to consider and. advise as to whether the evidence disclosed any facts which would justify or demand action in a Court of law. Counsel on this question advised that a prosecution would not succeed; and Cabinet accordingly decided that nofurther action be taken.",45
135,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,'What counsel was that?,45
136,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"They were Mr Mann, now. a Justice of the Supreme Court; and Professor Harrison Moore. The other counsel referred to was Mr H . E. Starke. Subsequently a letter was received, signed by/ Senator Gardiner, the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor), Mr O'Malley, and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). This letter, which, although dated 7th February, was not forwarded until 24th March, was replied to by the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), who pointed out that no reasons had. been advanced', for any further inquiry. To-day we, occupy exactly the same position.. The Leader, of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), asks for a general inquiry to be conducted by a High Court Judge. But he hasindicated no new lineswhich such an investigation could take, and he has' given no indication of any fresh facts which are likely to beelicited.. In the circumstances, it looks asi if he desires a vague.fishing, inquiry to elucidate nothing in particular. In justiceto. all. the paretics concerned, the Govermnent cannot consent to such a proposal. If there were an intimation of any fresh material, matter being available, the position would be different. The Government referred be- this question to independent counsel",45

139,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"He was asked to pass judgment on his own work. Mr GROOM.:-He was not. He was , merely asked whether any fresh facts ' werelikelytobe elicited by a. further inquiry: The honourable member himself cannot suggest any fresh lineof investigation. The whole matter, I repeat, was inquired into by an independent, tribunal, and the Government' arrived at the conclusion that nouseful purpose would be served by' appointing, a costly Commission, to traverse exactly the same ground ",45
140,Dr MJVLONEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"It is: as dirty a businessastheTleady-Watson affair, and the honourable gentleman knows it.",45
141,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"In theinterests of all the parties concerned, this matter was completely 'investigated; and, in justice to those who took part, in the inquiry, the action taken by the Government was the only course open to them. In the circumstances, I ask honourable members to reject the amendment: Mr. HIGGS (Capricornia)- [3.47] - I regret that the Government have decided to take the course indicated by the Minister for Works and Railways, and I warn honoraible members opposite that they should not accept, the advice of Ministers by voting' against a proposal for an open inquiry into this matter by a Judge of the' High Court-. I have read a good deal about thiscase, and the names of men have been mentioned in connection with it in such a way as to suggest wrongdoing on their part. I refuse to believe that they have been guilty of any wrongdoing whatever: It is very easy to understand why people mention the names of members of Parliament so lightly. It is very easy to. give a man a bad name; and I attach no importance whatever to the fact that the name of any. member of this Chamber, or of the other branch of the Legislature, may be associated witli proceedings connected with the purchase a colleague of Mr Jensen's. of the Shaw ""Wireless ""Works. From the very inception of this trouble, the action of the Government has been questionable. ""When the newspaper. published a series of articles, drawing attention to the report of the Commission which investigated affairs of the Navy and Defence Departall ments, and asked what action the Governsion ment proposed to take in regard to the Minister who had spent money in opposiW tion to the recommendation of the Naval Board, Ministers pretended that they not know who was the Minister referred to. But they knew all the time. The Acting Prime Minister knew all the time. I invite honourable members to read speech upon this matter, which was livered in the Senate last session by tor Gardiner. There they will find that, Carroll. according to the evidence given by a man named Augustine Carroll before the Comliminary investigation. mission which inquired into the purchase of the Shaw ""Wireless ""Works, the then ing Prime Minister had been made quainted with the charges preferred against Mr Jensen. That man went fore the Commission and told the Commonths mission his story. Senator Gardiner saidIf honourable senators will take the to examine the records which are in the Prime Minister's Department they will find that Commission first held a secret inquiry. that inquiry they examined Carroll, who made quite a number of statements about Mr Watt. ""What I understand as to this man Carroll was that he told the honourable memher afterwards for Balaclava (Mr ""Watt) that he knew of certain things against the Minister free hand at the Commission. (Mr Jensen), and wanted the honourable member to bring the matter up in the Government. House.",45
142,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,That was before the honoccasion ? orable member for Balaclava was in the Ministry.,46
143,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Yes . The honourable member refused to bring the matter up orable member. in the House because it was said- I am speaking from memory-that he was on the same side as Mr Jensen in 'the conscription campaign, and did not care casion ? to do it . That is what Carroll says. Then, after the honourable memher f o Balaclava entered the Government, Carroll said that he the bring the matter up because he was Carroll, it appears, for some reason, went to Mr Jensen's office, and Mr Jensen arranged to have a couple of detectives Age there to hear what he had to say. Carroll went to a solicitor and put his case before'him, and the solicitor advised the Carroll to go to the Commission and tell he knew. He went to the Commisand told his story. ""Why was the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . at t ) not called by the Commission to ascertain what t r u th there was ih Cardid roll's statements ? We have no evidence that he went before the Commission. then Apparently he was not called. Here is the singular part of the t h in g : a Mr H . E.

154,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,They did not. I am telling the honourable member that Mr . Starke was appointed to assist the Commission in elucidating the facts. I said so distinctly.,47

160,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Wheneve r he appeared.,47
161,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The Minister has refused to give me a straight answer. He is'suggesting now that Mr Starke was instructed by the Government to ar>oear on the first occasion.,47
162,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,There was no secret in quiry about Carroll. The whole inquiry was conducted in the manner shown by the records. The instructions were to get at the whole of the facts in connection with the case.,47
163,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I am nutting a straight question to the Minister. Mr Starke appeared before the Commission to - cross examine Carroll. Did he appear there in the interests of the Government Mr Jensen 1,47
164,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,He appeared in the terests of the Commission to get at the whole of the facts of the case.,47
165,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"On both occasions? . Mr GROOM - Yes , on every occasion that he appeared.",47
166,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The Minister now admits, though he declined to admit it before, that Mr Starke appeared before that Commission on every occasion, appointed and paid by the Government, to assist the Commission.",47
167,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Was it not to get out the facts interesting to the public?,47
168,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,That was his object-to assist in elucidating the facts before the Commission.,47
169,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The members of the Government pretended not to know who the Minister concerned was. Here is the reply of the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr W'att) to meI have re-read the paragraph referred to by the honourable member in the Royal Commission's report on the Navy administration, dated 18th. September, 1918. The section from which the honourable member has extracted the statement in the question affords.' me. no information as to who the Minister waa to whom attention is directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this clear. However, all the Ministers who have ever been in control of the Navy Department are at present included in the National Government, but I see no reason to pursue the drastic course which the honourable member suggests. I asked whether the Government were prepared to dismiss that Minister from office, and the Government said they were not prepared to take that course. By their answers through the then Acting Prime Minister they suggested that they did not know who the Minister referred to was, and all the time, on the admission bf the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), they knew that they had employed Mr Starke to assist' the Commission to get at the facts or otherwise, as stated by Carroll.",47
170,Mr GROOM,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I did not say anything about the facts as stated by Carroll. I told the honourable member that counsel was instructed to assist the Commission to elucidate the whole of the facts in connection with the case.,47
171,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"All these things show . the need for an open inquiry. The Comor of mission consisted of three business men, with Mr MCBeath, a member of a F l in in r ders-lane firm, as chairman. None of ' those gentlemen had any legal knowledge, and there we had the spectacle of Mr . Starke on one side and Mr Cussen on the other, arguing as to what these gentlemen ought to admit in the way of evidence. I venture to say that they admitted as evidence statements which would not be admitted by a High Court Judge or any other Judge trained in the knowledge and administration of the law. It appears that Carroll has been described by Mr Starke, according to Senator Gardiner, as "" an unmitigated liar."" Yet lie has: been allowed to. get away from Australia; to. America. He was given a passport out of the country. vernment dare not, in view of what has come out, refuse to grant a public in quiry by a High Court Judge, and every man who votes against that inquiry will have to take the responsibility for his. action when he. appears before his electors.",47
172,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Perhaps the Govern--ment dare not grant the inquiry.,48

189,Mr GEEGOEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Dampier) [ 4 . 1 0 ] desire to refer to a subject upon which T have been fighting the Government for'the [465] punisHing past three years at least. I had proposed to move the adjournment of the House about a fortnight ago, but I was dissuaded at the earnest solicitation of Ministers, who gave the assurance that the matter at issue would be dealt with at once. I deferred taking action then, but I feel now that it is impossible to permit the present condition of affairs to continue. I would have liked to venture a few words of appreciation upon the work of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and Sir Joseph Cook at the Peace Conference, but at this late hour I will hot delay honourable members further than to say that now that those gentlemen are home again, it is surely time we reverted to constitutional methods of government. So soon as the Prime Minister and the Minister for the . . 17 Navy had returned to this Parliament the . . 31 time was ripe for the presentation of a Ministerial statement respecting transac14 tions undertaken in the Old Country-the AYES. purchase of ships, the contemplated actions of the Goveniment in regard to that purchase, and contracts made with the Imperial Government in wool, wheat, metals, &c. This Parliament has certain powers, and it should exercise them. Parliament should be, and must be, consulted. We have gone too far ; we have been d r if t in g all the time. If we are to - NOES. have a Czar, an autocrat, here-doin g as he likes without consulting Parliamentit is surely time for Parliament to take action, or else to say to the Prime Minister, "" We are quite satisfied, and are perfectly willing, to permit you to do as you wish without seeking parliamentary authority at all . "" I desire to refer specifically to the . refusal of the Government to permit the export of base metals. We are informed that it is the policy of the Government that, so far as possible, Australia shall be self-supporting. We - are told that we PAIRS. - should try to build up our manufactures, and to utilize our base metals to promote the industries of Australia. That has been the policy of the Government for the past four years. Surely at some time or other during that period the Government could have, and should have, introduced a - Bill, Or framed certain ' regulations', - I for the control of the base-metal output. Surely this Parliament should have been consulted, should have been informed, of the purposes and ambitions of the Government. The Commonwealth ParliaThe ment could have passed legislation confer upon the Government the necessary power to do what they sought to do. the Government say they will not permit any one in Australia to trade in base metal ores without their permission, and then only through certain Combines. We, in Western Australia, have had to send our copper right away from the north-west coast to the eastern coast for treatment. mission? Is there any shortage of copper on side of Australia for the. building up industries? Is the policy of the Government ment aimed at such a purpose? time when copper was quoted at more keep than £ 1 0 0 per ton, 11 per cent, ore was shipped fro m Whim Creek to Port Kembla. It did not even pay the cost of treatment and transit, although worth £ 11 per ton, and men have been turned out of work. The mine has been closed down; hundreds are out of employment. Is it fair that men should be encouraged to put money into ventures away in the far north-west of Australia and be treated in this manner, and that, then, the vernment should say, "" We will smother you; not because we desire to destroy dustries, but because we want to hand these metals over to the manipulator and the exploiter "" ? For those are the people into whose hands our output of base metals is being delivered. On the other hand, surely some special concession might been made to retain' a white - population in the far north. I told honourable members some little their own electrolytic plant. while ago about men who had discovered could export electrolytic copper. a magnificent lead deposit in Western Australia. There have been very heartenment ing particulars in the press during the past day or two regarding a discovery gold in the Hampton Plains district. Honf orable members are always glad to upon hear 'of new discoveries, knowing that they mean production and development. W it h respect to the lead deposit, I have visited the mine, which i§ situated some 80 or 90 miles north of Geraidton. Out of a small pot-hole-for they have not gone down more than about 40 feetthe parties working there have taken out about £70,000 worth of ore in less than three .years, but their profit has been less sociation. than £4,000.",49
190,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Who has got the differHad ence? Mr Gregory.,50
191,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The manipulators L men owning this lead mine informed to me that they have now an English buyer for their ore. They are prepared' But to put on 100 hands immediately. Large numbers of men are out of employment. We, in Western Australia, are suffering from depression. Why cannot we securethe requisite permit for export to Great Britain? What parliamentary authority have the Government to prohibit perSir John Higgins, apparthis ently, rules the Government in reof gard to all these matters. The Governdelay, and delay, and delay; and At a they ask us to sit quiet. They ask us to our f a it h , and to wait and see! I would not mind if Parliament were to say, "" We will not permit metals to be exported from Australia while they are wanted for the development of local in dustries."" Nearly every honourable member of this House has received a copy of a document issued by the Mine ManagersAssociation of Western Australia, wherei n the owners of. certain t in minesGoshow that £21 a ton has been lost to them, and has gone to the manipui n - lators on this side of the Commonwealth. The parties on this side are not asking for what the Government are forcing us to send them. From Queensland the same complaint as that which I have to voice on behalf of Western have Australia may be heard. The 'CobaiSmelters Association works have been compelled to close down. They haveestablished their own smelters and They Theassociation sent a letter to the Governindicating that they would be compelled to .put off large numbers of men, of not only from their own property, but r o m a number of small mines dependent them for the purchase - of their oreoutput. They referred to the losses accruing to the State through the nontransit of goods over the railwaysfuel, timber, and the like. All they asked', for was the right to sell their copper; but they could not get a permit. They were given to understand that they would have to sell through the Copper Producers AsW h y should they be compelled to hand over the control of their mine and its output'to any outside body?"" time permitted me to go full y intothis question, I would have moved f o reduction of £100,000 upon the proposed vote; and, thus, I would have compelled honourable members to arrive at a definite decision. Protests have emanated from practically every State: from Tasmania in regard to its t in ; from Queensland with respect to copper ores; and f r o New South ""Wales and ""Western Australia. It is for honourable members tb say whether they consider the Government possible moment. justified in refusing, time after time, to grant permits. Sir John Higgins has acted as adviser to the Government. ""Who is this gentleJapan ? man? He is the man who, while financial adviser to the Government, strongly recommended the purchase, for £110,000, of the Blythe River iron deposits. have before me a letter in which he points out how satisfied he is in regard the value of this property. Mr Laird . SMITH - The Government did not purchase it .",50
192,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,No ; thanks to the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) and myself.,51
193,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The honourable member said that Sir John Higgins was running the Government. If that were so, wliy did he not purchase the property ?",51
194,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I am not here to answer stupid questions. Does the honand orable member believe that the man who was 'drafting the agreement, and fixing up the sale, should also be able to draw cheque for £110,000? But a Committee of the Government was formed",51
195,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The honourable member said that the mines were bought.,51
196,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,The options were bought.,51
197,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Will the honourable member tell me to whom copper was to be sold?,51
198,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"In every instance tin and copper were to be sold to approved countries. We never asked for anything else. We were agreeable that the Goon vernment should make any regulations they chose as to whether the copper should go to England, France, or i America. But we did complain of injustice of compelling us to pay £500 to join the Copper Producers' Association., to pay that body 1 per cent, for handling our ore, and to bind ourselves to allow them to make our contracts for the next r a fifty years. I have produced the correspondence and agreement in proof of my statement. It was unfair that any company should be compelled to join the Cop Der Producers' Association on pain of being denied the opportunity to sell their product. I have been fighting this matter m for three years, and only an hour ago I was assured that the matter would be considered by the Government at the earliest",51
199,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Is it a fact that the people to whom the honourable member refers desired to sell their ore to,51
200,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"That is not a fact, but I do not wish the honourable member to misunderstand me. The W him Creek J copper mine had been exporting ore to England for many years. About 80,000 to tons of hand-picked ore had been sent to Great Britain , and, with the profits, the company built a railwav to the coast, and set up a special leaching plant, at a cost of about £80,000. That nlaut proved a failure. Later, when the manager went to Sydney he consulted engineers by whom soecial tests were made with the oxides from Whim Creek. As a result he was under the impression that if the companv could find money for the purpose of erecting another plant on the design recommended in Sydney, they would Be enabled to treat the enormous body of 7 8 per cent, oxidized ore, now lying in the dumps, the surplus left after the hand picking. About two years ago, a while the war was still in progress and this country was supplying copper to Jaiian, the company asked to be allowed to send their ore to that country for treatment. It must be remembered that the Government were selling zinc, lead, and copper to Japan at the time, and had they acceded. to the request made. I am satisfied that the profits from the treat-ment of the ore would have proved sufficient to erect a new plant and afforded employment for 400 or 500 men .today. But the Government refused, and insisted the ore being sent to Kembla, and the' 11 per cent, ore sent showed a direct loss. I now desire to refer to the transactions n connection with the Blythe River iron the deposits, and the action of Sir JohnHiggins in connection therewith. That gentleman specially recommended this proposition to the Government, telling the Government that he would prefer them to have it . but that he was quite satisfied that he could get his friends i u England to run it . The expenditure in connection with this, when the scheme was completed, would mean £1,109,684.",51
201,Dr MALONEY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Is that for the mine itself?,52
202,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"No , that includes steamers, sidings, wharfs, metal mixers, and. so forth. Mr MATHEWS;-Is it not a fact that many years ago this iron deposit was known to be of no use?",52
203,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"I cannot say, because I never heard of it before. John Higgins, in offering the property for £110,000, said' I have every, reason to believe that I can place the venture in England with personal friends, to whom I introduced the scheme when in London eight years ago- Do not forget the dateand I personally prefer following this course. However, should the Commonwealth Government decide to purchase the properties, and not desire to erect works, my friends may be prepared to consider a proposal to open the mines and erect works. . . . The matter was referred to a Committee of the Cabinet, who approved of the acceptance of the option, and the Government paid £3,185 as 'a deposit.",52
204,Mr FOWLER,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"What were the Government going to do with the property after they bought it? ' MT . GREGORY - The reports suggest an expenditure of over a million sterling. I have heard of "" wild cats ""-of some very smellful transactions-bu t I honestly believe that if some of the fumes from this business could have been got over the German - trenches, the war would have finished long before it did. Here is the report of the three men who were sent by the Government to examine the mineAlthough the property has been known for many years, and a considerable amount of money expended by the present owners, vary little work of a useful or developmental nature has been done. The only works, of any importance are thu three tunnels shown on the plan herewith, - md known respectively as the ""' upper,"" ""' middle,"" and "" river."" These were put in about eight years ago, and little .or no work has been' done since. In addition, there are a number of prospecting trenches on the leases, and two small open cuts, or "" quarries,"" towards the north-east end of the outcrop. ,- Mr MATHEWS - Does the say' anything about the properties of the' ore?",52
205,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"The report says The results from the various underground workings nre especially disappointing. The "" middle"" tunnel results simply substantiate the poor opinion formed of this portion of the outcrop from surface inspection, and the same may even be said of the "" river "" tunnel. Some of the ore in the "" upper"" tunnel, however, looked fairly, good, and some nice clean ore is showing in one or two places on the surface immediately over the tunnel; the results.go a long - way towards proving the irregularity and noncontinuity of the better grade of ore exposed on the surface to the south-west, and also that shown in sample trench "" B "" to the north-east. Sir In conclusion the report saysI t is to be regretted that the result of our examination has been to force us to the opinion thai: the property is, at the present time, of no economic value; our investigations have shown that-(o ) the bulk of the deposit is far too salicuous to be considered as an iron ore at the present day; and (Z>) that the quantity of good ore is too small to be considered of any economic importance. Have honourable members ever heard of a more disgraceful ramp or attempt to foist a wild-cat venture on the Government? And remember this was recommended to it by the gentleman w ho, since the war r started, has been their special mining adviser. These are the extraordinary things that have been going on in connection with the administration of the metal business. On the last occasion when I dealt with this matter I referred to the Zinc Producers' Association, and do not intend to repeat what I then said. I do say, however, that there is an outcry from every State in regard .to the action taken by the advisers of the Government in controlling these industries. H a d the Government framed regulations-ha d they passed legislation which would give them effective control-n o one would have complained,- because Parliament would then have been responsible. But, time after time we find business of this kind .completed in a hole-and-corner method. When Ministers are interrogated we are told that the business is of a secret nature, and cannot be disclosed to the public. What reason can there be for that attitude ? It - is impossible there can be any reason to justify the .Government in acting as they - are doing at the present time. - Mr MATHEWS --The war is over. report not- ;MT. GREGORY - ^ In any case, where was""the harm, so long as the goods went tb'--an approved country.? A Metal Exchange has been created, and such an exchange I approve; but will honourable members believe that I got from Sir Eobert Garran the articles of association of the Exchange only on the condition that they were regarded as confidential. No person is allowed to sell ore except through the Exchange. Why did the Government not come and ask Parliament to give them power to make that regulation 1 We have had the Cobar Smelters Associated Company, month after month, writing to the Government merely asking permission to sell .their copper to approved countries. Why should that company give to an outside organization absolute control over their business for 50 years ? I do not think that honourable members realise what the position means. The leading metal organizations in Australia were called to a conference in the Attorney-General's room, for the purpose of forming a Combine, but the Broken Hill and Mount Lyell companies objected to j o in the Zinc Producers' Association. They would have to pay £500 to join the association, and 1 per cent, for the handling of the ores, and at the same time leave the association the whole power to make contracts and fix prices, not for the duration of the war, but for a period of fifty years. However, they were forced to join. They are doing the same with copper, and are trying to do the same with t in .",52
206,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,That is not binding on this Parliament.,53
207,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"No , but the agreement has been made. I think that this Parliament would n u l l if y such an agreement, but the people concerned have had to sign it .",53
208,Mr ABCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Did they not, before the war, sign a similar agreement for the Germans ?",53
209,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"T f we were desirous of breaking down one monopoly, surely we are not going to put another in its place.",53
210,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,I notice there Was no objection to the German monopoly.,53
211,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,Of what use is it for the honourable member to go back to the period prior to the war?,53
212,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"To show the inconsistency of the whole thing. There was no objection to the German monopoly, but when an Australian monopoly is created, we are invited to believe that it is everything that is bad. ' [466]",53
213,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"Has an Australian monopoly been created? The honourable member has only to consider for a moment to realise that it is only a few exploiters and manipulators in the cities who have been, given control of these matters, and that is what I object to. That is what I hate. I demand that the .Government shall give good reasons for , and show that good results will follow from , the course of action that has been adopted in this matter. If they are not - asked to do so, God knows what may happen in the future if a similar course is adopted in connection with other in dustries-wit h wool, and wheat, and other products.",53
214,Mr FINLAYSON,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,What is the good of the honourable member talking? There is no Minister listening to him.,53
215,Mr GREGORY,QUARANTINESTATION FOR,"We shall find some method of dealing with the matter. If the hour had not been so late I had in tended to move a reduction, of the proposed vote by £100,000, to secure attention being given to this matter. I shall not do that now, but I hope that what I have said will make the Government realise that strong exception is taken to the course they have followed. I trust also that in this matter Parliament will assume the responsibility which properly belongs to it . D u r in g the war I was prepared to excuse the Government for doing many things with which I did not concur, but now that the war is over the position is - entirely changed, and there can be no justification for the Government continuing to deal with the metal industry in the manner in which they have dealt with it . I had the promise of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) that as soon as the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) re- turned this matter would be settled. I remind Ministers that no good can result from asking the people of Western Australia to send their ores over here, and to continue to insist that they shall do so will only make enemies for the Government in Western Australia. I conclude by expressing the hope that the Government will give this matter favourable consideration Avithout further delay. I am sorry to have been compelled to delay honourable members on this occasion, but Ministers are awaTe that I have felt very strongly upon these matters for a long time, and things cannot be allowed to remain as they are at present.",53

The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) and I interested ourselves in this case, because we knew of no reason for the man's in ternment, and as the result of our representations the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell) definitely promised the honourable member for Adelaide that Herman would be released.

Public indignation against continued internment and deportation of husbands of British women. Petition to mayor, public meeting of protest. Native-born still interned. Although the Prime Minister (Mr .

He does not know 'why he has been dealt with in this way. I have known him for twenty-five years. His father came here because of his utter detestation of Prussian rule, and he has no German sympathies. I hope the Government will carry out their promise to release this man. I desire also to refer to the position of a - young woman in my constituency who is married to a German named 0. G. J?. Wilhelm, now in the internment camp, Sydney.",54

Are husremains band and wife to be separated and divorced because of action taken, without warrant, by the Government? Some comwhether mon sense should ho displayed in dealing with these matters.

I do not ask [466]-2 any alien who has proved himself to be an enemy to Australia, in the true sense of the word, should be allowed to remain here; but I think it is foolish to deport men who have been taunted into making rash statements. Por instance, I know a German who came to Australia many years ago 'because he objected to the Prussian system of government.' After the war broke out he was constantly taunted - tol d that the British were going to smash the Germans, and that he could not stand up against an Australian.
