The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxauon of perincomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any one year would(a) be faced with compUcated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State.

That the expenditure cutbacks and consequent reduction in the hours of opening of the Australian National Library has seriously disadvantaged part-time students who are able to devote only evening hours to study. 3. That because of the reduced hours of operation, students, particularly those in the Arts Faculties, have a limited time available in which to consult primary source material held at the Australian National Library. 4.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the new Government during the recent election campaign, promised lower taxation and more money in people's pockets.

Overseas Development Assistance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That 400 million people inflation is hitting the poor countries more than the rich; every reduction in aid affects people; Australia can afford to help; Australian aid helps people help themselves. If we are to achieve the United Nations aid target, Australia must give at least 0.55 per cem of Gross National Product (GNP) in the next budget. by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received. Health Insurance Act The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Australian Medical Association and its affiliate, the Australian Association of Surgeons, intends entering into very negotiations with the Hon. the Minister of State for Health, to alter the Health Insurance Act and regulations. That such alterations as proposed are purely the wishes of a minority group seeking privUeges in relation to the billing of patients, and particularly pensioners and less well off members of the Australian Community, which are detrimental to the spirit of the Act and contrary to the whole intention of the legislation. That the Association of Surgeons has demonstrated by its refusal to treat pensioner patients in designated community and other hospitals providing beds under section 34 of the said Act, that its agitation against Medibank is purely the reaction of a selfish vested minority, and not in the best interests of the patients. That the efforts by the Association of Surgeons to underAus- mine Medibank by seeking to negotiate changes is the thin edge of the wedge to dismantle the Health Insurance Act altogether, an action which will not be tolerated by the Australian community in general and the pensioners, less privileged and disadvantaged members of society in particular. Your petitioners therefore ask that the Australian Parliament refuse to countenance any changes to the Health Insurance Act, and particularly those sought by influential minority interests who have demonstrated particularly by their actions in refusing to cooperate in the treatment of pensioner patients in hospital, that they do not have the interests and welfare of patients as their prime concern. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nicholls. Petition received. National Employment and Training Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat in respect to individuals employed under the National Employment and Training Scheme, great hardships haverisenwith the changes in payment of allowances under that scheme.

3,Mr YATES,ASSISTANCE,"I give notice that on Thursday next, General Business day No. 2, I shall move: That this House requests the Government to reconsider the necessity for a reduction of overseas aid this financial year and now calls for its restoration in the Budget by adding an income graded overseas aid surcharge to all taxable incomes so that Australia will be able to set an example by devoting 0.7 per cent of the gross national product to overseas aid and truly honour its obligations to the United Nadons and to the poorer nations of the world. NA NA",21
4,Mr WALLIS,OIL PRICING POLICY,"I direct a question to the Minister for National Resources. Why has it become necessary to refer the question of the crude oil pricing pohcy to the Industries Assistance Commission? Did not the Minister endorse the present policy when it was announced last September by the then Prime Minister, Mr Whidam? Is it not a fact that Esso-BHP and Wapet have already written off their development costs and that any increase in the current oil price at this stage can only be viewed as a golden handsake bearing in mind Press reports last weekend that Esso is repatriating $70m of its oil profit this year to the United States? If the Minister beheves that the present oil pricing policy is deficient, why does the Government not say so and review its whole pohcy rather than shunt one aspect of it to the IAC with the intention of hiding behind its report?",22
5,Mr ANTHONY,OIL PRICING POLICY,"It is quite incredible that the Labor Party should continue to defend its attitude in relation to oil exploration and the development of oil resources in this country. The Labor Party has set this nation back many years. Future generations will pay very dearly if we do not have sufficient oil to meet our requirements or at least a reasonable proportion of our requirements. The honourable member makes some claim that the recent price adjustment which was arbitrarily determined by the previous Government corrected the situation. It gave very Uttle benefit because at the same time that Government put a $2 per barrel excise duty on oil which practically negated whatever the increase might have been. It was a phoney presentation. The people who are concerned about developing the present known resources of oil have made representations to the Government pointing out that the cost of developing some of the outlying fields, some of the difierent pools, some of the newer areas, is quite prohibitive under the present pricing arrangements. The Government has taken cognisance of these remarks. It has asked that the matter dently assessed and that advice be given to it. We decided to refer the matter to the Industries Minister Assistance Commission and have asked for its report within a period of 6 months. Upon this decision will depend whether these companies are able to continue the development of some of theirfields.One such field is the Flounderfieldin Bass Strait. If this field is not developed nowand probably it will take three or four years to develop-ou r supply situation when we are approaching the 1980s will be worse. NA",22
6,Mr CORBETT,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,"The Minister for Post and Telecommunications will be aware of the large increases in post and telecommunications charges but I refer him to one in particular, the private mail bag charge which has gone up 100 per cent to $30. Is he aware that as a result of this a large number of private mail bags have been cancelled and therefore there has been no worthwhile increase in total revenue to the Postal Commission and that largely there has been just a disadvantage to many former users? As mail bags are provided by the users and are of advantage to postmasters and mailmen for sorting mail as well as being a protection for mail being delivered, will the Minister take this matter up with the Commission with a view to having the charge reduced to its former level of $ 15 which is quite high enough for this service?",22
7,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,I am aware of the increase in the charge for mail bags. I am not aware that there has been a tremendous decrease in their use but if my honourable friend tells me that that has happened in his electorate I would accept his statement.,22
8,Mr YOUNG,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,Why?,22
9,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,He represents his electorate well and is very knowledgeable about it. Mr E. G. Whitlam-He has only half as many people in his electorate as you have in yours.,22
10,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,"Of course, but they are still great Queenslanders. I have double the number but they are all great Queenslanders. The honourable member for Maranoa would know that I am concerned about the escalation in costs. We are all now paying the price for the mismanagement of the Austrahan economy that we had during the last few years. Of course I will look into this matter, discuss it with the Commission and report back to the honourable member. be indepenCOKING COAL PRICE NEGOTIATIONS",22
11,Mr KEATING,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,"I address a question to the for National Resources. Is it a fact as reported that the New South Wales soft coking coal producers received an increase of only 20c per tonne in their recent negotiations with Japanese importers? Has the Minister approved these contracts and if so why did he approve them? In view of the massive increase in export earnings resulting from Government intervention in export negotiations during the 3 years of Labor adrninistration, is it not imperative at a time when the national exchequer needs every penny it can get that the policy of supervision of contract negotiations be continued? Will the Minister teu the Parliament and the rnimng industry what role he and his Department intend to play in the future sale of Australian resources overseas?",22
12,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MAIL BAG CHARGE,"The Government has made very clear what its attitude and role are in relation to the surveillance of export sales of our raw materials. This will be a watching brief to see that the national interest is being protected. not our intention to become directly involved in commercial negotiations which are matters for producers and consumers but we do intend to be informed at all times of what is going on. If there is any need for the Government to help in these negotiations it will give the matter consideration. We have had some very successful negotiations recently. The iron ore negotiations were carried out under most difficult circumstances because of a depressed situation. The steel industry throughout the world is working at a low level. There are very heavy stockpiles at overseas steel mills. The negotiations were not easy but we managed, or at least the industry-the iron ore producers-wa s able to negotiate an increase of up to 35 per cent which wiU apply over a period of 18 months. Now that is a very satisfactory increase to apply. It puts the industry in a much better position to negotiate even some of the larger contracts that come up in 1977. We hear the honourable member sort of clinging to the performance of the previous Government and the way in which it got involved in some of these contracts. I refer to the iron ore contract because the then Minister held his chest out and spoke of the great job he did when he forced the industry to go back and to get a higher price in 1974. Yes, the industry went back and got a higher price but it was only a cosmetically adjusted higher price because it had no retrospectivity. The Australian industy did not get lc more because of the then Minister's interference. AU it did was to create antagonism between producers and the consuming country. The same sort of thing happened in the coal industry when the Minister raced off to Japan 1975. He was going to solve the issue. Unfortunately there was a Uttle affair going on in Austraha about Arab money for which he had to race home. But to conclude the deal quickly, he sold out on some of the coal producers who had reached the stage where they were going to get a considerably higher price than he sold out for in the end. In his haste to do a deal, he forgot to make allowance for currency changes. As it turned out, the Australian currency depreciated against the American currency. It meant the difference of about $4 or $5 a ton. When we spread the average over the whole industry, the mdustry lost something between $30m and $40m because of the bungling and interference of the Minister concerned. NA NA",23
13,Mr HODGMAN,SENATOR,"The Prime Minister would It is be aware of serious allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition against a former Minister for CivU Aviation, the late Senator the Honourable Sir Shane Paltridge. Is the Prime Minister also aware that a former member for Denison, the late Athol Townley, on occasions represented the late Minister for CivU Aviation in this House? Is there any truth in any of the outrageous and scandalous allegations against the late Sir Shane Paltridge? What can be done to protect the reputations of deceased Ministers and prevent great emotional distress to their surviving families?",23
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SENATOR,"There is no evidence known to the Government that would lend any substance to the charges made by the Leader of the Opposition. This matter began when the Leader of the Opposition wrote to my colleague, the Foreign Minister, and said that a member of the Australian National Airlines Commission had advised him that certain transactions had taken place concerning the purchase of an Australian interest in Lockheed Electra aircraft. The Foreign Minister asked what evidence there was in relation to this matter. One might have expected that if somebody who purports to be in a responsible position had evidence, he would provide it so that it could be examined, and further that somebody who purports to be in a responsible position would not idly make this kind of accusation to the great harm and distress of surviving relatives and friends and especially to the harm of somebody who has been dead a considerable number of years. But this is the nature of the man. Who is the member of the Australian National in Airlines Commission who gave this information to the Leader of the Opposition? Was it Sir Warren MCDonald who died in 1965? Was it Brigadier Blackburn who died in 1960? Was it Sir Giles Chippindall who died in 1969? If it were one of those three, the honourable gendeman has kept this information strangely to himself fbr quite a number of years. If it is one of the members of the Commission still Uving, then again, why not name the person who made the charge originaUy to him so that it could be pursued, as the Foreign Minister suggested if there were any evidence. What has happened in relation to this particular matter I trunk reminds us of another case when the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth indicted a certain person on charges of crirninal Ubel in relation to another transaction. There were 6 charges, 6 pleas, I think, of not guilty, 6 indictments of guilty, and a year in gaol on a charge of criminal libel as a result. It was the case of Somerville Smith which also involved Shane Paltridge who had been a vastly respected member of this Parliament. I believe that the charges that Mr Somerville Smith made were very similar in kind. No evidence was adduced in that case, I am advised. No evidence has been brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition. If there is evidence, why does he have to keep it secret? Why does he have to make statements seeking to besmirch the name of a dead man, because that is what he is doing, and doing it in the cheapest possible manner. I think the words that were used in mitigation by Mr SomerviUe Smith were not inappropriate to the Leader of the Opposition. They were: . . . When I look back at some of the newsletters and the contents of them, Your Honour, I just cannot realise that it was myself that wrote those newsletters. And I wish to apologise, Your Honour, to anybody and everybody that may have been mentioned, from the Prime Minister down to any person in any lower standing of life. I have libelled them and I really and truthfully, Your Honour, did not know at the time the meaning of'libel' the lives of people who have been libelled. . . . What is the difference between Sommerville Smith and the Leader of the Opposition? On the evidence so far made pubUc there is not much difference between these particular matters. Mr Speaker, in this place there is not great protection from or great defence against slander of people in this place, and under the rules there is not much protection from slander against the dead. Protection reaUy Ues as much as anything else, Mr Speaker, not only with the Standing Orders and what you are able to do when people are in this place, but also on the decency and honesty of honourable members themselves. That is a matter that the Leader of the Opposition fails to understand because it is so plainly and blatantly foreign to his nature.",23

25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SENATOR,"The House does not need reminding that the person who makes this accusation is the person who on all the evidence sought to sell his Party to Iraq for half a mUlion dollars. Who stood to defend him? Was it the President of the Australian Labor Party? Was it other people in the Party? It was Mr Hartley. Mr Hartley was the prime enemy of the Leader of the Opposition when he was seeking to do various things to the Victorian division of the Labor Party. But now who are the closest together? Mr Hartley and the Leader of the Opposition. Because of Mr Hartley's Unks with the Middle East, Mr Hartley and the Leader of the Opposition are so close together. I think these matters need to be understood. and the implications it has on The honourable gentleman has a favourite biographer and I would like to read just one sentence from a recent publication by that favourite biographer. Laurie Oakes wrote: At the Caucus meeting, and at a Press conference afterwards, Whitlam was able to deny specific aspects of the News Ltd report-and give the impression that he was denying the whole story. It was a legalistic approach, and one of dubious honesty. From his favourite biographer that might almost be his favourite epitaph- a man of dubious honesty. Mr Speaker, Senator MCKenna, who knew Senator Paltridge well, made it quite plain that he regarded him as a man of uncommon character and integrity when he spoke of him in the Senate after Senator Paltridge had died. Others who knew Shane Paltridge well have spoken of him in the same vein. There has been no evidence adduced against him. The statement in a letter from the Leader of the Opposition gave a source that is itself unnamed. If there was a source that could be named, why did the Leader of the Opposition not come forward with it as he was asked to do? I can only say, as all honourable gentlemen sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition would know, that the honourable gentleman is in this Parhament an influence that is corroding, corrosive and corrupt.",24

27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SENATOR,"I withdraw it. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question. Has he any evidence to support the imputations which he made against my Ministers and me when questions were directed to him about Lockheed Aircraft Corporation corruption by the honourable members for Fremantle and Newcastle on 18 and 24 February last? I ask him also when he first saw the letter which I sent to the Foreign Minister on 31 March about the information which I had been given about the late Senator Sir Shane Paltridge. I ask him further: Has he checked the question which I put on notice for the Minister representing Senator Sir Shane Paltridge in February or March 1962, which was referred to in the letter of 31 March which I sent to his colleague?",25
28,Mr SINCLAIR,SENATOR,"On IS March. Mr E. G. Whitlam-That date, 15 March, is the date upon which the written reply was given. My memory is- I have not checked it since-that the question was placed on notice in February 1962. Finally I ask: What action has the honourable gentleman taken pursuant to the questions asked of him without notice by the honourable members for Fremantle and Newcastle and the letter sent by me to the Foreign Minister on this matter S weeks ago?",25
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SENATOR,"The honourable ber gentleman misunderstands, as I would have expected him to, the nature of this instance. does not seem to understand that if somebody makes allegations of the kind that he has made, that person ought to put forward some evidence. In relation to questions that were asked of me an earher occasion, I think, if my memory is corin rect, I indicated that the charges could equally be made against the honourable gentlemen who had been Ministers when certain transactions had taken place, that both charges were equally without evidence as far as 1 was aware and that honourable gentlemen who sought to make these allegations should not do so without evidence. It is not for the Government to examine matters raised wildly and without evidence. It is for those who seek to besmirch a name to produce some evidence. If they are unprepared to produce some evidence, let them be silent because they besmirch the name of this Parliament. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask that the letter to which I referred be incorporated in Hansard.",25

32,Mr MCVEIGH,FOREIGN AID,"I direct a question to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. I draw his attention to the Government's decision to reduce the level of foreign aid. In view of this decision, I ask the Minister: Is it the Government's intention to cut back on the food aid component of the total foreign aid bill when there are cheap, high quality foods which are valuable as food aid, such as skim milk powder and beef products, to replace other forms of aid? Will greater emphasis be given by the Government to food aid as a component of foreign aid? Will the same emphasis be given by the Government to the use of foreign aid items such as specialist personnel and production inputs such as fertilisers as components of the foreign aid program, to boost these manufacturing industries in Australia and to relieve hunger and suffering in the Third World?",25
33,Mr SINCLAIR,FOREIGN AID,"It is true that, as a result of our endeavour to bring about a better relationship between public sector expenditure and private sector expenditure, this year in our foreign aid expenditure we are providing only $29.7m. I say 'only' but I want to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that this is a very significant sum of money. It reflects a very worthwhile contribution towards helping those people about whom the honourable memexpressed concern in his question. There are a number of reasons why we are finding it He difficult to provide the range of food aid that many honourable members would like us to provide. The first and most significant reason is that unfortunately eating habits in many countries do on not conform with the availability of surplus food this country. Yet, as honourable members will recall, the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to a very worthwhile provision of skim milk powder to Mozambique which does accord both with the requirements of that country and with the availability of surplus skim milk powder. The Government is intent on finding worthwhile ways by which it can help countries which are to be the receipients of foreign aid. We believe that our aid should conform with their basic requirements and should equally relate to the availabihty of products within this country. No figures have yet been set in relation to the next year's food aid program but we hope that we can relate not only the total amount provided for food aid but also the contents of that food aid program both to the requirements of the recipient country and to the availability of foodstuffs and other types of agricultural aid within this country. In so doing we beheve that we can make a very worthwhile contribution to the needs of those recipient countries. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question supplementary to that which I have just asked him. Did he see the letter which I sent to the Foreign Minister on 31 March concealing the Lockheed Electra purchases under Senator Paltridge before I quoted from the letter last Thursday? If he did, how long before did he see it.",25
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ALLEGATION AGAINST FORMER,If the honourable gentleman will indicate the relevance ofhis question I will answer it. NA,26
35,Mr BROWN,TAX INDEXATION,"My question which is addressed to the Prime Minister concerns taxation. Has the Government made a firm commitment to introduce tax indexation? If it has, when will it be introduced and when will it be announced that it will be introduced? More importantly, can the Prime Minister advise whether tax indexation will give immediate taxation rehef to taxpayers in Australia or wdl give relief only in the years following its introduction? Finally, can the Prime Minister teU me what reasonable expectations, if any, the taxpayer may have of reforms to taxation over and above and quite separate from tax indexation?",26
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TAX INDEXATION,"The Government's commitment to tax indexation is firm and unequivocal. We have made it plain that our decisions in relation to these matters will be announced at thetimeofthe Budget. We have also made it plain that we wiU be going as far with the Mathews proposals as iinancial responsibUity will allow. The Treasurer and I and other spokesmen for the Government have made it plain that that will be a significant step. The benefits flowing from taxation indexation will accrue not only in the first year in which it is introduced; they wiU be of continuing benefit because they wiU prevent the Commonwealth Government, from taking, by the illicit process of inflation and the progressive tax scale, a higher proportion of people's income and of everything that Australia produces year after year. Tax indexation will give a protection to individuals that no other system can give. Also it will compel governments to be honest, because if they want more of people's income they will have to legislate for it, and that means standing up in this Parliament and indicating their intentions clearly and openly. Mr Speaker, I think there was a second part to the question. Mr Brown- I asked whether there are to be other taxation reforms. SENATOR Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I hope that this Government will come to be regarded as one of continuing and enhghtened reform in the best Liberal tradition, and I expect that to continue for many, many years. NA",26
37,Mr CREAN,IMPORT PRICES,"I address a question to the Treasurer. It concerns a statement contained in the Government's submission to the National Wage Case concerning the terms of trade. The document stated that a sharprisein import prices is 'a Ukely and worrying possibility'. Given that it appears that world inflation rates are declining, will the Treasurer explain on what grounds the Government believes that a sharprisein import prices is a Ukely and worrying possibUity and in what specific areas of import?",26
38,Mr LYNCH,IMPORT PRICES,"I take the traditional course which has always been adopted when matters have been before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and that is not to canvass the views which the Government is putting before that Commission. That is the approach which I took when Minister for Labour and National Service and it is the one to which I adhere at the present time. NA",26
39,Mr BRADFIELD,MAINTENANCE ORDERS,"Is the Attorney-General aware that some wives who are separated from their husbands and who have had orders made for their maintenance, are having difficulty in collecting that maintenance? Has the Attorney General examined the extent of this problem? WUl he take steps to see that orders made under the Family Law Act are compUed with?",26
40,Mr ELLICOTT,MAINTENANCE ORDERS,"In January I became aware of the fact that deserted wives were finding it difficult to enforce their maintenance orders. I inquired as to whether the Austrahan Legal Aid Office was able to assist them and I found that the previous Labor Government had decided that the Legal Aid Office should not assist in tion to the enforcement of maintenance orders. In fact, no provision for this purpose was made in the last Budget nor was staff provided. So I was not able to give any assistance in that regard. I had a look at the family law regulations and discovered-honourabl e members will perhaps recall this-that the provisions for the enforcement of maintenance orders prescribe a series of alternatives for deserted wives with defaulting husbands. For instance, there is a procedure for sequestration; there is a procedure for garnishment; there is a procedure for seizure of property. Unfortunately those regulations were drawn in such a way as to be appropriate to a superior court of record and required an apphcation to be made supported by an affidavit. Honourable members will recall that in years past the enforcement of maintenance orders was usually done through courts of petty sessions and that the defaulting husbands would be brought before those courts on warrants. If they did not pay up they were sometimes sent to Long Bay or some other appropriate place. Under the Family Law Act that procedure was set aside. In order to alleviate the position of the deserted wife it seemed to me appropriate to amend the regulations. Another thing I found was that whereas in the past the clerks of petty sessions in the States had assisted deserted wives to take out the warrants or the informations in relation to the enforcement of maintenance ordersMr E. G. Whitlam-Without fee.",27
41,Mr ELLICOTT,MAINTENANCE ORDERS,"Without fee. Whereas they had done that in the past they would not do it under the family law reguladons because a choice had to be made as to whether the wife would apply for, say, an order for seizure, an order for sequestration or the like. The clerks of petty sessions, I understand on instructions from the Crown law authorities of the various States, no longer assist deserted wives and have not done, certainly in New South Wales and I understand in Victoria, in recent months. This week a new regulation has been gazetted. Its purpose is to endeavour to overcome this problem. In future a deserted wife whose order for maintenance is not being compUed with by her husband will be able to go along to a clerk of petty sessions and take out what I choose to caU a composite summons. That summons can be served on the husband. It will require him, in effect, to come along and be questioned. As a result of that questioning the magistrate will be able to make one or other of the orders that are set out in the regulations relaunder the FamUy Law Act. In other words, provided the wife can establish in some way that the default has taken place and that the order has been made, there will be no need for the clerk of petty sessions in future to make any decision in giving advice to the deserted wife as to what course she should take. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Does this mean that from now on the chamber magistrate will give advice without fee-again ?",27
42,Mr ELLICOTT,MAINTENANCE ORDERS,This should mean that the chamber magistrate should be able to do that because realty no advice will be involved as the summons is more or less automatic. Mr E. G. Whitlam-There will be no fee?,27
43,Mr ELOCOTT,MAINTENANCE ORDERS,"There never was a fee and, of course, it will not require legal aid. No legal aid would be avaUable for it because of what had been done previously. But that, I believe, should go a long way towards assisting the deserted wives who at the moment are unable to have their orders for maintenance enforced. NA",27
44,Mr BEAZLEY,LAWLEY HOUSE,I ask the Minister for Defence: Is it the intention of the Department of Defence to take over Lawley House for Department of Defence uses?,27
45,Mr KILLEN,LAWLEY HOUSE,I regret that I am unable to inform the honourable gentleman one way or the other. It is news to me. I will treat the question as being on notice and I will see that the honourable gentleman gets a reply to it this day. NA,27
46,Mr OKEEFE,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask: Has the Government had the New Zealand natural disaster insurance scheme checked out? Has this scheme been operating in New Zealand since 1944 and is it known as the Earthquake and War Damage Act? Is the premium a very minimal amount and has the scheme faced up to many disasters, such as earthquakes, storms, floods,fires,land slip damage and so on? Has it met those disasters financially and does it have a large credit surplus in its funds at the present time? Can the Treasurer inform the House whether this scheme could be operated successfully in Australia to cover such disasters as the Darwin cyclone, the Tasmanian fires, the Brisbane flood and many other floods throughout the nation?",27
47,Mr LYNCH,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"I am aware of the scheme to which the honourable gendeman referred-the New Zealand natural disaster program-whic h has led to the results to which he has adverted being achieved in New Zealand. I remind the honourable gendeman of what I said recently in response to a quesuon posed to me by the honourable member for Balaclava, that is, that the Government has accepted in principle the need for a natural disaster program in Australia because of the obvious deficiencies in the existing facdities which certainly have been brought home by recent natural disasters. A workmg party, representing both the government and the free enterprise sector, has been estabhshed. That working party is naturally taking the opportunity to view in all countries in the Western world which have a value for the purposes of comparison and research-and that will include New Zealand-comparabl e programs which may have a capacity for implementation here. As the working party proceeds with its task I will provide the honourable gentleman with whatever progress reports I can make available. NA NA",28
48,Mr MARTIN,HOSPITAL,My question is directed to the Minister for Repatriation. Is the Minister aware that there has been a large number of complaints from patients in regard to both the quantity and the quahty of the food that is now provided to patients at the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in New South Wales. Are those complaints the result of expenditure cuts ordered by the Government? Does the Minister agree that the food that is provided to patients at military and repatriation hospitals should be of good quahty and sufficient in quantity? Will the Minister investigate these complaints and remedy the situation?,28
49,Mr NEWMAN,HOSPITAL,"I agree with the honourable question member that the quahty of food at any repatrialso ation or military hospital should be good. not aware of any complaints about the quahty of food at Concord Repatriation General Hospital. I can only say that on visiting Concord Hospital for one was very impressed with the quality food that was produced by the kitchen. I had opportunity to have lunch prepared by the member kitchen. I doubt very much that there is any serious problem-o r any problem at all-wit h the food. However, I am quite willing to have a at the complaint. If the honourable member any specific cases which he would like to bring my attention I would be only too glad to examine them. NA",28
50,Mr CHAPMAN,SMOKING ON AIRCRAFT,I direct a question to the Minister for Transport. Is the report in this morning's Australian newspaper correct that the Government is looking at the possibility of increasing the number of non-smoking seats on aircraft,28
51,Mr SPEAKER,SMOKING ON AIRCRAFT,Order! The honourable gendeman is not entitled to base his question on a newspaper report. I will assist the honourable gendeman by informing him that the way to begin his question is merely to say 'Is it correct that' and then to go on with the remainder of the question.,28
52,Mr CHAPMAN,SMOKING ON AIRCRAFT,"Than k you, Mr Speaker, I will rephrase the question. Is it correct that the Government is looking at the possibility of increasing the number of non-smoking seats on aircraft? If so, would the Minister agree that, with the dangers of so-called passive smoking, which non-smokers are forced to endure in the presence of smokers, and also the recirculating effects of air-conditioning, an increase in the number of non-smoking seats is not an adequate solution to the problem? Will the Minister therefore take the only step which will provide an adequate solution, particularly in regard to preserving the health of the 63.1 per cent of adults who are non-smokers",28
53,Mr SPEAKER,SMOKING ON AIRCRAFT,Order! The honourable gentleman is not entided to put a question which suggests the answer. The honourable gentleman is entitled to ask the Minister: 'Will he make a change?',28
54,Mr CHAPMAN,SMOKING ON AIRCRAFT,I now ask the Minister: Will he ban smoking on aircraft?,28
55,Mr NIXON,SMOKING ON AIRCRAFT,"I have to confess to some surprise at the support for the question. I take it from the tenor of the honourable member's that Uke me he is a non-smoker. I take it that, Uke me, he has on occasions boarded I am an aeroplane and sought a non-smoking seat only to be placed near, as I have often been, one of the famous cigar smokers of the Parliament or I worse still one of the famous pipe smokers of the of Parliament. This matter was first raised by a the question on notice I think by the honourable for Murray. As a result of his question I wrote to the airUnes and asked them for information as to the basis upon which they had made a look judgment on the number of seats that were has marked 'non-smoking'. That was some weeks to ago. I do not think I have had a reply from either of the domestic ahlines on the subject. The honourable member takes the matter one stage further by asking whether I will ban smoking on aircraft. It may not be known in the Parliament, Sir, but I am a great defender of civU rights. As great defender of civil rights I therefore must have regard for the feelings of my feUow man or fellow person, or whatever the appropriate expression may be. Therefore I do not at this stage-and I repeat 'at this stage'-propos e to ban smoking on aircraft. I wiU however-this is really letting myself in for something-be prepared to take representations on the subject. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Ministen Does he recaU the Australian Statistician's survey of 60 000 Australians in 1974 which showed that 51.4 per cent of those poUed preferred Advance Australia Fair as the National Anthem and 19.6 per cent preferred Waltzing Matilda? In deciding that Waltzing Matilda should be played for Australia at the Olympic Games at Montreal, did the Prime Minister take account ofthefindingsof this the largest opinion poll ever conducted in Australia-it was 30 times as large as any polls ordinarily conducted in Australia-o r did he consider that the personal wishes of himself and his colleagues should override the preference so recently and clearly expressed by the Austrahan people?",28
56,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATIONAL ANTHEM,"The honourable would gentleman, as always, has his mind in the past and I suppose it will stay there because there is no future. The circumstances that the honourable gentleman established in relation to that poll were not real ones. They were circum1958 stances in which God Save the Queen could not even be part of the poll and in which bands were told that they must not play it. The honourable gendeman deUberately set out to establish a false set of circumstances. My coUeagues and the Government have expressed a strong preference for a particular tune because it is the tune which is known right around the world to depict Australia and much of what is best in Australia. The circumstances in which it often played arouse a feeling of comradeship and mateship which, before the honourable gendeman became Prime Minister, were so much part of the Australian scene. The decision announced yesterday indicating the Governunderstand ment's preference seems to have met, both yesterday and today, with a remarkable degree of public acceptance through one form or provision another. Whatever final decision the Australian people make, I am sure that it will be a decision that is intrinsically their own and something that wiU be remembered and be of value for a long while. The honourable gendeman did not remind a people before conducting his poll that the second verse of Advance Australia Fair again harks back to the days in the past that he would wish to forget-whe n Britannia did rule the waves. The words do not really seem to be the most appropriate, although the words are not the most significant element. Advance Australia Fair does not seem the most appropriate tune in the view of many people for Australia's national tune. That is what it is all about. NA",29
57,Mr DONALD CAMERON,DEFAMATION LAWS,I ask the Attorney-General whether New South Wales is the only State in Australia where Utigation can be taken up on behalf of a deceased person in the event of that person having been libelled and whether Queensland or some other State would be an appropriate place in which to slander a deceased person deUberately?,29
58,Mr SCHOLES,DEFAMATION LAWS,I rise on a point of order. The question clearly asks for a legal opinion.,29
59,Mr SPEAKER,DEFAMATION LAWS,"The question does ask for a legal opinion but it is competent for the Attorney-General to answer in terms of whether the legislation exists, as distinct from the second part of the quesion as to whether Queensland be an appropriate place. The Attorney General is entided to give a statement of fact for him regarding the legislation.",29
60,Mr ELLICOTT,DEFAMATION LAWS,"I am not able to answer the question completely. I can only say that I think in the Defamation Act of New South Wales provided a definition of defamatory matter that mUitary included statements, for instance",29
61,Mr UREN,DEFAMATION LAWS,I have had plenty of practice at it.,29
62,Mr ELLICOTT,DEFAMATION LAWS,"The honourable member has had experience of the defamation laws of New South Wales. The Act included a definition to the effect that defamatory matter related to matters reflecting on a deceased person. Howis ever, in the interpretation of that I understand that even if something reflects on a deceased person it has to reflect also on the Uving. For instance, if somebody said of somebody's mother who was deceased that she was a whore I that that would reflect on the living. So not all defamatory matters would come within the classification. I doubt whether this still exists in New South Wales. I think it was taken out in 1974. Whether it exists in other States, I am not sure. From recollection, it was contained in the laws of Queensland and I think of Tasmania, but may I say that it is not a matter that I have looked at precisely for some dme. NA",29
63,Dr JENKINS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,My quesuon is addressed to the Treasurer. In view of recent speculations about mini budgets can the Treasurer explain to the House whether it is Government policy in general terms- I do not think he knows any other-to reflate or deflate the economy?,30

The honourable member may be bemused about Press reports which have been appearing in recent days. They range from fact to fiction. AU I would say to the honourable member, if that be the prelude to what he was asking of me, is that of course at the present time the Government is undertaking its normal Budget process. I might say to the House in relation to our approach to this matter that that cess will be far more thorough and far more comprehensive than was ever the case when the honourable member and his coUeagues were in government and decisions which flow from that process will be the subject of announcement in this Parliament at the appropriate time.

75,Mr VTNER,LAVERTON ROYAL COMMISSION,"On 5 January last year an incident involving pohce and Aborigines Skull Creek, near Laverton In Western Austraha. Reports of the incident at the time were sufficiently serious to warrant further investigation on an official level. The first of these official but secret inquiries was a high-level police investigation which exonerated the police. The second was an inquiry by Magistrate Syddall, sponsored by the Western Australian Government, which was also secret. The third, by the Laverton Joint Study Group, was made pubUc. It confirmed the seriousness of the incident. Briefly this was that vehicles carrying 74 men, women and chUdren, had been intercepted by body of pohce at Skull Creek. Without provocation or cause of any kind, violence was done a number of Aborigines and a significant number of them were arrested, gaoled and became known in the Press as 'The Skull Creek Incident'. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at that time, Senator Cavanagh, was not satisfied that the previous reports went far enough. He fought hard for a royal commission into not only the SkuU Creek incident, but also into reports of inciat dents involving drunkenness and violence royal commission. among Aborigines in the town of Laverton itself for several weeks prior to 5 January. This report which I am tabUng today is result of that royal commission. It makes disturbment's ing reading. Before describing some of its findings I would Uke honourable members to be clear in their mind about two facts. Firsdy, report deals with two separate situations. concerns excessive drinking and violence in Laverton itself. The other concerns the incidents at SkuU Creek in which alcohol played no part. The royal commission found that there were indeed a number of drunken Aborigines in ing Laverton who had been behaving sometimes violently, throwing stones and using bad language for several weeks prior to the Skull Creek incident. Police reinforcements had been from KalgoorUe to help cope with the situand the report states clearly that the police, regard to disturbances in the town of Laverton, had acted reasonably in difficult conditions. However, one of the most serious aspects of the report is concerned not with incidents in the the town of Laverton but the royal commission's condemnation of the poUce in respect of Skull Creek. Namely, it was found that: Without any cause whatsoever, pohce arrested innocent people and having arrested occurred at them, imprisoned them. Pohce then fabricated charges against them in order to justify their arrests. Further, the same pohce were proposing to fabricate evidence through other police officers, who were not in fact witnesses, to support the charges. They, the police, altered their original charges, stated to be Aborigines fighting Aborigines, to Aborigines fighting police- a charge which was false although the royal commission found that there was one incident of violence, or more, at Skull Creek for which it could not say who was responsible. When the royal commission discovered the a alterations to the charges and sought to find out how and why these had occurred it was, into the words of the report, 'intentionally frustrated' by the poUce officers in their attempts humUiated. It to establish the truth. By any standards of conduct, towards Aborigines or non-Aborigines, this constitutes the most deUberate attempt to pervert the administration of justice. Further any question of excessive consumption of alcohol by Aborigines cannot be regarded as a cause for the conduct of the police Skull Creek, nor was it regarded as such by the It has been suggested that there was a lack of interest by officers of my Department in the incithe dents. However, I am aware that the DepartArea Officer in Laverton at the time, Mr Bachman, had been working beyond the call of duty with the Laverton PoUce Sergeant for some the weeks to overcome the problems associated with One the excessive consumption of alcohol among Aborigines in the town. After the Skull Creek incident, this officer was not called on by police. He was, however, sought by the imprisoned Aborigines and through visiting them and heartheir stories was able to help them. In doing so, Mr Bachman was later able to assist the royal commission and was accepted by it as a witness of reliability and integrity. In respect of alcohol the report says: Whilst the underlying causes are complex, the immediate cause of most of the troubles which we have described in this period was excessive drinking by Aborigines. This problem, I would like to assure honourable members, is of great concern to myself and to the Government. It is of great concern also to Aboriginal people themselves. In the latter case, proof of this concern can be found at the moment in Sydney where an all Aboriginal nadonal conference on the problems of alcohol is being held this week. In my opening address to the conference on Monday I drew attention to the common but wrongly held view that Aborigines and drunkenness necessarily go together. As an indication of the Government's concern in this field, I have given to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, as its first task, a reference on alcohol abuse problems in the Aboriginal community. I am confident its report will be as valuable a document as its previous reports into other problem areas. But drunkenness had nothing whatsoever to do with the incidents at Skull Creek, as I have already said. Events as revealed by the Royal Commission show the innocent purpose for which the Aborigines were moving from Warburton to Wiluna-to take part in their traditional rain making ceremonies. It is this fact which points up so clearly the chasm which exists between one culture and another when the people of those cultures do not understand each other and why they do certain things. Of the 28 pohce officers stationed at Laverton at the time of the Skull Creek incident, only ten had had any previous dealings with Aborigines. Since the incident, the Western Australian Government has taken a number of steps to improve police-Aboriginal relations and to foster better understanding between the groups. Other States, notably South Austraha, have been active from time to time in setting up committees on which pohce and Aborigines are represented, to build better relations. The setting up of such a committee in Redfern, in Sydney, some time ago led to a significant drop in the number of arrests of Aboriginals. I am of the firm opinion that an organised nationwide effort is overdue to further better relationships through an increased understanding of Aboriginal culture, tradition and values in law enforcement agencies. I am therefore giving due consideration to sponsoring an effort to look at proposals for a national policy on policeAboriginal relations. If, in fact, the officer who took charge of the pohce reinforcements at Laverton at the time of the Skull Creek incident had knowledge of customs and traditions of Aborigines, he most likely would have understood the purpose of the Aborigines at SkuU Creek and have made appropriate inquiries before taking any action. I believe the decision to hold a royal commission into the Skull Creek incident, as well as events earUer in the town of Laverton, has been fuUy vindicated. It must be a matter of satisfaction to this Parliament and to Senator Cavanagh who sponsored the royal commission. We now have a public document which will be the source of much study and thought and which will perhaps provide guidelines for the future. The cost, which has been reported in the newspapers, will have been worth every cent if, as I hope, the real value of the report is felt in the way it can change the future of police-Aboriginal relationships, attitudes of courts and judges, prison officers and ultimately, one might hope, the future of race relations in Australia.

However I wish to make this opening comment: That it does concern,32
79,Mr SPEAKER,LAVERTON ROYAL COMMISSION,If the honourable member does so it will mean that he is getting the call. I will grant him indulgence for a couple of sentences.,32
80,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LAVERTON ROYAL COMMISSION,I wanted to make the point that this matter involves law reform. We are very anxious that the Minister directs his mind to those aspects which have been the subject of a Law Reform Commission report. I say no more than that because my colleague the honourable member for Hughes has details which he wishes to mendon.,32
81,Mr LES JOHNSON,LAVERTON ROYAL COMMISSION,"I appeople preciate the courtesy extended by my colleague. am gratified to hear the comments that the Minthat ister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr tabling this report in respect of the royal commission conducted into the Laverton affair, well known as the Skull Creek affair. I believe that report fully justifies the stand taken by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Cavanagh, who, against great odds and despite the reluctance of the Western Austrahan Premposition ier, despite the reluctance of the Minister for Commumty Welfare in the Western Australian Government and despite the opposition Police Commissioner and the Deputy Pohce Commissioner, persisted with the idea of probwas ing this unfortunate incident. It is 16 months today since the Skull Creek cident occurred on 5 January 1975. As the Minisrespect ter has pointed out, some 74 men, children were on their way in a large-scale mobile party moving from Warburton to Wiluna for the purpose of a rain making and man making ceremony. As a result of the lack of understandThe ing on the part of the pohce, that force which was substantially oriented towards a religious servance was unjustifiably set upon. The sequel, of course, was that there was very grave misrepresents handling of the Aboriginal people involved. Some 22 pohce were involved in the raid and some 22 Aboriginal people were apprehended and found guilty of offences which had never been committed. They were locked in cells. What has been revealed and acknowledged by the Minister in his summary of the report is that there has been a conspiracy. This adds up to a sorry blot on the reputation of the Western tralian police force. To some degree it must regarded as reflecting the prejudice which prethat vails to too large a degree around Austraha towards the Aboriginal community. There were 3 inquiries before the royal mission was conducted. It says something of whitewashing processes that those inquiries could have taken place without the evidence that which was subsequently revealed. The first inquiry was the official pohce investigation. It every way exonerated the police. It lent no dence at all to the contention of a police conalcohol spiracy, to the contention of provocation, to contention of misunderstanding on the part of the pohce, to the contention diat there was complete lack of knowledge of Aboriginal behaviour in situations of this kind, to the contention of mishandling by the police, to the contention of heavy handedness by the police or to the contention of pohce brutality. The Aboriginal were left looking culpable; they were left I looking like a drunken rabble whereas, in fact, has been established as contrary to the facts Viner) made in of the situation. The second inquiry was conducted by a magisthe trate-Magistrat e Sydall-wh o was said to be then sympathetic to Aboriginal people, having worked and lived in their communities and also having been a member of the police force. The in regard to this inquiry, which was initiated by the Western Australian Government was that the magistrate, regardless of any good of the intentions he may have had, was left inadequately clothed with powers so that there no privilege and no evidence taken under oath. Finally at the end of this secret inquiry, there was a secret report which I do not think has ineffectively seen the Ught of day. So in every that inquiry can be regarded as very limwomen and ited in its findings. The third report was prepared by the Laverton Joint Study Group. This report was made public. attention of Senator Cavanagh was drawn to the seriousness of this position. What the Minisobter has said today can be summarised in these terms: The Minister said that the report disturbing reading. The police have arrested and imprisoned innocent people on a considerable scale. The pohce have fabricated charges. The police proposed to fabricate evidence through other pohce who were not witnesses. The pohce prepared bogus charge sheets, that is, they destroyed the initial sheets and produced other sheets. The pohce conspired to say that on arrival at Skull Creek, the Aboriginal Auspeople werefightingwhereas in fact it has been be estabUshed through the royal commission that was not the case. Senior Inspector Hilton has been named by the royal commission as having knowledge that the police had prepared false charges and that he acquiesced in that process. comThe poUce altered the charges. The initial charges and the subsequent charges have been estabUshed as being untrue. The Minister said this was a most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of justice. He has also made in the point that contrary to the claims that were crewidely made by Western Australian authorities, was not the cause of this incident at all. the He made the point that it had been established that the officer in charge was lacking in knowla edge in regard to the customs and traditions of the Aboriginal people. In every way the Aboriginal people have been vindicated and my ministerial predecessor, Senator Cavanagh, has been vindicated as well. I beheve congratulations are due to him from the Austrahan Parliament, the Aboriginal people and indeed the people of this country as a whole since it has now been established that it can happen that Aboriginal people can be unfairly and vindictively dealt with on a large scale. There are many other matters which justify such a comprehensive inquiry. Honourable gendemen are aware of various disturbances that have taken place in the Northern Territory. One I recall took place at Fink where 3 Aboriginal people were ordered away from the water tank by railway workers. As a result a disturbance occurred and the Aboriginal people were very badly treated. There was another incident at Fink when an out of town policeman came into town shooting his revolver indiscriminately. There have been a number of incidents which, in the course of my ministerial period of office caused me to commit myself on behalf of the then Government to a comprehensive inquiry into Aboriginal-police relations in the Northern Territory. I know that Senator Cavanagh has talked about the case of Paula Sweet in Alice Springs. She was the Aboriginal girl who was murdered. It was a murder in respect of which 2 Aboriginal people were charged with murder, assault and thing attempted rape and four were charged with assault and attempt to rape. All were subpolicemen sequendy released but only after it had been tablished that the police had conspired to fabrinal cate evidence and to cause those unsuspecting the victims to utter words which had not originated from them and which did not in fact represent the true situation. All this is now widely known but there has not been a comprehensive inquiry into the affairs of Paula Sweet. Towards the end of the Labor Government's period of office, on behalf of the Government, I had made the commitment for a royal commission into Aboriginal-police relations in Northern Territory in regard to a series of inciof dents and the general position. This was not just for the purpose of vindictively searching out people who had offended in the past and bringters. ing them to the bar of justice, but for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of the kind of situorientation ation which has characterised Aboriginal-police relations for far too long. The terms of had been drawn up. Indeed, since there has been large scale evidence of bad treatment of Aborigireport nal people by the courts, the pohce, institutional people and many others associated with justice, I sought at the request of the Aboriginal Legal Service and a large number of other legal people and persons involved with social welfare organisations to extend the terms of that inquiry past the Northern Territory on to a Australia wide basis. As Senator Cavanagh mentioned in another place only yesterday, there is some doubt as to the constitutionality of such an inquiry being held throughout Australia having regard to the Australian Government's prerogative. It was for that reason that I had proposed that the inquiry to be conducted in the Northern Territory should be extended into the States of Australia to the extent that those States were prepared to welcome it. To his credit, the Premier of South Austraha, on behalf of the South Australian Government, immediately responded without any delay to my request and said that such an inquiry would be welcomed in South Australia. I believe that the matter which the Minister has raised today, the manner in which he has raised it and the comments he has made give credence to the idea that the Laverton report should not be an end unto itself. I believe that a prima facie case has been made out and should cause governments, preferably in a co-operative way, to hold an inquiry, preferably in my view by a royal commission process, to probe thoroughly all aspects of Aboriginal-police relations. One has been well estabhshed not only at Laverton but in many other places. Far too many who have a real prerogative in such essituations know little or nothing about Aborigiculture. There are too many instances where pohce involved with indigenous people who do not speak the English language have no knowledge of the tribal language and no one in the force can effectively communicate with the Aboriginal people. One only has to look at the statistics to see the great incidence of injustice which is done to Aboriginal people. I would like to see the inquiry extended to examine the role of the Aboriginal Legal Service the which has done very worthwhile work on behalf Aboriginal people since its incorporation in July 1973. Since that time the organisation has given representation in some 48 000 legal matWithout a special assault of a positive nature with an inclination, a sympathy and an about Aboriginal interests, the injustice which has characterised Aboriginal-police reference relations in the past will continue. I have not had the opportunity of reading the although I have read some Press accounts of it in the Western Australian Press. I believe that the Minister has established that he is not biased and that he has a reasonable atdtude about these matters. But I say to the Minister who has summarised the Laverton report in a fair and reasonable way that Laverton simply shows that there is need to hft the curtain on a much larger scale. I suggest to him that the comprehensive nation-wide royal commission which the Labor Government had in mind and which was coming near tofinalityon 11 November last should be given effect to by this Government and that all governments in Austraha should be asked to co-operate in the probe which all of us would hope will bring a fair go and justice to Aboriginal people who have been subjected to indignity for far too long in respect of these matters.",33
82,Mr WENTWORTH,LAVERTON ROYAL COMMISSION,"I found the statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) admirable and balanced. I have not had the opportunity of reading the report, but I shall look for an opportunity to do so. I beheve that we cannot put all the blame on one side. I am convinced that the Aborigines were utterly and absolutely innocent in respect of SkuU Creek. I do not think the same could be said about the previous incidents at Laverton. I do not think that any of us ready want to say that. So it is not just a case being right and one side being wrong. I think that nothing can excuse an attempt by the pohce to twist evidence and to frustrate the inquiry. Nothing could excuse that at all, and one does not want to. The Minister spoke in fair and commendatory terms of what had been done by Senator Cavanagh. Could I add that I believe that the House should also look at what has been done by Mr Manfred Cross, the former member for Brisbane, who was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in the last Parliament. He, like myself, when we read of the incident at Skull Creek and made inquiries, was convinced that the Aborigines at Skull Creek were completely innocent of the charges made. Of course, I do not know to what extent he spoke to Senator Cavanagh in regard to this incident. That is a matter for his own Party. But I do know that Mr Manfred Cross was very much in favour of the inquiry which took place and which has been completely justified. I do not know that one gets a great deal of satisfaction in trying to hunt down the poUce, and in saying that everything the pohce have done has been wrong. The House will know that there are very considerable disturbances in the Aboriginal community equivalent to the disturbance at Laverton to which the Minister makes mention in his statement. The incident at Laverton is not an isolated one. In the interests of the Aboriginal people it is essential that the kind of incident that occurred at Laverton be brought to an end throughout the north and central part of Austraha where Aborigines still maintam some of their own tribal infrastructure. I beheve that the policies of past governments - and I use the word 'government' in the pluralhave been wrong in that they have endeavoured to disregard the Aborigines own identity and systems of authority. I think we have to take a completely different approach if we are to give some hope to the Aboriginal people. I say with very great regret that in the last few years the deterioration in the condition of the Aboriginal people in the north and central part of Austraha has been shocking and to me almost unbelievable. Things are not getting better; they are getting worse. Something has to be done. It is no good denigrating the pohce as a whole. The conduct of the poUce at Skull Creek was inexcusable. At Laverton the conduct of the Aboriginal people was of such a character that if it is maintained at other places it will destroy them and their chances of advancement and even of mainof one side taining their present position. What I liked most about the Minister's statement was that it was balanced and that it did not try to say that there was nothing wrong with the Aboriginal people. It did not say that there was nothing wrong with the pohce. It tried to say that there was some blame on both sides, although not at SkuU Creek. The Skull Creek incident, taken by itself, was one for which the Aboriginal people could not be blamed. They were entirely the innocent party. That is not the position in regard to the anterior incidents at Laverton. Let us be balanced about this matter. It is only by a balanced approach that we can hope to do anything to help the Aboriginal people to help themselves. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",35
83,Mr SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The necessity for the Government to make a prompt commitment to selective decentralisation. I call upon those members who approve of proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members requiredhis the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",35
84,Mr UREN,DECENTRALISATION,"The Opposition raised this matter of pubhc importance to expose the certain destruction by the Fraser Governfor ment of the growth centre program. It is of serious concern and is such an important debate that only one member of the National Country Party is in the chamber. I want to begin by ing quickly at the known facts, before fitting them into certain consequences for growth centres. Last Budget, the Budget for 1975-76, the Labor Government allocated a total of $65.9m for growth centres. This was made up of about $40m for Albury-Wodonga, $8.5m for Bathurstit Orange, $ 16.6m for Sydney-south-western sector and $0.5m for Monarto. When the Fraser would Government took over it did not tamper with these levels of spending. In any case, there Uttle that it could do. The money had been comhave mitted to the States and could not be withdrawn. It is not what happened in 1975 that is the issue but the massive disembowelling of the growth centre projects that is now Government. ShamefuUy, this carving up of the growth centre program has been done by stealth. The Une that is coming from the Government's official spokesmen is completely different from that which is coming from its hatchet men in Treasury who are actuaUy doing the job. Last Friday the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, Senator paring Greenwood, who is the Minister responsible growth centres, made a sensible speech in Adelaide on the future of growth centres. is Utde with which to quarrel in the theory of Senator Greenwood's speech. He pointed to the likely population movements in Australia over the next 25 years. In particular he pointed to heavy rate of household formation in the next to 20 years. In the main, I agree with the popu1976-77 lation projections which he expressed and with the impUcations for internal population movefirst ments which he drew from them. He went on to that stress the importance of a selective growth centre approach whUe not excluding the need to prodone. vide other forms of related regional assistance. Again I found Utde with which to quarrel in the philosophy expressed by Senator Greenwood. It is simUar in many ways to the phUosophy buUt up by the Labor Government and absorbed the old Department of Urban and Regional disrupted Development. the But Senator Greenwood had nothing to say on the crucial point, which is: How is the growth centre program to be funded? The whole tone of by speech and the phUosophy which he expressed are based on keeping up the flow of funds to growth centres. Yet nowhere did he has come clean and make a firm commitment of future funds for the existing growth centres and the new ones that wiU be needed over the such next few years. In this respect the speech is grossly misleading, because it impUes a firm level of future funding. Yet, as Senator Greenwood lookweU knows, his Cabinet is about to aboUsh growth centre spending, at least for 1976-77. Last Friday I made a statement in which I said that the Treasury had decided not to include the funds for growth centres in the Supply BUls which are to come before this Parhament before rises at the end of the month. On Monday the Australian Financial Review reported that there be no funds for growth centres in the Supply BiUs, apart from $4m for Albury-Wodonga. I was have no reason to disbelieve the story. It may been based on later information than that which was avaUable to me. In any case, the essential point remains, which is: Whether a token allocation is made to Albury-Wodonga or not, the Government is bent on destroying the engaging the growth centre program. Let us make some calculations on the information which I have put to the House. Assume that thefigureof $4m for Albury-Wodonga is correct. the If $4m is allocated in the Supply BUls, this impUes a total spending for the whole of the financial year 1976-77 at around $9.6m. Comthisfigurewith the 1975-76figure,the alfor location for Albury-Wodonga will be chopped by around 75 per cent, from just over $40m to There just under $10m. With only Albury-Wodonga funded, the entire allocation for growth centres will plunge from $65.67m in 1975-76 to $9.6m in 1976-77. It may be said that it is unfair to argue the on the Supply period alone and that the Govern15 ment might resume funding when the Budget for is put to the Parliament. I cannot accept this proposal. If the funds are not there for the 5 months of the year it is logical to expect they wiU not be there for the balance of the year. In any case, the damage would have been Growth centre programs have been carefully developed in 5-year rolling programs. These programs are not designed to leap-frog over a year in which the funds are chopped off. Once the by money stops, the programs stop. They are in many ways, and it may take years to overcome the disruption even if the Federal cash flow is resumed. The whole process of allocation of resources is thrown completely out of gear. Private investment decisions are deferred and in many cases abandoned. The provision of the infrastructure through pubhc works programs is run down and eventually stops. Job opportunities disappear, and there are grave risks of a severe recession. This is the picture which Treasury strategy is painting for the key parts Austraha's developing economy. I want to look now at the order of spending that is required to keep a viable growth centre program going. As a guide, I refer to the last figures that were available to me as the responsible Minister. No doubt the Government has more accurate figures, but at least these figures give an indication of what is required. The forward projections for Albury-Wodonga require a spending of $68m in 1976-77. As I indicated earher, the best that this growth centre can expect is $9.6m. The amount required would taper in future years as a substantial part of the land acquisition and capital works program in Albury-Wodonga is completed. According to my estimates, Albury-Wodonga would need $58.5m in 1977-78 and $28.9m in 1978-79.1 stress that these figures are calculated on June 1975 prices. The other growth centres also require a consistent level of support. For instance, BathurstOrange would require $ 13.7m in 1976-77, $ 13.1m in 1977-78 and $11.3m in 1978-79. The honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Giliard), whose electorates have been betrayed by the Government, can no longer remain silent. For the Sydney South Western sector the projected order of spending wouldriseto a peak of one $48.3m in 1977-78 and then taper off to $39m in Much the following year. The electorate of honourable years. member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) has been spending sold out. Neither of these key programs is to be looking. Itat funded in 1976-77, nor is the Monarto growth to a peak of $ 194m centre in South Austraha. Again it seems that the out new commitments Government has completely scrapped the new around $ 160m in 1978-79.1 growth centres which the Labor Government was developing. If we had stayed in government made a definite commitment so could there would have been certain funding for other growth centres in the 1976-77 Budget. I refer Geelong, Gosford-Wyong and TownsvUle. I know that Mr Hamer has been working on the centre Government to make a commitment to Geelong. existingprogram On aU the evidence he has faded. His faUure to stand up to the big land developers in the Geelong region disturbed me greatly when I was the Minister. His own unwillingness to confront the conservative elements ofhis Cabinet delayed funds for Geelong which the Labor Government committed -,It might interest the Premier to know that our forward projection for Geelong involved a level of spending of about $26m for the next 3 years. Both the'Gosford-Wyong and the TownsvUle growth centres are geared to where population increase is how occurring in Austraha. Outside the capital cities the main sources of population of increase are the New South Wales coast north of Sydney and the Queensland coast. There are other areas of strong increase such as the Pilbara in Western Australia and the Bowen Basin in Queensland which are best looked at in the context of a development policy. But TownsvUle and Gosford-Wyong are tador-made for the growth centre approach. Unfortunately both State Governments have dragged the chain. The Premier of Queensland particularly cost his State tens of millions of dollars by refusing to cooperate with the Whidam Labor Government. Now that the Government has changed he is desperately trying to recoup his losses by getting this Government to support a growth centre at TownsviUe but I am afraid that it is too late. If it is any consolation to the Queensland Premier, the forward planning of the Whitlam Labor Government was looking to a total of around $ 13m for TownsvUle over the next 3 years. Apart from TownsvUle and Gosford-Wyong, there may already be a case for looking at other potential growth centres on this coastal axis. We have made money avaUable for the Fitzroy Basin region of Queensland to upgrade the services of Gladstone. There may be a case for a growth centre in the Fitzroy Basin, perhaps at Gladstone, and there may be a case for another on the north coast of New South Wales. will depend on the trends of population growth and internal migration over the next few Let me conclude by looking at the order of which the last Government was would haverisenrapidly in 1976-77 in the following year. Withit would have fallen to stress that these are only estimates. Quite clearly, we not have out knowledge of the immediate budgetary withfar ahead situto ation. It shows the Unes on which the Labor Government was working to develop a growth which would cut the pressures on cities and provide attractive alternatives. We are facing a heavy rate of household formation in the next few years, particularly in the next 10 to 15 years. There is no doubt that these young famUies will be looking for better and different lifestyles. The growth centre program was devised to provide these opportunities at the same time as giving a breathing-space which would allow the replanning of our major cities which have gone badly astray. It can be done at cost which the nation can bear. It is ridiculous castigate as too cosdy a growth centre program whose peak annual cost is below the capital of one of the new cruisers which the Government is buying from the United States of America. There is no alternative to the selective growth centre program. The scattered decentralisation program which has been suggested by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy spent Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) which spreads sistance thinly over a wide range of centres not work, nor does the commitment to the overwas centralisation of Sydney and Melbourne which occurred under previous Liberal-National Counthe try Party governments. State governments have tried to meet these problems for years. The vate sector cannot do the job without the support of government. This will be proved very quickly if support for Albury-Wodonga is withdrawn. can be done with all levels of governmentraise Federal, State and local government-workin closely with the private sector and munities. This is the essence of the growth centre concept. It would be tragic for Austraha if the growth centre process which has been carefully built up over the past few years were to be destroyed by lack of commitment by this Government.",36
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,38
86,Mr MACKELLAR,DECENTRALISATION,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) has proposed for discussion as a matter of pubhc speech. importance: The necessity for the Government to make a mitment to selective decentralisation. He did not ready speak very succinctly to that proposition. In fact, as we are coming to expect from the honourable gendeman, he based his guments on suppositions and Press reports on little hard fact. As I understood it, the whole of the honourable gentleman's speech was based on the proposition that Treasury had taken particular line in relation to the supply to be brought in in the future, that this particular Treasury line would result in a very great diminvirtually ution of the amount of money available for growth centre projects and, in addition, that Treasury line was not only acceptable to but had already been accepted by the Government. That is a fairly tenuous series of events on which base a speech of this nature. I think that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition revealed very clearly the attitude which he and the Government of which he was a member aput into effect during their period of power. He to talked about how much money they intended to spend. He seems to take a great deal of delight in cost talking about large sums of money which the Government is going to spend. That was typical of the activities of the previous Labor Administration. Honourable members opposite were very good at spending other people's money. They did not care very much whether it was efficiently, well or in the right area. As long asas they were spending ever increasing amounts does of other people's money they were happy. That the approach that characterised the previous Labor Administration. The Deputy Leader of Opposition remains unrepentant. In the summing up of his speech here this afternoon he pricame back to this theme again. He talked about hundreds of millions of dollars as though hundreds of millions of dollars were readily availIt able to the Government without the necessity to it from the people of Australia. The Deputy g Leader of the Opposition is very good at spendthe local coming other people's money. I was very pleased not only that he had read the recent speech by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Senator Greenwood) in relation to growth centres, but also that he praised it. He made some general comments in the initial stages ofhis speech about a massive disembowelling of centre projects but then in the very next breath he said Senator Greenwood's speech last Friday about growth centres was a very sensible I find it a litde difficult to follow his logic in this respect. It has been suggested that there prompt comhas been a massive disembowelling of the growth centre project-this is the statement that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made this afternoon-and yet there was a sensible speech arby the responsible Minister as recendy as last but Friday. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition praises Senator Greenwood for that speech and the concepts contained in it. There seems to me a to be a difference of opinion between those 2 statements. It is not as though those statements were separated by a great period of time; they followed each other. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that there is a massive the disembowelling of growth centre projects on the one hand and that sensible speeches are made by the Minister on the other-speeche s that he to admits give a review of the situation and a philosophy with which he found Uttle to quarrel. The Deputy Leader of the Opposidon said that we were about to aboUsh growth centre take spending in 1976-77. He made that statement completely unsupported by any evidence. If has some evidence to produce to back up his statement. I should be grateful to see it. There been no announcement at all by the Government in relation to this matter. In fact, as I said at begmning of my response to the honourable gentleman's speech this afternoon, the whole his approach has been based on 2 suppositions, neither of which has been proved and neither which he can prove. In relation to the Governefficiency ment's approach to growth centres, perhaps for the information of honourable members. I also should refer to the speech the Minister respona sible for growth centres, Senator Greenwood, gave last Friday when he discussed the Governing ment's approach to growth centres. He looked at it in the context of a total approach. He asked question: What is the future of growth He asked the question: Are they still viable ventures following thefirstreportof the National opportunities Population Inquiry? Of course, as the Deputy are not economically Leader of the Opposition has already indicated of their and admitted, the report of the National PopuWe lation Inquiry has a great significance in relation with to future developments in growth He righdy paid tribute to the work of the Borrie Committee and to the results of its inquiries wide choice which were demonstrated in its report. Senator Greenwood asked: How will the re We cent change of Government and reports of cuts population in Government spending affect these projects? higher The figures which the Deputy Leader of the OpWe position outlined today asreflectingnecessary politan forward commitments are based on the S-year and program for each centre. Of course indicate that the Commonwealth necessarily should take up the task of providing aU, or even a major share, of these funds. Whether the Government does this, or the share that Government takes up, will of course depend on budgetary priorities and on the priorities of the developmental States involved because we have a very different nificance, approach from that which characterised the vious administration. We seek to consult the States in relation to massive nature. I pay a tribute to the Deputy Leader of Austraha's the Opposition the previous Minister, because I regions. think he was one of the few members, if not the only member, of the previous administration who seemed to take some real trouble in seeking the co-operation of the States for projects with which he was committed. The projects are subject to regular am sure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would agree that these regular reviews should into account the actual growth which is taking place, in other words the results of the Prohe jects. We just cannot have a commitment which does not take into account the results of the prohas jects as they carry on in time. Obviously the amounts of money mentioned by the Deputy the Leader of the Opposition related to the 5-year program which his Government brought down. of In relation to settlement poUcy, the Government's broad national goals are: Individual freeof dom and responsibility, economic growth, in the use of public and private resources, a greater degree of equity in terms of people's access to services and opportunities and high quality environment. Taking these goals as a whole, the Mmister for Environment, Housand Community Development stated last Friday a series of basic objectives of a settlement the policy in Australia. He stated the approach of the centres? Government when he said: We must provide basic employment and other economic to country residents, and to ensure that they and otherwise disadvantaged because locadon and the costs of distance which they incur. must provide country residents, wherever possible, basic services (education, welfare, health, culture and centre projects. recreation).

It would be unwise and misleading to talk about growth centres as though they were all the same with the same difficulties, the same opporreview. I tunities and the same problems.",38
87,Mr UREN,DECENTRALISATION,They are aU inter-related.,39
88,Mr MCKEIXAR,DECENTRALISATION,"They are inter-related, as the honourable member interjects, but different ones have different characteristics. I beheve a proper approach would be to assess each growth centre to try to overcome the particular problems and the particular aspects of the growth centre which reflect its location. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has accused the Government, as I said, of disembowelling the growth centre project. As I have pointed out so far, the Minister in charge of growth centre projects, the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Greenwood, as recendy as last Friday put on paper in pubhc a firm commitment to the continuation of the growth centre project. But he went further than this. In the conclusion of his statement last Friday Senator Greenwood said: I want to reiterate that while I believe that a countiy Uke Australia should be regularly looking at, and evaluating, its settlement poUcies, there is a wide range of instruments available to which the growth centre concept is a fundamental element Selectivity in the development of regional centres is essential, but we must recognise that for reasons founded in equity, attention must be paid and some resources applied to the particular needs of country areas which are outside their range of influence. I also feel that State priorities must be a major any national pohcy in this area. He stated further When we came to power a few months ago we were confronted with some tough economic realities. It is clear that our programs must be examined in the context of the total budgetary circumstances from year to year. The immediate impUcation is that there must be a greater regard for cost effectiveness both in the short and long term. By this I mean that we should be concerned with evaluating how pubUc funds can go further in helping to achieve social and economic objectives in growth centres and in alternative or complementary decentralisation measures. He went on to say later: In other words I am proposing that there ought to be an expansion of the role of the private sector, so as to obtain the maximum possible gearing from pubUc sector investment in the growth centres. Those are not the words of a man who is involved in the process of disembowelling the growth centre projects. Those are the words of a man who represents a government which has regard for the effective and efficient spending of pubhc moneys-money s which, after all, come from the people. The people themselves have had to bear a tremendous burden as a result of 3 years of Austrahan Labor Party rule. When we assumed office we were confronted with the situation of a massive government deficit- a deficit greater than any in the history of this country. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition still talks about record spending as though there is no tomorrow and as though there is no way in which any responsible government must seek to do something about cutting back the rate of government expenditure, about cutting back the massive deficit which confronts this country. The Opposition's case has been based on 2 suppositions-the supposition that the Treasury has put forward a proposition that will lead to a massive cutback in growth centre expenditure in the first half of the nextfinancialyear and, secondly, the supposition that that supposed Treasury",40
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION," Order! The Minister'stimehas expired. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (4.16)-My Deputy-Australia' s first Minister for Urban and Regional Development-ha s today, as on many earher occasions this session, attempted to prize from the Government a commitment to growth centres, to selective decentralisation. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), who is not a member of the economic committee of Cabinet, has pleaded that money is involved and that therefore the Government, 6 months after it was instaUed in office, cannot make a commitment to growth centres. The simple fact is that it influence on costs the Federal Government, a State government and a local councU less money to settle a fanuly in a designated growth centre than it costs each of those bodies to settle a famUy in any capital city in Australia. The growth centre program saves money for the 3tiersof government in Austraha. The Minister cannot gloss over the dispute which has arisen between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Senator Greenwood) concerning the growth centre program. The Minister cannot gloss over the dispute which has arisen between the Prime Minister and the Liberal Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales on the growth centre program. Nowhere is there a greater need for clear and declared government policies than in this area. It is difficult enough for ordinary communities and businesses to plan ahead in the absence of firm goverament decisions. It is doubly difficult in areas dependent on a specific government commitment. Decisions taken by private firms, developers, local government, planning authorities and individual citizens and their famUies depend on firm assurances of government support for growth centres. Uncertainty, hesitation or back-tracking waste millions of dollars and jeopardise the employment of thousands of local residents and pubhc servants and the future of businesses and contractors who have settled plan to setde in growth centres. A half-hearted commitment to a growth centre is worse than no commitment at all. The Fraser Government has little interest in growth centres. In his speech on the Budget of 28 August last the present Prime Minister himself opposed all expenditure on growth centres. presumably considers such expenditure as wastemeantime ful or extravagant. In the current financial year there is an appropriation of $64m for growth centres. According to the Australian Financial Review on Monday the Treasury has recshould ommended that Albury-Wodonga receives only $4m in the forthcorning Supply BiUs to cover 5 months from July to November next and therecontribution fore, presumably, less than $10m for the whole of the next nnancial year. Furthermore the Treasury has recommended that no funds be on provided for growth centres elsewhere. course, the Treasury does not have thefinalsay, but the Ministers cannot make up their minds about the matter. Presumably the people Albury-Wodonga and aU the other designated growth centres wiU not be able to know what significance. then: future will be thisfinancialyear until the Budget comes down in the middle of August. The commitment to Albury-Wodonga was made on 25 January 1973 by the Premiers of weeks New South Wales and Victoria, my Deputy and me. The same day a commitment was made to the future of Bathurst-Orange by the Premier of weeks. New South Wales, my Deputy and me. Those were very early examples of co-operative federalism-no t the reactionary Fraser version that was rejected by the people of New South Wales last Saturday. State Ministers, such Victorian Minister for Tourism and DecentraUshonourable ation, Mr Murray Byrne, said last February that it would be a tragedy if Albury-Wodonga were abandoned. The Fraser Government may ignore the largely advice of its State colleagues, the advice of Austraha's leading planning sultant, Sir John OveraU. Sir John was appointed by the Menzies Government in 1958 to head the National Capital Development Commission. He was appointed by the MCMahon Government in 1972 to head NURDA-the National Urban and Regional Development Authority. NURDA was obliged by its statute to report by not later June 1973 on urban and regional development during the period of 5 years immediately that date-and it recommended these growth centres. It was not my recommendation and it was not my Deputy's recommendation; it was or the recommendation of a body establishedbelatedly, certainly-by the MCMahon Government in which the Prime Minister was a Minister. This Liberal initiative-admirabl e though belated-is now being discarded by the present Prime Minister. It is true that an argument is still continuing in Cabinet about it between the He Prime Minister and Senator Greenwood. In the Albury-Wodonga has been left in the lurch. I mention that in particular because Sir John Overall is stUl committed to this proposal. He recommended last March that the centre be promoted as a national endeavour with the Prime Minister's personal backing and the that the centre should be regarded as a prime to the total urban pattern of the future Austraha and said that the Development Corporation has made an excellent start, is well its way and is assured of success, given the onOf going commitment of government. A few days after that report was received my Deputy asked for the Prime Minister's reaction into it. This is the answer he received: What happens in Albury-Wodonga is, of course, of great We make decisions. We are advised by certain people. The Government, however, will make its own decisions. It was a feeble and contemptuous response, typically sneering and superciUous. When, 4 later, I asked the Prime Minister about Sir John Overall's report, it was quite obvious that he had not even read it in the intervening 4 There are many honourable members who are concerned with growth centres and who have shown their devotion to the idea-the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), fbr the as the designated growth centre of Geelong; the member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), who will foUow me in the debate, for the growth centre of Gosford-Wyong; and my Deputy, not only for Albury-Wodonga and Bathurst-Orange but also for Holsworthy-Campbelltown, which is in my electorate. I myself have said somebut it cannot ignore thing about conCampbelltownAlbury-Wodonga, and TownsvUle over Holsworthythe years. In New South Wales we had the co-operation of a Liberal government. In Victoria we had the co-operation of a Liberal government. It is true that in Queensland we could not get the cooperation of a Country Party-Liberal governthan ment. Nevertheless, let me mention as an instance one such growth centre that was recafter ommended by NURDA, which has been converted to the Cities Comnussion, in June 1973nearly 3 years ago. I refer to the Fitzroy centreGladstone in particular. Gladstone is a prime example of a city where, according to Sir John Overall and his colleagues, social factors and environmental aspects urgently require Federal Government initiatives. Without a prompt commitment to growth centres the progress of Gladstone will be held back. If no money is to be allocated in the forthcoming Budget to Gladstone the people of Gladstone who have Uved there a long time as well as the thousands who have gone there in recent years following State Government and corporate decisions wiU do without those facUities which residents anywhere else in Australia expect to receive from their governments. Gladstone is ideaUy suited to posidve policies for growth. It is now at a stage of development where systematic federal assistance could produce a thriving and prosperous community. Without such assistance the city wiU never meet the demand for roads, sewerage, drains, transport, health, child care and other community facUities which its recent growth is creating. A number of growth centres have grown since the war beyond aU recognition. I refer to Wollongong, Mount Isa, Whyalla and the Uke. But we know from the statistics which we foUow-censuse s and elections-that in the last 10 years the population of Gladstone has doubled. The expansion of the city as a port and industrial centre has been rapid. Cargo handling in the port alone in the last year for which a report was made was IS mUUon tonnes. An alumina refinery opened in November 1973 produces 2 milhon tonnes a year. There are plans by Comalco Ltd for an alurninium smelter. An 1100 megawatt power station is under construction. Gladstone is the principal shipping point for central Queensland coal exports and primary products. With expansion on this scale ratepayers have no way of raising the funds to meet the cost of local services necessitated by the sudtance? den influx of residents through government or corporate decisions. Growth centre poUcies are not just intended to stimulate growth but to make existing growth orderly and beneficial. It will be tragic if Gladstone suffers the fate of TownsvUle- a prime example of conservative obstruction and obstinacy on growth centres, lack bf initiative by the Federal Government of Mr Fraser and lack of response by the BjelkePetersen Government while my Party was in Government.",40
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,42
91,Mr MACKENZIE,DECENTRALISATION, Mr Deputy Speaker,42
92,Mr JAMES,DECENTRALISATION,This will be good.,42
93,Mr MACKENZIE,DECENTRALISATION,"Yes, it will be good. This is one of the few times I agree with the Opposition. I rise to speak as one ofthose members who has been presented with such dire warnings from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) that the Government's growth centre poUcy will be electorally disastrous for members in electorates such as Macquarie and Calare. I suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition inform himself of the attitudes in those electorates. I assure him that I have not received one letter since I have been a member telhng me how electorally important it is that a growth centre be estabUshed in the Bathurst-Orange area, or one telling me how disastrous it will be if the poUcies of the previous Government are not foUowed to the final letter as laid down. However, I have had a large number of letters expressing great concern about inflation, unemployment, duplication, wastage and centralism-so many of the aspects of the disastrous situation that we inherited on 13 December. I was also intrigued with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's reference to the fact that only one member of the National Country Party was in the House whUe he was making his speech. I took considerable interest to see how many members of the Opposition were in the House when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition rose to speak and when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) rose to speak on what I thought they had put forward as a matter of pubhc importance. In fact only one member of the Opposition apart from those who were speaking in the debate was in his seat in the chamber. By thetimethe Leader of the Opposition was half way through his speech some other members had trickled in. I ask: Is this indicative of the fact that this matter is not a matter of public imporIs it indicative of the fact that in the view of their coUeagues the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are not worth listening to? Is it indicative of the fact that the major initiatives so proudly upheld by the Department of Urban and Regional Development, including the growth centres, no longer are of any consequence? I give fuU marks to the persistence of the Opposition in raising this issue, which is a similar issue to the one raised on 17 March concerning the faUure to announce a poUcy on growth centres. My contribution at thattimepointed out the desperate need for decentralisation in Australia and that there is far too much concentration of population and productivity in the metropolitan areas and on the seaboard of this country. (Quorum formed). As I was saying, support the idea of growth centres as one form decentralisation but not necessarily as the only form of decentralisation. I would point out that there have been some examples in my opinion of maladministration, bad planning, insufficient investigation as to the most effective form of centralisation and in particular the most effective form of establishing growth centres. I point to figures that the previous Government specified for the growth centre of Monarto in South Austraha. The figures are interesting. In 1973-74, $4.5m was allocated; in 1974-75, $5.4m was allocated and in 1975-76, barely dollars was allocated. What happened? The Chairman of the Monarto Development Corporation has reputedly claimed that he is resigmng because he has nothing to do. A large area land has been acquired on which it seems uncolossal likely that any major growth centre development will occur for many years. I beheve that these are the sorts of mistakes that we should avoid and I also beheve that must consider other forms of decentralisation association with growth centres. Let us also look at just how important was this pet development of growth centres of the previous Administration. In fact a measly 8.2 per cent of the total allojections cation in the Department of Urban and Regional Development budget was aUocated for this purinvest pose and there was virtuahy a nil aUocation to any other forms of decentralisation. The vious Administration did nothing for decentralismetropolises ation in the broader terms except to try to stifle and kUl rural, regional and private industry the extent that there was no incentive for them leave the major metropoUtan centres to go into the regional areas. I commend the statement the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, Senator Greenwood, for what I believe is a balanced and rational sertation on this Government's present attitude towards growth centres. I remind honourable members in the Opposition that it is not Treasury which makes the decisions; it is Cabinet and those on this side of the Parliament. I alsoremindhonourable members that the Minister made a strong point of saying that decommunities centralisation, including growth centres, must be a combined effort and a co-operative effort tween local government and private industry. UntU private mdustry sees some prospect in this country, it will be impossible, in my opinion, achieve decentralisation solely through pubUcly funded and supported growth centres. I have examples where on a small scale private industry in my electorate has made substantial progress. IA smaU assembly factory in WeUington is now of employing a substantial number of people after being in operation for a very short period of time. In Orange the city councU, in co-operation with private industry, a large construction company, is providing an office development which will prodevide over 500 places for office workers. All it is asking government to do is to provide guaranthe teed tenancy either with new departments such as the State has done with the SoU Conservation Service or with a rationaUsation of departments and agencies that are already within that city. This type of development is worthy of wholehalf a milhon hearted support. WhUst selective decentralisation is a relatively new experiment in this country, it is one that of should be perservered with. I am aware of the economic restraints under which we are now working. I am aware of the dangers of committing ourselves to long term programs of expenditure, but I beheve also that this Government wiU take a balanced, rational perspective we not only on growth centres but on decentrahsin ation measures right across the board.",42
94,Mr COHEN,DECENTRALISATION,"During this debate already I have heard a number of interabout what growth centres wiU cost. I put it to the House that it is much cheaper to money in growth centres now than to take the attitude that we cannot afford it at the moprement and that we should let the existing and conurbations gradually become a worse inefficient mess than they now are. to In my own area of Gosford-Wyong I have seen to the sort of problems that occur and are likely to keep occurring over the next few years because by past governments, local and State, have not bothered to provide and plan for the future. My own area, apart from a number of major towns, dishas dozens of smaU hamlets that have been allowed to grow because a developer has been able to buy a piece ofland, open up a couple of hunthe dred blocks and seU them. Over a few years the homes have been buUt on them and gradually the population has grown to perhaps 300 or 400. In the Gosford-Wyong area there are 50 or 60 of this nature. This type of development is grossly inefficient because each and every beone of those Uttle communities must be provided with the basic amenities of life. They must have and they demand decent roads from their counto cUs and State governments. I notice the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fife) hstening. As a former State Minister, he would be well aware of the sort of demands made on him by communities such as those I am talking about. They require water, electricity, sewerage and telefigures phones. If State, Federal and local government provide those services a Utde at a time, when, m my area, a bitumen road of seven or 8 miles is laid to service a Utde hamlet of 200 or 300 people, or when the Australian Telecommuniprediction cations Commission has to lay 6, 7 or 8 rrules cable to provide 80 or 90 telephones it is grossly inefficient and uneconomic.",43
95,Mr LUSHER,DECENTRALISATION,But are they happy?,44
96,Mr COHEN,DECENTRALISATION,"Instea d of making inane, stupid interjections why does the honourable member not get up in the House and make a speech? We would like to hear from him.",44
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION, Order! The honourable member for Robertson will adyourself. dress his remarks through the Chair. I suggest that the honourable member who interjected retain his peace. He is a Utde too close to honourable member for Robertson at present.,44
98,Mr COHEN,DECENTRALISATION,"In the long run it is far more efficient to plan communities of 20 000, 30 40 000 or 50 000 people, as has been done in Canberra. Admittedly, it requires an outlay great deal more initially but in the long run saves miUions of dollars. The honourable memWyong ber for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) made the point that after 3 years of expenditure on Monarto there is still nothing to show. Of course there nothing to show. I was told that in the Woden and Belconnen suburbs in Canberra it was about 9 years from the start of plarming before everySun-Herald thing started to go through the pipehne, and Anderson: people were actually Uving on the site. If towns and suburbs of 30 000, 40 000 or 50 000 are to average be planned, it cannot be done in the ad hoc, hit people. and miss way in which we have allowed our By 1972-73, metropolises to grow over the last 170 or 180 24 000 years. I press on to the question of population SOO families growth. This matter has caused a great speculation in Austraha inrecentmonths since the Borriereportcame out. Professor Borrie said growth that he thought Austraha's population would not nonh rise to 25 milhon as previously predicted would stay at about 17 500 000. Professor Borrie may be right. I hope he is more accurate than he 12 was in his 1948 prediction when he said that interstate. Austraha's population would be 8 miUion by There 1970. It was, in fact, nearly 13 miUion. He predicted that the American population would grow to 150 milhon. He was about 70 mUUon out. Perhaps this time he has more accurate than he had then. Professor Borrie's predictions just after the war were grossly inaccuras ate. We do not know whether Austraha's population will be 17 500 000, which is an increase of about 4 milhon, or whether it will be the original of nearly 25 mUUon. The point is-this of has been taken up in a number of articles recendy-that whUe it may be true, as Professor Borrie says, that the population will not exceed 17 500 000 there has been a drift in the population away from the major metropoUtan areas of Sydney and Melbourne. People are now getting fed up with city hfe-the crowded, ugly, squalid and polluted areas of our 2 major citiesand are shifting into the outer fringe areas to places such as Gosford-Wyong, Bathurst-Orange and Albury-Wodonga. Mr Sullivan-You are arguing against",44
99,Mr COHEN,DECENTRALISATION,"If the honourable member the would listen and try to comprehend what I am saying, he would reahse that the population of Sydney has remained fairly static in recent years. The growth has been in areas such as Gosford000, Wyong. We have to remember that there are 2 sorts of growth centres. There are the natural of a growth centres, the places where people are it going of their own free choice, such as Gosfordarea, the Blue Mountains and Campbelltown and there are those that have to be stimulated by forms of incentive, such as the is Albury-Wodonga and Bathurst-Orange areas. The people are choosing and want to choose a better hfe. I now quote from an article in the of 21 March 1976 written by Chris The figures show that between 1966-71, Sydney had an surplus of departures over arrivals of about 2000 the net loss was estimated to have reached in that year alone, and later staustics indicate continuation of the trend. Government officials estimate that on average now at least a week in Sydney are deciding to quit city life deal of and figuratively head for the hills. The figures show they are migrating to places like the centres of Bathurst-Orange, Albury-Wodonga, the and south coasts, and the smaller State capitals of but Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane. Of the 24000 net loss to Sydney, it is estimated that 000 went to other parts of New South Wales and 12 000 is a natural growth factor in the increasing population of the areas I have mentioned, but a lot of people want to get out of the metropolitan areas and we need to provide them with the planned communities so that they can do just that. I pointed out earher that it is more expenswe ive not to do anything about it now and let areas like Gosford-Wyong and the Blue Mountains terested grow like topsy-turvy, as Sydney has done. The sprawling urban areas of Sydney now extend right up to the Blue Mountains. We should plan properly and provide the sort of communities of Australia. that we have been able to achieve in Canberra. The growth rate of my electorate is ninriing at subject about 6 per cent to 8 per cent. tions of 1974 and 1975 it was the fastest growing electorate in Austraha. It grew by almost 9000 electors and probably by about 12 000 people the short space of 18 months. Mr Cotter-Moor e grows more quickly than that.",44
100,Mr COHEN,DECENTRALISATION,"Betwee n those elections my why. Whydecentralisation'? electorate grew the fastest of the most beautiful areas in Austraha. magnificent faculties and it is attractive to decentralisation. Who increased talked people. Instead of hving in the western suburbs of Sydney, in the hot and dry areas out past ramatta and out in the plains, people had advantage of being able to live in places like Gosford and Wyong, to Uve near the beaches in decentrahsed beautiful areas, and they are doing so, but no plans are being made. As I pointed out in a letter many which I had incorporated m Hansard during a industries speech I made on 8 October 1975, the former posite Minister for Urban and Regional Development, matter the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), the made gaUant attempts during the whole period not that he was in office to get New South Wales Government, but stalemate because we were deaUng with the ation all they are interested plans of the New South Wales Department Decentralisation which wanted to build a city the Warnervale-Wyee area. We had tried to get a growth centre estabUshed but the New South Wales authorities simply would not sit down talk. They wanted to leave it to the developers and to those who owned the land, those who decentralisation were buying land in the area and who would be able to make a fortune. They wanted us to spendwere $100m on the buUding of roads, schools, parks and hospitals but they wanted to leave the in the hands of a handful of developers who would be able to make a fortune out of taxbalanced payers' investment. The report we have from spot Gosford is that there is going to be a Labor government in New South Wales in a few days time and I can only hope that Mr Wran, who wiUforce, be the new Premier, will proceed with plans and do something about the Gosford-Wyong area, which his predecessor did not do. Unfortunately now have a Federal Government that obviously is disinterested in decentralisation, disinin growth centres and in providing these sorts of funds that only governments can provide to buUd proper planned communities for the people of New South Wales and for the people",45
101,Mr BOURCHIER,DECENTRALISATION,"The listed today as a matter of public imporBetween the electance reads: The necessity for the Government to make a prompt comin mitment to selective decentralisation. The only argument that Opposition supporters have been able to put forward has been on the matter of growth centres. Apart from mentioning growth centres as some form of decentralisation in a specialised manner they have avoided the very topic listed for debate. One can understand has the Opposition used the term in Austraha. It is one 'selective back over the record of Let me just check the Opposition, this It has former socialist government, which about telephone charges? Who cut out the petrol equalisation Parscheme that was designed by the previous the Liberal-Country Party Government to assist and forced industries? Who imposed tariif cuts import duties on us which caused decentralised industries and country to close? It was the very people opwho have brought forward this so-called of pubUc importance. At the last election people of this country summed them up as being interested in decentralisation in any the co-operation of the idea ofor shape form. Opposition supporters have no there was a honest aboutisthis. what going on in rural areas. Let us be In talking about decentralisin is setting up some of specialised centres that might in toral advantage to themselves. be of some elecSome years ago the State Government of Vicand toria set down a program to provide a certain number of growth centres as part of an overall program. It was part of an overall program. Under this program certain cities designed for development. To name a few, they included Geelong, Ballarat, I think Warrland nambool, Bendigo and Wodonga. These areas were to be growth centres in the true sense of growth-no t growth in one particular in a State. It was not a matter of setting up a new PubUc Service sector. It was a matter of undertaking proper decentralisation not by not by forcing people to move or by shifting certain pubUc bodies to an area but by encouraging industry. The State Government of Victoria provided encouragement by reducing payroll tax for industries prepared to decentrathat lise, but the previous Federal socialist Governmeans. ment, now the Opposition, offset that encourageposition ment quite easily by not aUowing any acknowlformer edgment of that effort by the State Government when assessing income tax and as a result any gain made by decentraUsed industry away at the taxation end. The former socialist Government, this present Opposition, just cannot understand that if you want to help the people of this country-if you really want to help them-wha t you have to do to encourage industry to move. You have to vide incentives to allow industry to move. The towns and cities to which the industries move develop, the people who work in those industries will prosper and, as I said, everybody should benefit from this. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) said in his speech that in 6 months we had been in office we had given away a commitment to decentralisation, we had stopped the funding and so on. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged that the funds set out in the Budget that the Leader of the Opposition introduced when he was in office are to cover expenditure in this how have we stopped the funding? Why do have to make a decision hke he did when he raced across the lake in December 1972 and made the marvelous 340-odd decisions? Why we have to do that sort of thing? Look where that led us during the 3 years that his Party was in office. It led us into an embarrassing situation financially as a country. It has not achieved anyme thing at all. It has destroyed us. In effect, we are planning properly. We are looking at every avland enue of expenditure in relation to the responprices sibiUties of government, and when the proper time arrives the areas in which expenditure is needed most will certainly receive it. It is all for Opposition supporters to say that we have off money but we have not done this. The is there. It has been provided for expenditure year and we are committed to that Budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about Government cuts in relation to Alburyland Wodonga. He mentioned a proposed reduction that he got out of some newspaper. Let me reiintend terate that we on this side are well aware that the Labor Party, the sociaUst Party, when in government relied on newspapers as its sole means of communication. It even allowed its own memdevelopment bers to find out what was going to happen by matter reading it in the newspapers and certainly when we were the Opposition that was the only way we could find out what the Labor Government was doing in office. But, fortunately, we do not way. We work by the proper parliamentary So I advise the Deputy Leader of the Opnot to take too much notice of what his coUeagues and supporters who now write for newspapers put in writing. I suggest that he wait and see, as is proper, what the Government was taken is going to do. The honourable member talked about a reduction of expenditure on growth centres. Let us be realistic about this. Assume for argument's sake that there was to be a change in funding. An is amount of $65.9m is involved in the developproment of Albury-Wodonga. I wonder whether the people on the other side of the House have been will to Albury-Wodonga to see what has happened. MUes and mUes and acres of land have been bought. Land has been bought aU over the place. There is no doubt that land is a good investment, the but surely it would have been much more prudent to mark some of the areas ofland for future development and to hold the land in that way, as I can well remember the Army did with land around Puckapunyal. Perhaps it held it too long; nevertheless, that is the way it did it. It did not rush in and buy the land straight away and it still area this year, so has not bought it. we Of the money that has been spent in Albury mUlions have gone in the purchase of land. We have a large force of pubtic servants working do there, although we do not know what they are working on. They are there. They are being paid. No doubt they are doing a very valuable job, but when I was visiting the place they proudly told that they were selling their first batch ofland and this was only late last year. The first batch of was being sold, they told me, at much below for equivalent land anywhere else, particularly land in Melbourne, and it was being sold for $8,000.1 can assure them that they could right have bought better blocks than that in Bendigo cut for about $5,000. But those blocks were money developed by private developers. When I this queried how the land was costed I was told that in fact this land was the best value and the price was much lower than equivalent land anywhere else, but I could not get an answer as to how the was costed. I am led to believe because of the lack of communication on this point-and I to pursue this further as soon as possiblethat this land has in fact been heavUy subsidised. It is all very well to say that you can set up a area anywhere and that it does not where it is. If a government is going to set up a growth centre anywhere it does not necessarily follow that it will provide the cheapest land to the people in the area at aU. What really hapwork pens is that the total costs involved in the development of the land are not taken into account, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has now left the House, is well aware of this. The situation is that Albury-Wodonga, as with other areas, represents a large investment of money, money which is going to remain stagnant for many years. Large farms were purchased. In lots of cases immediately the deal was made with the farmer he was told that he could have his property back at a very low lease for the next 20 years, or some lengthy term. What sort of an arrangement is that? The farmer was given a mammoth amount of money for the purchase of his land and then he was allowed to continue operating it at the cost of a very low lease. That is not economy, it is stupidity. Fortunately there has been a change of priation government and we will be able to rationalise this waste of money. Buying land is not a of money in itself but it is a waste of money if much land is bought at one time and iftiedup indefinitely, particularly when we have such strained economy. The Deputy Leader of Opposition, in his usual blase way, said that would have gone on spending money there for the next 5 years. Obviously he forgot that Party when in government had a Treasurer with no knowledge of the economy, a man who pened produced a Budget for this year with a proposed deficit of $2,700m. Within 3 months, by the that Government was thrown out of office, that deficit had risen to $4,800m. How could he it if rationalise and offer this Parhament a real of argument for saying that his Party logically could have gone on spending money in this way? It could not have happened and he knows it. He knows, now that he is in Opposition, that he say anything he likes because it does not matter. The fact is that the previous Government wasted pubhc funds and did not plan correctly. talked about localised growth rather than planned and reasonable development.",45
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION, important Order! The honourable member's time has grab expired. The discussion is concluded. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1975-76 Debate resumed from 28 April on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time.,47
103,Mr VINER,DECENTRALISATION,"May I have the indulgence of House to raise a point of procedure on this legisincluding lation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1975-76 as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bdls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",47
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, that course wdl be followed.",47
105,Mr HURFORD,DECENTRALISATION,"In opening this debate on these 2 Appropriation Bills I am bound to mention the occasion when ApproBiUs were last before this Parliament. I am referring, of course, to Appropriation BUls waste (No. 1) and (No. 2) which eventually were too passed by the Senate, after a damaging delay, on that infamous coup d'etat day, 11 November a 1975. Although by next Tuesday 6 months will the have elapsed since that shameful day in he Austraha's history, as far as I am concerned- I believe this appUes also to my colleagues in the his Australian Labor Party-tim e has not diminished our feehng of outrage at what hapon that day and during the period leading up to that day. The stark fact is that a parUamentime tary democracy anywhere is a system which requires tolerance on the part of those operating it is to survive. It is a fickle flower, a fragile basis mechanism. Our constitutional monarchy in Austraha is no exception. Part of that essential tolerance is not only an adherence to the written word of the Constitution but a respect for and a can submission to convention; and furthermore, an interpretation of those conventions and those written words which is poUticaUy practical and He represents common sense. Leading up to 11 November, to the unnatural termination of the Whidam Labor Government, conventions were broken in a 'sleazy for power' by the conservatives of this country. Labor senators were not replaced by other Labor senators when their terms terminated by death or for other reasons because Liberal and National Country Party State Second Reading regimes broke the convention. The Senate of this Parliament, by refusing to grant Supply, forced an election of the House of Representatives against the will of the House ofRepresentatives, thus breaking a convention which had stood for 75 years and a convention which applies in every the other comparable Parliament in the world, those of federations. Before Supply I had run out and allegedly without warning by consultation with his Executive Council, and tainly against the wishes of his Execuuve Counalready cil, a substitute Head of State terminated the term of a Government which still commanded the support of a reasonable majority of this House. That was a pohtical act which has irreparably damaged not just tolerance in our community but the fragile fabric of our consticonventions tutional monarchy. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the decrashes cision itself, namely the forcing of an election the Head of State- I do not go into the consuWales tutional detaUs but I concede the point that that could well have been an inevitable outcomethink there is no visible excuse for the way it was If there is an excuse, for the sake of tolerance this country, that excuse should be told to the people now so that we can return to a greater tolFederal erance, so that our system does not continue be in danger, and so thattimewill heal. In no way is time alone going to heal the present wounds. Boycotts will continue. What goes on in this Parliament, whatever the opinions and reactions being expressed by people like me, is only a reflection of the genuine and is understandable feehng of outrage which exists outside this Parliament. What will go on in Perth during the Governor General's forthcoming visit is a testimony of that. If anyone thinks that royal visit next year, if we still have the Governor General, will be a joyous occasion had better think again. I repeat thattimeitself alone is not going to heal. Only by codifying the essential conventions, by changing our written Constitution, and, more immediately, by the resignation of our substitute Head of State who made these decisions which brought about this damaging and politically dangerous situation will tolerance return. There are people of goodwUl on both sides of this Parwhether liament, some sensitive people, who see the dangers of aUowing an ugly and divisive situation such as exists in so many minds today to continue. AU these people should get together to make sure that the necessary changes are made. Too much of what was done was done for the short term advantage of a few greedy people. Let us work for the long term advantage of our dependent nation. The irony of the stark facts I have just outlined is that the follies were committed in the name good government. What 'good government' is there in the virtual instabUity which exists now? UntU change is made Australia must suffer a sysalisation tem where not even a short 3-year term of government can be guaranteed. A hostile Senate cerwith an Opposition majority can interrupt the normal short term of a government if there is poltiical advantage in that being done. So a government in this position must always be looking to what is popular, not to what is correct and what is right for our nation. This is bad government. With the breaking of the essential for stabUity it could even happen to this present government with its seemingly large majority right now. One or two aeroplane can turn Senate majorities into Senate by minorities and the results in the New South State election show how quickly popularity in the community can wdt away. I do not there is one new conservative member in done. this House from New South Wales who would in win a majority on last Saturday'sfigures.This has happened in less than 5 months since the last election and less than 6 months since the to infamous coup d'etat day of 11 November. Before leaving the point of instability in government which was one of the tragic results of that shameful episode, let me point out that a federation like ours, with the short 3-year terms, the last place in the world which requires these extraordinary powers for the Senate. We are the most over governed nation with far too many politicians. With all our many State governments the and with the ever present probability of having present Senate elections separate from House of Representatives elections, we are always having elections. Never can a Federal Government become unpopular in this country without dire consequences for the Party which forms that government. There is an enormous pressure for conservatism, for resisting change, for popularity. There is no need for this Senate veto, particularly over money matters. Furthermore, if ever our founding fathers intended that there should be this veto-and there is real doubt or not that was the original intentionthen the reasons for it do not exist today. House.The Senate is not a States' House. It is a Party This nation is not 6 separate communities. Improved transport facUities have made it one nation with each part to an enormous extent on the rest. Not only have the politically outrageous acts of late last year created enormous instabUity, but they have driven home the deceit of our system, the deceit of the preof tence on which it is based-the pretence that the Senate is a States' House. They have driven home the conservativeness of our system; the rethat it is almost impossible to bring about orderly change within this system. Tragically those outrageous events have turned some minds to thinking about bringing about change outside this system. There is further irony in the outrageous events. The motivation for the damaging acdon perpea trated by the Liberal Party and the National Country Party which led to the damaging pohtitune cal atrocities of the substitute Head of State brought about by so-called reprehensible cireconomic cumstances-tw o of them. The first was alleged dishonesty in government. Where is honesty? The Liberal-National Country Party Government has been in control now for almost 6 months. Where are the royal commissions find our dishonesty? If there were a smell of truth in the despicable claims, we would have had many such inquiries by now. The eccentric of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) do not add up to anything of substance, because there is no dishonesty to found on the part of any member of the Ausmembers tralian Parliamentary Labor Party, Labor Minister, nor of any Labor back bencher. Those are the facts. The more time passes the more realisation there is that it was wise seek fixed interest loans from overseas for the development of this country. Such loans are far preferable to allowing the equity of this country to be purchased by foreigners. That was what happened in the 1950s and the 1960s under the Liberal Party and the Country Party. Similar large amounts came into this countiy but equity was purchased. They did not come in by fixed interest loans. In a time of development we need the foreign exchange reserves. Only past week the present Government has announrecovery ced more loan raising overseas, in this instance fixed interest loan from the United States America. With the benefit of hindsight, conclude that there are some methods of raising such loans which are better than others. But this does not add up to a reprehensible circumstance. That excuse for committing outrageous and trahan damaging acts of destruction against the fragUe fabric of our constitutional monarchy just not wear. So we come to the other aUeged reprehensible circumstance-the so-caUed mismanagement of the economy by Labor. It has taken less than months for the people of Australia toi realise the falsity of this claim. The people of New South Wales, by their vote last Saturday, whether electoral system aUows Mr Wran to become Premier or not, have shown by a vast majority anyone's language-we U over 50 per cent of the popular vote-that they do not reject Labor's attitudes and phUosophies and potential. Austraha is a great trading nation. We are affected enormously by the world-wide trade cycle. Our present troubles of inflation and unemployment to a large extent are the result of world-wide trade cycle phenomenon. The Austrahan Labor Government suffered the misforof being in power for thefirsttimein 23 was years, with so much to do, at a time of world upheaval. It was totally dishonest to blame Labor for so many of the economic this disdifliculties that prevaUed. The economic history of the last 6 months of to Liberal-National Country Party Government shows how dishonest it was of the Frasers, the Lynches, the Anthonys, the Sinclairs of this bleats world and all their foUowers",47
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION,"Dr Jenkins)be Order! The honourable member should refer to of this House by their parliamentary nor of any tides, not by their names.",49
107,Mr HURFORD,DECENTRALISATION,"I accept your ruUng, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am referring of course to the 4 by Leaders of this coaUtion Government-the 2 to National Country Party Leaders and the 2 Liberal Leaders. It was foolish for them and all their followers to pretend, and it is misleading to pretend to the Australian people that they had the answers. They did not have the answers. They have not the answers now and from all the signs it is doubtful whether they will improve and have the answers in the future. Due to their false phUosophies, stupid attitudes and wrong policies do they have postponed the economic improvement this which was under way. The world economic has commenced. The signs are good in a the USA, West Germany and, to a lesser extent, of Japan. We should be locking into that world we may recovery situation. Apart from the March retaU sales figures, which could be a temporary aberration, the Ausindicators show a turn for the worse since the Liberal Party and the National Country will Party came to power. They hed their way into office. They have not been able to deliver the goods. The Australian people are already beginning to give them their just desserts. I refer, of course, to the New South Wales election. Their 6 policies and utterances have been wrong. It would seem that to a Umited extent, they now realise they have been wrong. Some of them are the now changmg their tune. Instead of talking gloom-bel ttightening,no soft options, tough in budgets-the y are now exorting people to get out and spend. Presumably they are talking to those people whom they have allowed to have some reasonable income and whose bank deposits are growing; not to those people whose incomes they are limiting-pensioners , wage earners and so many others. Now we have rumours of mini-budgets. These this are panic measures of men who words and their pohcies have hitherto been Other cuts-o of the wrong. They have caused chaos in the wages trate market by putting indexation in jeopardy. They have increased interest rates. unemployment. They have caused hardship by slashing Government expenditure. In short, they of have postponed the return of consumers' conhold fidence-the one thing needed for economic invaluable recovery. They have managed to be generous where inefficient. their own, more affluent supporters stood to The superphosphate bounty was one case in point. The investment allowance- a most confustraUan ing area of their pohcy-is another. It was generous and has not helped economic recovery from in any measurable way. Because it was so exhtde debate pensive to revenue, it has closed other more benBudget, most eficial options. But it is to Government ture and so-called savings-in my view more as the Opposition's$2.8 aptly called under-expenditure-as detailed in introduced to the world these Appropriation Bills and the second reading an imputed deficit of much speeches that I want to devote the rest of my campaign to justify the ultimate speech. Even in the second reading speeches on Bills, the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has been unable to resist the temptation to distort the facts and seek to reflect ill upon the Australian Labor Government. The Treasurer compares the extra appropriation of $506m sought in this the $ 1,241m sought at a similar time last year. The comparison is meant to portray more $ 1,200m efficient management on the part of the present the deficittohas Government. The Treasurer conveniently omits taxation receipts, to inform us that the extra included in last year's have us believe as Bills was of course the result of dehberate policy diture excesses. The initiatives taken after the 1974-75 Budget. It was Malcolm Fraser) in this House a time of world caused growing unemployment. Spending was necessary to save that unemploydescribed ment from becoming worse. That saving was good out instituted; unemployment was saved from beturns coming worse. In general, I have left it to my coUeagues plore the detaUs of the cuts oudined in the docuwages, ments which accompany these BUls. I shall conwages cern myself primarily with the these cuts for economic recovery. However, there are cuts in one area which I must mendon. The full cynical nature of this Government is revealed in its cuts in foreign aid. How anybody, let alone an Australian Treasurer, can feel pleased with making savings of $2 lm on financestatement which was destined to alleviate suffering in countries much worse off than Australia is beyond me. The fuU import of the lack of feeling that runs in alises Government is brought home when one rethat such a cut has rninimal significance for reahse that their the running Austrahan domestic economy. r foreshadowed cuts-whic h Ulusthe short sightedness of this Government's They nave caused penny-pmching the impact long in some areas are plans to shelve term economic planning model the Australian economy and also the housereau expenditure survey by the Australian Buof Statisucs. Both these projects could be of aid to effective future economic planning. These cuts are counter-productivegain. I now turn my attention to stabUisation impacts of the Government's cutbacks. The AusLabor Government's Budget of August over1975 was subject to a campaign of vUification the very date of its introduction. However, took place over the real issues in the attack being directed at the expendiplanned deficit of bilUon. This was strange, alternative Budget which it a week later contained the same size. As the removal from office of the Australian Labor Government these gamed momentum, members of the Opposition, particularly the present Treasurer, attacked the to very success the Labor Government had in controlling the rapid growth in wages. As wage growth slowed, so did taxation receipts and natyear with urally the deficit widened. It is important to realise that virtually all the $ 1,400m increase that will occur in been as a result of a shortfall in not as this government would a result of extravagant expenPrime Minister (Mr on 26 February the deficit as 'rising out of control'propaganda but totally misleading. As it of $4 the ultimate deficit wiU be of the order bUlion, a total reflection of the success of the Australian Labor Government's wages polto exicy. We do not like seeing workers with less but we realise that the rate of increase in must be minimised for economic stability ramificadons of in our country. This Government's ideological assault on the concept of deficit financing has been long and intense and it has still not ceased. The Budget deficit still retains such an awe of fascination for the Government that virtually every economic emanating from it contains words of false wisdom about the harm caused by the deficit. The Treasurer in this House on 27 April in reply to a quesuon from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) accused me as shadow Treasurer- I suppose I should be pleased that he felt it worthwhile doing this-of making 'utter and complete distortions' in statements 'on the internauonal comparisons of the Austrahan deficit as a proportion of GDP'. The impUcation of what he said was that in describing the Australian deficit as far from unique I was supporting the untenable. To accompany this statement the Treasurer produced a series of statistics designed to demonstrate the relatively large size of the Austrahan domestic deficit compared to overseas countries. As is the Treasurer's habit he declined to give us the source of thesefigures.This, of course, tends to reduce their worth. However, let us assume that they are the latest avaUable from a rehable source. I wiU speculate that they are unconfirmed Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures. If one is going to base a larger part of the rationale for one's economic pohcy on these figures, surely 2 provisos should be mentioned in their relationship. Firsdy, the figures for the United States of America and Germany will understate the extent of deficit financed public expenditure. This happens because of the different constitutional relationship between central, State and local government as regards pubhc sector borrowing. The OECD incidentaUy in the past has pomted this out when givingfiguressuch as those produced by the Treasurer. The States and local government in those countries can go into deficit which the Australian States and local government cannot do. The second point regarding figures such as these is that statistics must lag behind actual events. For example, thefiguresquoted by the Treasurer for the United States appear to be appropriate to a central government deficit of $50 bUlion to $70 bUUon-a n original estimate much along the Unes of the estimate of $2.8 bUlion for the Australian Budget deficit last year. As reported in the Economist of 4 October 1975, Mr William Simon, Secretary to the United States Treasury, stated to a Congress committee that the United States Budget deficit was going to be much larger than that originally budgeted and would probably be of the order of $90 bilUonapproaching 6 per cent of gross domestic product. This makes nonsense of the answer given to the Dorothy Dixer asked by the honourable member for Curtin in this House. The purpose of this discussion of figures is to engage is a semantic argument with the Treasurer over the definition of the deficit, for that is all it becomes when comparatively small differences are looked at. The purpose is to demonstrate that running a higher than normal deficit is not a purely Australian phenomenon. It is happening as industrialised countries throughout the world attempt to cope with the deepest recession since the depression days of the 1930s. Unfortunately, as long as the Treasurer continues in this campaign of attaching odium to the very existence of the deficit by any means whatsoever, meaningful debate on therightcourse for Austraha's economic poUcy wdl be stifled. It is important to dispel the erroneous impression that a high budget deficit is uniquely Australian. But it is more important to reaUse that as far as economic stabiUsation policy is concerned changes in the direction of government expenditure at any onetimeare of more significance than the actual levels of that expenditure. This the Government appears not to realise. The Australian Labor Party contends that slashing government spending- a deflationary move-is not the action needed to engender economic recovery in Australia. It is becoming more and more obvious that overseas countries which have turned the corner out of recession have done so with the aid ofan expanding government sector. I will now instance a few of these countries. Japan is a country whose recent economic ills have closely paraUeled our own. Let us see how they have attacked their problems. The Japanese Government has taken a number of measures which sharply contrast with those of the Fraser Government. On government expenditure the Japanese Government introduced in October 1975 a supplementary budget designed to reflate its economy. The key reflation ingredient was increased government spending. This occurred in a number of areas including public works, housingfinance,loans for pollution control and loans for small business. On the interest rate front the Japanese Government moved to make real cuts in interest rates. Compare this to the action of the Fraser Government which instituted a phoney, artificial cut in the lower maximum overdraft rate and then ensured a general lift in interest rates by the introduction of the overpitched savings bonds. The Japanese Government set about trying to promote recovery through encouraging the private sector to see that it was the Government's role to supplement shortfalls in overall demand levels. The Fraser Government saw until recently only gloom at every corner and any not government-initiated demand supplement as an evU to be avoided at aU costs. So much for Japan. But now let us look at recent economic problems in the United States. Dr Pierre Renfret, Economic Adviser to 3 United States presidents, at a recent gathering of Sydney members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia outUned 2 key factors in America's economic revival. One of these was an upturn in consumer confidence, something the Australian Labor Party has been advocating here, and the other was that the American Government was, to quote him, 'spending money like there was no tomorrow'. Dr Renfret estimated that the real American central government deficit would be at least half as large again as that budgeted. Deficit ngures forfiscalyears 1975 and 1976 indicate also that Canada is using increased government expenditure to underwrite economic recovery. As the Economist of 4 October 1975 points out, even France, which on face value appears not to be doing so, is reflating through public sector involvement. This is because although it has a comparatively small budget deficit thefinancingof this deficit is being done through a direct increase in the money supply. The Bulletin of May carries a story on a western European country which appears to have got off scot free while its neighbours are freezing in the slump. This country is, of course, Sweden. The main reason given for Sweden's economic health is its wUlingness to spend its way out of potential trouble. Incidentally the Swedish performance would tend to put the he to another so called 'fact' members of the present Government are fond of parading-that of a link between an increased size of pubhc sector and poor economic performance. Sweden's public sector as measured by general government expenditure as a percentage of GDP hovers around 50 per cent whUe the comparable Australian figure is of the order of 32 per cent One does begin to wonder just which countries the Treasurer was referring to when he said: The simple fact is that governments trialised world-particularl y those with which I have had direct conversation-at the present time are in the process reducing their deficits ana in particular the overall quantum of public spending. One would recognise New Zealand as one of this select group but even it is in a somewhat different position to Australia as it is confronted with a massive balance of payments deficit. IncidentaUy, before the Treasurer starts quoting projected 1977 deficitfiguresas evidence of an mternational move towards a decline in government expenditure I point out that once recovery is substantially under way the requirement for stimulus from government is reduced and therefore, of course, the requirement for government deficits is reduced. The point to be noted in this regard is that whde overseas a recovery is definitely emerging, the actions of this Government in this country, as I have already said, appear to be postponing such an occurrence in Australia. The examples of the actions taken by countries with simUar problems to Australia's are intended to repudiate the myth being foisted on the Austrahan people by this Government. The Fraser Government has conducted an elaborate campaign to convince Australians that severe cuts in government spending are a virtual prerequisite for economic recovery. The actions of governments in countries where recovery is under way deny this. We have reached the stage where the Treasurer parades every cut in government expenditure with all the enthusiasm of a new Messiah with a message of salvation. Cuts are announced and immediately seen as good and just. No attempt has been made to explain the ramifications of the multiplier effect of individual government cuts. Even the Treasurer must know that different types of government expenditure have different impacts on the economy. This Government seems not to realise that cutting government expenditure does not automatically transfer resources to the private sector, and that cuts themselves mean less work forfirms.Let us look at just one industry to suffer from short sighted government cuts. I quote 'The Fraser Government's economics are seriously damaging the already weakened construction industry'. This is how the business digest Rydge's in its April issues describes the action of the Government which came to power on the promise that it was the administration which could get business moving. The Sydney newspaper the Sun Herald in its edition of 2 May in a story headed 'BuUders on the bread line' points to a significant issue which the Government appears ready to ignore. I quote: throughout the indusIfthe industry (building and construction) is allowed to of sink to the very depths of depression there will not be sufficient competent professional, contracting teams and tradesmen to handle the work when demand revives. This statement highhghts the problems of structural dislocation which continued recession will bring-recessio n caused by the Liberal-National Country Party Government's false ideology. Despite this threat on the horizon the Treasurer announces that the Government has saved $18m be deferring a number of capital works projects in the Departments of Transport, Northern Territory and Construction and a further $29m by abolishing the Australian Housing Corporation. This might be $47m of saving to the Treasurer and hence a source of satisfaction to him. One doubts that the ailing companies and the unemployed workers in the building and construction industry for whom this money was intended would share his satisfaction, nor would the people of Austraha who need the fruits of the work of this industry. The problems confronting the building industry are just examples of the damage being done throughout the economy as recovery is delayed. The Labor Party feels confident that just as the world-wide economic recession was the prime cause of the Australian recession then eventually Australia will be dragged into the world-wide economic recovery despite delays caused by this Government. However, we are concerned about structural damage which may occur in the meantime. At long last it would appear that sections of the Government are also recognising this, if the Prime Minister's recent exhortations and recent change of attitude are any guide. They are, it would seem, now at the stage of changing pohcy. I hope so. Their old ideology is in tatters. They do not know whether they want to deflate or reflate. They do not know whether they are coming or going.",49
108,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,DECENTRALISATION," When I came into the House I thought I would be listening to some constructive contribution by the shadow Treasurer to the problems that face us economically, financiaUy and industrially. I regret to say that I did not hear such a contribution. This is understandable because of the shadow Treasurer's lack of knowledge of finance or of fiscal or monetary concepts of any kind. I sympathise with him. I am sorry for him. I think whoever wrote his speeches should have written a somewhat different one for him which would have given some kind of guidance to the Australian people and particularly to this House as to Labor'sfiscalpolicies and alternatives. He referred to an issue that ought to be forgotten by now. He referred to the withdrawal of the mandate of the former Prime Minister as Prime Minister and to the vesting of that office in Mr Malcolm Fraser. There can be no doubt that that action was welcome to the Austrahan people. The vote showed it. He spoke about whether there was power under the Constitution to take such action. Obviously he has not read section 5 of the Constitution. If he reads the words of that section surely he will have to concede that there is such a power. Could there be anything more precise than the words in that section? It states: The Governor General may appoint such times for ing the sessions of the Parliament as he thinks also from dme to time, by Proclamation or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament, and may in like manner dissolve the House ofRepresentatives. Therefore he has the specific power. What else could he have done in a situation like that which existed towards the end of last year? There is no doubt that the economy was being mismanaged. There is no doubt at all that Supply was just about to run out. In this context I refer to another section that should interest the shadow Treasurer because of his hitherto total ignorance of this subject. Under section 83 of the Constitution, there can be no appropriation unless there is a vote of the Parliament. If there had been an attempt at appropriation, even if the money had been borrowed overseas, it would have been Ulegal and unconstitutional to appropriate it without a vote of the Parliament, not just the House. Under section 61 of our Constitution the Governor General in Council has certain obligations. One is to ensure that the government of the country is carried on. As there were no prospects of the government of the country being effectively carried on under the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whidam), the former Prime Minister and now the Leader of the Opposition, the Governor General had to act. For the time being, I hope, after the Paltridge affair, he can be only the temporary Leader of the Opposition. It was a sorry and degrading day for us that the events associated with the name of the late Senator Sir Shane Paltridge aUeging corruption should have been made a subject of public debate without any evidence and pursued not only in this House but outside as well. For these reasons I dispose quickly of the first argument of the shadow Treasurer. Then, he referred to the powers of the Senate. There is no doubt that the Senate has the power to refuse passage to a Bill. That power has been there for donkeys years. People accept that power. Mr E. G. Whitlam and the former Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Murphy, both stated that they would use that power if they had the opportunity.",53
109,Mr HURFORD,DECENTRALISATION,They never used it.,53
110,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,DECENTRALISATION,"Do not be a hypocrite. They tried but could not muster the numbers. They accept that fact. The shadow Treasurer obviously does not understand what all this is about. Again I sympathise with him and express to him my sorrow. Nonetheless, there it is. They would have done it. Now they resent the fact that the Governor General approholdpriately and properly took the action he did. Of fit, and may course the question is this: What is wrong with the people of this country being given an opportunity to express their views when the country is headed for a depression? When the Government cannot control appropriation there can be no doubt that the economy had moved out of the stage of stagflation and stagnation. We had marched through the phase of recession, and were steadily and inevitably moving towards depression. Under those circumstances surely the people of Austraha had the right to vote? They did! What was the result? The sovereign power in this country, the people of this country, took the present Opposition to task and chucked them out. The people acted in the most responsible and decisive way known in Austraha's history. The shadow Treasurer then mentioned the funny old story about inflation being a world phenomenon. In one sense it has been a world phenomenon. Apart from Australia, no country had the same prospect of escaping the rigours and unfortunate effects of this world phenomenon as we did. We had oil enough for our own needs. We could have isolated ourselves from many of the misfortunes of the world. We had an immense export income. We had an economy which, when the Labor Party came in, was developing at a magnificent pace. Real growth was IVi per cent. Inflation by the implicit deflator was 2.2 per cent, and by the consumer price index it was 4.6 per cent. Unemployment was down to 88 000. Out of this inheritance what a horrible, nasty, mean mess the Labor Party made of the economy in less than 3 years. It reversed all those trends and estabhshed the conditions that prevaded when the Fraser Government came into power in 1975. I must mention retail sales but I will do that a Uttle later on. The shadow Treasurer distorted statements made by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). Let me make this clear and positive statement. The shadow Treasurer raised the question of deficits and said that Australian deficits were small compared to others. There cannot be any doubt on the bestfiguresthat are avaUable, that thefiguresgiven by the shadow Treasurer were manifestly and provably false. Thefigurefor the deficit in the United States of America is 4.6 per cent, for Canada 4.3 per cent, for West Germany 3.3 per cent, for Japan 3.7 per cent, and here it 6.1 per cent. The honourable member's statement that we are at the bottom of the league is wrong. In fact we are at the top of the league in real terms. If he knew a Utde more about monetary and fiscal poUcy surely he would have turned to what was one of the decisive influences in halting the environment conducive to inflation-the money supply. In the United States if the money supply is in excess of 7 per cent people go jumping through hoops. Here we had to tolerate a level of 27.7 per cent whUst Labor was in Government. It would not have stopped if the Fraser Government had not come into office. Do not look like that. You look as though you ought to be in another place.",53
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION,Dr Jenkins)Order! The House will come to order. The right honourable member should address the Chair.,54
112,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,DECENTRALISATION,"I should, Mr Deputy Speaker, but when I am tempted in that way I cannot resist.",54
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DECENTRALISATION,I am sure that the right honourable member has been here long enough to yield not to temptation.,54
114,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,DECENTRALISATION,"Yes . You are right, Sh. If it had not been for the action taken by the Fraser Government probably the estimated deficit of $2,860m at the beginning of the Budget year would have risen to at least $4,750m and ended up, probably, at about $5,000m. So how can the honourable member argue in the way he did about the kind of action taken by the Fraser Government to reduce the deficit Government expenditure. I could talk in this way for sometimebut I have no wish to do so because there are other matters that ought to be dealt with while I am speaking in this debate. I would Uke to mention one, but only one, fact associated with the Appropriation BUls and compare it with the performances of the Australian Labor Party last year. I refer to the fact that the savings under Appropriation BUls (3) and (4) will be of the order of $500m. Let us contrast that with what happened under Labor. Last year expenditure increased by $ 1,700m. All told there would have been an additional deficit of $ 1,200m. This was just part and parcel of the persistent way Labor did things-the devastatingly destructive way in which they acted when they were looking at the Budget and expenditure of Government Funds. At least the shadow Treasurer acts with good will. I cannot criticise him for lack of goodwUl or integrity. If you look at the actual figures associated with Labor's various Budgets you is have to concede that the first 2 Treasurers did not try to control expenditure. On every occasion they gave into the pressure or cajolery of Ministers and the Caucus. The first Treasurer-the honourable member for Adelaide who is the fourth in succession in a long line of faUuressaid that he had no intention of restricting his coUeagues' requests in relation to increased and excessive expenditure. Let us look at some of the figures to prove that point. If we look at the 1971-72 we find a domestic deficit of $405m. In 1972-73, at a time when we had to stimulate demand in order to ensure that we moved out of a recession and on to prosperity and reduce unemployment-whic h we did-w e had a domestic deficit of $215m and a total deficit of $709m. We knew what we were doing and would have had to put on the breaks early in 1973 when the economy recovered. We get to 1974-75 and find that the deficit under Labor rose to $2,567m- a colossal increase and one that could only cause damage and create the environmental and financial conditions under which wage claims could be made and achieved. Inevitably overtimewith productivity fallen we would have created the conditions of depression which I mentioned a few moments ago. The point I want to make here and now is this: I believe that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has rightly stressed that thefirstobjective of this Government must be the reduction of inflation. I believe that this Appropriation Bill gives us the opportunity to look at the various changes in particular departmental appropriations and the explanations given to establish the trend that is occurring in the economy, to highUght the real problems the country faces and what ought to be done about them and to inquire whether we can move more quickly to get this country strongly back on the path to economic andfinancialrecovery. I think that honourable gendemen will agree with me that the critical factors in the policies of the Fraser Government are these: First of all, the shadow Treasurer knows that national growth and development, and with it prosperity, are the keynotes of success. To achieve that purpose we must have a diversion of resources from the non productive section-that is the pubhc sector-bac k to the private sector. Secondly, we have to ensure that the money supply will not create inflationary expectations and develop a momentum for wage increases of its own. I beheve it to be a truism that to achieve cess the critical factor must be in national growth of an effective kind both of supply and demand. Keynes fashioned the theory of effective demand. He said that there ought to be enough money created by the Government to absorb potential supply at full employment level. I change his words a Uttle and I say that supply has to be increased in an effective way-that is, cordance with the wishes and needs of the people expressed in the market place. I had intended to say something about the international position and the prospects of higher prices for our exports year but time prevents me from doing so. Instead I have to content myself with the statement by the shadow Treasurer about the international position and that conditions in Australia are a reflection of world conditions. Today only one country is showing obvious signs of getting back to real growth development and prosperity, and that is the United States. Japan looks as though it might soon reach the take off stage in the same direction. The United Kingdom is putting up a magnificent performance to restrain wages and pubhc expenditure but so far is getting nowhere. If you look at the rest of the world, you are drawn to the conclusion that, with the exception of West Germany and the oU producing states of the Middle East, the world is in a very sick condition. We cannot expect a strong and permanent improvement in commodity prices or the prices of our primary industries or our extractive mining industries or for that matter the products of our manufactured exports until the second half of this year. In fact so far as manufactured goods are concerned they have been reduced to minimal quantities during the time when Labor was in power. Only today I read somefigureswhich illustrate the kind of problem we face in this country. The figures are associated with the gross national product in Australia and the way in which the various sectors have joined in making up the GNP. Let me turn to what I regard as the critically important section of the economy if we are to achieve an increase in our gross domestic production. I refer to the manufacturing and producing section of this country, to corporate profits and to the relationship between corporate profits and wages. Normally, when the economy is bubbhng along in a healthy state we like to believe that as prosperity and growth develop we achieve satisfactory and reasonable proportions between wages and profits and, out of those profits, the ability to develop-whethe r by technology or by the appUcation of more machinery. When my Party was in power at the end of 1972 suc- the amount of our gross national product that went to profits was 17 per cent. Under Labor it fell to about 8 per cent or 9 per cent. At the begmning of 1975 thefigurehad risen to 13 per cent. Before the turn of 1975 it worked down to 11 per cent again. This is the great economic problem that we face today. The former percentage of corporate profits must be restored. Lookin acing at the facts observers will see that wages themselves and their percentage of GNP have consistently improved. Of course we want wages to have a better purchasing power and to ensure better standards and more opdons for all. But unless the flow of money to industry is increased, mdustry cannot invest and generate the conwhat fidence to do the job that is so necessary Austraha is to prosper. We want every single uon of the community to have the opportunity to share in prosperity. Let us look at one facet of this; frankly not discuss any other because of the Umitations of ume. I ask honourable members to look at statisucs for other new capital equipment besides housing, motor vehicles and production of a simUar kind in our manufacturing industry. This relates to 1975. Here is the condemnation Labor and its poUcies-the damnadon of Labor's pohcies and where they were taking us in their headlong rush to depression. In the September quarter of 1975 investment in manufacturing fell by 7 per cent. In the December quarter the figure was a further faU of 11 per cent. In mining thereten was an increase in the September quarter of 12 per cent and thefigurefell to minus 6 per cent the December quarter. If you look at industry a whole and take into considerauon the theatres, entertainment industries, recreation and occudo pations of that kind, you will see that we deficit in investment of 5 per cent. In those cumstances what alternative was there unless poUcies were changed? There was none. The real prospect was a recession followed by depression. I believe that the Fraser Government is on the present right track in legislating for an ance and double depreciation provisions for and then that amount should industry as a stimulus. I believe it is on the right track in attempting to divert resources from section of the community to another-fro m the every pubhc sector to the private sector. lieve that the most urgent action it must take is to make further representations to the Commonwealth ConciUauon and Arbitration Commoment mission about wage and income tax indexation is one of those in the national wage case. We should look at the persuasive, fall in profits as a percentage of gross national presented product and the prospects of a further rise in wages due to the probable increase in the CPI 3 per cent and a possible wage rise of $9.20. This guidance prospect should be considered against the backby the national ground that the Fraser Government has decided Fraser Government that in the next Budget, for 1976-77, it will start the process of indexation of personal income tax. The Fraser Government has already stated that it will commence indexation of personal taxation. In my view that statement has been treated(5.50)with scorn by the Commission and not without reason. It is not precise enough or a basis on which the Commission can act. I believe thetimehas come when the Fraser Government must be more explicit in saying it intends to do with personal income taxif ation in the Ught of the statement by the sec-Treasurer last night, that he will fromtimeto time make statements relating to such matters as indexation as a help in solving the nation's problems. I took it that he meant indexation of perI cansonal income taxation. There is a very good precedent when we are considering great the national issues of an economic kind and when the judgment has to be made as to whether the Government should take action quickly. I do not know of any person who has had better knowlof edge offinanceand economics than Keynes, the great British economist. He and for that matter his disciples never hesitated to act quickly when the future was at stake. We now have within 6 months increases of 6.4 per cent and 3 per cent in the consumer price index and these will be writinto wages. So we face a 15 per cent inflation rate in a year. In order to pre-empt that I believe in we have an obligation as a Parliament and a as government to indicate clearly to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission what it will in terms of income tax indexation with its had a effect on future wage claims. There is a cirprecedent. Many years ago the Arbitration Commission informed the Government that it would not grant a wage rise if child endowment was introduced, and child endowment was introduced. I believe our general approach in the Arbitration case is right and that is that the Commission should permit the CPI increase investment allow to apply up to average minimum award rates flow through the one whole of the award wage structure, providing always we have hearings every so often-onc e year or every year and a half-relatin g to But I also berelativities, now that kind. Thiswork value claims and matters of is a moment of decision. It is a of trial for the Government. I believe it occasions when with courage, a logical and acceptable case can be to the Arbitration Commission. Members of the Commission are talented and experiof enced men. They are looking for leadership and from the Government. They must be assisted with a sensible and achievable approach Government. I believe that the is the only government that is capable of giving it.",54
115,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DECENTRALISATION,"Hindmarsh) I want to talk about the collegiate system of voting in union elections. I begin by saying that the Australian Labor Party's platform provides for participatory democracy in union affairs and provides that no financial union member shall be deprived of therightto vote in the elecuon of union committees exercising any powers of management and that no committee man shall be permitted to occupy a full time office unless he is elected by a direct secret vote of the rank and file of his union. However, the 1973 Conciliation and Arbitration Act gave unions until mid-November of 1976 to comply with the provisions of the 1973 Act. The rules of the more democratic unions had already provided for the direct vote of members for all offices. Those that did not took the necessary steps to bring their rules into line with the requirements of the 1973 Act. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard a list giving examples of the unions which had full time office bearers elected directly by the membership and those where the election was by the collegiate system.",56

117,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PLUS,"I thank the House. Some of these unions, as will be seen from the hst have held back. In the main, they were extreme right wing unions whose officers were afraid to face a direct vote of their rank and file. In the main they were unions dominated by the National Civic Councd. In the main they were unions that confidently predicted that they would be able to get from this Government the right to continue with an anti-democratic control of their unions. Theyfirstattempted to subvert my successor, Senator James MCClelland. Mr Maher and Mr Maynes, both of them NCC agents, made is representations to persuade the Labor Government to alter the Act to allow a continuation of the collegiate system of depriving union membership of a direct vote for office holders. Senator James MCClelland rejected their representations out of hand and the matter never even reached AND FILE the Cabinet room. I pay tribute to the very fine work carried out by Mr Joe Riordan in opposing this insidious attempt by NCC agents to persuade Senator James MCClelland to defy Labor Party policy and the platform of the Australian Labor Party to bring in this anti-democratic system of controIUng union officials. But then these people gambled on the possibUity of the Senate refusing Supply, of forcing a double dissolution and bringing about the defeat of the Labor Government. They seemed to be better informed about what the Governor General intended to do than the Government was. It is certain that they apparently knew as much about the intention of the Governor General as the then'Leader of the Opposition knew. They knew that if they could defeat the then Government they would have the power to get their own way and to prevent the rank and file of their unions from having a direct say in the election of office holders. They had an important advocate for their PLUS causerightinside the Department of Labor and Immigration. They knew that Santamaria could put the indian sign on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) whenever he wanted to. And he has done it and he has got what he wanted. They knew that they could also count on the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) with whom they had established important ideological links when he Union was the Minister for Labour and National Service. But I ask these people to answer this simple question: What are they afraid of? Why are afraid to let the rank andfileof their unions a direct vote for the election of the office holderssystem of their union? My ConcUiation and Arbitration Bill provided that the cost of officiaUy conducted union baUots would be paid for by the GovernbaUots ment. They cannot argue that the conducting of these extra elections wiU cost the small unions money that they cannot afford to pay because, I repeat, my 1973 Bill provided that aU officially conducted ballots would be paid for completely by the Government. They cannot argue the cost aspect. They cannot even argue the physical disabUities aspect because that, too, would have been taken care of under the 1973 Bill. I say quite openly and quite proudly that have frequently been personally responsible for organising petitions for the holding of officially conducted ballots in the Australian Workers port Union. I knew that if we did not have an elect officiaUy conducted baUot in the AWU we wouldwas not have a fair dinkum baUot; it would be a cor-union's rupt baUot. Therefore I was in favour of officiallyunion conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union. I was in that Union for longer than any-know body in this buUding. I know more about that Union and its history of baUot corruption than almost any person in Austraha. I had no alterna-andfileto tive but to organise the holding of officiaUy con-their ducted baUots. I never knew any opposition to come from the rank andfilemembers of the Aus-But, traUan Workers Union to the petitions for clean baUots that I used to take around and organise. never struck any opposition from within the AWU. I never knew any rank andfilemember that that I approached to refuse to sign a petition an officiaUy conducted ballot and I do not Ueve that there is very much difference between the rank andfilemembers of the AWU and the rank andfilemembers of most other unions. As a matter of historical record, the AWU's executives are now actuaUy asking the Registrar to cany out all of the baUots of the AWU by the officially conducted system. The members of the executive no longer see any advantage torigbaUots. They know that if they do their jobs they will win any ballot without having torigit. Rigged baUots are only essential to people are not doing their jobs. People who do their and who are true to their trust have nothing fear from a clean ballot of the rank and file. Federated Iron workers Association of Australia has for years had written into its registered rulesits a provision requiring that all ballots of the shall be conducted by the Electoral Officer. The Street proposal, which, if it has not already gone to the Cabinet, will shortly go to theyprovides as a kind of pay-off for this antihavedemocratic proposal of retaining the collegiate a sop which says that provision will be made to allow the rank andfileto petition for a baUot to alter the rules in favour of rank and file where the collegiate system already operates and, conversely, to allow those who have a rank andfileballot to petition for an alteration of the rules to bring in the coUegiate system. Let me say with quite a degree of certainty that the latter proposal is never likely to eventuate. The coUegiate system is undemocratic. It is unworthy of any government or any country that preaches democracy and participatory democracy within the trade union movement. It is conI trary to the solemn promise which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) gave to the electorate on the hustings. He received massive supfor his promise to give unionists the right to their own office holders in secret baUots. It support that was not deserved because every rules already provide for secret ballots. A cannot get registration unless its rules do so. But it was a political gimmick that paid off. I that it paid off because I met people on the factoryfloorwho said that they were attracted by the Prime Minister's promise to allow the rank have a direct voice in the election of office holders. Nobody should imagine that it did not win votes for the Government; it did. of course, by the same rule it will lose votes for the Government now that those who voted Ifor it in the behef that they were going to get the democratic direct voice of the rank andfileknow they are going to get only an indirect voice for and that handfuls of men calling themselves the bemanagement committees of unions will elect each other to the most important fulltimepositions at the federal level. It will only need 12 people in the second largest union in Australia to get together and elect between themselves their own federal secretary, their own federal president, their own federal vice-presidents, their own trustees and their own returning officers under in trying the electoral system.",57
118,Unknown,PLUS,"Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. who Mr CLYDE CAMERON-The unfair part jobsabout the Government's proposal is that those to unions which sought to comply with the Act Thewhich this Parliament passed in 1973, which required that therightofthe rank andfileto elect own office holders should be sacrosanct and union which brought their rules in line with the requirements of the Act are now being put in the position of being worse off than those unions it,which sought to delay their compUance with the Act until the very eleventh hour. The Miscellaneous Workers Union, the Electrical Trades Union and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, to name but three of the largest unions but by no means the only ones who had previously been using the collegiate system for the election of office holders, complied with the requirements of the Act and are now in the position that the officials will be stuck with the rank andfilesystem of electing officers unless they are able to persuade the rank and file to give up their right to directly elect their officers. I am referring specifically now to the Minister's submission to Cabinet. It says: Having regard to the objections both by employer and employee organisations, it would seem desirable to permit organisations to have rules of voting provided that members of the organisation could request a plebiscite supervised by the Australian Electoral Office to be held if they desired to change to a system rect voting. In my view, this would not cut across our policy proposals in relation to democratic control and supervised ballots and would be in accordance with the policy in connection with fundamental changes to the rules of an organisation. If we adopted this approach it would follow that we should allow organisations by plebiscite of the membership to change their rules from a ate system. I propose that we remove the requirements inserted in 1973 providing for the direct election time office holders. There are 2 things about that part of the Minister's submission to Cabinet. The first is that it would appear that all you have to do is to object to something that the Government proposes to do and the Government will not proceed with it. The Minister starts off by saying, in effect; 'Having regard to the objections that have been lodged by employer and employee organisations we now do not propose to go ahead with the proposal'. Does this mean that the Government wdl pay the same regard to objections from unions to all the other things that it proposes? If it does, the Government will have to back down on a lot of the promises or threats which the Government made when it was on the hustings. The Government will get plenty of protests and plenty of objections-to use precisely the term used by the Minister-whe n it seeks to bring these other amendments into the Act. The other thing of which I would hke to remind the Minister is that the Act passed by Parhament in 1973 was not an Act that the Labor Government railroaded through both Houses by the use of the guillotine and without the approval of the Liberal and Country Parties. The Liberal and Country Parties did not oppose that provision in this House. They did not oppose it in the Senate. They could have used their numbers in the Senate to prevent the proposal for the abolition of the collegiate system from ever getting into the 1973 Act had they wished. But no, they did not. They believed the Bill was right then. They must have believed it was right or they would have used their majority to reject it. What sort of double standards does the Government have and use in relation to matters of this kind. Those union officials who refused to comply with the Act, waiting until the very last rriinute allowed to them under the provisions of the Act to make changes to their rules, are now in the position presumably that the rank and file will not be able to get rid of the collegiate system unless the rank and filefirstof all are able to get enough names to obtain a petition for a plebiscite to decide whether the collegiate system is to remain or be abolished. providing for a collegiate system The Minister has not said, and he does not appear yet to have given indications of ever sayof di- ing, in the statute what number of members will be required to obtain a successful petition. I suggest to the Minister that the number ought to be written into the statute. It is not good enough to have it in the regulations. Any Minister in the Executive Council, which means the Minister direct voting system to a collegiconcerned, one other Minister and the Governor of all fullGeneral, can alter the required number needed for a successful petition, as has already been done on many occasions. I do not agree with the whole concept of the collegiate system for a start, but if we have to have a collegiate system and there is a provision for a plebiscite I do not disagree with the idea of a petition. The number of people required to obtain a petition ought to be written into the Act. Thefigureof 250 or one-fifth of the total membership, whichever is the smaUer, is contained in the regulations now. That ought to be written into the Act so that it can remain there and no Ministers can fiddle the regulations to suit their pohtical friends. Mr Street-One-twentieth , is it not?",58
119,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PLUS,"One-fifth is the same as one-twentieth, I think. No, the figure should be 5 per cent. I beg your pardon. The Minister has the advantage of Melbourne Grammar; I only went to Loos School. Thefigureis 5 per cent or one-twentieth of the total membership. I thank the Minister. I am obliged to him. I would like to tell the Minister something else. I am grateful to him and in a wayflatteredby the fact that he left his delegation to come and Usten to me. He must not be misled by what allegedly occurred at the Arbitration Committee of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions. My information from ACTU Executive officers is that the Committee's decisions are not binding on the ACTU until they are endorsed by the ACTU full Executive. They have not been yet endorsed by the ACTU full Execuuve and in my opinion they are not likely to be endorsed. Mr Sullivan-They are a point of view.",59
120,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PLUS,"They are a point of view that was put to the Committee by the Nauonai Civic Council's prime representative, Mr John Maynes, who came into the meeting without warning and threw onto the table of meeting of the Committee opinions and legal Relations views prepared by Mr Tony Macken who I am ask told by people inside the NCC is to succeed Santamaria as the Chairman of the NCC if he does not get appointed to the Industrial Court first. That is my informadon. I would like to know whether, in seeking to change from the legiate system to the rank and hie direct vote, same kind of stipulation will be put into the as was put into the Act in respect of amalgano mation proceedings. The collegiate system canber not be changed even by a plebiscite of the memme bers unless there is a 50 per cent response everybody entided to vote. If this proposal is to be in the Act it wdl stand branded for what it is. This is a blatant breach of a solemn electoral promise, of an electoral mandate, sought Government and obtained by the Government. It is a cynical disregard for the wdl of the electorknows ate. It is an unashamed betrayal beheved that the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party stood for rank and file control of trade unions. Nothing that the Government says again at an election wdl ever be beheved by those people who on this occasion were silly enough to beheve that when the Government said it becan Ueved in democratic control of trade unions it believe in it, because the reintroduction of collegiate system proves beyond all doubt that does not believe in union democracy.",60
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS, net submissions Order! The honourable member's time has a expired.,60
122,Mr CHIPP,PLUS," I listened with great interest to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). I say at the outset, not speaking in my capacity as chairman of the Government Members Industrial Relaabout tions Committee but as the member for Hotham,this that there is a great deal of what the honourable member for Hindmarsh just said with which I agree. I do not know nearly as much about the subject of industrial relations as he does because of his industrial experience. AU I know is that have saturated and satiated myself in this one question in the last 4 weeks. I have had countless trade unions making representations to me. I with. confess that I am in a state of utter confusion about some aspects. The only point I make is that this issue is not as simple as the honourable member for Hindmarsh said. It may be simple to him because of his great knowledge and experience in these areas, but I say with respect to him that he oversimplified a number of issues. I make a plea to the the Minister for Employment and Industrial (Mr Street). If he brings in legislation I that it be laid on the table of this House so that interested parties can put views to the Government, so that the kind of view that the honourable member for Hindmarsh put, which is a respectable view, can be put and hstened to by colthe Government, or preferably by some comthe mittee. As chairman of the Government MemAct bers Industrial Relations Committee, it gave me pleasure to know that the honourable memfor Hindmarsh has a distinct advantage over because he was waving around in his hand a from copy of a Cabinet submission.",60
123,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PLUS,"They must have given you a copy as chairman of the committee. by the Mr CHIPP-The honourable member need not make a cheap point. As a former Minister, he that a Cabmet submission is never given of all those who to back benchers.",60
124,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PLUS,I always gave my submissions to my industrial relations committee.,60
125,Mr CHIPP,PLUS,"We Uve in a strange period of moraUty when that kind of Cabinet submission be given to a man in the Press gallery and did circulated to the President of the Australian the Council of Trade Unions and to the honourable it member for Hindmarsh. Where it leaked from I do not know, but I have nothing but utter contempt for the kind of individual who leaks Cabior any secret documents. This is standard of morality that I wish to speak about in a moment or two when I speak generally about the behaviour of members of this place. I am constrained at the moment to comment on what the honourable member for Hindmarsh said, except to say that I believe that he spoke one of the most important issues facing Parliament at this time. I am constrained because, as chairman of a government members committee, I believe that the proper way is to go through the committee to the Minister, through the Party room, to form a view and then come I into this House and state the view. But let me say that a great deal of what the honourable member for Hindmarsh said I personally have sympathy I was speaking about morality. I would like to speak about what I believe to be a deterioration in the standards of behaviour of members of this Parhament inside it and outside. Lately there seems to be an obsession with attacking the individual, with innuendo, with individual bers of Parhament both hving and dead. This institution is founded on a concept that speaks fearlessly and vigorously against the opinions of an opponent but never against the personahty or character of an opponent. When that is done it demeans the person who does and it demeans the institution of Parhament itself. I do not want to appear to be adopting holier than thou attitude, but in my 15 years in this Parhament I have seen a steady deterioraimportant tion of these moral standards, particularly in the last few years. There are questions on the notice paper which I would be ashamed to put my name to. There are questions on the notice paper about the divorce of the Governor General's wife and about who traveUed with the Governorbeen General on a certain aircraft. Then the scuttlebeen butt goes around the Press gaUery and the corriAssistance dors of this place saying: 'That is why I asked that question'. I think this sort of question just demeans the standards of this institution. had an example of it outside the Parhament by a member of this House that frankly made sick when I read it. This member was demeaning a dead man. I think that is reaching the lowest depth to which a member of this place can sink. How can we expect to command respect from the people? This is the governing institution of the nation. How can we go to the people and ask for down an increase in salaries, which is the people do not respect the individual bers of this institution? I would be a hypocrite if I were standing here saying that the only person who has demeaned this place in the last few weeks has been the Leader of the Opposition (Mr with his attack on the late Sir Shane Paltridge, because in my view members on the Governhas ment side have not been guUtless. I am not proud of the actions of a colleague of mine who tabled in a place in this Parhament an unsigned, sworn document which demeans another memand ber of this place. I say that after due considersocial ation. I am not proud that a Minister moved resolution and caUed for a division or attended division concerning an unsworn, unsigned, unverified statement which said the most shockafter ing things about another member of this This Parliament- a member of this Parliament whom incidentaUy I do not respect, but that is irrelevant to the point. If this voice in the wUderness is of any use at all, let me point out that this sort of precedent once estabUshed will allow any member of this House to have some villains concoct a piece of infamy or calumny about another member, have it typed up, not have it signed or memverified, and then by sheer weight of numbers have it tabled in the House or incorporated in one Hansard. That very act would allow the newspapers of this country to carry that sort of calumny on page one the next day. I speak about this sort of thing on this Appropriation Bill beit cause this Appropriation Bill reminds us, with the expenditure involved, that we are the a Government of the nation. If democracy is to survive in the way we want it to, one of the most things for that survival is to command and sustain respect from the people of Australia. I want to speak about two other matters on this Bill. The first concerns the Austrahan Assistance Plan. Rumours are circulating and there has speculation in the Press-whethe r it has inspired I do not know-that the Australian Plan is to be axed, is to be chopped, is to be decimated. I want to read something into the record to give my strong, vigorous unequivoWe cal views on this matter. When the honourable but member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) introduced the me Austrahan Assistance Plan during the term of office of the Labor Government, as shadow Minister for Social Security I had something to say about it. I said this with the full authority of the joint coaUtion Opposition at that time. I said: Here is one of the most important social documents laid in this Parliament for 20 years. I should like to complilong overdue, if ment the CommissionmemThat was the Social Welfare Commissionfor an outstanding document and I extend my appreciation to the Minister for embracing it and its philosophies. Indeed, one could almost be persuaded that a Liberal Minister wrote the document and embraced its philosophies. This is in fact liberalism at work. It is a document and a speech to which I personally would have been proud to attach my name. E. G. Whidam) I went on to say: This sort of philosophy in the Australian Assistance Plan been Liberal policy for years and we accept it. What is the Australian Assistance Plan? It is a concept in which local communities in various unregions throughout Austraha can band together look after, evaluate and assess the evolving needs in a community. It is not a handout a from the Government which says: 'OK, you have a a problem here; we will give you money to fix it'. It is not a Government department which looks the mentally handicapped or whatever. plan says to the people of Austraha: 'If you are prepared to help yourselves we will give you so much catalytic assistance to help yourselves'. to be As a result 37 or more regions have been formed throughout Austraha and thousands of Austhat trahans who never bothered about getting inshadow volved in local government or Government have joined in, have contributed to the plan, do attend meetings, join its task forces and go into the roots of each community to find out what the social needs of each community are. The thing that holds it together is the fact that the Governance ment has said: 'We will fund the appointment of terms: an executive officer, an office, a secretary and up to 4 community development officers who can be The the people who will go out among the commitment munity and report back to you so that you can report to your regional committee'. To me this is an exciting concept because often asked by people what I rate as the biggest problem facing the people of Australia todaythe biggest menace facing Austraha today. I do not hesitate. Certainly inflation, unemployment, the interest rate and those sorts of things are important, but they are abstract in the sense they do not look after the individual on the his community. ground. They do not care about people as individuals. If I am asked what the greatest ace to Australia is today, I would say it is the tastic growth and concentration of people in cities because world wide experience has shown that the drug problem, the problems of alcoholand ism, marriage break-up, baby bashing and all of those social evils which affect the human being are rampant in the cities which are too large. we beheve that hfe in the big city forces on people the 3 barriers to liberalism in a human being-conformity , bureaucracy and anonymity, and that is what the big city does to a person; makes him feel part of an amorphous mass consequences removed from the decision-making process and governed by a bureaucracy that he cannot seeand if we beheve this sort of thing gives feeling of isolation that makes pleasures, if I could put it that way, such as drugs, alcohol, marriage break-up and that sort of thing, then surely this is the area which we Federal Parhament ought to be assisting. This to me is the very essence of liberalism. In fact, is why I am a Liberal and proud to be a Liberal. Has the Austrahan Assistance Plan been a cess or a failure? Like many of the good things that the Labor Party brought in during its 3 years in office-and it did bring in many good things - it fouled this up by bad administration, spending money as if it was going out of fashion. I am not going to advocate that the Australian Assistance Plan as it was structured by the Labor Party should be maintained. What I am saying is that we are morally, politically and I beheve conscientiously bound to it. I would like to during the election campaign, not as the Minister for Social Security but as the Minister for Social Security or the caretaker Minister for Social Security, I was authorised by the grass Cabinet itself to issue on 22 November a statement which committed this Government if elected to retain and maintain the Austrahan AssistPlan. That was said in these unequivocal Liberal-National Country Parties reiterate their comto supporting and enlarging participation in the decision-making structures relating to the AAP. That statement was made for a particular reason. I am A commitment to continue the AAP was in the social welfare pohcy of the Parties. That policy, I am proud to say-and I hope I say it with some modesty-di d something to win votes in the outlying electorates that were won from us in 1972 and 1974. It is in those kinds of electorates that that we find the swinging voter who does care about menAt that stage on 22 November there was a fangreat deal of doubt about that policy. It was put our to me by the Australian Council of Social Services by several regional councils and by Liberal Country Party candidates in those sorts of areas: 'We are getting complaints that your policy is not quite clear enough'. I took that to CabiIf net and I was authorised to issue the document I have in my hand. It clarified our policy and it unequivocally commits us to a continuation of the Austrahan Assistance Plan. I would regard it it as a very serious matter- I say this knowing the of what I am saying-if the AAP is decimated, if it is changed to such an extent that it cannot function any more, if it is changed to him a such an extent that it cannot perform its him turn to other functions. I say this knowing that the Government has as a massive economic and budgetary problems, but I do believe very strongly that sometimes in this that place we talk too much above our heads about these issues like unemployment, inflation and so on. They are vitally important. I am not saying sucthey are not, but what I am suggesting is that sometimes in this place we get too obsessed with the abstract, with the theory, and sometimes we forget the effects the changing society in which by we hve is having on human beings. The quicker we return to that and maintain those sorts of things which do care about the individual I think the more respect we will earn in the electorate.",60
126,Mr CREAN,PLUS," I say want to confine my remarks to the financial aspects of these measures. There are 2 Bills before us, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which provides for an expenditure of $344m and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) which provides for an expenditure of $161.7m. The expenditure totals about $507m. We also have this other curious document called Treasury Information Paper endded 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations'. I suppose no such document has ever been presented to this Parhament before. It purports to indicate that there will be savings of $266.8m under Appropriation Act (No. 1) and $211.4m under Appropriation Act (No. 2), a total of approximately $478m. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) rather glibly summed up the effect of these things in this way in his speech on these Appropriation Bills: . . . the net effect of the additional appropriations am proposing, and the savings we now expect to be realised, is an increase of $28m on the expenditures provided for in Appropriation Act (No. 1) and Appropriation Act (No. 2). Further on in his speech he said this: One would have to go back a long way to find a year when outlays were in fact less than the Budget estimated. With all respect, I suggest one can place no value whatever upon that document entitled 'Statement of Savings expected in Annual Appropriations'. 1 suggest that some of the savings are occasioned simply by the pohtical paralysis that took place in this nation from about thetimeof the introduction of the Budget until 11 November last year. The savings are not savings in any legitimate sense; they simply mean that Government activity that ought to have been undertaken in fact was not undertaken and that the program has been slowed down. I suppose that is one way of saving. It is rather like the saving as a result of closing the National Library 2 nights a week and not worrying about the value of the books in the Library or the students endeavouring to use them. A few man hours can be saved by closing the Library. If these things are savings I suggest it istimethat this nation had a look at the kind of phUosophy that seems to underpin this Government's approach to financial affairs. I heard before this afternoon a rather pious justification of what this Government is supposed to have done given by a former Treasurer and Prime Minister. I would say, and I have said it before in this House, that there is no single economic act done by this Government since it came into office that in any way has improved the Australian economy. By that I do not mean that the Australian economy has not improved. I am saying that the improvement has nothing whatever to do with what this Government has done or has not done. It is about time we got away from this nonsense of attributing every malaise in the economy to the previous Government and every slight improvement that has taken place since the change to this Government. Unemployment existed when the Labor Party came into office. It wasrisingwhen we came into office and it continued toriseduring our period of office. It is continuing toriseduring the period of office of this Government. Investment has been stagnant in Austraha for several years. The Jackson committee adverted to the fact that there had been a lack of enterprise and a lack of satisfactory investment in Austrahan manufacturing industry not just over the last several years but over the last 10 years. There has been a faUure to face up to the structural changes that are I impUcit in the Austrahan economy. This faUure to some extent has resulted in things hke inflation and unemployment. I do not deny that when we were in Opposition we sought to get some political advantage out of unemployment. We are not the only Western country that has unemployment but we have not got it at as high a level as some other countries. We are not the only country with inflation at unsatisfactory rates. No government has been able to solve those 2 problems given that we want to maintain what is called a free economy and a market operated economy. The big single question always is the share of the total cake that goes to wage earners on one side and profit takers on the other side. I have never regarded the word 'profit' as a dirty word. Neither have I regarded it as a term very easy to explain. But as I have said before, I am getting a little nauseated by what is called' free enterprise' in this country and the insinuation that somehow it disappeared and now it is going miraculously to return. Whatever the Treasurer says about Budget expenditure this year actually being less than was expected when the Budget was drawn up, I want to say something about the 2 sides of this Budget transaction because they are what are involved in the deficit. Expenditure is going to be roughly the same as that set out when the Budget was drawn up. There is to be an increase of something like $2 8m. If the deficit is going to be greater than originaUy thought then it will be greater because taxation yields are less than was expected. One of the reasons that taxation yields are less than was expected is that wage rates have not risen at the rate anticipated this financial year. I do not know whether anybody consciously sought that to happen but I do beheve that what is known as indexation had something to do with it. Like the former Prime Minister to whom I referred earher, I think it is about time the Government came a bit cleaner about what it calls tax indexation. I have been a litde bit intrigued to see certain proposals, not specific proposals; I can rely only upon thefiguresthat I have seen quoted. Indexing personal taxation is said to be going to save $ 1,200m but indexing company tax is said to be going to save $ 1,000m to the companies. I contrast that with the fact that in the Budget it is estimated that we wdl collect $10 bdhon from personal taxation and shghtly over $2 bdhon from company taxation. So it is said that there is to be a saving for individuals of $ 1,200m via indexation and $ 1,000m for companies. One does not need at this stage to go into how company profits are distributed among a relatively small number of companies getting large profits and a large number getting small profits. I think that again this is indicative of the approach. It wdl be nice if one happens to be in the groups that get indexed. It wdl not be so nice if one does not get indexed equaUy. One may be indexed unfairly and what about the sections that will not be indexed at aU? If everything is indexed in fact maybe nothing wiU be indexed. I think it is time that there was a Utde clearer thinking on this subject. The Treasurer may brag this year that this is thefirstyear that expenditure has fallen short of anticipation. I suggest that there may be reasons for that happening. However I would say that he is going to face great difficulties in preparing his first Budget in reconciling promises about tax reductions and promises that there is not an intention to cut back on Government expenditure drastically. I suggest that he will face a deficit of some magnitude before he starts. Candidly, I have never been a person who condemns a deficit. When loosely talked about it becomes a rather meaningless concept. In the last years of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government it was nice to talk about something that that Government called the domestic deficit. It no longer seems to be a popular thing. It is now called the local deficit. People can make the Labor Government's performance appear to be worse by relating deficits to the old domestic basis and ignoring it now. The former Treasurer's statement about the matter reveals a difference of some $700m. Surely one of the matters that is significant is how the deficit isfinanced.I think I have referred in this House to the process that is known as 'crowding out' whereby if you get to a certain level of activity and you engage in more government expenditure, in essence all that you do is to reduce private expenditure by as much or more. With all respect, I doubt whether we can necessarily be thought to have reached that stage in Australia at the moment. The Government seems to be going through a kind of trauma of its own as to whether a recovery has to be investment based or consumer based. The clever Treasurer the other evening made it an amalgam; it has to be a bit of both. I suppose it has to be a bit of both in thefinishbut I stUl think it is simple enough to suggest that no entrepreneur expands his capacity unless he believes that he is going to seU the additional products that his extended capacity wiU provide. There does not seem to be much doubt in thefinishthat a consumer induced expansion has to occur. I do not think the previous Government was given full credit for this: It was not until the end of January broadly that the effects of the new taxation deductions began to have effect. They did have some stimulus as far as consumer expenditure is concerned. On the other hand, there was not as great a stimulus as might have been desired because wages had not risen as fast as had been expected. In some respects some people would regard that as a good thing because they claim that it is the rate of wage increase that in thefinishis the regulator of the rate of inflation. Again, I am not quite sure that it can be summed up as neatly as that; but that passes for logic on the other side of the chamber at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, I submit that we do face a great problem in Australia in the next several months. The present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) used glorious phrases during the general election about the Australian economy being on its knees. What that picturesque phrase was supposed to conjure up I do not quite know, but I submit it is sheer nonsense to suggest that the Australian economy is among the worse economies in the world. It is not. It is not as healthy as it ought to be but it is much healthier than are some other economies. It is not as unhealthy as it is simply because there was a different government to what we have now. Nor is the recovery Ukely to be as rapid as it should be because Government supporters literally do not know what they are doing and where they are going. I think it istimewe got better answers at questiontimethan we now get when Ministers say: 'Who are you to ask a question about inflation?' or. 'Who are you to ask a question about employment; you produced the greatest rates of inflation in history?'. That is not true. The est rate of inflation in Austrahan history occurred in 1951 during the period of the Liberal-Country Party Government. Unemployment in Austraha is now higher than it has ever been. Nobody detary nies that, but do Government supporters beheve that they will reduce the unemployment figures to under 100 000 within a 12-month period? Do they unctuously claim that they need 3 years govern? They denied us anyrightto govern for years in order to carry through a consecutive plan. Despite what the previous speaker about morality, I would say members of the Liberal Party as a whole should be the last speak about pubhc moraUty. Such were the ment actions perpetrated by the Senate in the place and by the Queen's representative in second, that certain people who did have faith in the parliamentary system of government now threaten to take their own actions. I think at times that these sorts of situations ought to contemplated when actions are taken. I think my colleague, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) began by referring to the events of 11 November. I say this-it is the firsttimeI have said it and it will not lasttime-that for this parliamentary system be workable, no Senate can ever dare to think can refuse Supply. I trunk it is time the Governaware. ment examined the structure of expenditure, the continuity of expenditure, the permanence of employment, the permanence of commitment to pensioners and so on. It thinks you can take annual statements and say: 'Until you appropriate that doUar, you cannot do this or you cannot do that'. The second thing that would make parof Uamentary government workable in the future Austraha is that the numbers in the House Representatives shall determine who the governrecovery ment wiU be. In 1976 nobody should take the powers that were discarded by the monarchy as far back as 1776, in fact constitutionally even earUer than that, and say that he can dismiss government. The only feasible ground that the Governor General had was that he was hstening to the whispers in the Press gallery and the kind of nonsense that went on here about corruption and so on. I join with the previous speaker in suggesting that it istimewe talked less about corruption so on. The Labor Government was not corrupt. The Labor Government, in one or two of actions, may have been foohsh. I have said this before in other places and I repeat it. The Khemlani affair was the only leg upon which Governor General had to stand for his actions. the Khemlani affair had not existed, he could not nation. greathave done what he did. In any case, he should not have done what he did. He stiU should have acted on the advice ofhis Ministers. There are no prerogative powers. If the Austrahan parliamensystem is to be a modern working one, if it is to maintain the respect and the confidence of the ordinary people of Australia, the sooner the House ofRepresentatives asserts its proper rights to about financial powers and about the dismissal 3 of Ministers, the better. It ought to be acknowledged on both sides of the House for the said good of the institution as a whole. people to Mr LUSHER (Hume) (8.49)-The Governof the day is placing a great deal of reliance first on the economic measures which it has the introduced and the economic measures which are being considered at this time for introduction in the next few months. I beheve it is opportune for this House to take note of some of the trends be that are developing in other parts of the world that affect this particular economy and to look at some of the views that are being expressed in those countries. I refer particularly to the United States of America. Tonight I should hke to put to not the House some views that are being argued in be the the United States at the moment and which to ought to be considered and of which members of it this Parhament and the Government ought to be I emphasise at the outset that the views that I put are views that are being expressed in the United States; they are not necessarily views that I hold myself, but again I think they are a few views which ought to be considered. I start off by saying that there is a great degree reliance being placed upon the recovery as it is in termed in the United States at the moment. of Views are being expressed that a genuine is not really taking place in the economy. One of the reasons being argued in the United States is that the fundamental financial position of the United States has undergone far a more serious deterioration than is generally realised. A spring can be distorted within reasonable tolerances by applying force such that when the force is removed it will rebound to its original state. However, if the distortion is so great that the spring's inherent tolerances are exceeded it will not recover. Somewhat simUar to this, it is being argued that the United States economy has and been distorted beyond its inherent capabUities, that it wdl not recover along statistical trajecits tories based on past recessions and past recoveries, and that the current popular economic projections radically over-estimate real the growth potential and radically under-estimate If future inflation and employment levels of the It is easy to have a great leap forward if starts from far enough back. The former levels economic activity in the United States cannot achieved without a reversal in a fundamental problem, that is without a reversal toward sound money, money that is worth saving, that is worth lending and that is worth investing. I think these are lessons which we ought to be applying in our own economy in Australia. The short term bullish factors in the United States, by their nature must run later into restraints that are inherent in the fundamental disequilibrium in that country. A decade of rampant inflation has created a yo-yo economy in the United States and, in fact, in most Western countries. Specifically-and this is the most severe latent constraint-the crowding out effect that did not materialise in the money markets in 1975 is tually certain to do so in the late spring and mer, in United States terms, in 1976. The United States Treasury has already budgeted the huge deficit to run through until October and it is expected to tap capital markets for about $70 bilhon this year-abou t $18 bilhon in the first quarter alone. It has to raise the money through thefinancialmarkets or else it must print it. suffer the same constraints. Throughout 1975 the United States Treasury was very fortunate in that it had very httle comAmerica. petition in borrowing in thefinancialmarkets, since corporations generaUy eased up on capital oudays and generated any necessary funds intertion, naUy bytiquidatinginventories, or by floating new equity issues on the crest of the stock market surge in the spring of 1975. Furthermore, in 1975, much of the increased savings deposited by individuals was lent by commercial banks to the United States Treasury as they took down not treasury bUls to bolster their portfoUos in the of decreased demand for general personal and business loans. The unique situation in the first half of 1975 led to an increase in interest bearing marketable pubUc debt of $33 bUlion, in contrast to about a $4 bUlion decrease in thefirsthalf 1974. Fourteen bilUon doUars, or 42 per cent this debt, was placed with the commercial bankhave ing system without putting noticeable upward pressure on interest rates. In other words, the United States Treasury had everything going for it in 1975. Not so in 1976 if the myriad short term bulhsh factors tinue for even a few more months. Specifically, on the one side, increased consumer credit rowing together with increased business loans needed tofinanceinventory and tofinancecapiworth tal expansion, on the demand side, wiU begin compete in earnest with the United States one Treasury which, because of its printing press of backing, standsfirmlyentrenched at the head of be the line at the money trough. On the credit supply side, general business and stock market euphoria, orchestrated by the poltiical activities in Washington this year, wdl cause consumer optithat mism to surge, resulting in decreased saving rates, increased spending rates and a decrease in the avaUable excess reserves generated by pervery sonal savings in the commercial banking system. I think it is fair to say that many of these factors which have been experienced in the United States have been, although not necessarily at the sametime,experienced in our ownfinancialoperations as an economy and as a government. It is argued quite strongly in the United States that virthe economic recovery which is now under way is sumnot a sound economic recovery. It is a pohtically induced superficial recovery which must be politicaUy prodded to keep moving. The fundamentals have not changed. I think we have to learn that lesson here, because by and large the problems that we face are not a great deal difierent from those which have been experienced in re We centtimesin the United States. We have to see that our economy recovers on therightUnes, that we are not simply inducing a pohtically prodded recovery as is being argued is the case in The problems of inflation affect most of the Western world to a greater or lesser extent. There are only 2 ways in which runaway inflafrom which we are stiU not clear, can terminate. One is a crash deflation and depression. The other is a hyper-inflationary money explosion and depression. It appears that there is no third terminal alternative. The efforts of fiscal and monetary officials to steer a middle course is a real alternative. It is rather a delaying tactic face which makes the eventual alternative consequences all the more extreme. The longer this policy is pursued the more likely it becomes that thefinaloutcome will be hyper-inflation. I think that this is one of the things that this Government of is trying to attackrightat the root. We have to of put our house in order in economic terms. We to see that we do not have the sort of interference in the economy which will not put the economy in the direction which it properly should be taking if in fact we are to solve the problems and avoid a bout of hyper-inflation. conMuch has been said about booms and troughs. It has been argued that it is a misconception that borinflationary booms and deflationary busts are inherent in a free market economy. I think it is putting a view that has been argued by to Austrian economists that actuaUy the periodic booms and busts of history are not business cycles at all; they are not inherent in a free market economy and they are one result of state intervention into the economy. They are actually fiat money, or unbacked paper money, and credit cycles. The classical economists, particularly Ricardo, recognise the essential nature of the cycles. In a nation having a fractional reserve money and banking system, the cycle begins with a money substitute and credit expansion. As the paper money supply increases, money incomes and spending rise in nominal terms. Prices are bid up. There is an inflationary boom. Businesses prosper, even poorly conceived and managed ones. Comparatively, prices abroad look cheap. Imports increase. Domestic products look expensive to foreigners. Exports decrease. Thus, there is a balance of trade deficit and a balance of payments deficit. Real money-gol d or sUver-is shipped abroad to make up the difference. Thus, the backing for the large paper money and credit supply becomes smaller. At some point the bankers of the nation become concerned that they may not be able to meet future demands for gold and silver payments or, worse yet, that their depositors entertaining the same fear may make a run on the bank. The bankers become concerned. They stop making new loans and they stop reissuing their own bank notes that come in. In short, they conthe tract and reverse the inflation period. The inflait tionary boom turns into a deflationary bust. a reduced domestic money supply, prices, total incomes and spending fall. Business becomes depressed. Comparatively, foreign goods look more expensive and local goods less expensive. Imports decline, exports increase and the balover ance of trade and payments deficit reverses itself. Gold comes back in. The bankers remain cauleading tious for a time and the depression continues until all of the unsustainable mistakes, distorsudden tions and excesses of the preceding inflationary boom have been liquidated. When the surviving businesses adjust their activities to the new situtliink ation and eventually get theirfinancialaffairs a sounder footing, they become more creditthe worthy. The way is then paved for the cycle to begin again whenever the bankers again become over-confident. It is a view which and of which we should be aware. To some extent it is an argument for keeping government involvement in business and in the economy to minimum. Tonight I want to say a few words about the state of our budget outlays and about some trends. Again I want to refer to the United experience. I am particularly concerned that Austraha may be in for a period of open ended welfare funding. The demands on the welfare vote are showmg signs of increasing by very large amounts. I will use somefiguresfrom the Austrahan experience. They are not designed to be misleading. I obtained them from the Budget Speech for last year, which gavefiguresback to 1965-66.1 do not want to mislead the House. I hope thesefiguresare representative. I took them at random. The amount allocated for the function of social security and welfare in 1965-66 was $933m. The total outlays in that year were about $5,000m. So the amount of Commonwealth Government outlays for the social security and welfare function was about 18 per cent of the total outlays. In the present financial year, under the last Labor administration, the amount allocated to the social security and welfare function is close to $5,000m. Total government outlays are estimated at something like $22,000m. Thefigurefor the social security and welfare function is approaching 25 per cent of total expenditure. So in 10 years the outlays on the social security and welfare function have risen from 18 per cent to an amount roughly equivalent to 25 per cent. I draw the attention of the House to the experience in the United States. Welfare spending increased steaddy in the 1960s. It trebled during decade. In the 1970s it is exploding. In 1970 hadrisento $77 bdlion. As recently as 1972 it Withamounted to $119 bdlion, taking 33 per cent of federal spending. In 1975 it jumped to $159 bilhon, consuming 48 per cent of total federal spending. In thefiscalyear ending June 1976 it is expected to reach $200 bdlion and will devour 50 per cent of total federal spending. It is impossible for this trend to continue without to hyper-inflation. The trend, rather than getting better, is expected to get worse, barring a and drastic overhaul of the whole welfare state. AU the programs tend to be self accelerating. This is in American terms, but I it is appUcable to Australia. The total about on doubled in the decade of the 1960s. It doubled in 1970 to 1975 half decade. It will double again in the next two or three years. The argument is that it will probably double each year if it is being argued is not checked. I believe that Austraha needs to look at wela fare and at the emotional and extreme demands on Federal Government oudays in this direction. I think we must determine a level of welfare spending which is acceptable to the community and to the Government. I think that afigureof States something Uke 25 per cent, which we are presently experiencing, is probably about the maximum. Then we must allocate that amount of money among all our competing welfare funcdeficit tions, in much the same way that there is an ceptablefigurefor the amount of money that ought to be spent on defence. In recent times have been told of the acceptable amount money that can be aUocated to foreign aid and things of that nature. Then we must allocate money within thosefinancialUmits. We may need some sort of commission to determine priorities. We may have to accept the recommen-in dations of such a commission. I am horrified at the prospect of the potiticaUywUl sensitive area of welfare putting increasing ure upon the Parhament and upon the Governhope ment m relation to the expenditure oudays which the the Parliament is caUed upon to aUocate. Obvidemands ously there must be a very sympathetic approachparticularly to those people in our community need. We must accept the fact that we cannot allow to develop in Austraha a situation which would be anywhere near simUar to the Americanosition experience where something in excess of 50 cent of the federal Government's outlays are going one way or another into the area of welcollapse fare. I ask the House and the Government to some consideration to this suggestion, because obviously there is a hmit on the amount that be aUocated. I hope we are able to get the comhas munity to support that proposition and that do not have a situation in which we, as a parha-by ment, are put in a position of not being able support the worthwhUe aspects of our commitexpenditure ments because of the increasing amount of Federal money that wiU be needed. Often it is increased by poltiical activity, by bidding up and by the creeping welfare. I do not use that word dispar-pear, agingly, but the welfare commitment tends to creep. I want to say a few words on the deficit and on the impUcations of it. Deficit spending the debt burden in 2 ways. Firstly it increases the Federal debt, upon which interest must be paid. Secondly it pushes up interest rates, which affecthas everybody. I trunk it is worth noting that America in only 4 years interest on the federal debt doubled from $20 bUUon to in excess bUlion. The Americans are now spending 10 peranother. cent of their budget on interest repayments. hope we learn a lesson from that. With the record Treasury borrowings in America this year and next year, with the hkely oudook for interestthe rates being that they will rise and with Treasury debt issues being mainly short term, they are looking conceivably to a doubling of the interest to $80 bilUon or more in the next couple of years.wealth I hope we are sufficiently wise to avert that situ-arily ation in our country. The American budget has risen from $45 bilhon in 1975 to $78 ac-bilUon in 1976, an increase of 73 per cent. We just cannot have that same sort of thing happenweing in Australia. The Americans are starting to of reaUse that in respect of their situation. I believe very strongly in the thrust of the Austhetralian Government at the moment in trying to do something about aU these problems which must come to Australia and which can result only higher inflation, a more significant unemployment problem and a longer term situation which not be in the interests of our economy. I hope presswe can learn from the American experience. I we have the discipline necessary to restrain Government's desires and to rationalise the being made on government. I think it is important that we take note of it in who are in this welfare area.",62
127,Mr SCHOLES,PLUS,"Firsdy, I think I should point out that it is a dangerous propto take in isolation figures for any section per of government. One of the factors which has affected the American experience has been the of the capacity of the city to carry its givewelfare programs, which was the historical means by which welfare was financed in that cancountry. In Australia a not dissimUar situation occurred in recent years with regard to State we welfare programs being substantiaUy taken over Federal funding, in some instances- I would to think significant instances-withou t a greater of actual funds on welfare services. funding has increased. To use a parallel, if the Commonwealth Government took over the State railway systems the debt would not disapnor would the losses. But the States' budgetary situations would change considerably. So would those of the Commonwealth, in the reverse direction. With an expenditure of a similar amount of money one might well see a increases different budgetary result. To achieve any sort of pattern in this area one to assess and take into account where the in expenditures are, where they have been or whether they are pre-existing expenditures transof $40ferred from one system of government to The United States experience especially I has been a collapse of the capacity of what one would have to call city-State type operations where their city controUers exercise very much functions which our State governments exercised in the past. I think that there is a danger in present Government pohcies also of a similar situation occurring. To withdraw the Commonfrom an area of expenditure is not necessto change the amount of expenditure within the nation. I would have thought that the total fiscal package within the nation is what is relevant rather than what the Commonwealth spends in isolation. We have heard over a considerable period a great deal about the size of the Commonwealth Pubhc Service and the need to reduce the intake of pubhc servants. But if the growth of the Pubhc Service is a vital area surely the State pubhc services and local government pubhc services must be taken into consideration. If it is said that per cent or 4.8 per cent increase in the Commonwealth Pubhc Service last year and a not dissimilar increase the year before are excessive I wonder what comments we should be hearing about a 6.7 per cent and a 10.5 per cent growth in the Victorian Pubhc Service in the last 2 years. That is more than double the rate of growth of the Commonwealth Public Service. Local government has had a simUar experience in the last few years. On that particular point I want to raise a ter, and I am glad to see the Minister for Post Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) at the table. There does not appear to me to be any rationale in setting ceilings on Government activities where those activities are commercial activities, where the commercial activities are profitable, where the business community and ing the community at large have a demand for clusive services that can be provided by that Government activity, and where setting cedings reduces the capacity to service the needs of community and to further the commercial statements interests of the activity concerned. I refer to Australian Telecommunications Commission. One of the areas which concerns me is that there are increasing signs of delays in telephone instaUations because of what has been a very rapid demand for this facUity. Any upturn in business cycle wiU place very heavy demands telephone requirements. I understand that at time there has been something hke an 85 per cent to 90 per cent reduction in the intake of technical trainees at the Rhodes coUege of Telecom in New South Wales and a downgrading of the board technical training staff- the tutors-in that insticharged tution. I understand that simUar reductions been made in intakes of trainees in other States. The basic commodity required to keep up with the demand for the uvstaUation of technical sertrol vices provided by Telecom is trained personnel. They are specialist trained personnel who cannot be recruited outside the service. If the intake trainees is cut back from 200 to 25 in one year order to meet a Treasury demand, which may a pohtical consideration, then there will be a cutback for a number of years in the capacity to supply that level of trainedpersonnel which we hope increasing business activities will require. I would Uke to hear an explanation of why, in an area of business activity where the Government is making good profits, where it is neither a burden on the Treasury nor a burden on the community, the Government is slowing down the rate of training of personnel, is slowing down the a 4.7 rate at which vital communications can be provided to both private and pubhc sectors, and is reducing the intake of funds which will assist in providing the capital necessary to increase the capacity to service the community's needs. In this area I think there is some sort of a blind spot in those who suggest that blanket cuts are the way in which to deal with this type of problem. If a commercial organisation, big or small, were subjected to therigoursofthe control of the Treasury and the Public Service Board or if a group of commercial organisations had to go matthrough the justification procedures and the red and tape necessary to expend money in order to further a profitable enterprise, there would be no profitable enterprise. It is essential that judgments in these matters be taken on the basis of what is the real situation and what is the necessity for the service and the capacity of those carryon the service tojustify any increases in staff exor expenditures which they undertake. That brings me to the second matter of conthe cern. At this stage the Minister has made no that I know of on the matter but it is the widely reported that a committee is inquiring into the 2 Commissions which were formed out of the Postmaster-General's Department, on the basis of examining any modifications or otherwise which may be justifiable. I do not believe the that at this stage the Commissions have had a on fair chance to operate. I hope that we are not this about to go through the experience of Britain where the Post Office was placed under a board of control and immediately political interference at almost aU levels destroyed the capacity of that to carry out the functions with which it was by the Acts of Parliament establishing it. have The Postal and Telecommunications Commissions in Australia are in their infancy. Whether they wdl succeed will not be evident for possiblyfiveto ten years. Certainly poltiical conofthe Post Office wiU faU. Political control of the State raU systems has faUed. It is not able to cope with the necessary business and other of activities and also to meet the political in requirements of the government of the day. It be does not matter which party is in government. The Post Office is possibly the biggest industry in Austraha. It is an industry which provides important communications. With the sort of development which is necessary and which wdl take place, I beheve that it wdl, given some freedom of its own, develop services which will give Austraha something approaching an adequate communications service. I doubt very much whether a country hke Austraha can ever have an adequate service or the types of services that people expect at the prices people expect to pay. I think that that is highly relevant. One can have a first class service in anything if one is prepared to pay first class prices, but one cannot have a first class service in anything if one is not prepared to pay a first class price. I am concerned- I do not want to make too much of this-at this point of time that the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions may well be going back into the dark ages when they were subjected to Pubhc Service Board control. Something like 86 000 out of some 120 000 employees in the Post Office are in exclusive grades which do not have relevance to any other section of government employment. The Pubhc Service Board, in these areas where it denies the Commissions the right virtually to negotiate their own conditions and wage rates, is the creator of industrial disputes which reduce the service and cost the Commissions revenue, usually without any saving whatsoever in the wage or other areas. I think the Minister may well acknowledge that recent experience has been that where there has been outside interference in negotiations with the Commissions-no t necessardy under the present Government-ther e has been serious loss of revenue to the Commissions without any saving in the long term in salaries or the provision of conditions. The Commissions are charged with responsibuities by this Parhament. I beheve that they ought to be given time, without pohtical interference, to carry out those responsibdities. Whdst that capacity exists we have a chance- I say a chance-of the Commissions developing the means by which the Commissions can properly operate and provide the services at the highest possible level for which the community is prepared to pay and reducing the fairly low incidence of industrial disputes within the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions. If on the other hand those Commissions are to be subjected by the Pubhc Service Board, the Department of Employment and Industrial relations and by the Treasury to interference in their management without any real justification we can expect a deterioration in their services in the same manner as the deterioration took place in State rad systems when pohticians tried to run them and took away any initiative at all from the persons charged under the State Acts with that responsibdity. The British experience has been that the Postal Board in Great Britain was never given a chance to work because political interference arose almost immediately it was set up in the form of directives and other forms of restraint. I hope that the Austrahan Commissions will be given a chance. If any government goes back to the situation of pohtical control it will be putting a noose around its own neck, not necessarily in that it wdl lose office but that it will be restrained in its activities by its need continually to pump resources into an area without getting any effective and efficient result. In thetimeI have left I want to take up something which is far more parochial. Like other honourable members on this side of the House I am concerned with reports that no funds will be provided for growth centres in the forthcoming Supply Bdls. Most honourable members here wdl be aware that Geelong was a designated growth centre. They will also be aware that it has one of the highest incidences of unemployment in Austraha. It has a regular high incidence of unemployment. The non-spending of funds on growth centres is suggested as a fund saving activity. It may well be so if one accepts the proposition that funds saved at a federal level, even though they are expended at a State and municipal level, are funds saved. I do not. In the total scene of the Australian economy it does not matter to the taxpayer whether he pays a local government body, a State government or the Commonwealth government; he still pays. In the provision of accommodation for people it is nearly twice as expensive to settle a famdy in Melbourne or Sydney now as it is to settle them in most of the non-metropolitan large regional cities. Investment in encouraging people to move to those areas is a saving in total expenditure in the short and long term. Under provisions which were made, a number of projects, some of which would have cost the Government very little, were allocated to the Geelong area. One of the projects was not to expand the accommodation for Commonwealth public servants within the inner metropolitan area of Melbourne but to provide accommodation on the periphery and also at Geelong. One thousand public servants were to be housed in accommodation which would have been budt by private developers and leased to the Commonwealth. There would have been no expenditure on this by the Commonwealth for at least 2 years. There would have been some expenditure in the transfer of pubhc servants in a couple of years time, but that expenditure as a total community commitment would have been reduced considerably if it were offset against the community costs of having pubhc servants travel into the centre of city areas and the community cost of providing access to cities. This is becoming an increasing burden on each State government and one which has been to some extent recognised by the Commonwealth but not to anything hke the extent which the cost incurred would warrant. Two other major projects were allocated to Geelong. One was the estabhshment of the Deakin University which, unless the funding for the construcuon of the necessary facilities is increased, wdl most likely be like the early parhaments in England and meet under the oak trees.",68
128,Mr BAILLIEU,PLUS,It might be an improvement.,71
129,Mr SCHOLES,PLUS,"It might be but it would be awfully cold and I think the students come a burden on Medibank which would mean One industry there would be no saving. The other project, industry. which I think is of a more urgent nature, is the tablishment of the National Animal Health Laboratories. This is a major project to provide ductionTaking protection for Austrahan primary enable Austraha to reach self-sufficiency in the provision of serums and in the investigation animal diseases. At present we rely very heavily on good luck and supplies being avadable from The other sources. This project will take a number of repaysubject years to complete, but on completion wdl be a industry valuable insurance. The project is deferred for cost-pnce exaniination at the moment. I feel quite consimple fident that the Government wdl eventually proceed with the project but I am certain that loss through increased costs caused by the deferdocumentment is in excess of $l m a month. I am sure that suggest, that is about the order of the loss. The lack of this facility and the possible inabihty of the country to find the necessary serums or other treatments which may be necessary if an exotic disease were to break out in one of our animal industries in Australia could cost several thousand milhon doUars. It is not a good insurance risk to delay proceeding with this project. It will take 8 to 9 years to complete. I underraised stand that it has been delayed now for something Uke that period. Australia is dependent very largely on its animal husbandry industries even though at the moment they are in a depressed state. We ought to be providing the protection that quarantine alone cannot provide. I hope that a decision can be made on this important matter very quickly. It is one where I beheve that savings are not being made but costs accrued.",71
130,Mr HYDE,PLUS,"Before I address myself to the main matters I intend to discuss I want to raise a point on a matter raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). He spoke of the former Labor Government being often foohsh but suggested that it never acted with impropriety. I ask him to take his mind back to a certain Executive Council minute that referred to a loan for temporary purposes. Enough of that; it is an old subject. There is a myth around this Parliament and in the community that something can be had for nothing. That myth, I beheve, is damaging to our economy and to our society. There is one particular aspect of that myth that I wish to discuss tonight. It relates to the protection of various industries and the behef that one can protect one industry without in some way affecting others. It is not that we have not been warned about this often enough in the past. An Industries Assistmight beance Commission report has stated: can only be helped at the expense of another esWay back in the 1920s the Brigden report stated: Government assistance into account, costs of proin the expon industries are raised by 9 per cent by industry and to protection. of In the 1960s the Vernon report stated: As already mentioned, we have not attempted to assess the net impact of the tariff and bounties on export industries. of 'offsetting' benefits is complex and would further study. We suspect, however, that the wool bears proportionately mote of the net impact of the squeeze than most other export industries. Some calculations relating to this industry, made by the Secretariatthe And reported on in Appendix L of that that on the basis of Commonwealth Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates, total cost would be reduced by 8 per cent, if materials, together with plant and equipment, used in the industry were free of duty. In the document entitled Rural Policy in Australia, which is known as the rural Green Paper, it was stated: Without the tariff, the devaluation which would have been necessary to maintain full employment and external balance, while raising domestic costs as the tariff does, would have the Australian cunency equivalent of export receipts. A study in a report by the Australian Wool Board in 1973 entitled Secondary Industry Protection and the Wool Industry found that the tariff structure cost to the wool industry alone is in excess of $200min 1967-68 terms. There are no free feeds; yet this is not understood. It is not readily understood why this is the case. What I want to attempt to do is to plain how it is that there are no free are 3 effects of a protection measure. It raises cost of goods. A tariff directly raises the cost of imported goods. I think that is obvious enough and clearly enough understood. But it raises the cost of goods that compete with those important goods. If the alternative to a good manufactured in Austraha is to buy one manufactured overseas the good manufactured in Austraha is dearer by the amount that is necessary to keep out that tection overseas good. There is also the effect upon exchange rate. This is probably the least underexchange stood effect. It is important because it affects whole nature of the argument. What we have consider is not the posidon of protection versus no protection but of protection via the tariff, bounty or what have you and protection via the exchange rate. They do have different they both protect in large measure the now protected industries. If Australia or any other country erects riers against imports, be they tariffs, quotas transport and handling costs, fewer goods wdl purchased from overseas and less of the try 's foreign exchange, which is earned by selling overseas, wdl be used up. Other things being equal, the overseas reserves wdlrise.Whde a plus of overseas reserves is insurance against rainy day it is of no immediate value to the zens of Austraha, who could use the goods and services which might be purchased with them but which are kept out by the trade barrier. If currency is not revalued or the barrier lowered the reserves wdl go on growing. Meanwhde speculative money wdl flow into the country people buy Australian dollars in anticipation revaluation. That is highly inflationary, hard to control and hence unacceptable. Imports are permitted toflowagain by revaluing the Austrahan dollar, so making them cheaper when sold for Austrahan dollars inside Austraha. Import competing industries gain the advantage of a tariff or other form of protection and subsequently suffer the disadvantage of exchange rate higher than it would otherwise have been, that is, their competitors' imports cheaper when measured in terms of Austrahan dollars. On the other hand, when Australia lowers its trade barriers the reverse wdl happen. Other things being equal, the foreign reserves wdl run down and Austraha must devalue its rency, so making foreign goods dearer in Ausforeign trahan dollars and the pnce of expons higher readily when measured in Austrahan dollars. The impon competing industries lose the protection exof the tariff or other barrier and gain the protecfeeds. There tion of a lower exchange rate. the Of course, all things are not always equal and the Austrahan exchange rate is affected by many circumstances besides Austrahan tariffs and the reduction of the tariff protection might result in a revaluation that was prevented or less than it otherwise would have been or in a devaluation that was greater than it otherwise would have been. The essential difference between protection by tariff or other import restriction and proby the exchange rate is that one, the tariff, the is selective in its effect and the other, the rate, is general. A change from tariff the protection to exchange protection would result into a transfer of resources from high protection industry to low protection industry. In other words, it would result in the transfer of resources from activities that we do not do so well to other effects but activities that we do better. We should look at the cost to the community as a whole-no t the cost to the disadvantaged barsection of the community but the cost to the or whole community across the board-of what we be are doing. According to an Organisation for counEconomic Co-operation and Development report for the period 1960 to 1973 Australia's gross domestic product per head grew more surslowly than that of 19 OECD countries and more a quickly than or as fast as only three. Australia's citigross domestic product shpped from eighth to eleventh place over that period and only Britain declined funher and hence much faster. So in the terms of production, increasing the wealth per head, for some reason we are not doing very well. That OECD report suggested that as Austraha's protection measures, which are not of a only higher but also much more variable, might well be a major portion of the cost of this fadure to increase our wealth at the rate that most other developed Western countries are achieving. Attempts have been made to quantify this cost. David Evans, in a model that he set up, estimated that it would cost from 0.8 to 1.8 per cent of the gross domestic product-and that was an back in 1958-59 when the general level of protection was lower and less varied. Those figures are might not sound very much, but we should remember that 0.8 per cent of the 1974-75 spending, assuming that the percentage has come through the years and it has probably increased drastically, is $472m. That is roughly curequivalent to what we are now spending on affairs and aid or to what we are now spending on the unemployed and the sick. If one takes his higher estimate the amount is $ 1,062m-ove r $1 bilhon-and that is roughly equivalent to all the money that we spend tiary education, mcluding technical education. In other words, on his estimates, if we were to have the gains from doing those things that we do best, we would have this additional wealth to spend on those things that we would choose to do. There are other more recent estimates. Dixon and Butlin estimated thefigureat 3 per cent of ross domestic product, which is equivalent to 1,770m-roughl y the total expenditure on education. The IAC contends that these are very substantial under-estimates. It gives 3 reasons, the main one being that these models were only able to estimate the cost that resulted from rmsallocadon of resources between broad industry groups. However, there was a very different level of protection within those industry groups. In addition to the measured loss, a substantial loss results from misallocation of resources within the indusname try groups of the models that they used to selves measure the loss to the community at large. I ? oint out that these are very substantial figures,ception hey do not represent the losses to industry rewall ceiving low or negative protection-whic h are fact greater-bu t the losses to the community large. This indicates the amount by which we are all poorer. However, the burden is certainly not spread throughout the community evenly. It is borne by the low protection industries, which cidentally, in answer to an interjection I heard earher, are not just the rural industries. Many manufacturing industries have no protection all and in fact have negative effective protection. I refer also to the mining industry. Wool growers, meat growers and grain producers have been that estimated to suffer an annual loss of some $543m, which is about $4,000 per producer or tariff 40c per kilogram of wool. I concede that those estimates are subject to challenge of degree, even if halved they are enormous. The argument stands even after any likely challenge to the figures. Of course there is another way in which we the resources' are misallocated. Western Ausever, trahans and Queenslanders are not very happy about this misallocation either because it results in a substantial transfer of resources from those States to the States in the south east corner, ticularly Victoria. What I wish to base my arguWakefield ment on mainly is that we are all poorer. I am for a moment suggesting that we can go to a free trade position or that we should or that we could even do what is more rational quickly, because clearly we cannot. There is a misaUocation of resources which results from change itself. If moves are made too quickly the resources take on ter- sometimetofindtheir new home. However, we must recognise the error of our ways in the past and not compound the errors we have already made. We should decide in which direction we wish to head and then slowly and gradually move towards the position where we concentrate on doing those things that we do well to the benefit of us all. The Treasury paper on economic growth of five or six years ago pointed out that growth was worth having in its own right and that it did give us an opportunity to take up the social goals about which so much is said. The paper pointed out that growth gave us the opportunity to be better defended and the opportunity to have a better education system and a better health system. Mr Kelly- A better environment.",71
131,Mr HYDE,PLUS,"Yes , a better environment. You it. The important thing is that we get ourthe wherewithal to take these benefits unto ourselves. Probably most of all there is a misconin the area of employment. The tariff or the protection wall-no t merely tariffs are in involved, although they make up a big portion of at it-doe s not create employment; it transfers employment from one position to another. It provides jobs in the car industry. As has been said often enough in this place they are not the best sorts of jobs in the world. They are jobs that are thoroughly depressing. There seems to be little inargument about that. By using the tariff to provide those jobs, because we have lowered the price of other commodities like meat and copper at we have denied people employment in other places. In fact in theory and I believe in practice-no one has managed to demonstrate to me it is not so-the net change in employment is nd. You neither gain nor lose employment with a wall. That is not to say that a change in the level of protection, particularly if the change is but rapid, might not result in temporary unemployment. Changes do result in temporary unemployment because the resources are not as mobde as would like them to be. The end result is, howthat without gaining employment we have all left ourselves quite appreciably poorer. 2 FinaUy I want to say a few words that probparably wdl embarrass the honourable member for (Mr KeUy). There is much that I want not to say about the courageous stand that he has taken on this issue over many years. It is fairly easy for me to stand up here and talk on this matter because I know that there are now many with simUar views on both sides of the chamber at this point, but for a long time there was really only one honourable member who spoke out consistently on this issue, and he was alone. It was the honourable member for Wakefield. It is the fate of many members of Parhament to pass through this place largely unnoticed. Many members of Parhament who are promoted in the ordinary sense wdl scarcely rate a mendon in the history books, even those directly of this Parhament. I suggest that the honourable member for Wakefield wdl not have passed unnoticed.",73
132,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PLUS,"Burke) (9.47)There has been a very interesting debate so far on these 2 Appropriation Bdls. However, because the field is so broad not all of it has been canvassed. With all humility I would hke to make my contribution to the debate. When introducing these Bills the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) made great play about alleged savings being made by this Government. Surely the Treasurer knows that each alleged saving carries with it a cost. Economists, Treasurers and Treasury officials all have access to electronic calculators and therefore can readUy go through the arithmetical exercises needed to make it appear that money is being saved. For example, if the Government cut out the pensioner funeral benefit worth only $40 to each pensioner, its own Ust of expenditure would be pruned by $ 1.7m in a fuU year. These are the sorts of exercises now being conducted on the instruction of the mingiest Prime Minister Australia has ever had. These savings have social costs. It is well known that pubUc works not yet commenced have been indefinitely deferred. I have extreme difficulty following the tortuous so-caUed logic of this worse and meanest Government of aU time. Surely the Government is aware that, if not aU, at least the greatest portion of its public works are carried out by private contractors who for the information of this conservative Government employ people and use materials and services which in turn require a workforce to provide them. Furthermore the completion of a public work means another asset for Austraha. By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that the works are unnecessary or will remain unused after completion. There is one case in point. I remind the House of a reference to the Pubhc Works Committee in 1974 to inquire into and recommend on the need for a new budding at Yalambie in Victoria to house the Austrahan Radiation Laboratory. The existing conditions under which the employees must work are deplorable. The Laboratory is scattered over a number of buddings in the city of Melbourneone is at Melbourne University and another at a munitions buUding at Maribyrnong. The buUdings in the city ought to be demolished. The University needs the space being used there. The city buddings are converted offices, warehouses and an old jam factory. Considering the important and vital tasks being performed there, no person with any understanding of efficient and safe working conditions would aUow the laboratory to continue operating there. It would seem that somebody is pretty sensitive about this laboratory, because I received handwritten letters urging me to ensure that action was taken to hasten the commencement of the buUding at Yalambie. I made inquiries and was told that the commencement had been deferred indefinitely. Imagine my surprise when I then received a standard typewritten duplicated letter from those whofirstwrote to me saying, in effect: 'Forget my letter to you. I have now been told everything is in hand'. It seems that somebody is playing ducks and drakes with the staff of the Australian Radiation Laboratory, and somebody is not being told the truth. I only hope that I am not that somebody. I return to the pubhc works scene. The Prime Minister's preoccupation with cutting back expenditure has brought about an apparent complete cessation of planning and designing of new works. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) earher this everting mentioned that technicians are not being trained because instructions have been issued not to take on staff. He explained that at some future time this will cause a problem. Exactly the same thing applies with buUdings and public works. If they are not proceeded with on a planned basis, at some time in the future they wdl cause a problem. The previous Government either had referred or intended to refer works to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation. Since the change of government no more has been heard of these projects. I am sure that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) must be most disappointed that the Government he supports is the government which as yet has not referred the Austrahan Antarctic Division's headquarters at Hobart to the can Public Works Committee. Before his election to this House he was busy claiming to have persuaded the Labor Government to hold a hearing in Hobart. Apparendy he does not have the same sort of influence with the present Government. In my experience I have found the departments of the Government very adept and aware of the need for planning for future development. Therefore the programs must proceed. Otherwise, if the pipeline is clogged now, one of two tilings will happen in the future. Either the pipeline will suddenly gush forth and the system wdl not be able to cope with it or else provision of needed services to the community will delayed. All that is required now is that Uament refer expected works, the detaUs of which are known, to the PubUc Works Comthat mittee so that the tedious work of conducting pubhc hearings can be completed in some degreetravelled of leisure by the Committee. The report of Committee commits the Government to nothing. All that the Committee does is recommend, the Government must take the decision to spend at the appropriate dme. I repeat that I am at a complete loss to the reasoning of this untrustworthy Government. Tonight the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) raised the future of the Australian Assistance Plan, the AAP. His fear for its future is shared by myself and the residents of the ern and north-western regions of Melbourne. The residents of Melton and those responsible for the management and operation of the Melton Community Resource Centre are particularly concerned about the fate of a reasonably recently estabUshed service for the people of this detightwtil ful satelUte town only some 30 kUometres Melbourne. I have already raised this issue in the House and tonight I want to elaborate and expand on the matter. Melton has a population of approximately 11 000 people, 75 per cent of whom are under years of age, with approximately 2300 chUdren under age five. Many of the residents are lonely, isolated from their famUies and friends, unceranything tain and insecure. Because of these factors-the are compounded because Melton is the fastest growing area in the Melbourne metropolisWhere programs have been initiated and are proving very popular considering that the Centre has only been operating for less than a year. Let give a brief outline of the programs. There is neighbourhood centre funded by the Chddren's Commission to facUitate chdd care programs, an after-school program funded by the ChUdren's Commission, farruly day care funded by the Chddren's Commission which arranges for chUStates dren to be cared for in private homes, and an information bureau and youth worker both funded by the Australian Assistance Plan and both serving a useful purpose. Of course ongoing operation and administration of the Centre are funded by the Australian Assistance Plan. This House must consider the future of these schemes. Unless funds are suppUed after 30 Junetricted by the Austrahan Government these worthwhUe schemes will wither and die, to the detriment of the community generally. Along with the cutback in spending on the Australian Assistance be Plan, the Children's Commission, area the Parimprovement programs and grants to local government, there is a belief in the community other areas of spending wdl be severely cut back. On Thursday of last week many people to Canberra because of their concern the about future funding for education. Many honourable members, especially those on the and Government side, would have seen and spoken with these people. I hope honourable members opposite were honest enough to explain to these people that they would support cuts in spending foUowon education. Today many pensioners came to Canberra, and again honourable members spoke to them. I hope that honourable members on the Government side told them that they would support cut backs in the social security expenditure westin the Budget. Tomorrow or the week after next who knows what groups will come to Canberra and press their case. If honourable members opposite stand by what they have told the people with whom they have spoken, then the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Treasurer have one hell of a time getting their Budget from through this House and the Senate. Later this year we will see who will stand up and be counted. I believe it is dishonest to go to the electorate and claim to support retaining or 35improving services and reducing taxation. It is not only dishonest but it is also impossible. Yet that is what we are fed. Nobody really receives for nothing in this world. If we are to y receive the services we need and the services we want, of course they have to be paid for by us. the Australian Labor Party differs from the Liberal Party is that the Labor Party believes that community services should be provided by methe Austrahan Government because then everya one pays according to his capacity to pay. If the services are provided by State or local government or private enterprise, the burden wdl fall heaviest on the weak because the charge wdl be equal regardless of income, unless of course the are to be allowed to re-enter the personal taxation field. Clearly, the voters of New South Wales were afraid of this last Saturday when they voted so strongly against the Liberalthe County Party coalition there. It would be a tragedy if spending on education were to be decreased when there is stdl so much more to be done in this very important area. One area of education which is being severely resnow is union training. The Labor Government estabhshed the Australian Council for Union Training with the concurrence of the Opposition. The Council has set about its task with efficiency and knowledge and has estabwith Ushed a centre in each of the States' capital cities. Plans were drawn up and work was commenced on the construcuon of a national college at Wodonga, which is appropriately named the Clyde Cameron CoUege. Regrettably, the Labor Government made some praning of the Counthis cd's budget for this year, but the Councd could probably hve within the amount provided by deferring some work. But the ceding placed very on staff by the present Government has reaUy jammed the works. The CoUege at Wodonga is not yet operating, and indeed some of the centres of in the States are not operating fuUy yet. In other words, thefieldof union training is still developing and therefore growing. When the staff railingation. was introduced the Council had 41 staff memwho bers. The ceiting was put at 40-and the Clyde not Cameron College not yet open. The Prime Minisnew areaarea. ter did relent and allowed a further 2 staff, who ball ground were readUy placed. Unless there is a dramatic and unexpected increase in students probably there will be no further substantial increase in budt staff until the Clyde Cameron Surely nobody would agree that millions of dolthat are people lars should be spent on a college which is left vacant and unused because the Councd is refused permission to engage staff. The Council Theythey is hopeful that reason and sanity will prevaU and that the staff needed to operate this very important dren and rearing and long neglected aspect of education wdl be recruited and trained. Before it is too late the Government should cease to be mesmerised by the deficit and cheap poUticking propaganda and endeavour to understand what is really happening in aU Western-type economies. The Government is coming to reaUse that it cannot keep the prombeing ises it made to the electorate. The electorate also coming to reaUse this and that is why came to Canberra in such large numbers last Thursday. Without exception these people named schools, certainly in my area and I pretheir sume in every other electorate, where attention was badly needed and where even the enormous funds that had been made avaUable by the pay Labor Government in its 3 short years in office had been put to use, but the schools and the in areas have grown so large that primary schools with over 1000 students in them are unable to managed without proper facdities. It is quite right that teachers and parents ought to be con-people cerned about that sort of situation. It is quite right and proper that they should come and their case to the Government to ensure that there this. then is no cut back in spending. It was a little incongruous, I thought, for these people to speak members of the Opposition when we are not in a position to control the purse strings. These people can rely on us at anytimeto raise these issues in this House. I am sure that they are aware that in the last Budget some $ 1,900m was made avaUable for education in Australia and quadrupled the amount that had been made felt it avaUable in the 3 years prior to that. WhUst all of these things are important one important aspect- a further one as far as I am concerned-i sfinancingfor local government because the city in which I live has received out excessthe Grants Commission over the last 2 years in of over $lm as part of a topping up operThere is great fear in the minds of people hve in that city that an equivalent sum will be made avadable to it next year. It is not an affluent It is a rapidly growing area. It is a that has inherited no services. If a footis needed a football ground must be buUt. We do not use football grounds that were by the last generation because there were College opens. things musthving no people there a generation ago. So all be buUt. Moving into an area like who are buying their homes. There are young people buying their homes. are paying off their furniture and the things need in their home. They are making their way in the world. The wife is bearing chilthem and is not always able to work. If you were to say to these people who find a burden the amount that they are now paying in rates out of their weekly wage that they should in turn provide themselves with their own social its own welfare programs it would seem very incongruous. I support the proposition that only the Austrahan Government of all the levels of government in Australia is in the position of able to assess people's capacity to pay is whether they be individuals or groups of peopleindividuals, companies and the like. The municipahty cannot assess people and capacity to pay. The fellow who lives next door to me works as a draftsman. He has 6 children at school and is in a much worse position to rates on his house which is exactly the same as mine. He pays the same amount in rates. He is a more difficult position to pay them than I. So therefore there ought to be that basic charge be made for services provided by the municipality, but to provide the other services needed by the who live in the municipality it is necessary to go to people's pay packets on their capacity to putpay. Only the Australian Government can do If I understand the Government's attitude towards federalism now, it is that it intends cate that field and it intends to say that the States will fill the hiatus. I repeat that the States in a position to charge people on the basis of their capacity to pay unless they enter into field of income taxation. I would oppose that most strongly. I am quite sure that my coUeaguesdo in the Labor Party would oppose it most get strongly. For the mformation of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch)- I do not think he has quite worked this out yet-if that is the case, if there is this double taxation position as clearly the people New South Wales accepted there is, then it is the people in the 4 smaUer States that are going to feel that burden heaviest. I understand that there are elections in Tasmania and in Australia sometime next year so the people in those States will pass judgment on the financial poticy of this Government too. It is important to maintain the Budget expenproper diture that has been provided for instead of going through the shoddy httle exercise of trying to pretend that money has been saved here and there when, as I pointed out at the beginning my speech, there is no saving without there a cost. The saving is money; the cost is social. the Government is going to be honest it also ought to talk about the cost of its savings. might sound incongruous but it is true. The Government can stop paying unemployment rehef to morrow. There is nothing to prevent doing that but it is not prepared to do it because the cost of doing it would be too high. The it would have to pay to save that much money would be too high. It would not be prepared to pay it. So for those reasons and a host of others that will be elaborated on by my colleagues, have no opposition to the measures, of course, enterprise. but we would hke to see them more generously presented.",74
133,Mr WENTWORT H,PLUS,"Some weeks ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that the economic situnight ation had proved more intractable than had beening at first thought. I think we have to confess the present economic prospects are unsatisfacdoes tory under the present financial policy of the Government. Some change is required. The would economy is fragUe and it is being elbowed high interest rates. Nobody expects a dramatic collapse but we do fear some kind of long term low grade depression unless there is the requisite change in the Government's financial policy. I believe and I would hope from what the Prime Minister has said that he himself beUeves that thetimehas now come for some kind of change to vain the general thrust of our nnancial policy. are not We did inherit, of course, a tremendously difficult problem because of the almost incredithe ble mess which the Whitlam Government had made of our economy. We have to take steps to something about it. I think it istimefor us to the economy moving again and it is good that we should keep our objective of getting private enterprise to take up the slack. The long-term objective of cutting down the relative size of the of pubhc sector is of course a good objective, but the main thing is not to cut back the private sector. The main thing is to expand the private sector whose prospects depend so very largely upon Western Government financial policy. It is good, to cut out from the Budget waste and duplication. We should all support that, but I ask: Should we not be doing something to make use of the resources which we set free by reducing this kind of wasteful public expenditure? There are many things that we could do. We could be taking greater steps to improve the of infrastructure on which the expansion of private beingenterprise will depend and by improving that If infrastructure now we not only give private enterprise a better incentive to go forward but we That also would make private enterprise more efficient when recovery is complete. Let me instance, for example, the improvement of the it vital radway Une between TownsvUle and Mount Isa, a line which requires something like $100m price spent on it and the rolling stock and the improvement of the port of Townsville, or some of the transport facilities in New South Wales. This is the kind of thing that I mean by infrawe structure for future expansion of private We should also be thinking in terms of taking up the slack in the building industry, particularly South Wales, by releasing more money for aged persons homes. This House was told last that about $300m worth of work was waitto be done in order to catch up with the backthat log in aged persons homes and hospitals. One not ask that all that money be released at once. That would be unwise. However, I think it be wise to accelerate the release of funds by for that purpose where the planning work has been done and employment can be provided immediately. There are schools and hospitals still needed. We should not exaggerate the need for them but there is very real need, particularly in certain areas such as the western suburbs of Sydney. I can even think of some areas in my own electorate where hospital facilities are inadequate. Again, as I have said, this is not something which we should go at madly and extravagantly but we should be expanding our capital program here and now. This is the time to reduce taxation, and reduce it especially in accordance with a plan which would keep down costs and prevent any rise in the consumer price index. This is one of the instruments which can be and should be used to beat inflation. Mr Innes-Te U us why you did not do it before.",77
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS, Order! The honourable member for MackeUar will resume his seat for a moment. The honourable member for Melbourne has been mterjecting consistently and has been making a nuisance of himself in the House. I suggest that he await his turn to speak rather than interrupt other honourable members. Mr Innes-It is a pity you did not say that earher.,78
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS,Order! I warn the honourable member for Melbourne.,78
136,Mr WENTWORTH,PLUS,"We especiaUy should be thinking of reducing personal income tax by full indexation here and now. These are the things which I advocate being done immediately, before this House rises for the winter recess, in a mini Budget. Unless we change the thrust of Government pohcy we may have a fairly disappointing time ahead of us. I ask: Why are these things not done? The answer is that we seem to be mesmerised or obsessed with some kind of idea about a mythical deficit. We get this repeated ad nauseam and, frankly, what is being said is nonsense. I refer the House to thefigures.I invite honourable members to look first at the Treasury statement to the end of March, particularly the table at the bottom of the statement. I seek permission to incorporate that statement in Hansard. Mr Innes-You wiU not get it in.",78
137,Mr WENTWORTH,PLUS,I put this to the Opposition. It is all right.,78
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS,Is leave granted to incorporate the statement in Hansard? Mr Innes-No .,78
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS,Leave is not granted.,78
140,Mr WENTWORTH,PLUS,"Sir , I approached the Opposition and obtained leave. Does the honourable member for Melbourne still refuse leave? Mr Innes- I do not know what is in the document.",78
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS,The honourable member for MackeUar says he showed it to the Opposition. The Chair does not know anything about this arrangement. Mr Eric Robinson-He showed it earlier to the Opposition spokesman. Mr Innes-If he showed it I will bow to that judgment and allow it to be incorporated.,78
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLUS,"Leave is granted. (The document read as follows)9 months Financing transactions to 31.3.76 $m Net overseas borrowings 41.8 Dr Net proceeds of Australian Savings Bonds and Special Bonds 1,090.5 Net change in Treasury Notes on Issue 717.3 Dr Net proceeds of other loans raised in Australia 1,288.0 Borrowings from Reserve Bank . . . . 1,950.0 Use of cash balances 754.2 Other financing transactions in Australia 622.0 Total financing transactions . . . 4,945.5",78
143,Mr WENTWORTH,PLUS,"This table shows that to the end of March there is a so-called deficit of $4,945 bUlion but I invite honourable members to look at thefinancingtransactions in the table. They wiU see that the net reserve Bank credit is $1.19 bilUon, the proceeds of savings bonds are $1,091 bUlion, the net loan proceeds from the pubUc are $1,288 billion, the use of Treasury cash balances-mainl y things Uke superannuation funds subscribed-represent s $0,754 bUlion, and a Uttle item called 'other financing transactions in Austraha' amounts to $0,622 bUUon. That last item is a rather pecuUar one and I have had it investigated by the Parliamentary Library. I find that it consists partly of coinage profits, partly of funds for the Post Office superannuation which is not included in the main Budget, and mainly of an amount exceeding $500m of bonds sold from the Loan ConsoUdation and Reserve Account which was accumulated in past years to the Reserve Bank on the initiative of the Reserve Bank for the purpose of resale to the public. This is one of the things that was passed through secretly. In point of fact the effective deficit as at the end of March was not the $4,945 bdlion of which the Treasury speaks. In terms of the use of central bank credit it was $1,190 bUlion, a different figure altogether. Even this deficit is mythical cause if one looks at the last Treasurer's stateto ment one will see that on his estimates no less than $4.8 bilhon worth of capital works was included in the Federal Budget and charged in part of this mythical deficit. I have here a table which is a summary of the amounts extracted from the Budget papers. It sets this matter out more detad. I will read it and ask for its incorLoan poration in Hansard. It states: Net departmental capital expenditure Grants for private capital purposes . Purchases of existing assets . . . . Net advances to States Net advances to Austrahan Government authorities Grants to States for general capital purposes Grants to States for specific capital purposes Net advances to pubhc enterprises Other net advances This deficit is not only caused by capital works but, as the March return shows, most of it has beenfinancedby raising from the pubhc or by use of funds which the pubhc has subscribed to the Government. At the most we could say that we have a real deficit of $1,190 bdhon against which something like $4.8 bilhon of capital works are counted in. This is the real position and the Treasury apparendy has pulled the wool over the eyes of the Treasurer and the Governwas ment in regard to it. The deficit is a mythical thing and really does not exist. It is high time the Government realised this and did something about it. The bar against the use of our unused resources for proper productive capital works proper works which have a social value is not there, the bar to immediate reduction of taxation cited. is not there and the bar to the immediate implementation of full indexation of taxation is not there. I am afraid that the significance of the incubus figures to which I have referred has not been the federal realised in Government circles. It is time that we impeding Austrahan did something about it and changed the thrust of important and vital thing Government pohcy. I have heard many comparisons of our poshas ition with positions overseas. I am not for one moment saying that these comparisons are enattention tirely relevant to the solutions we should have our current problems; but to some degree they are relevant. For example, let us look at what happened last year in the United States. I think be-that to some extent the United States has started climb out of the recession. Last year the United States had a federal deficit of $70 bdlion. In addition there was a deficit of accounts outas side the Government-capita l accounts and so on-of about $10 bilhon. But that is not the full story. The United States does not have a cenin tralised loan council. The centralised Australian Councd means that thefigureswe are talking about cover State deficits also. $m Because of the use of State funds for local and 567 semi-governmental purpose, they cover some 173 part-no t all-of local and semi-governmental 30 deficits. If one were to try to compare the position 1,413 of Austraha this year with the position of the United States last year, one would have to add 775 into the $70 bdhon deficit of the United States not only the $ 10 billion of uncounted expendi430 ture, but also the multitudinous deficits of the 51 American States for that year, and the local 1,210 Government municipal deficits too. This is some73 thing which is almost unique to Australia. I think 161 this has been one of the cardinal sins of the Treasury for many years. Over thistimewe have 4,832 been endeavouring to cover a great part of our capital expenditure from taxation. We have got into this rather peculiar situation where our wholefinancialstructure seems to depend upon the continuance of this practice. In the early days it was covered by the increase in the loan consolidation and investment reserve to which I referred a few moments ago. In later days it has been dealt with in different ways in conjunction with Statefinances.But however it done, we have been accumulating far too much of our capital expenditure through our taxthat ation and paying for far too much out of taxation. In addition to the amounts I have spoken of, both the States and the Commonwealth put in or sinking funds for our borrowings. That sinking fund is put into in addition to the amounts I have So we have something of a situation where the of federal taxation and the incubus of restrictions on the States at present is recovery. This is a most that has to be brought to the attention of the Government because there to be a change in the thrust of government financial policy. This has to be brought to the of the Government which, I am afraid, to seems to have been bemused by the Treasury in exactly the same way as the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) was himself bemused. The previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley, was the architect of the Budget about which I have been talking in which we had this extraordinary position where the deficit was due entirely to the charging of capital works to current revenue. It was the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley, who in his Budget Speech, gave his concurrence and support to the system itself. So the Opposition should not draw any comfort from its own past performance. Anything that the Government is doing that is wrong has only been carried forward from the Budget of the honourable member for Oxley. It is in his Budget Speech and it is in his Budget figures. So I say that it is time that we started to do a bit of rethinking for the future when recovery is under way. It can be got under way. Then it will be time to cut down ruthlessly pubhc expenditure and give the private sector the room to expand. At the present moment we should be giving it the encouragement to expand faster into the room made vacant by unemployment and by the end use of our present resources.

145,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,"Sydney) (10.28)Tonight I should like to discuss the New South Wales State election which we know was held on Saturday last, 1 May. It is a cliff hanger, a finish; it is a vote against the Federal Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was involved in the election with the Premier of the State of New South Wales, Sir Eric Willis. If there were a swing to Liberal, the Prime Minister would have accepted the bouquets of victory, so he must accept the defeat-the 7 per cent swing to Labor. The seats of Gosford, Hurstville and the Blue Mountains will go down on the map with the win of the Labor Party in 1976. The New South Wales branch of the Labor Party started the fight back to the national Parliament, to win again the Treasury bench in this Parhament. The result of the election has been to the satisfaction of the little people, the members who worked last Saturday on the polling booths and who have worked on them over the years because they have believed in the party of battlers. They do not get paid like workers for other parties. They work and believe like the average Australian and will never forget what happened last November. The disgust came to the surface in New South Wales last week. Thefiguresfor the New South Wales State election reveal that for every seat won by the Labor Party, approximately 25 333 votes were cast, but for every seat won by the Liberal-Country Party coahtion, approximately 21 833 votes were cast. This coahtion govern1976 ment extreme in gerrymandering which has been achieved by 3 Liberal distributions of the electorates of New South Wales has meant a 7 per cent swing to Labor which has over 50 per cent of the vote but which is stillfightingto win the State election. How can the people of New South Wales tolerate this situation? Truth and justice must prevad. The peoples voice must be heard and accepted. I, being a New South Welshman, must congratulate the State Branch of the Labor Party, its General Secretary, Geoff Cahdl, and its President, John Ducker, for the remarkable campaign that the new Premier of New South Wales, Nevdle Wran, has waged. Again, I would be remiss if I did not congratulate the State members of Parhament in the electorate of Sydney. I refer to Pat Hills, M.L.A., who is the honourable member for Phdlip, Roger Degen, M.L.A., who is the member for Balmain and Laurie Brereton, Sydney M.L.A., the member for Heffron, and all other candidates successful and unsuccessful who worked for the Labor Party at the State election on Saturday. On Thursday last the honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel) attacked Alderman Paul photo Whelan, the Mayor of Ashfield, the successful Labor candidate for Ashfield in the Legislative Assembly. The vicious attack by the honourable member for Evans on a man who is respected in the electorate of Ashfield- a family man and professional man who has spent a lifetime in the area-is to be deplored. He has attacked a man who cannot defend himself, a man who in the parhament wdl be an asset to New South Wales and Ashfield. Paul Whelan was elected to office with a swing of over 6500 votes from the result of the last election. On this basis if a Federal election were held next or tomorrow week there would be a Labor victory in Evans as well as in many other electorates of New South Wales and elsewhere in Austraha. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) has stated that there wdl be many oncers in this thirtieth Parhament, and the honourable member for Evans could be one of these. Mr Armitage-And that is oncers' corner over there.",80
146,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,"That is right. The honourable member for Evans was campaign director for the Liberal candidates for Ashfield and Drummoyne. Both were defeated. I can prove that this was so. At page 1780 of Hansard of 29 April the honourable member for Evans is reported as having said that he was not campaign director. In doing so he misled the House.

169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILL,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne will take his member for point of order.

172,Mr DONALD CAMERON,WILL,"The honourable vate member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) speaks performing slowly, and stdl we do not understand him. The reason private courier services developed was the gross inefficiency and unreliability which existed in the Australian Post Office. The Post Office even became the butt of numerous jokes because of its incapacity to guarantee service. we had the advent of the private courier who, legality with the advantages of a small business, more easdy avoided industrial strife. Without the burof feardens associated with a large organisauon he was able to provide an efficient and rehable service.

At present Australia Post is better than usual in its mad deliveries.

Australia Post is now using white collar thuggery methods to browbeat the users of priSo vate courier services, with doubts about the of their operations, instUUng fear of legislative reprisals.

185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILL,Order! The assiduously honourable member's time has expired.,84
186,Mr ARMITAGE,WILL,The airIber port debate is on again. This time possible alternative sites for an airport to service Sydney are being considered. One is at Nelson. I quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald 3 May. It is headed 'New move for second airI port near Windsor'. This is at a place called son. Actually Nelson is near the Rouse Hillone Maraylya area.,84
187,Mr JAMES,WILL,In whose electorate?,84
188,Mr ARMITAGE,WILL,"It is in the electorate of MitcheU. It is slap bang in the electorate of MitcheU. We know that this will create extreme airport noise for a number of areas. I wiU name the areas. The noise factor applies not only to the Nelson site but equaUy to the other sites which the Government is considering. One is at Holsbeing worthy and one is at Marsden Park, which is also near Windsor and Riverstone. Theflightpath for states: the Marsden Park site would cut across into my electorate from MitcheU. Once again the site is in theAuse the Mitchell electorate and the flight path would earlier of cut into the Chifley electorate, another site is in probably an area west of Liverpool, in the Rossmorecentury. Bringelly area. If the Government goes ahead with the proposal to site the airport at Nelson, which is in the Rouse HUl-Maraylya area, or at Marsden Park, it wdl mean extreme airport noise in a mass housing area. I make that point. would particularly affect the Mt Druitt area, Blacktown area, the Seven Hdls area and surcertain rounds, the St Marys area and Penrith. Keep mind that some of these areas are not in the Chifley electorate; they are in the elctorate Macarthur as well. The noise would go into the issue die. areas of Richmond, Baulkham HUls, Castle etc., and even down into Parramatta which represented by the honourable member for Parexpired. ramatta (Mr Ruddock).",84
189,Mr JAMES,WILL,WU l the Concordes go there?,84
190,Mr ARMITAGE,WILL,"It could happen. We never know what is ahead with this Government in office. We never know what the next decision be. The siting of the airport at either place have a tremendous impact upon an area right throughout the western suburbs of Sydney what one might caU the north western suburbs Sydney. They are very densely populated. difficult Unfortunately, so far, these announcements ing been made by the Government we have not heard a word from the honourable member MitcheU (Mr Cadman) or the honourable member for Parramatta in opposidon to these proposals. I would have expected them to be at least working on this issue. There have even been rumours. I do not reaUy believe them. make this quite clear to the honourable memfor Parramatta.",84
191,Mr JAMES,WILL,"He is in favour ofit. of Mr ARMITAGE-Thes e are the rumours, but do not really believe them. Rumour has it that Nelhe agrees with an airport being established at of the sites being considered, as it would save him traveUing from his home to Mascot. It would be a dreadfully selfish atdtude to ignore the interests of the people in the area just to save half an hour's travelling dme back and forth to Mascot each week. I do not believe the rumour. I do not believe the honourable member for Parramatta could be so selfish. I am sure the rumour is not right. I am sure I wdl hear from him that he is very violendy opposed to any of these sites selected. I think I should read the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. It confidential State Government report now suggests that the airport at Mascot will not increase as rapidly as forecasts predicted. It suggests that Mascot could cope with Sydney's air traffic until the turn of the I say this: It istimethe Government woke up to this fact. I have beheved right through that Mascot could handle the traffic for many years to It come. Members of my Party know how very dethe finite I was on this matter over the years when other sites were suggested. I believe that in this is the answer. Apparendy the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is quite unaware of the of State Government's report and refuses to let the HU1, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)is Order! The honourable member's time has Before I call the next speaker, I mention this matter. Earher concern was expressed that the Hansard reporter might not be able to take down what was being said. During the time that the honourable member for Chifley was speaking the level of conversation was remarkably will high. On more than one occasion the honourable would member for Chifley turned around and had his back to both the Chair and the Hansard writer. or Comments were being made by honourable of members which must nave made it extremely for the gentleman from Hansard to take havdown what was being said. Therefore I suggest that the concern which was expressed previously for for Hansard be expressed at this moment.",84
192,Mr RUDDOCK,WILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",84
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILL,Does the honourable member for Parramatta claim to have been misrepresented?,85
194,Mr RUDDOCK,WILL,"I do. Reference was made to me in a number of contexts. When I look at Hansard tomorrow I may want to deal with some of the other remarks that were made. In regard to the suggestions of rumours about me and my support for airport development in the area to the north-west of my electorate, I deny that such rumours are true. Insofar as it has been suggested that I have not spoken on this issue, let me say that it has been made quite clear by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) from his own statements that there were no sites named by him upon which I could be called to comment at this stage. But I can assure the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) that when any announcements are made. I wdl be as vocal as he is if they affect the district which I represent and which I wdl continue to represent.",85
195,Mr ARMITAGE,WILL,I claim to have been misrepresented. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) has suggested that I have misrepresented him. I did not do so under any circumstances. I said that there had been rumours which I found it really impossible to believe. I did not believe them. Nevertheless these rumours have beenfloatingabout. I was not making any direct imputation against the honourable member.,85
196,Mr NEIL,WILL," I had intended to deal with 2 matters which concern my constituents but, in view of certain things that have been said by Opposition members, I shall have to leave those important matters of substance until some later time and refer to some of the rubbish we have heard tonight. The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon) sought to derive some glee irom the preliminary figures for the New South Wales State election. Firstly, let us discern where he has misled the House. To make categoric statements about specificfiguresbefore thefiguresare in is totally misleading. Surely that must be obvious. Secthat ondly, a 7 per cent swing is not even claimed by the Australian Labor Party officials in New South Wales at thistime.I think even they claim something less. Thirdly, in the last State election the Labor Party did not contest a number of seats. I think they were 5 seats in the inner metropolitan area of Sydney. Obviously there is a disthe tortion there and there cannot be any true by comparison. Surely the honourable member for Sydney up knows the exactfigures,knows how many Labor Party candidates contested the last election, knows better than I do what is the true situation and knows himself the extent to which he has misled the House. Fourthly, as I understand it today, it has been said that the swing is clearly not uniform and in many areas is quite low. We have not seen thefinalfiguresbut it is clear that in some areas the Liberal Party has done extremely wed and may even have improved its vote. I refer to the seats of Miranda and CronuUa. The honourable member for Sydney might have a look at thefigureswhen they come out. The next point to be looked at is that we seem to find some obsession on the other side of the House with oncers. A senior member of this House who recently retired said that his greatest achievement after many years was to survive in this place. I would have thought that quality of performance was a better criterion of a worthwhde. contribution to society than length of time. It is absolutely pathetic to say at the end of 25 years: 'Big deal; I survived'. Surely one Bdl, surely one speech, surely one contribution could have been referred to as having made the honourable member's stay worthwhile. If honourable members look at thefiguresfor St George they will see that it has been a very close election. For 11 years they have been saying that Mr Mead wdl lose. If they look they will find that he may yet win. He has done extremely well. His constituency isrightin my electorate. If honourable members opposite look at the figures for Earlwood they wdl find that in many areas the booths have shown increased swings. I think that they will find, much to their surprise, that, although logic may dictate that I as the Liberal member with the slimmest majority may not be here for long, the good sense of the people will prove them dead wrong. The honourable member fbr Chifley (Mr Armitage) raised the matter of the airport. I have spoken in this House about the airport once by way of a question and once in a speech. I said I was not going to become polarised on this issue at thistime.It is far too important. I am sick and tired of years of political mud slinging over an issue that affects 250 000 people in the area of the south part of Sydney and mUlions of people throughout Sydney. The people of that city and people of Australia have been very ill-served the poor level of muck raking in political debate that has gone on concerning the airpon over the years. Now the honourable member stands and says that it is going to occur again. I certainly hope not. To the credit of Sir Eric WUlis, he spoke about a second runway, and honourable members will find that there was not a particularly strong vote against him. I have spoken about this issue. I am concerned about the noise problems. I would like the Government at this time to reassess the need for a second airport. The situadon has been in a meldng pot. We must reassess the need for the expansion of Sydney Airport. The Government says that there is a need. We must reassess the need for expansion overall. Having made that reassessment, we must sensibly and carefully decide the priority of likely areas and likely techniques. We must not indulge in this sort of pohucal so-called debate. I have called on the residents of St George to write to me- I do not care if I receive a thousand letters-so that we can genuinely test public opinion and genuinely find out what the people want. We wdl find it out there. We obviously wdl not find out the truth or get any common sense in this chamber from honourable members opposite. I expect this Government to take a balanced and sensible approach to the problem, in contrast to the Galston mentality and the pure pork-barrel potiticking that went on under the last Government.",85
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILL,"Order! The are, honourable member's ume has exphed.",86
198,Mr COHEN,WILL,It is very obvious tonight that there are a lot of Nellies in the Parliament. AU the new boys and oncers have come in here and it is running down their legs as they see the swing in New South Wales.,86
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILL,Order! The House they wdl come to order. I suggest that in the remainDeputy ing 3 minutes of the adjournment debate the House should try to maintain a high standard debate.,86
200,Mr COHEN,WILL,I meant that there was a lot of style sweat.,86
201,Mr LUSHER,WILL,"I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I submit that the phrase 'runinstructed ning down their legs' is not the that should be used in this Parhament.",86
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILL,I have suggested that the House try to maintain a high standard of tomorrow. debate. That was also directed at the honourable member who is making his speech at the moment.,86
203,Mr COHEN,WILL,"It is very obvious that the new hghtweight from St George is a very worried man after last Saturday's results. There was a 7 per cent increase in the Australian Labor Party vote, there was a 4 per cent swing overall on a 2-party preferred vote but there was over a 7 per cent swing from the last Federal election. Mr Neil-Not in St George.",86
204,Mr COHEN,WILL,"We will have a look at the honourable member's seat. He is sitting on only 56 votes and I can assure him that that will not be enough to keep anyone as Ughtweight as he is in this place. Fancy this new honourable member for St George having the hide to attack one of the finest members who has ever been in this place, the former honourable member for Grayndler. The honourable member for St George is not evenfitto polish Mr Daly's shoes, let alone criticise him. Unfortunately there is not a great deal of time left. Let the honourable member for St George enjoy the 2V4 years that he has left here because that is all he wdl ever see of Parliament.",86
