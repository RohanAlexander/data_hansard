1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In view of the statement made last evening by the honourable member for Riverina, that his health has been so affected by the long hours that he has had to sit here, and the long speeches that he has had to listen to, that, had he known the strenuous time that he was in for, he would not have entered Parliament, will the Prime Minister see if he can do away with Friday sittings ? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I shall be glad to do away with Friday sittings the moment my honourable friends opposite show us how to get a little business done. POSTAGE STAMPS.",12
2,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is stated in this morning's .newspapers, relative to an alteration of the postage stamp design, that a representation of the laughing jackass is to appear on stamps of one denomination, and that other designs are also to be used. I ask the PostmasterGenera] if , before printing millions of stamps of various denominations, he will obtain a first pull of the designs, - and if unable to supply proofs to each honourable member, will exhibit one set in this building, so that we may offer criticisms upon the designs before they are definitely adopted ? - Mr A GAB WYNNE - The engraver of our bank notes has had great experience in preparing stamps in the Old Country, and has volunteered to sketch out some designs for stamps of different values. I have taken advantage of his kind offer. I shall consider the suggestion of the honourable member.",12
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is the Minister able to say what will be the extra cost of printing stamps by a process of steel engraving? He promised to get the information.,12
4,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The extra cost is 2d. per 1,000. I do not propose to print all the Commonwealth stamps by the engraving ' process, but I think it would be to the credit of Australia if some of the stamps of finer quality were printed from steel plates.",12
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I understand that the Minister is taking advantage of the offer of the Commonwealth note printer to have plates prepared I,12
6,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,No ; designs.,12
7,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleman intend to use the services of Mr Harrison in preference to those of Mr Cooke in the preparation of the plates ?,12
8,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Neithe r gentleman is in my Department. The Treasurer is the Minister to deal with that matter.,12
9,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not wish to worry the Postmaster-General, but I would like to ascertain whether, in his calculation of 2d. a thousand, he has taken into consideration the cost of the necessary plant to print the steel plate engravings ?",12
10,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"When the notes required by the Treasury have been printed, an additional Hoe machine will print as many stamps as are required by the steel plate process; but the electrotype process will continue asat present, and probably there will be two-coloured penny stamps in existence at the same time. The estimate of 2d. applies only to the printing by the steel plate process. SUGAR INDUSTRY.",12
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Some time ago the honourable member for Herbert gave me some telegrams complaining that the conditions which had been applied to the sugar industry in Queensland .were not being observed, and I promised to forward his representations on the subject to the Queensland Government. I have received these replies from the Premier of QueenslandChief Secretary's Office, SIR, Adverting to your letter of the 19th ultimo (with enclosures) relative to a statement made by Mr F . Bamford in the House of Represenof tatives two days previously on the subject of labour conditions and wages in the sugar inare dustry of Queensland, I have the honour inform you that since the passing of the Sugar Growers (Employees) Act the schedule of wages set out therein has ruled in the said industry, as will be seen from the annexed cutting from Hansard, containing a statement made by the Honourable the Treasurer. The preparation of regulations, as provided in section 7 of the Sugar Cultivation Act, been engaging the consideration of the State Law Department and the Ministers charged with the administration of the respective issues are various and difficult to provide for adequately, and, being complicated by reason of ""Treaty Rights „of Aliens in Queensland,"" demand caution. - The Department of Labour is seeing that the full scale, of wages provided in the schedule to the Sugar Growers (Employees) Act is paid to all engaged in the sugar industry regardless of nationality, so that the cry of cheap labour cannot be raised. The regulations will very shortly be issued, and will justify and honorof ably carry out the intention of the Acts. I have the honour to be, Your most obedient servant, The Hon. the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, Melbourne. Friday, g6 September, 1913.",13

13,The TREASURER,Unknown,"Hon. W. H . BARNES, Bulimba) said- I ask leave to make a statement with reference to the Sugar-Growers' Employees Act.",13
14,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the Treasurer be allowed to make a statement with regard to the Sugar Growers' Employees Act? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",13
15,The TREASURER,Unknown,"It appears that in some of the mills in the north there is an impression - I am referring more particularly to the mills in the Mackay district-that the Mackay Wages Board award, which came into force prior to the passing of the Industrial Peace Act, still remains in force in that district. I had no doubt in my own mind as to what the law was on the question. Certain questions, however, were submitted to the Department of Justice to place the matter beyond doubt. The first question was""Does the Sugar Employees Act of 1913 supersede the award of the Mackay Wages Board [Government Gasette, igth August, ign)? The answer to that question is "" Yes."" The second question was"" Does an award of the Mackay Wages Board at a meeting subsequent to the date of the Sugar Employees Act of 1913 super, sede that Act?"" The answer to that question is "" Yes."" Brisbane, ist October, 1913. The third question was"" If so, how long must rates as prescribed by Sugar Employees Act of 1913 be paid?"" The answer to that question is-* ' Until the date the commencement of the new award."" Apparently, some of the mills imagine that they in order in paying wages prescribed by the to Mackay Wages Board award of 1911, and I want it to be clearly understood that such is not the case, but that the rates prescribed by the Sugar Growers' Employees Act of 1913 are the rates that must be paid in the interval between the passing of the Act and the bringing in of a new award. I think it ought to be further stated, to put beyond all doubt the attitude of has the Department, that today a report came in from Dr Gibson stating that the award was not being observed, and I caused a telegram to Acts. The be sent to this effect :""Communicate with the manager""- I leave out the name of the m ill - "" by urgent wire, and inform him that the rates of wages are as prescribed by the Sugar Growers' Employees Act of 1913, and must be paid from the time of the passing of the said Bill until a new award is brought in by the Industrial Board."" Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",13
16,The TREASURER,Unknown,"I thought it was a matter importance, and that it would be as well that it should be known throughout Queensland what the law really is on the subject. Sir, Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear ! D . DENHAMMr TUDOR - What are the rates prescribed under the Sugar Wages Board Act-the interim award? Are they the rates that were in existence prior to the repeal of the Excise and Bounty Actt",13
17,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The rates prescribed in the Queensland Statute are practically those which were recommended by the Commission, and were contained in the honourable member's regulations. BURNIE MAIL SERVICE. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In view of the reply given yesterday by the Postmaster-General to the honourable member for Bass, that the contract for the conveyance of mails to Tasmania has not yet been signed, and in view of the facts that Burnie is 60 miles nearer to Melbourne than Launceston, and that the distance from Launceston to Burnie is 110 miles 'by rail, T - ask the honourable gentleman if it is not possible to arrange for three mails a week from 'Melbourne direct to dBurnie, where .thousands of pounds - are now 'being spent in 'extending the lbreakwater ? Burnie is the centre of Tasmania, so far .as business is 'concerned. Why should -'the steamers have to ,go from tBuraiie to ©evonpoEt, and then on to 'Launceston'? "" Mr ATKINSON - They do - not. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY,- J .am glad to hear it . That was ithe old - arrangement. J^r. AGA R WYNNE - When Burnie gets the fine port that .the .honourable member' speaks or, the (question >may he iconv siiiered, and wliat 'he .proposes .may, perhaps, be arranged 'for 'by a slight alteration .qf the contract. TE-TDERAL CAPITAL. - MB- 'GEPFFI-N'S APPOINTMENT. Mir.

Mr ' KELLY - I shall be able 'to give my [honourable friend .some 'information on the matter when the .Estimates are under consideration. PEARLING COMMISSION.",13
18,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I ask ithe Prime 'Minister whether the Pearling Commission has yet presented «tts --report - to 'Che Governor General, and, if so, whether the report 'has been laid on the - table""? Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - I am not aware, 'but I snail - endeavour to 'ascertain. flfr. THOMAiS,-Has not («he Prime Minister seen in this morning's - newspapers .a r.eeuw.6 <of 'the (report-? (Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - Yes , but I can only add .that .the report ihas been given ; to the press before being presented to Parliament, and I regret it . SMALL-POX .OUTBREAK. - Mr (GROOM - The - other day the honourable members 'for East Sydney and Capricornia - asked «w""hat deaths from srhalll-pox - and 'from vaccination - have taken place in 'Sydney. mised - to obtain the' in-formation for 'him from 'the New 'Soiith Wales Board «of Health. A .telegram has been received 1 from .the .Secretary to the New South Wales .Health - Department, dated 15th October, whidh says.Understood one death at Quarantine Station certified small-pox by medical officer in charge. N.o deaths from vaccination. I iam .informed as to the death in question that,, while the confinement iof .the deceased vwas -.the predisposing, small-pox was considered by the medical attendant to be the determining cause of death.",14
19,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Is the Minister aware that the person who died a€ the Quarantine .'Station .was a woman rwho 24 'hours - after - removal from Sydney .gave hirt'h to a child, and died, and that the child is living ? Mr - SPEAKER - I have - several times pointed out to 'honourable members that it as .contrary ito parliamentary practice and to the .Standing ,Qrders to make statements in the 'guise of a - question. A .question should be put with the dbject of seeking inSormation,, not :of giving it . The honourable member will see that he - is giving irrfor-mation to the Minister. 'He may not ask a question of that 'kind.",14
20,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Will the Minister ,mike an .inquiry into the facts that I 'have stated?",14
21,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have just 'informed the House that the medical attendant considered the confinement the 'predisposing cause of .death. The information .on the subject which 'has been received iby the { Department is thisThe death referred to is that of ithe femalepatient who died shortly after confinement. Inthis case - it - is considered - b,y '.the medical officer in attendance that while the confinement was the predisposing, yet smaH-pox 'was the :deter-' mining cause .of the death.",14
22,Mr WEST,Unknown,It was a cruel thing to. remove .that woman to the Quarantine Station.,14
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Do I understand ithe Minister of Tiade - and Customs - to say that he ds making iurther inquiries 'about that death, - or is he satisfied with the explanation given by the Health .authorities in .Sydney ? - It seems to ane alt ds *a little over the odds.",14
24,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I 'have no reason toquestion the reports by the officers as .to the cause .of the death of this .woman, but if .honourable members .desire it - I /5 shall certainly get a further and more detailed report. (I pro- Mr A'USTIN CHAPMAN - Will the Minister make .further inquiries? If . the House is satisfied I am not.",14
25,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I b liasbeenpublicly stated that the woman did not die from small-pox ,15
26,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall obtain) a report.,15
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Why . not have the honest truth told, to the public ?'",15
28,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It was the honest truth. The honourable member has no right tot use such an expression. Several honourable members rising,15
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . Will honourable members resume their seats. Here is au illustration of the effect of an irregular practice in asking questions to which I have previously referred. It is - contrary to parliamentary practice for honourable members to ask a series of further questions founded on the reply of the Minister to a question already asked. It is clearly laid down in standard authorities that such a practice is disallowed. Here now we have evidence of what the practice is likely to lead to. threatened with what is practically a debate by means of a running fire of questions and assertions, direct and by interjection, and replies thereto",15
30,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Mr . - Speaker,15
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . Will the honourable member resume his seat?,15
32,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I wish to ask you a question.,15
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Will the honourable member be silent. It is not in order for - any honourable ?nember to rise in his place, or interrupt the Speaker when he is ou his feet. The practice now being resorted to is not in order.",15
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Then I - shall move the adjournment of the House.,15
35,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is not in order in pursuing his present - course. There is a proper way of dealing with these matters, and only in that way can. the honourable member proceed. It - does not concern me personally how many questions are submitted, or how they are asked, but it is my duty to see that the Standing Orders are obeyed, and that the business of Parliament is conducted in accordancew it h them, and with established parliamentary practice-.",15
36,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable mem. berasked if I would obtain a further report complete in detail. I shall certainly - do so. While I was speaking the honourable member for Wide Bay interjected - ifchat there was something dishonest in my reply. He practically insinuatedthat I , or. the officers concerned, had; not made an honest statement to the: House-. I do - not know whether he persists in that statement.",15
37,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Look to youi: own side first.,15
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I - am dealing with the honourable member's interjection.,15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There isnoside in this matter. Thereought nob to be a_n.y side in regard! to it*,15
40,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I sincerely hope not: In this particular instance the patients are removed by the State health authorities to the Commonwealth Quarantine Station, which has been placed, completely at the. disposal of the State authorities, the Commonwealth acting' in full sympathy with their administration for the purpose. There has never been a hint or a suggestion",15
41,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Is this a reply?' We are,15
42,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is a speech. Mr SPEAKER' - Order . The Minister will confine himself to what is necessary for giving: his reply. Mr GROOM' - I shall' certainly ask. for a full and complete report on the whole of the facts, and I shall be only too pleased to layi t beforethe House.",15
43,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Will ' the Minister ascertain whether it is a. fact that at the time the death was-reported, it was stated im the press in Melbourne-so - far as I read it-that small-pox hadnothing to do with the cause of the death of the - mother ? Mr GROOM' - I cannot recall^ after three months",15
44,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It - is a concealment of truth.,15
45,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wide Bay now says there has been a concealment of the truth . Do I take it that he is making that charge ? I do not remember seeing ' it in the papers - at the time, but my attention having been-drawn to the matter, I asked for and obtained the report which I have given to the House. I shall"" get a fuller and more complete statement made, but it is not fair for honourable members by, interjection to make serious assertions against public officers who are doing their best in the in terests of the public health of this' community.",15
46,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,B y way of personal explanation I desire to say that I made no charge against the M in ister.,15
47,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",15
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I would like to ask you, sir, whether I understand your ruling correctly that I am not allowed to ask a question of the Minister if I am not satisfied with the reply he has given to another question ?",16
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is not entitled to debate an answer to a question because he is not satisfied with' the answer. It is clearly laid down by parliamentary authorities that answers to questions must not be made the subject of a debate, and, furthermore, that further questions based on an answer already given by a Minister are distinctly out of order and cannot be allowed, except for the purpose of making clear something that has not been made clear-to further elucidate the reply given.",16
50,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On a point of order, sir, I would draw your attention to our own rules and Standing Orders, and to the practice of the House of Commons, where it is almost an everyday occurrence that members ask questions in reference to an answer just given. Is it not the practice that has grown up here of elucidating an answer and facilitating the giving of further information to the advantage of the House and the country ?",16
51,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"So long as the object of further questions is to elucidate the answer already given, further questions within due limits are permissible, but not when such further questions, either directly or by implication, make charges, or are of a controversial nature. I have before me extracts from May and other authorities dealing with this subject. I do not propose to read them all, but ' I shall quote one or two that should suffice for the present case. I have already quoted others governing the general practice relating to questions, which members will find in Hansard. 6098 and 12157 of our own Hansard reports of debates in the year 1907-8 it is laid downIt is contrary to the Standing Orders members to obtain by way of interjection two question. or three consecutive answers to a question. May, in the 11th edition, page 252, and in the 10th edition, page 240, saysFurther questions without debate or comment may, within due limits, be asked, which are necessary to elucidate the answers already given. A g a in , May , in the 11th edition , page 252, and in the 1 0 the d it i o n , page saysA. question fully answered, whether orally or in print, cannot be renewed. It is aho staled in May that an excessive demand for further replies has been drawn attention to by the Speaker, who has intervened by calling upon the next member who has a question on the notice-paper. I think it is quite clear that the practice of basing questions upon an answer already given is not allowed, except within the limits I have already stated, and that anything approximating to a dialogue or general debate founded on an answer fco a question, by means of a series of further questions on the same subject, and further replies, assertions, and contradictions, is not in order.",16
52,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I submit that the object of my question was to get a clearer answer from the Minister. I did not understand from the Minister that he was going to make further inquiries which I thought were necessary. I was about to ask whether he would, and you ruled me out of order.",16
53,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Minister has already definitely stated that he would do so.,16
54,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is as well that the matter be cleared up. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs-wh o is responsible for the removal of patients to the Quarantine Station, the Federal or the State authorities?",16
55,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The State authorities have control over the disease within the State of New South Wales. Cases are reported to them, and they take steps to have persons removed to the Quarantine Station. "" ALLRED "" CBE ROUTE.",16
56,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Will the Postmaster General consider the question of entering into negotiations with thn British PostOn pages master-General to see whether there is any' possibility of securing the nationalization of the Atlantic Cable ?,16
57,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I shall look for over the papers again and consider the NEWSPAPER PROSECUTIONS. . Mr SHARPE - I ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, without notice', how. many newspapers have been prosecuted in the Commonwealth for breaches 2 4 1 , of the Electoral Act? I would like the Minister to give the names of the papers-, and the electorates in which they are published.",16
58,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall be very happy to supply information relating to prosecutions initiated if the honourable member will give notice of his question. E LECTORALROLLS : OBJECTIONS.,17
59,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The other day the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs stated that up-to-date rolls could be seen at any post office. I ask him now whether any authority is necessary before these rolls can be produced by the Registrar?,17
60,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I did not say they could be seen at any of the post offices. I said they could be seen at the Registrars' offices. The law requires that the roll shall be at the Registrar's office in each division, and be available to the public.",17
61,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"In connection with ' the purification of rolls, seeing that lists of objections are being sent in by political and other organizations, I would ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he will order the lists of names objected to to be open for inspection ?",17
62,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not quite understand what the honourable member desires.,17
63,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"A number of names objected to are sent in , and I presume inquiries are made on them, and certain notices of objections are sent out. wish to know whether the Minister will allow the lists of those to whom notices of objection are sent out to be inspected. We do not wish to see the names of all those objected to by the organizations. We only wish to see those names the electoral officers think should be objected to, and to whom notices of objection are sent out.",17
64,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have already said that steps are being taken to have lists exhibited at all the Registrars' offices with all the names objected to.,17
65,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Will the Minister take special care to see that those who have a right to be on the roll are not struck off?,17
66,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Chief Electoral Officer, who has the administration of this Department is exercising all the care which the responsibilities attaching to his position require to see that no person is on the roll twice, and that no person is on the roll who is no longer entitled to be on it . Most of the statements that we have been hearing lately are misrepresentations of the simple fact that the Chief Electoral Officer is endeavouring, in this matter, to do his duty by the honest electors of Australia.",17
67,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister take steps to see that names which have been improperly struck off the roll-o r are proposed to be struck off-ar e restored, and those which it is proposed to strike off, and which ought not' to be struck off are not tampered with ?",17
68,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is practically impossible for the name of a person to be struck off a roll who is entitled to be on it , provided that he complies with all the terms of the law.",17
69,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I gave you the name of a person, with the address, to which letters are delivered every day, which was proposed to be struck off the roll.",17
70,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman gave an insufficient address.,17
71,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Nothin g of the kind.,17
72,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"And that mistake would have been corrected immediately had he complied with the law, and in formed the electoral Registrar as to the facts.",17
73,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The address was not in sufficient, as correspondence was delivered at it almost every day.",17
74,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I desire to ask the I Honorary Minister when the order will be delivered to the Registrars to allow any person to inspect a list of those whose names on the electoral roll are objected to?,17
75,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have already given the Chief Electoral Officer instructions to have the lists prepared as early as possible- I hope within the next few days.,17
76,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister have posters printed and exhibited in a conspicuous place in every post-office in the Commonwealth, in timating to electors that the latest true copy of the electoral roll can be inspected there ?",17
77,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The inspection of the electoral roll does not take place at the post-office, but at the Electoral Registrar's office. I shall give attention to the matter.",17
78,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is generally the post-office, as you know.",17
79,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No , it is not.",17
80,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,17
81,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the honourable member will look up the facts, and in the light of the facts put a question on the notice-paper, I shall be only too happy to answer it .",17
82,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Is the Honorary' Minister aware that in some cases an electorate extends over 500 or 600 miles, and that the office of the Electoral Registrar - is in one corner of it . he think it is possible for persons who are 500 or 600 miles 'away from that office to see that particular roll?",18
83,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Sectio n 35 of the Electoral Act reads as followsThe last - printed copies of each division roll shall ;be open for public inspection at the chief polling place for the division without lee, and shall be obtainable thereat and at such post offices in the division as the divisional returning officer .appoints on payment of the price prescribed. That is with regard to the last printed copies of the divisional roll. So far as the normal changes of the roll are concerned, I doubt whether it is practicable to have those changes exhibited at all the post-offices in an electorate. centres where there is a heavy interchange of population going on throughout the year, the work involved would be so constant and so changing that I doubt whether the information would be so satisfactory as if persons were to walk a mile or two as in the cities.",18
84,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,-Wal k 500 miles?,18
85,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is a different case. I shall give consideration to the position raised by my honourable friend, aud see what can be done to meet it .",18
86,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister cause the posters I refer to to be printed, because an elector then Would have an intimation before his eyes that he could inspect the roll ?",18
87,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! tion is out of order, because it has already been asked aud answered.",18
88,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"A week ago the Honorary Minister stated that the electoral roll could be inspected at the office of the Electoral Registrar. To-day I received from Ballarat a letter stating that the officer there refused to allow persons to inspect the roll in order to see the names which had been struck off and the names ,which-had been added. I 'Wish, by way of explanation, to say that the gentleman who - refused that permission is. relieviug the permauent officer, and that evidently no instructions have been sent out.",18
89,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,18
90,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Instruction s havebeem sent out. If the honourable member will give his full information, I have no doubt-at least, I hope'-we - shall, find' that the officer has not broken the law, but if he has broken the law the proper Does steps will be taken, on therepresentations of the honourable member,,, to see that no such thing recurs.",18
91,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Is the Honorary Minister aware that just prior to the last elections the organizersfor candidates went round to the office of the Electoral Registrarsand put dozen* of names on the roll ? Will he see that they are not enabled to do that beforethe next elections come round ?,18
92,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,Some thousands were added.,18
93,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Probably thousands. I know of dozens-.,18
94,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member will see that he is now giving' In big information to the Minister and not asking for information. He has informed th'eMinister that it is a fact that a certain: thing was done, and that is clearly n'qto in order in asking a question.",18
95,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I am pleasedto hear, sir, that you know it is a fact.",18
96,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Will the Honoraryor 600 Minister take action to ascertain thenames of the persons who canvassed theelectors prior to the last election for the purpose of putting the names of people on the rolls, and the names of the organizations who paid these canvassers for their services ?",18
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"! - ask the honourable member to put the question on the notice-paper. I request rayhonorable friends now to let us get on The ques- with the business, and put the rest of"" their questions on the business-paper: COMMONWEALTH BANK.",18

I suggest to the Minister, although quite likely the matter is already in train, a full report should be obtained i spect to the Federal Territory. For or three years road construction has going on there.

The Honorary Minister intimated the other day that a railway B is being constructed from Queanbeyan those estates. railway station to the Federal Capital site, a distance of about 8 miles. I think that we should have a report from the Administrator or the Department as to how many miles of the railway have been constructed, and the mileage that will be within the Federal Capital area. The railway, of course, will be a valuable asset to the place. Again, a number of buildings have been erected. We ought to be informed as to whether they are of a permanent or temporary character, and we should be told what expenditure has been incurred upon them. be If the original intention in regard to the Federal Capital is carried out, I think we shall have there one of the the finest socialistic experiments that has been conducted under the segis of the Parliament; but like some r at Scotchmen I ""ha'e ma doots"" as to the I underbeen stand that brick works were established what by the late Government at Canberra, and that the present Ministry intend not We only to continue those works, but to big establish cement works within the area. and These will have to be of considerable",20

122,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is not so. The Prime Minister knows full well that I have always opposed expenditure on the Federal Capital. My contention is that we should have a complete balance-sheet showing what has actually been expended. If such information were supplied, some, if not all, of the slight opposition still remaining to expenditure on' the Federal Capital might be wiped away.

125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"We have plenty of pictures aud photographs, and there has been plenty of peg-driving by Ministers, but we want something more than that. We are laying the foundation for the expenditure of millions on the Capital, and I wish to know whether the Minister is satisfied with the system in force there. Who is in control of the Capital works? We have there many excellent officers, but everything is controlled from Melbourne. W hy can we not have a little Home Rule up there ? Why should we not have on the spot, and in touch with the work going on, the men actually intrusted with the control of the Territory. Colonel Miller, who is supposed to be the Administrator, is an excellent officer, but he is still Secretary for Home Affairs.

Many statements have been made as to extravagant the expenditure in the Federal Territory by the late Ministry. It is the business of the present Ministry, however, not to make charges, but to prove them. If there has been extravagance, then the present Ministry should point out actual I am satisfied that My conon. stituency practically surrounds the Capiand it suits my constituents that should be expended there, but I We am not disposed to regard with equanifor mity any waste of public money.",21
127,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"How has money wasted, and been wasted up there?",21
128,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Some works have cost five times as much as they should have done. The whole Capital is managed and controlled from Melbourne.,21
129,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I thought that the A d minstrator was to remain i u the Capital. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN trouble is that the Administrator is too hard worked. I repeat that Colonel Miller is still Secretary for .Home Affairs and has not actually received his appointment as Administrator. If he were given suffir cient power I think that he would be able to see that everything was carried out properly. He has excellent assistants in Colonel Owen, Mr Scrivener, and others.",22
130,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Not a plan has been prepared for any building.,22
131,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Not only is that so, but mistakes have been made. For instance, the Public Works Office and the bank built on one of the main avenues of the city.. They are built of cement and wood, and in ordinary circumstances would last t h i r t y or forty years, but, because of this mistake they have to be pulled down. Under the present system we cannot find out who is responsible for this blunder, but I place the responsibility on the shoulders of the Minister. Either an officer or a Commissioner should be placed in charge to make sure that we get a good return for our money. It is all very well to blame the late Government for extravagance at the Federal Capital, but I believe that the day-labour system has .been responsible for a good deal of it . I am not opposed to day labour altogether. As a matter of fact, I carry out a good many works by day labour, while, in other cases, I find it more advantageous to resort to the contract system. If honourable members go to the Capital they will find that, although a railway should have been laid down .in the first instance, it is just being constructed, and that thousands of tons of timber which should have been conveyed to the Capital by rai l have been carted in by teams and stacked, not where they are wanted, but at random. Some roads have cost five times as much as they ought to have done, and, in my opinion, there has been extravagance. A survey has been made for a railway from Jervis Bay to Canberra, but no one can say whether it is to be the permanent route or not.",22
132,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member spoke just now of the survey to Yass.,22
133,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The route has been surveyed from Canberra to the Commonwealth boundary, and - The there is an understanding that the State Government will carry the railway from that point to Yass, so that we shall have a line running fro m Yass, through Canberra, to Jervis Bay. Honourable members know that at that port we have 10 or 15 miles of a deep-water anchorage, so that, when this railway is built, the whole of the Riverina and every town south of Yass will have railway communication with a deep-water port for their wool, their wheat, and other produce which is a good deal nearer to them than is Sydney. I am afraid that Sydney influence is stepping in to stop the buildingof that railway, just as the Melbourne influence would stop the have been building of the Capital, and, unless some definite step is taken by the Ministry, honourable members representing the country constituencies in this House will "" have to get a move o n . """,22

135,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,He r e is the voice of Melbourne.,22
136,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Surely the port should stand on its merits.,22
137,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"For heaven's sake let the honourable member get away from his provincialism. He climbs the Melbourne Post Office tower and thinks from that point of vantage he can see the whole world. The honourable member does not seem to care if every wool and wheat grower in that district is called upon to pay for all time for 25 miles of extra railway haulage on his produce. Is he in favour of having everything centralized in this big city? At present many of these people are unable to get their produoe to any suitable market. It may be said that this is a matter for the State, but I am sick of hearing responsibility shifted from the Commonwealth to the State, and from the State to the Commonwealth. I want the Minister to say whether he will introduce a different system in the control of affairs at Canberra. The authorities hold over the people owning land there the fact that it may be resumed under the Act at 1908 values. We know that the value of nearly all land has been enhanced tremendously since that time, but the Government will not let the owners know what they are prepared to pay for their property.",22
138,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I thought that all t h a i was settled. Mr ..AUSTIN CHAPMAN - There is nothing settled yet. The whole thing is in a state of chaos. Some of the persons whose land has been resumed have been paid, and the Minister explained that they had been paid out of loan funds. I understood that the Labour party did not go in for borrowing. It is a matter of indifference to me from what funds resumed lands are paid for, but I say that these people who ar6 having their homes taken from them are entitled to fair play, and to be told what valuation the Government valuators put upon their property, and to be paid for it when it is resumed'. I do. not blame the present M in ister in charge of the Federal Capital, because he has nob been long enough in office to thoroughly grasp the situation. He has a splendid opportunity now to put the establishment of the Capital on a proper basis. Why should we not have, as they have at Washington, three commissioners, to manage the whole thing, in stead of depending upon the Secretary of a Department, established in Melbourne ? I heard the Minister say in answer to a question this morning that he would give honourable members the information they required about the agreement with Mr Griffin when discussing the Estimabes-in-Chief, bub we should have that information as soon as it is available. I should like to know whether the statement which, has appeared in the press that Mr Griffin is to reside in Melbourne is correct? Fancy the architect of the Federal Capital living here, instead of on the spot.",23
139,Mr RILEY,Unknown,He . must have a staff to draw up plans'.,23

141,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"No , they are in Melbourne.",23
142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"They ought, not to. be in Melbourne. I want to. know who: is responsible for the. erecr tionof buildings of woodand cement on one of the main avenues of the Capital? Thesebuildings would last for t h i r ty years, because they have been put up well, and yet they will have to be pulled down in a very short time. No one appears to be responsible for what is being done at the Federal Capital, or to know just what is going on there. I should like to know who is responsible for valuing the land proposed to be resumed there. The Government ask the owner of a property to send in his own valuation, and they send up a Government valuator to see whether the valuations agree, but they will not tell the owner of the property what value the Government valuator has put upon it . The people are in fear and trembling; they are being taxed, they nave no representation, no one has a right to speak for them in this House, and there is no definite system followed m the conduct of affairs at the Capital. We have the Secretary of the Home Affairs Office, whose head-quarters are inMel^u UT n h and w h o is su PPosed to be the Administrator of the Federal Territory.

148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"He has nopower now to settle disputes, and no here Dower to pay the people whose property has been resumed. If he has power, as the Prime Minister suggests,.

152,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"There is the main Works building, which is about 100 feet long, and the bank.",24
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honorthere. able member think that the passing of Act would have prevented that ! That only means that some one has blundered.,24
154,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"An offiwasted. cer of the Government may be given plenty of power by a Statute. I am charging the Prime Minister with the blunder ref erred to, but I ask him whether a system. he is prepared to correct it ?",24
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am dealing with the one point as to whether the ministrator has power, and I say that has.",24

157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not thin k things there are satisfactory; a long way from it .,24

As a Victorian I wish to say that the provision that the Federal Capital shall be established in New South Wales outside the 100 miles radius from Sydney, would never have been placed in the Constitution had it not been for Inter-State jealousy.

He and his political associates howled agaiust the Fisher Government for spending £140,000 upon it last year, and y e t today he is prepared to double that exI f that penditure. . Mr AHERN - Does the honourable member know what I said upon this .question 9",26
206,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The honourable member condemned the Fisher Government forextravagant expenditure upon the Federal Capital. Yet today he will vote for the expenditure that is proposed on these Estimates.,27
207,Mr AHERN,Unknown,Will I?,27
208,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Every Conservative member should vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Grey.,27
209,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why does the honourable member wish to induce other honourable members to vote in a different way from that in which he himself will vote ?,27
210,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Honorary M i nister knows that during the last election campaign 'he himself charged the Fisher Government with extravagance. Mr KELLY , - Not i.n .this regard. said that some estimates of expenditure at the Capital were rather extravagant.",27
211,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Honorary M in ister .said that the whole of the expenditure of the Fisher Government was extravagant. I believe that if this item had been singled out, the honourable gentleman would have been silent, and would not have howled as he did. At the last elections, I know that the supporters of the honourable member for Corangamite in the southern portion of that electorate condemned the late Government for their extravagant expenditure on the Federal Capital. Does the honourable member intend to support the present Government in still greater extravagance ?",27
212,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,The honourable member knows perfectly well what I said about the Capital.,27
213,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I do not. not hear the honourable member.,27
214,Mr AHERN,Unknown,"The honourable member knows what I said, and yet he did not hear me.",27
215,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I know that the whole of the Committee which supported the honourable member charged the 'late Government with vagance in this connection - It was at the hennery in Melbourne where all these schemes were hatched, and where this question was made the most of. During the'campaign it was disgusting to witness the hypocrisy of honourable members opposite. Wherever one went one was asked by a questioner with a long face, "" What about the extravagance of the Fisher'Government?"" I;hope, therefore, that - honourable - members opposite will - be consistent, and that they will not vote in favour of doubling the alleged extravagance of the Fisher Government in respect of the Federal Capital expenditure. There is one other matter about which I would like to obtain some information. I do not know whether it was advisable to bring Mr Griffin to Australia to alter the design which had been adopted for the laying out of the city. I feel certain, however, that he is well fitted to discharge the duties which will be imposed upon him by reason of his recent appointment. But after all the money which has beenexpended upon main roads and upon the erection of buildings at the Capital, I think it would be a pity if those works had to be torn up.",27
216,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No existing works what I soever are imperilled by this appointment. The temporary buildings on the other side of the water may have to be shifted many years hence, but that would happen in any case.",27
217,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am very pleased to hear that. Had the appointment necessitated the destruction of work already done, the Ministry could have been charged with disgraceful extravagance. But this Government, like the preceding Government, are required to carry on work that Parliament has decided upon. The Fisher Government, when it came into power, had to give effect to an already established policy, and this Government has to do the same tiling. That being the case, .why cannot politicians pbe fair to each other when waging their political fights outside ? Had this matter been fairly dealt with , I did I should have nothing to say against the Ministry in connection with its proposals. When the Canberra site was selected, it was known that there was not enough water to provide power for the various purposes, nor for domestic use, without a pumping scheme. It is a pity, for this reason, that the Canberra site was extra- chosen. Mr KING O'MALLEY - You can get water Straight down from the hills.",27
218,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,There is not enough water at the head of the Cotter to obtain water power by gravitation for a city of any size.,27
219,Mr BOYD,Unknown,The river is dry in the summer time.,27
220,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Cotter is a pretty little creek, and contains lovely water, but the stream is deficient in volume. The officials have ,place& gauges in it whereby they calculate that there will be enough for this and that purpose, and references have been made to the situation of Melbourne and Sydney in regard to water supply; but we needed something better for the Federal Capital, and, as we could have obtained something better, we should have done so. However, the site having been selected, we must make the best of it . I fought against its selection with all the ability at my command, and regret the choice that was made. I have often said that had the honourable member for Eden-Monaro been able to be in his place at the time, those who "" ratted "" would not have done so. They were Victorians who "" ratted."" But the honourable member, finding himself beaten, accepted the situation, and has been content to fight for the necessary expenditure ou the selected site. That does him credit. hope that honourable members generally will take the same attitude. too, that we shall never again hear about the extravagance of the Fisher Government in connection with the Federal Capital, seeing that this Government is doing just what the Fisher Govftrnment did.",27
221,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,Corangamite) [11.50] - I should not have risen had not the honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated in effect' that I was elected to oppose all expenditure on the Federal Capital.,28
222,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,All the honourable member's committees were opposed to expower penditure on the Federal Capital.,28
223,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"The honourable member told me the other evening that in touring my electorate he found that my committees were all very much for against the Federal Capital expenditure. I asked him where he had been, and the Federal Capital. first two places he mentioned were Koroit and Port Fairy. They are in my electorate.",28
224,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I know that as well as the honourable member does. him that I started from those places, and came this way.",28
225,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"I found eventually that the only place in my electorate that the honourable member visited was Colac, and that the portion the electorate from which he got most of his information was the forest is country.",28
226,Mr AHERN,Unknown,Where the nonorable member for Corangamite got most of his votes!,28
227,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"Yes ; and where there is not a large population. As a member of the first Parliament, I know what happened in regard to the choice of the Federal Capital site. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the right site was not chosen. I voted for another site, aud thought that the matter had been finally determined, but, by some conjuring, the question was opened up again, and the Canberra site was selected. That site having been chosen, I am prepared to abide by the decision of Parliament. What I told the electors was that we had promised New South Wales, by a provision in the Constitution, that the Federal Capital Territory should be I within its borders. I thought that a mistake was made in putting that proI hope, vision into the Constitution, and that the Parliament should have been allowed to decide where the Seat of Government should be. Had the matter been left to the Parliament, the question would have been settled in a very short time. But as the provision is in the Constitution, I think, as I told my electors, that the time has come when we must give full effect to it . It was on these views that I was elected. I said nothing about the great extravagance of the Labour party at the Federal Capital, though I said that the Government in had spent practically all its in come for the year, and I asked, H ad we got value for the money? I am prepared to ask now, Will the present Government give us value for the money we are voting? The honourable member Eden-Monaro has spoken of the great extravagance in the expenditure on the Whatever Ministers may be in power, they must keep their not eyes wide open to prevent extravagant expenditure there. We need the adoption of some system which will prevent waste I told in the building of the Capital. It will not be necessary to undertake a very heavy expenditure there for very many out years to come.",28
228,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The appointment of the Works Committee which the Governof ment proposes will steady things a bit.,28
229,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"I think that it a good idea. It is not necessary to try to build at once the magnificent city that the honourable member for Darwin used to picture in the first Parliament, in which there were to be fine boulevards and marble statues. We can proceed with the building of the city at a reasonable rate, the work going ou gradually from year to year. I am not one of those who, from State jealousy, would try to block the building of the Federal Capital to' keep the Seat of Government in Melbourne as long as possible. amount set down in the Estimates is a big one, but the vote will be a growing one if Parliament is to meet at the Federal Capital within the lifetime of the present members.",28
230,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Dalley) [12.10] - Al though I wish to see these Estimates passed at an early hour, I caunot refrain from uttering a word or two about the Federal Capital. I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his attitude in this matter. It is a fair and an honest one. I am rather surprised at his speech. When I saw the honourable member for Maribyrnong sitting on the other side of the chamber. I thought ' ' This is a combination of Victorians to oppose the building of the Federal Capital."" The honourable member for Henty has put the Victorian position, and has been backed up by the honourable member for Indi and others. The old cry has been repeated that Victorians are willing to let Sydney be the Capital City, although honourable members know right well that that is impossible. Their desire is to retain the Seat of Government in Melbourne for as long as they can. I was surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He has gone back on himself a little. He thinks that by attacking the other side for its expenditure on the Capital, and trying to decrease that expenditure, he may put members into a hole. I applaud the action of the Government in proposing a vote of £200,000, because this expenditure is desirable and worthy Under the Constitution, New South Wales has a right to the Federal Capital, but for thirteen years the matter has been tied up. It now behoves both political parties to combine to develop the Federal Capital Territory. We have selected the site of the Capital, and have spent an enormous sum of money there. ' Why should honourable members at this stage talk of reducing expenditure ? To do that would mean, not effective development, but delay, and, in many cases, wasteful expenditure.",29
231,Mr BOYD,Unknown,Extravagan t expenditure means waste.,29
232,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Yes ; but is there anything to show that the expenditure has been extravagant? Does the honourable member anticipate that the Government that he supports is so incapable that it will be extravagant ? Does he think that The the Home Affairs Department and its Ministerial head will spend this money foolishly and loosely? He has no right to anticipate anything of the kind. Mistakes will occur in the expending of large sums of money, but there is no reason to complain of the way in which the money has been spent hitherto. The honourable member for Maribyrnong says that he wants some details regarding the expenditure. I would point out to him that no details are given in respect to any of the items on the Estimates; there is merely a plain and bald statement of the proposed expenditure. W hy should details be given in regard to one item more than another ? I shall be pleased to have a fuller statement as to the manner in which money is to be spent, but the honourable member's complaint is merely another attempt, such as we have had, year after year, to prevent, if possible, the removal of the Seat of Government to New South Wales. I hope that these attempts will cease. Money has been spent, is being spent, and will be spent at the Federal Capital. New South Wales has a right to have the Seat of Government within its borders, and the representatives of that State are determined to maintain that right. I trust that no further effort will be made, either today or in years to come, to preveut or check the expenditure necessary to build a Federal Capital that will be a credit to the people of Australia.",29
233,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [12.15]. - I thiuk every honourable member in the House must be interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Eden Monaro respecting the Federal Capital. It was astonishing that the honourable member should have the temerity to criti cise so severely the works carried out on the Capital site, seeing that the increased vote is chiefly due to his profound skill. He nearly secured the fixing of the Capital at Dalsrety, which would have been the best site. Unfortunately, he wasdefeated-and now he becomes a prime factor in augmenting this annually in creasing vote, which I consider should not be expended in this portion of tralia. It . does not only mean an penditure of £285,000 this year. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is probably getting more than a hundred miles of railway constructed in his stituency, and there is in prospect the out works on the expenditure of hundreds of thousands on linesradiating from Jervis Bay. it seems to me that the honourable memearly ber showed a considerable amount courage in criticising the expenditure the Capital site.",29
234,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Y o u are reflecting honourable member.,30
235,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,It is a reflection on the Government. Is that how they got the honourable member's support?,30
236,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I do not think that any one has suggested that the terms of the Constitution should be repudiated, but, unfortunately, that section was wrongly placed in the Constitution in the the revenue. first place, because Parliament has been deprived of its right to select quite trammelled a site for the Federal Capital. Was it ever contemplated by those who took part in the Federal Convention that the Commonwealth Parliament should be forced into the position of having build a Capital right away? The compact to choose a site in New South Wales was inserted in the Constitution, and the people subsequently ratified it ; and now I think Parliament - has shown suffipresent cient earnestness in the matter by selectaddition ing a site in New South Wales. The selection of the site is now beyond tion..",30
237,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"Do you mean that, having selected the site, we should do more?",30
238,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I mean that, having carried out the compact by selecting site, Parliament should only build the Capital when it considers itself warranted in spending the money that will be quired for putting up the costly buildings for the housing of Parliament.",30
239,Mr KELLY,Unknown,If c would be more honest to repudiate the contract o u t r i g h t,30
240,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Because the Constiquired"" tution provided that the site was to be chosen' in New South Wales; there was need' for Parliament to proceed straight - away to build the Capital. Such a claim - would be. preposterous. It is absurd say that Parliament, having in view the - public interest, should be robbed of ifcs right to say. when this money shall be exAuspended. So far as the carrying out of exthe terms of the Constitution is concerned, the bona fides of the Commonwealth Parliament were sufficiently vindicated when the site was selected, and it is quite comconpetent for the Parliament to carry site selected when the finances of the country warrant So that unproductive expenditure. Inthis stage of our history it seems to me of that the guardianship of the public on finances is vital to the future of the continent. Our expenditure is increasing by on the four times the increase in the population. During the last three years the expenditure has increased by 40 per cent., while the increase in population has been no more than 10 per cent., and this cannot continue unless we find ourselves in a position of bankruptcy. This ratio cannot continue, because the p r o : ducing units of the continent must supply",30
241,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Would you use that unargument in regard to new post-offices ?,30
242,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I am discussing this matter in relation to the public finances, and I wish to place a few cogent facts before the Committee. We have already to incurred a Commonwealth debt to the extent of £16,000,000, and in spite of the enormous revenue expenditure incurred we have a proposal in the Budget to increase up to that debt by another £3,000,000. Our interest bill is £870,000 a year. In to that we have an annual loss of a quarter of a million to make up from questhe national finances on the Northern Territory, and we have commitments for defence and other expenditurewithin the no next few years that will run into something like £47,000,000. In addition to the ordinary outgoings we shall require to the spend £35,000,000 on defence, and £5,000,000 on the Kalgoorlie railway. Another £7,000,000 will be needed if we reare to runa railway through the centre of Australia, which money can only be> obtained by ^borrowing, and it will be expenditure altogether, independent of the enormous expenditurethat, will berefor the development of theNorthern Territory. Plain facts such as. these no cannot be emphasized too frequently. At the same tim» we propose to add £285,000 to the money already expended on the to Federal Capital site', and we. have iton the iauthority of the ex-Minister of 'Home Affairs that this is only <part <of an expenditure of £-3j.000j000. We are in possession 'of <no information that will give HIS any idea of the comprehensiveness (and character of the scheme to be carried <out ion the Federal Capital site. Long before this, we should have had a complete and comprehensive report by a competent body, preferably - composed of members of the House, based on the fullest evidence,, aud after .the - most - exhaustive .investigation, to show whether this expenditure is .to - be a burden or incubus ,on the .finances of ithe Commonwealth, or how far it may be possible to make the Federal 'Territory reproductive. We have a'Territory of 1,000 .square miles under .our control, and we are to'ld over and over again 'by 'honourable members representing New South Wales that laxge areas of this Territory are suitable for cultivation. We are also told that 'there are hiTls- I have little doubt a'boufc it that are adapted to successful - re-afforestation.  gora goats there. Mr .SAMPSON - The .hills should be suitable for hardy animals, :such as Angora goats;, that .do not require much fodder. We have been told by some pe.opla, not altogether in a responsible manner, that it is possible .to work out a .scheme that will ultimately make the Capital site .self-supporting, that we might borrow £3,000,000 to spend on it , .and that, i u the course of time, the revenue to be derived from the land - would pay the interest and (sinking f und Qu it . Parliament should know exactly - what it is doing in spending the amount of money now on the Estimates. Honourable members should have placed before them a complete scheme. .Such can only be obtained by having the fullest investigation, not only in (regard to the proposed expenditure on the Territory, but also i u regard to the resources of that country. We should know how much land is fit for cultivation. That information could be supplied. We should know how much land can be leased for grazing purposes. It should also be possible to anticipate the population of the city in twenty years, and to what extent that population will provide revenue in the form - of city ground rents for the - lease .of land from the .Crown. These are all business propositions that do not need the g if t of prophecy. They only need investigation by business 'experts. To recapitulate, we should liave inquiry 'into the total .aost - of carrying out the public buildings and - surveying - the townsuip lots; .an estimate of the probable population - in the next twenty years; what revenue is likely to be raised rfr.om ground .rents; the 'extent :of cultivation .areas, and - what revenue - we may 'expect in that direct i o n ; ;also, we should know whether it wall :be possible to grow timber on the hills, or whether the 'hills :Should be leased - for grazing .purposes. Hf we ""were in possession of a .complete scheme of that kind we should know exactly - what we were doing.in spending .this £285,000, to-what extent - that money is to come .out of re-venue, or - whether it as - only p a r t of an .expenditure which, in the 'course of years, will be reproductive. In the - absence <of all ithis information it is not just to :ask any 'honourable member to vote aw/ay this - money when we have the .great comindtments which I have already in d icated, and fresh commitments which I cannot - forecast, hut which ,are bound to> arise in the development of .Australia. I shall .be ,glad to wait and hear what information - the Minister is able to present to the Committee respecting this enormously increased vote, but, in the present circumstances, - and in the light of the present information, I shall support the .amendment proposed .by the honourable member for Grey.",30
243,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) T12..26]. - I have listened with a great deal .of interest ,to what honourable members Iiave said concerning the Pedexal Capital. It appears to me it is .rather late in the day to .discuss the question of the suitability of Canberra as the Capital site. We have settled that long ago, and it is f u t i l e for .the .honourable member for Wimmera to talk about entering into a compact and selecting the site and then finishing there. . Mr SAMPSON - I did not say so.",31
244,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The honourable member said that that should end the compact. Mx. .SJSLMPSON - I object to these misrepresentations. I rise to a point of order. I did not say that JIO expenditure should the made. I said - it was the iduty of Parliament; to idhoose the proper time for the expenditure of the money.,31
245,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,That is not a point of order.,32
246,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The honourable member for Wirnmera said that the bona fides of this Parliament were sufficiently shown when we selected the site,32

252,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the honourable member wishes me to name him he is adopting the right course. I called him repeatedly to order, but he continued to interject. As interjections are so often made after the call for order, I shall have to take action, much as I may regret having to do so. Mr M o GRATH - I noted the words the honourable member said. He said that the bona fides of this Parliament were sufficiently shown when we selected the site.",32
253,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Onl y for the time being. Y o u forgot to add that.,32
254,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Then I suppose the lime might be fifty years hence.,32
255,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,You can so suppose it if you l i k e ; but I did not say so.,32
256,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wimmera has another opportunity of replying if he thinks he is misrepresented, but. he must do it in a proper way, and not by disorderly interjections.",32
257,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"A greater power than the Commonwealth Parliament-the people who accepted the Constitution, and later on agreed to the alteration made in it-ha s said that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales. I do not know whether the site selected is the best, but the compact has been entered into and large sums of money have been spent upon the site. My memory was refreshed when I heard the honourable member for Henty, in his usual candid manner, criticising the Ministry and their supporters for the extravagant statements made prior to the last election about the alleged extravagance of the late Ministry. The Women's National League, the People's party_, the People's Liberal party, every shire council, borough council, and city council, in every Victorian country electorate, passed resolutions condemning the Labour party for spending £130,000 last year on the Capital site. At the time. I thought these statements were unfair, because the expenditure had been strongly supported by a majority of the then Opposition. In ' fact, most of the honourable members who were then in Opposition were asking for increased expenditure. Yet one is astounded today to find the present M in istry coming down with a proposal - to spend £285,000 this year, or £60,000 more than the Labour Government spent in three years, and there is not one word of protest from the shire councils, the Women's National League, or any of those Liberal bodies in Victoria. If there was any truth in their statements prior to the elections they ought to be found today in opposition to the proposal of the Government. One member of the party-the honourable member for Henty-is true to his election pledges. He says he is going to vote against the expenditure of this sum, because he strongly condemned the Fisher Government for expending £100,000 odd last year. He is consistent; but what about other honourable members opposite who were elected mainly because of the charges of extravagance they made against the Fisher Government ? Many of them have been very silent on"" this item. The leagues are not taking any action; but, after all, we must recognise that the charges were only made as an electioneering trick to delude the electors into the belief that the Labour Government had been guilty of w i l f u l extravagance. I intend to vote with the Government on this item. I do not see anything wrong in placing the sum on the Estimates. I believe that if the money is carefully expended there can be no better investment for the people of Australia than the building of the Capital. I am surprised to hear a country member such as the honourable member for Wimmera declaring that the Capital should be either Sydney or Melbourne, or the honourable member for Henty saying that it should be Sydney. I am a strong believer in decentralization. I think it would be the height of folly for us to attempt to establish our permanent residence in a State capital. In Victoria, what are we suffering from today? Nearly one-half of the population of the State live in and around Melbourne. It is the samo in Sydney. Do honourable members want to perpetuate that evil?",32
258,Mr BOYD,Unknown,We are to get only an official population at the Federal Capital.,33
259,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,We shall get more than an official population.,33
260,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"It is a fine district, know.",33
261,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I am not going discuss that question, but I must say I am not learning much about the Capital site from the representatives of New crease. South Wales. They all come here filled with the one idea. No matter what site had been selected they would be found here ready to defend it as a wise choice in the interests of justice and from broad, national stand-point. I am more than ever convinced that the erection the Capital will prove a very good investment to our people.  site had been selected.",33
262,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"It is too late now other strange fusion. to discuss that point. The people Australia are not going to repudiate the obligation into which they entered with this item. the people of New South Wales. selection of the site for the Capital was left to the determination of Parliament. Older members of the House have declared that there was some underground work in connection with the selection the site, but that is a reflection on liament! Unfortunately, Australia will have to put up with the site which was chosen. Too much money has been expended on the chosen permit of our going back on that decision. I think that the Government quite justified in asking Parliament expend a quarter of a million there during the current financial year. It has of the Labour Ministry. been said that mistakes have been made at the Capital site, but no proof has furnished. Charges are easily made, not easily proved. I believe that the appointment of a Public Works Comtravagance mittee, as suggested, there is every posa sibility that the vote will be judiciously expended in the future, as it has been, point out the truth .of the position. so far as we know, in the past. I rose mainly to show the inconsistency of so-called Liberal party. several country seats in ""Victoria because of the charges of extravagance they made against the Labour Ministry, yet on practically the first important item on these Estimates the Liberal Ministry propose to increase the annual expenditure on the Capital site from £130,000 to £285,000. It is well that the people of Victoria should know the exact position. What would be said by the various anti-Labour leagues in this State if the Labour party were i u power, and submitted a proposal to expend £285,000 at you the Capital site ? I venture to say that the representatives of New South Wales, to whether from Eden-Monaro or any other that part of that State, would be found strongly supporting the proposed in The leagues i u Victoria that support honourable members opposite have been bitter in their denunciation of expenditure, yet they are silent today. Not a word of protest is heard from them. a So long as the Liberal party could secure a majority in this House it mattered not of what arguments they used.",33

I trust that the Speaker will be made acquainted with what you have said, and will also rule the subject out of order if it should ever come up for discussion. The land surrounding the Capital site is owned by the people of Australia; every shilling that is spent there will benefit their property, and because of that I am going to vote for the increased item on these Estimates. Mr MCWILLIAMS [12.41] - I was one of those who strongly opposed any expenditure at the Capital site. In mv view we made a mistake in precipitating the movement as we did. I look upon it as a great error that we should add to .the cities in Australia. It must be palpable to all that one of the great evils in the Commonwealth today is that far too large a percentage of the people live in the cities.",34
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is on the seaboard.,34
277,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am credibly informed that the expenditure on the Federal Capital to date, exclusive of the item before the Committee, amounts to very nearly £500,000 . It is rather too late in the day, I think, to consider whether we should proceed with the work or not. There is a very serious aspect of the case, however, to be considered. To my mind this is just one of the works which should be referred to a committee in accord with the views of a very large majority on each side. members have a very small conception of the manner in which the money already spent on the Federal Capital has been used'. If my information is correct, we have spent practically £500,000, and there is an exceedingly small return to show for that expenditure.",34
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The land cost a lot you know.,34
279,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The land cost a portion of that sum.,34
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"£221,000 .",34
281,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That was an exceedingly good bargain, because the land had to be purchased in accordance with the scheme which this Parliament deliberately voted. No objection to the purchase of the land can be raised, and unless some huge blunder is made, the Commonwealth ought to get a good ret u r n from that source. The total exThat penditure today, I am credibly informed, is £500,000. Sir JOH N FOKKEST - Includin g the purchase of the land.",34
282,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Yes . That leaves considerably over a quarter of a million spent on the Federal Capital. If that be so, the information before the Committee is exceedingly limited. Not one private member, I repeat, has the slightest idea of how that money has been spent or of what return has been obtained. There are some exceedingly un(Franklin) pleasant rumours afloat as to how a very considerable portion of the money has been expended. It is the duty of the House to see that the Commonwealth gets something like a fair return for the outlay. This is, I think, just one of the proposals which should be referred to a committee, in order that they may find out the whole policy of the Governmenti n that regard. We learnt from the press this morning that a gentleman from America has been appointed for a term of three years to have the supervision of the whole of this work. To what extent is his responsibility to go? Is he to have the entire charge of the expenditure in the Federal Capital?",34
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Certainl y not.,34
284,Mr WEST,Unknown,And the right of private practice as well?,34
285,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Parliamentar y and M in isterial responsibility will still remain, but we will avail ourselves of his expert knowledge. Private Mr MCWILLIAMS - I think that when we were embarking on this large scheme the Government acted very wisely in obtaining the services of a first-class expert. In my opinion, no f a u l t can. be found with the man-.. What we want to 'know is how far will his duties and responsibilities go. ""We ought to have that in formation while this item is being discussed. Is this officer to have the entire control of the expenditure in the Feder al Territory, or are his duties to be confined simply to architectural work-that is, will lie formulate plans and allow - others to carry them out, aud take the responsibility of the expenditure? money for the purchase of the land has been voted, the land has been bought, and we are now asked to vote £285,000 for work in regard to the Capital site, but the Committee really does not know what is the general scheme in connection with the Capital, or how that sum is to be expended. Save for some few details given by the Minister, we know nothing. The best friends of the Federal Capital are - those who advise that every shilling expended there shall be spent to the best advantage. W it h in the next few years ""there must be a large expenditure. We have already spent something like half-amillion on the Capital, and must go on with its erection.

All these works must cost money, and if the Federal finances are in an embarrassed state, how can he expect the Government to carry posithem out? We know that all this talk is merely moonshine. We are financially in a sound position, and can afford to spend £280,000 on the development of the Federal Territory.

If it were necessary to get the cement required a in the building of the city from Germany or London through Melbourne or Sydvotes ney, we know that the cost would be enormously increased, and the Government deserve credit for proposing to carry out the establishment of cement works There Is another vote on the Estimates for the construction of brick work3 at Canberra.

The State of New South Wales has been very generous in this matter, and honourable has given us a large tract of country. We have been placed in possession of 900' square miles of territory, which in a few years' time will be very valuable indeed. My only complaint against the Home Affairs Department in connection with this subject is that they have not pushed on as they might have done with the plansof the buildings. I saw Colonel Owen on the matter, and he said that they could not do so u n t i l the sewerageand water supply systems were completed.",38
344,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,He .is right.,39
345,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member for Darwin when this building would have been constructed if Victoria had waited for the sewerage system of Melbourne to be completed. This building was sewered only a few years ago. It is nonsense to say that we must wait until the sewerage system is completed before we can complete the erection of buildings in the Federal Capital. Brisbane is a very fine city, in which there are many imposing buildings, but it has not yet been sewered. It is only about t h i r t y years ago that the sewerage system was established in Sydney, and there were at that time many fine buildings in the city. The reason given for not going on with the plans of the buildings will not hold water. Ifc is over twelve months since the plans for the lay-out of the city were accepted, and no permanent buildings have yet been erected. Some buildings have been erected for the Defence Department, but they are of a temporary character. The honourable member for Eden Monaro complains that some buildings have been erected on one of the main avenues of the Capital, but they are of a temporary character also. They are required for those who wil l be engaged in the erection of the Capital, and for many years they wil l not be in the way, and need not be taken down.

The honourable member for Melbourne [81] Ports tells the electors in my constituency what my attitude on this question was, and he dealt also with the attitude of the honourable member for Corangamite. The honourable member was not long in Corangamite before he got lost, as one might have expected, as soon as he got into the bush. I rise with a definite purpose. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro touched upon a very i m portant point in dealing with this subject. We have no Public Works Committee, and no Committee specially charged with the supervision of expenditure on the Federal Capital. I have never seen anything in the nature of a complete scheme for the building of the Capital put before the people.

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports was not correct in saying that I am opposed to expenditure on the Federal Capital. I am prepared to sanction such expenditure upon that undertaking as I think is consistent with the finances of the country. I share, to a large extent, the views expressed by the honourable member for Wimmera in regard to this matter. I . say that this is not the time, to embark, upon a huge expenditure on the Federal. Capital, for the reason that every £ which we expend today will commit us direction. to an expenditure of £ 1 0 in the future.

But we must recollect that we are committed to the principle of establishing a Federal Capital in our own Territory, and we are I do not think that we are bound to dist charge it immediately, but it is a matter n t ifor this Parliament to decide how soon we shall do so. It must be recollected that the Government only came into office a week before the close of the present financial year. It takes a little time to gather up the threads of administration, and we have not had sufficient time to determine exactly what we shall do in the future, and the time within which we shall do it .

Honourable members are pretty well unanimous that, having entered upon this work, we must proceed with it .

370,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [2.47] A f t e r the speech of the Treasurer, the Committee needs an explanation from some other member of the Ministry. He has told us that the Government must go slowly in the development of the Federal Capital, expending money over a long term of years. He said that the Committee could vote this amount now, an""d that after the recess we might decide what we are going to do. What is the use of voting money now if we have not made up our minds what we shall do with it? The tenor of the right honourable gentleman's speech was that matters should be deferred as much as possible.",41
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No . people Mr MCDONALD - That is the impression lef t on the minds of the Committee, and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, as well as the Prime M i nister and the honourable member for Richmond, were looking very serious during the Treasurer's speech. Mr - KELLY - We did not misapprehend the Treasurer, as the honourable member seems to have done.",41
372,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The Honorary Minister knows him. We should be told definitely what the Government are going to do in this matter. There are members on both sides who have supported the Capital expenditure, and they are prepared to vote a reasonable amount for developmental work. The Treasurer tells us uow that Ministers are not going to spend any of the money; but that next y - if they are in office, he says-the y e a r will come down with a proposal. We should like to know what is to be done now.",41
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We are going to spend £285,000, if the Committee approves.",41
374,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [2.48] I expected this Government, instead of proposing a large expenditure on the Federal Capital,- to provide a small amount merely to keep the trees growing that were planted by the honourable meiiuber for Darwin. In the interests of Australia, economy of that kind is needed. Things have altered very much since the Federal Capital project was first mooted. The Commonwealth had then no Territory of its own, but we have now the immense Northern Territory, on the development of which we could very well spend the money proposed to be spent on laying out a Capital, and might very well, too, spend money on making the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, which will give access to the Macdonnell Ranges, where the climate is the finest in the world, and where the Federal Capital might well be located. The Federal Capital Territory, which comprises only 568,227 acres, is very small, compared with the Northern Territory.",41
375,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It is very good country.,42
376,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"It must be, as it carries only 1,762 horses, 8,000 cattle, and 224,000 sheep; but there are rabbits there by the million. If they were erect a rabbit-proof fence round the Termonwealth in my electorate. ritory, that would improve it in a - that would benefit the people of tralia.",42
377,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,That is being there-and done.,42
378,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"The Minister Home Affairs told us that it is proposed to build a dam at a cost of £40,000. Fancy that expenditure on water conserthere vation in that country. If we were asked to vote for a scheme like the Kalgoorlie gallons daily. water supply, which would be valuable to the people, it would be another matter. At most, there will not be more than mum. 6,000 persons living in the Capital for jnany years to come, and I do not see the need for spending £40,000 now to provide them with water. I do not think there is any place in Australia more unsuitable for a Federal Capital than is the berra site. There is no stone within miles for building purposes, and the is fit only for firewood, and not much good for that; while the only water ply is from a little creek called the Cotter. The time will come when some Government will, in the interests of Ausney. tralia, put a stop to the wicked waste public money that is now taking place. I am not jealous of Sydney, although am a South Australian. I say that, if you want a Capital, choose Sydney, or somewhere near Sydney. When coming from the Old Land to Sydney, some Yankees on board the steamer said, "" You people do not know anything about ading that railway. vertising. You have this lovely harbour, and no one ever hears of it . They tell us that you are going to build a Capital 100 miles out in the bush."" Parliament will meet in the Capital for only a few months in the year. What will the people resident there have to do during the remaining months ? They will have no facilities for educating their children, nor for living in a civilized way. This year it is proposed to spend £250,000 on preparing for the erection of the Capital, and already nearly £500,000 has been spent, while the return from the Territory is only a little over £2,000.",42

385,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [3.0]. - It is amusing how our Victorian friends desire to retain the Capital in Melbourne. I shall support the amendment; and I hope we shall be successful in reducing the vote to what it was last year. I have no sympathy with the amendment forecasted by the honourable member for Wannon. He is simply attempting to side-track the whole issue. The day for inquiry by Royal Commission in connection with this matter is past. Our only care now is to exercise careful vigilance as to the expenditure of this money. Laying out a city is an expensive matter, and should be done on the soundest lines possible, for the judicious expenditure of £150,000 at the start may mean a considerable saving in the future. Honourable members may be surprised at my supporting the amendment of the - honourable member for Grey, but I do so for one reason. The charge levelled - against the past Admnistration was their extravagance in connection with expenditure on the Capital site.",43
386,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Is that your only reason?,43
387,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,Absolutely. There are some questions that should be above party.,43
388,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,But not above merit,43
389,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"We have put the us? - defence of Australia above party, and I think it would be well to p ut the question of the Federal Capital above party, and I speak as a representative of one of the smaller States that has to foot the bill. This expenditure is not popular in South Australia. The workers there do not resent it so much as the well-to-do. I have had many discussions in regard to it with merchants and the well-to-do people, and my answer has always been that, because the citizens of Australia. placed a certain provision in the Constitution, it should be honoured by both parties. At the last election, the late Government were charged with wanton extravagance in regard the money they were spending the Federal Capital site,' and, in the face - of those charges, how can honourable members supporting the present .Minist r y vote lor double the previous expenditure? It was to their interests to lie .aibout their ""opponents in order to .get into office; it was a good thing, in the in terests of party politics, to deceive the electors; but is it a good thing for - puiblic men, and those assisting them, to delude the electors, and throw dust in their eyes by false statements for party purposes? I shall vote for the amendment for that reason. I am in favour of this Capital site. If it came to a question of the Government being beaten on this vote, I should side with them, because I believe in keeping the compact; but I say there should be a recognised principle that matters of this character are not party questions; and the only way this can be brought home to any Government that tries to trifle with a serious - question like this for party purposes is to refuse to pass votes. If I can bring the item down, down it shall go for that reason, and for that reason alone. Necessarily the .great masses of the people are not experts, and look to their public men to guide them and supply them with information. If the item is passed as it is, the effect on the general community will be that very little will be thought of certain public men after the statements which they made at the last election for party purposes. There is a remark of Bisuiarck which it is worth our while to recollect. "" God save us,"" he said, "" from a race o men f with hearts of stone and hides of leather.""",43
390,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Do you appty that to,43
391,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I do not apply the remark to honourable members, but I say that nothing wil l have a greater tendency in that direction than will the evil I have pointed out. I hope that the amendment will be carried as a salutary lesson that, while the compact made by all the States and all the people of the States should be redeemed, the expenditure on the Federal Capital should not be made use of for electioneering purposes, as it was by men who with their tongues in their cheeks, circulated reports which they knew to be false, and never on one single occasion put the issue straight and 'square before the country. to on Mr GREGORY (Dampier) [3.7] Had I been here when the question of - building the Capital at Canberra was first raised, I think I would have voted against the expenditure of any money there, but we must realise the position as it exists today, and assist the Government to carry out the work to which the Parliament has been committed. think it would have been far better had the whole of the expenditure in connection with the construction of this city been provided from loan funds, because it is a work for posterity.",43
392,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown, sinking f u n d .,44
393,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Yes . I have risen to speak on account of the speech made by the honourable member for Eden Monaro. He represents the . district round the Capital site, and he has told us of the gross extravagance in connection with the work there. It does seem absurd to me that honourable' members should get up and say that the Government are carrying on the same extravagance as has taken place in the past simply because a larger expenditure is proposed on these Estimates. Surely it is not an argument, because more money is asked for now, that we are going to have greater extravagance in the future. There are the commitments of the previous Administrat i o n ; there are the works essential to the building up of the city, which require more money, and therefore a larger vote is necessary. But we have been told today, on the authority of an honourable member who lives adjacent to the district, that there has been gross extravagance at the Capital site. It is the duty of Parliament to insist, and I think that before this item is passed we should have a definite assurance from the Prime M in ister, that a full inquiry shall be made into the work that has been carried on. Otherwise we shall not be able' to satisfy the public as to whether there has, or has uot, been extravagance. We ought to kuow the position thoroughly. It is the duty of the House to appoint a Committee to inquire as to whether in the past the work has been carried out on proper and economical lines, and also to advise Parliament in regard to future expenditure. I recognise that to a very great extent the Minister must be in the hands of the heads of his Department. W it h the work of Parliament proceeding, and his presence here being continuously necessary, he is not able to go into all the details of the works which are essential. I think we should insist upon the fullest particulars being given to the Committee in regard to the proposals of the Government for the future, what money is to be expended, and how it is to be spent. I am I one of those who are entirely opposed to the day-labour system. Many works can be well carried out on that principle, but in ordinary practice I believe that the contract system is far better. However, I do not want to go into the details of W it h a proper that subject now.",44
394,Mr WEST,Unknown,Y o u are courting a discussion.,44
395,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I am only expressing an opinion. When we are dealing with the question of railways. I think I shall be able to discuss the subject much better than I could do on an item of this sort. I only desire now to make my position clear. I think that the Minister should give us an assurance that Parliament will have fuller information in regard to the methods which are to be adopted for carrying out this great work at the Capital site in the future. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro made statement after statement relating to gross extravagance in the past. As representatives of the people it is our duty to see that the extravagance, if it has taken place, is not continued. But the mere fact that a larger amount 1 is asked for in these Estimates does not denote that there is going to be extravagance in the f u t u r e . Our duty is to see that the money is properly expended in the best interests of the people.",44
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [3.13] - Honourable members who have spoken, especially the new members, have asked for information to be given to the Committee as to what is to be done at the Capital site, and therefore cannot be expected to know that the fullest possible information is already in Hansard about the whole scheme.",44
397,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,No .,44
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is a definite scheme,44
399,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He is an old member, too, who says "" No . "" He should know.",44
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think that even an old member knows what I am going to say.,44
401,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is quite possible.,44
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I respectfully submit that it would be just as well to let me finish my sentence. There is a definite plan of development mapped out for the Federal Territory, showing the processes each year by which the Capital is to come to f r u it i o n. before Parliament for some time. Plans have been laid down definitely, and all that we have done recently has been to take care that while that process of evolution is going on the original plan is not seriously departed-from. Mr Griffin has been retained to see that his own design of the Capital, which won first prize in a world-wide competition, is f a it h full y and properly carried out.",44
403,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That is only the city area. What about the large Federal Territory? We want to know the whole scheme.,45
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I invite the honourable member to read the statement which was put before the House last year by his own Minister, and if he does he will find all the details.",45
405,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,It is given in the schedule every two months.,45
406,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,That is only a catalogue of expenditure; it does not go into the whole question.,45
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I confess I do not know what is indicated here. I wish it could be put more plainly, because I am unable to perceive just what is wanted.",45
408,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Jus t a nice word picture.,45
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know that there are statements about extravagance. Who makes them, where do they come from , and what are they Distinguish between the plan of the Capital, the general scheme outlined, and the method of carrying it into effect. Make a sharp distinction between the two. The statements made from time to time by the honourable member for Eden Monaro are to the effect that there is gross extravagance going on in regard to the employment of labour.",45
410,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I do not say that there is now, but it is a matter of public knowledge that there has been.",45
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If it is not going on now, but has gone on in the past, it will be most difficult for the honourable member to get to know anything about it .",45
412,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I do not thin k so.,45
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"1 know the honourable member does not, and that for that reason he is asking «for further in quiry. But I hope honourable members will give us some little credit for having tried to sift some of these allegations. It It has all been seems to me that we get no credit for what we try to do. I say at once that I do not know where the extravagance is or I would point it out. I believe, however, that what in many respects is a fault y system has been pursued in regard to the Capital city. I am not here, to say that everything has gone right. I am only pointing out the difficulties of getting to the bottom of these complaints.",45
414,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"What about the five launches that were bought by the late Government. I believe that they are at the bottom of the sea now. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Well , if they are they must have been insured, so that the loss will be covered.",45
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Every one knows that launches were bought, and that bad purchases have been made. There is no need, therefore, for inquiry. But if the honourable member for Wannon would indicate to me what useful purpose could be served by an in quiry, I would give him one tomorrow. Indeed, I would not w a it; I would undertake the inquiry myself. But let us get down to bed-rock, in regard to these matters.' I dissent altogether from the statements that have been made today that these works in the Federal Capital should be held up u n t i l inquiry has been made. The time has gone by for holding up the building of about? the Capital, and the work must go on, but in a reasonable way. I never could, and cannot now, understand why Victorian representatives should oppose this expenditure. My own opinion is that by-andby we shall see a railway running through Gippsland, and connecting Melbourne with the Federal Capital- a railway that will give a quicker route to Sydney than we have now, and which will bring Melbourne, from every point of view, into pretty close touch with the Federal,Capital. Wisely and properly administered, the Federal Capital should not cost the country one half-penny, and, in my judgment, it will not. The moment this Parliament and the administrative officers of the Commonwealth go there, we shall have such a tremendous accretion to land values as will put this proposition on an entirely satisfactory footing, and make it a paving, andeven a profitable, concern.",45
416,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,But is not the Committee entitled to have before it a complete scheme indicating all the different phases of this undertaking.,45
417,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The time for that is when the general Estimates are before us.,46
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope that the Committee will accept my assurance thab we are going, as far as we can, to prevent any waste of money. If honourable members will only give us a little time, we shall sift to the bottom a lot of these, allegations; but everything cannot be done at once. We have been in office only three months, and it is too much to say that everything should be straightened out, every allegation cleared up, explanations made and forecasts given, and plans prepared at once for works which are to proceed for years and years ahead. I say frankly and decisively that such a demand is unreasonable.",46
419,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"We have been waiting three or four years for such a scheme. Mr. JOSEPH COOK' -.Then it is only reasonable that the honourable member should wait another three or four months for it. Whatever happens, this. Government is nob. to be held accountable for any delay in this matter. There can be no delay. Jf my honourable friendswill be just a little patient, we shall put fore the Committee every scintilla of information in the Deparbmenb, and they will know exactly what we are doing, what is proposed to be done, and under what conditions. But we cannot do everything in a day.",46
420,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member used pretty strong language last year, when these Estimates were before us, in regard to the lack of information respecting the Federal Capital works.",46
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And I tell the honourable member now that I do not think things are satisfactory up there. When he asks me why they are not, I can only reply that I believe that dissatisfaction must inhere under the very system which has been carried out there in regard to the employment of labour and other things.",46
422,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"But there is the purchase of land and other items, about which we ought to have full information.",46
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as I know, the ibem under discussion does not provide a farthing for the purchase of land. After these Works Estimates are through, a Loan. Bill, will be brought clown, and the honourable member will be able then to discuss the question of land tenune in the Federal Territory. He knows that we wish to carry these Works Esimates ab once, so thab we may go ahead and provide employment for the labour that is dependent on the voting of these sums. The whole question will be considered later - on. There will be many opportunities to discuss the policy of. the whole scheme; but this is neither the place nor the time to discuss the whole policy of the Federal Capital. At this, stage, we have only to say whether the money asked for in this Bill shall be voted for the purpose of the labour waiting to be employed on public works, and vobed in time to enable it to be expended within the financial year. A third of the financial year has already gone, and until we can get authority to expend this money it cannot be expended.",46
424,Mr FENTON,Unknown,A lob of ib has already been spent.,46
425,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"About £50,000 out of the Treasurer's Advance. That is all.",46
426,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"The longer we talk, the more we save.",46
427,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And that is what the be- Prime Minisber gebs from his majority.,46
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"-It strikes me that a good deal of my majority on this particular question is to be found on the Opposition side, bub ib does not exist to see me through. I am under no delusion on that point. I believe there is a sincere desire on the part of honourable members that the construction of the Capital shall be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment, and I am in hopes bhat before long we shall be able to propound a scheme which will so conserve the interests of the Territory as to make it , in the near future, a completely self-supporting proposition. I should like to say oneword, further.. I subscribe entirely to the statement made by the honourable member for Dampier that this money oughb to come out of loan funds. It ought to be put to the debit of the Federal Capital. I believe that every penny of it will berepaid with interest in the future, if only wise, business principles be applied to the development and evolution of the Federal Territory. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin). [3,26].:-I . should not have said anythingon this vote if the statement had not been attributed to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that there had been extraordinary and wilful extravagance at Canberra. If so, I cannot understand how I did not hear of it. I spent enough time at the Home Affairs office and in the Territory. I suppose that no Minister, in the history of Australasia, ever worked as I did. I was at work from 8 o'clock in the morning til l any hour at night, and my name is to be found on the attendancebook at the Home Affairs office the same as that of any other hired man there. I cannot understand how honourable members can get up here and say that they have not received any information. The fact that they have said so is an indication that there are obstructionists, or fools, in this House. Por over two and a-half years I issued a schedule of works carried out by the Home Affairs Depart* ment, and everything done in the Eederal Territory was set out there. Did honourable members read that schedule? If they did not, what, in the name of God, is the use of publishing any information for them ? The schedule contained the history of works in the Federal Territory for every two months. The present Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has continued the issue of the schedule, and honourable members are supplied with information about all the works that are going on there. Still, they say that they have received no. information, and that there is no system. Of course, there is not if honourable members will not read what is placed before them. ""We shall have to start a kindergarten here to teach some honourable members. I challenge any honourable member to look at a copy of Number 13, 14, or 15 of the schedule, and say whether it does not supply information about all the expenditure in the Federal Territory. There is not a word said in this House about the millions we throw away on defence. Although the warships we have built will be on the scrap-heap within the next ten or fifteen years, there is no objection to the money spent upon them. But there is a hueand-cry against everything done to carry out the compact entered into with the Government of New South Wales, although, in the Eederal Territory, we shall have an asset such as no other nation in the world possesses.",46
429,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We have not got it all yet. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have got it . The Territory is ours. Eighty thousand acres have been purchased. There is no hurry about the rest, and why should we spend a lot of money before it is necessary to do so? I selected Colonel Miller to take charge of the business, and he is admitted to be a very able administrator. He was selected to carry out the great scheme for the welcome of the American Fleet, and Admiral Sperry told me that he never saw anything better organized.  down. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He has not been turned down. He is the Administrator of the Eederal Territory, though the Government have not yet had time to pass an Act for his appointment.",47
430,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Why did not the honourable gentleman's Government do it? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They could not do everything. Honourable members must not forget that this Commonwealth Parliament will last longer than either the Labour or the Conservative party. Men are mortal, and they die, but this Parliament is immortal. If the Government are game, I am prepared now to take the whole show off their hands, finance it myself, and make, lots of money out of it. Some honourable members talk about going to Sydney. Let them go to Sydney, and they will have to pay £1,000,000 for 15 or 20 acres of ground near Sydney. Yet here we have 560,000 acres. One of the Yankee financiers who was present at the opening of the Eederal Capital said to me, ""Lord, if we had only kept the ground at Washington!"" Why, in the next fifteen or twenty years the income from ground rents will be almost sufficient to meet the interest on the construction of the Federal Capital. I want honourable members to specify some particular extravagance. I have a fairly good reputation as a business man. I do not trouble about what people say as to my character, but I have some respect for my reputation as a business man. I do not want that to go. I want my honourable friends whp make these charges - to specify some particular extravagance, and I ""hall then ask the Minister to call upon the Administrator of the Eederal Territory 2218 Additions, New Works, [REPRESENTATIVES.] to investigate the expenditure complained of. I have heard the tale of the fellow who got drunk at Queanbeyan, and of the other fellow who was brought up for chasing him, and said that he was working for the Home Affairs Department. All this is only side-stepping. what Colonel Miller is, and if he has neglected his work he ought not to be there. I sent him up there because so many complaints were being made. am sorry that this House should become such a growling establishment. ters have to depend on their officers. Mr LAIR D SMITH - And should be protected by their Ministers.",47
431,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I am sure that those who were present at the laying of the foundation-stone of the commemorative column at the Federal Capital, and saw how people were brought there and sent away again, must have recognised that there was system and organization at work. It is like the talk of Mrs. Somebody, who told Mrs Somebody-else of what another woman had done. Though, of course, she was not the kind of woman to say anything about any one, she started the report all the same.",48
432,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,What about the water supply of Canberra?,48
433,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,We have the Cotter River.,48
434,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"River ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , it is a beautiful river. I admit that many years ago, in this House, I said that a crow would have to carry his water-bag £1,000 a year. there. That was before I had information. I talked too quickly and too much then.",48
435,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"An average daily flow 23,000,000 gallons is fair l y good. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , it is. I say that at the Federal Capital we a better water supply than has Melbourne scheme ? or Sydney.",48
436,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Oh , no.",48
437,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Yes , we have. The honourable member for South Sydney complains that we have not do started to erect the buildings before completion of the sewerage. Let me tell the honourable member the experience of Melbourne in putting in the sewerage tem after the city had been built. If sewerage system had been put in first 40 per cent, might have been saved i Buddings, the. construction of this city. Accordingly we determined to first establish a water and sewerage system. How can the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs enter upon the erection of buildings u n t i l he has put in a water service for the inhabiI know tants of the Capital city?",48
438,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,What is the estimated cost of the entire project?,48
439,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"At the end I of 500 years it will have cost £5,000,000 or £6,000,000. Minis- Mr Rodgers - What is the estimated cost of setting up all the Federal acthe officers tivities within the Federal Capital area ?",48
440,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It will cost a little over £1,000,000 to get the scheme started upon right lines, but at the end of 500 years the undertaking will have .cost £5,000,000 or £6,000,000. There is no hurry about the scheme-it can grow gradually. I am pleased that the Ministry have brought out Mr . Griffin from Chicago. When I was Minister of Home Affairs, I appointed a Board which decided upon a composite plan, out of the different designs which were submitted. I confess that I had not the courage to bring Mr . Griffin to this country, because people would immediately have said that one Yankee was bringing out another. I wish to point out, however, that the Government are not paying this expert a sufficient salary. They are sweating him. From what I can learn, he has an i m mense business in Chicago.",48

442,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I had a conversation with him, and I found that he is like all other artistic men. He of does not wish to see the scheme of his intellect destroyed by somebody else.",48
443,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Ye t the honourable memhave ber appointed a Board which upset his,48
444,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"That Board did good work, because Mr Griffin has already made changes in his own scheme. That circumstance evidences what we can if we act in an intelligent way. In the the Department of Home Affairs, there is another great man, who is an architect I refer to Mr Murdoch. I l o a n e d that sysofficer to the ex-Minister of External the Affairs, who sent him to England. The result was that he put 14,000 cubic feet n the of space more into the Commonwealth offices there than did the London architect. In other words, he increased the rental value of those buildings by £3,000 a year.",48
445,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Then why import another man? Mr KING . O'MALLEY - Because Mr Griffin is the creator of the winning design.,49
446,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On e man is a town planner, and the other is an architect. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Exactly . Mr Murdoch studied the Post Office at Chicago, and also visited Washington, and I am satisfied that the joint labours of that gentleman and of Mr Griffin w provide us with a great city.",49
447,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [3.40] - I am very reluctant to take up the time of the Committee, or to interfere with the progress of business. Bu""t I must remind the Prime Minister that there are very deep-lying principles which are affected by this vote-principle s which compel honourable members to state their position even at the risk of repeating what they have said on previous occasions. When I entered this House, the question of the site of the Federal Capital had been practically decided. Only one division was taken subsequently, and, on that occasion, I voted for the Government of the day. opinion isunshaken that we are just about fifty years ahead of our time in making extravagant provision for a Federal Capital.",49
448,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,Fift y years behind the times.,49
449,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"We have to respect the provisions of the Constitution, I know. But having secured the site for the Federal Capital, there is no reason why it should not be handled as a business proposition, and there is no reason why we should build the city until the necessity arit.es. The site has been settiea, and ccsiderable commitments nave been incurred.",49
450,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,What did the orable member say during .ris election campaign 1,49
451,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I said what I am saying now. We have been charged by honourable members opposite with having denounced the shocking extravagance of the previous Administration. I do not deny it . Until a thorough examination has been made of what has been done, I shall continue to denounce that extravagance. If it is proved by a proper impartial tribunal that I am wrong, there is nobody who will more readily apologize to this House and the people of the Commonwealth. But until the expenditure of public money in connection with the Federal Capital site and other big undertakings has been impartially investigated, I shall continue to say that there has been maladministration in the expenditure of the taxpayers' money, and an extravagance the extent of which nobody can possibly decide. My statements in the ill past have been severe, sincere, and conscientious, and they will be repeated u n t i l we are afforded an opportunity to prove that they are wrong. I readily admit that the action of the Government in bringing Mr Griffin to Australia was a splendid one, and one which ought to allay to a considerable extent the misgivings of the people of the Commonwealth. I am still more delighted to find that his expressions of opinion have not been adversely criticised by other experts. I am particularly pleased to know that Mr Griffin has stated definitely that the natural features of the country surrounding the Federal Capital site are such as lend themselves to the creation of a new and up-to-date city, which My will equal anything that we may desire. . Although I have not seen the Federal Capital area, and although I have misgivings, I feel justified in leaving the matter in the hands of the expert who has drawn the accepted designs for the Capital, and has made a personal examination of the site, giving an opinion upon it which has not been controverted by any responsible authority in Australia. I shall, therefore, vote against the amendment of the honourable member for Grey, which, if it means anything at all, means the practical cessation of work on the Capital. We have passed that stage. The opinion of the people, and of the press of the Commonwealth, is that the hon- die has been cast, and the site of the Federal Capital finally determined. Being thus committed, we cannot go back. In regard to the amendment foreshadowed by - the honourable member for Wannon, I gather the i m pression from the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government, if we gave them time, would determine to the satisfaction of honourable members that they were on the right lines, and that they would demonstrate that the site that has been chosen is the site that ought to be built on.",49
452,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,We are al l agreed as to thab.,50
453,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Then I am willing bo vote for a thorough inquiry into the manner in which public money has already been spent on the Capital sibe.  postpone the item ?,50
454,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I think bhat it should not be postponed. In the interests of Australia we should proceed with this matber. If the honourable member for Darwin is satisfied that the money thab has been expended has been spent on work f a it h full y carried out, and that the expenditure has been in the interests of the taxpayers, he will vote for a thorough inquiry.",50
455,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I have no objection.,50
456,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member is too big a man to object to submit his work to investigation. But the spirit of unrest and distrust throughout the Commonwealth in regard to public expenditure on this and other undertakings will not be allayed u n t il there Has been a thorough and impartial investigation. Those who supporbed the last Administration will not, if they have confidence in it , Oppose an inquiry. I have great admiration for, and confidence in , the integrity and ability of Colonel Miller, but as Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs, he held a position requiring the utmost human strength arid ability for the proper performance of its duties. Y e the has been sent to the Federal Capital Territory to act as its Administrator, and the other day, in giving evidence in relation to railway matters, he said bliat he was Manager of the Commonwealth Railways, and responsible for their construction. One of these railways is the biggest individual proposition that Australia has ever faced. This is the day of specialists and specialization.",50
457,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Does the honourable member reflect on Colonel Miller? Mr RICHARD FOSTEfe - No ; but I say that, notwithstanding, liis ability,.he cannot satisfactorily fill al l these positions.",50
458,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Has this Ministry altered the arrangement?,50
459,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I do nob know; but, if not, it should be alteredat the earliest date. Ministerial responsibility cannot be shifted on bo the' shoulders of permanent heads of Departmenbs, because, in the last resort, responsibility cannot properly attach to them. When the time comes, I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Wannon for an independent and exhaustive inquiry iubo the expenditure on the Federal Capital site. It would be inappropriate at this moment to deal with other matters, b ut I hope that the same investigation that is earnestly desired, and that will have to come, in connection with the expenditure on the Capital site, will be applied to other things. As a Commonwealth, we are a young body in regard to public works. We cannot regard the Commonwealth in the light of an oldestablished public service, where we should have efficiency in every direction, and expert officers of the highest character in every department. We have not the officers, the machinery, or the plant, and, so far as public works are concerned, we are only in our infancy. That being so', We have begun on a wrong basis, we have adopted wrong principles, and the only thing to do is to institute a thorough inquiry in the inberests of the people whose money we are spending. Until we do so we are not justified in occupying our positions in the House.",50
460,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honor ary Minister) [3.57] - There seems to be a desire for an inquiry. I suggest that a detailed statement of the expenditure be provided for the Committee, and when, that information is submitted, if honourable members will specify in what particular direction they desire an inquiry, the Government can consider the question. That should meet the views of honourable members generally. I shall give the details and specifications of the expenditure as full y as possible, and I suggest that as we have been a long time discussing this ibem, we should now take a vobe upon it .",50

It is deplorable to find any members in such a position. are desiring to put themselves right In at the expense of-who m ? At the expense of the officers of the Departments, cannot defend themselves. The honourable member for Wannon is tryin g to side-track this issue, and to bluff the electors by bringing down a proposal in which I question very much whether one honourable member on the other side believes. Why does, he take that course? Suppose that he gets the delay he seeks. What will it mean? It will mean the stoppage of the plant at the Capital site. The machinery will be hung up, and every practical man knows that when machinery is hung up it deteriorates beyond measure. Are we going to incur that waste to enable the honourable member for .Wannon, and a few others who made rash statements on the hustings, to defeat a Government who did more for Australia than any other Government had done ? At the elections these honourable gentlemen made rash statements, and now, to put themselves right in the eyes of the electors, before whom they expect to go shortly, they want to stop the gress of a great undertaking for twelve months at the very least. The country is committed to expenditure at the Capital site. The honourable member for Wimmera is in precisely the same boat. He suggests, purely for political purposes, that it is the honourable member for Eden Monaro who has got this huge sum placed upon the Estimates. The majority the. Government! The honourable member for Wimmera practically said that the Government had a majority, because they allocated this huge sum to the Capital site section in the constituency of Eden Monaro.",51

469,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,52
470,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"There are, 1 believe, quite a number of honourable members who are prepared to support the honourable member for Wannon; hence he may find himself in trouble that he did not expect. I am not going to say how I shall vote on his proposal.",52
471,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"You are chewing your own words, then?",52
472,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"All I wish to say now is that it is not my intention to vote for cutting down this item one iota. I am of the opinion that it is absolutely necessary that the Capital should be built, and built as quickly and effectively that. as possible. I am still of the opinion that the money spent there will not be wasted, because, as we enhance the value of the country by our expenditure, the Commonwealth will participate in the unearned increment. Increasing by leaps .and bounds, like the nails in the shoe, that money will be giving interest, which will give compound interest; and the day is not far distant when the expenditure on the Capital site will be repaid ten-fold. That is the best investment which has ever been made in Australia. All that the little Victorians can see is the little centre in which they are. The honourable member for Wannon cannot get out of the limitation of his own electorate; aud to put himself right with his constituents he has to put his own Government in a dreadful hole. I wish to draw the attention of the Chairman to the fact that the Government's majority has crossed to this side of the chamber. It is quite gratifying to me, as the honourable member for Denison, to know that I have pro- brought him over to this side; and in such good company I feel that he will see the error of his ways, and that we shall have a Labour member for Wannon next time.",52

474,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"An honourable of member interjected that the attack of the honourable member for Wakefield was venomous. There is no doubt that it was. The honourable member for Wimmera evidently did not realise what he was saying, because, as soon as the honourable member for Ballarat pinned him to his statement, as it was understood in the Chamber, he wished to make out that he was not responsible for the statement. The honourable member for Ballarat deserves the thanks of not only the people of New South Wales, but the people of Australia, for rising to the occasion and throwing off the fetters of Victoria and the influence of the Victorians, and saying that he will vote for the carrying out of this great national undertaking.",52
