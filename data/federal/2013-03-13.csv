The criticism of this government is that, The Productivity Commission did a thorough recommendations and rejected others.

For the alternative government to attack $200 million could be better used, that its recommendation in this direction, I think is suppose that is its approach to economics, just government is a high-taxing government The truth is the highest-taxing government government.

We do not accept the criticism from $200 million from the EFIC fund would be advice from the Productivity Commission preserved.

Indeed, on the day that this media commitments around it, a quite significant developer at Clermont, which is in the heart proposals have been put forward to expand these have brought the questions of housing use of fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out like Moranbah, Dysart, Clermont, stood up in opposition to the loss of member, I was regularly being asked to come and public meetings and respond to inquiries in drive-out and what that means for the communities but also those communities in like Mackay. That is the most obvious one, as a local member I was up against the problem government has really been involved in and it necessarily or obviously has many a local member, I was really in the position of workforces as they were impacting on the a perception or value judgement perspective. I enough when you are a member of parliament and has to be a more rigorous, comprehensive and it? What is the scale of it? How many people are What are the consequences? What are the I was very keen on this inquiry. I thought that a necessarily to provide answers but at least to the issue of fly-in fly-out workers. people's choices about where they live, what you think about fly-in fly-out, if it is going to that it is projected to be we need to understand What are the costs? What are the opportunities? to be on the federal government's agenda and its policies intersected with fly-in fly-out, measure and assess those problems and to be part that the inquiry could shed some light on was the I was confronting this as a local member it is people's choice.' People choose to live on the take up work in the mining regions. You are always with people making that free choice? and people in the mining industry in places like there's a waiting list for houses. If people to live on the coast, why is there a waiting list number of people would choose to live here if it report was released and we were fulfilling our article in my local newspaper referred to a of the Bowen Basin, who has completed 70 homes in that town and is turning the sod on Bowen Basin, why is this developer putting the town of Clermont? I just wanted to You will see that a bit of a theme running the playing field. We made recommendations company housing, for example, as opposed cetera, and we recommended changes to the about making it a genuine choice. When it everyone in a mining town will tell you, is available and affordable in those towns. One of the problems that I saw with this choice where, while companies and state governments fly-in fly-out, they were ignoring or completely in mining towns or regional inland centres. becomes the norm and towns are overtaken population's right to choose to fly-in fly-out people who want to live, make their lives towns. The towns would become so diminished infrastructure, pressure on services et cetera those towns. So the theme of our recommendations to people. The point made by the member for Riverina goes to that as well. To have a fully functioning you must have accurate data about who lives infrastructure from that town and really get how they should then be properly and fairly communities. The example given by the member the local member. The official population 8½ thousand. On any given night, there would that number growing by the day, living in good quality of life in Moranbah if health, you name it-cater for a population of 7½ thousand about 15,000 or 16,000. The other thing that really motivated planning. One of the big myths, as far as between what companies are ostensibly prepared from what they are prepared to do in investing or state governments treat it like a gold knows how long it will last?'-and at the same to invest in a $6 billion railway line.' Clearly, port, they would figure that it would last talking about 15 or 20 years, which is a whole hoped this inquiry could get to the bottom of. get the minerals out of the ground and pretend another 80. Again, if no-one wants to live in the his time and money into building 150 houses in pop the bubble of this choice argument. through the recommendations is a desire to level about the fringe benefits tax treatment of to the FBT treatment of work camps, flights et zone allowance. These recommendations are all comes to choice, the other important thing, as that there has to be housing. Housing has to be argument is that we were getting to a point were constantly defending people's choice to devaluing the choice that people make to live If you get to the point where fly-in fly-out by work camps, in defending one part of the you are completely denying a genuine choice to and make communities in those inland mining by the lack of volunteers, pressure on that you would no longer have a choice to live in was largely around trying to return choice in his closing remarks about the ABS data town with good services and good amenities, in the town and who is seeking services and an accurate grasp of what those figures are and reflected in the funding that flows to for Riverina is one that I know very well as of Moranbah, according to census data, would be be at least another 7,000 or 8,000 people, with work camps in that town. You no longer have a education, roads, sewerage, childcare servicespeople when they are being stretched to me to pursue this inquiry was the question of I can see, is choice. Another is the mismatch to do in terms of infrastructure as distinct in communities, housing et cetera. Companies rush-'Why would you invest in the town? Who time others say, 'Hang on, everyone is looking if people are investing in a railway line and a for more than three, four or five years. We are generation. That is the other mismatch that I It is all just go, go, go-build the infrastructure, it is all going to be over in four or five yearswhen communities are saying: 'Hang on, what railway line, but we cannot build a house.' One of the things that we were really recommendation 18 in the report-is what different attitude to mining development over countries and the places that we are talking of us are anti mining, and none of the people they just want to be able to live a decent life alongside the mining activity. In Canada we there seemed to be much more readiness for and say: 'Hang on, you want this out of the mine.' At every step of the way the local governments, which is not something that necessarily for other states. In Canada we saw a different Canada are the same that operate in Australia companies are much more prepared to initiate proactive, not just in engaging with communities, but also in rounding up other companies Recommendation 18 goes to the notion that of what we saw in Canada and take a much more projection and collection of data so that we have the resource activity means for the region-for population projection? Instead of making have a much more comprehensive view about planning around community needs could take place This was a very important exercise in putting urging the federal government to be proactive one form or other, whether it is in social costs front foot with this.

That has been reflected in the chamber. I would like to stress that the title overreacted to the title, which is 'Cancer of the question that poses both sides of this argument.

The that: recommendations. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the mining to fear from this report. The mining industry, Australia, has every right to be a bit gun shy have nothing to fear from this report. In fact, utilising it to help work positively towards to live and work. This report only reflects the evidence that process. The recommendations are a direct response that in my mind. Part of this evidence that I information, including data and policies on member for Riverina and the member for Capricornia fundamental problem when you have 7,000 people outskirts. The pressure that that brings to quite overpowering. The evidence also displayed government's ability to look out for regional shortly. Essentially, this inquiry highlighted two FIFO workforces are having a devastating effect FIFO can provide Australians with opportunity without uprooting their lives. But we also heard on families within the cities that are affected.

Where do we end up with towns that support mining communities if wilderness? The committee also noted this point and projects, or projects in a construction communities.

Also, once Western Australia. So often we hear in this and that we are the saviour of this nation, industry and elsewhere.

We have to come up with the long-term these problems. As the member for O'Connor regional Australia gets its fair share of the nation, and we have to make sure that that addresses these areas. I note what has happened Sydney, where we have seen 19 applications next level, whereas every other region This is not the way to address these problems. and this is what we need to get away from population base in regional and rural Australia contribution. My view is that, if we get government the pie around properly, then everyone can agriculture, from manufacturing or from services. focus on where the population base is and in population base is.

We have a regional aviation provider able to use the opportunities that have been to service the mining communities. It has done commercial aviation business which services areas. Being able to offer additional services has enabled it to continue to grow and, in continue to provide very good services. We are also seeing regional communities and their operations wherever they may be occurring. regional and rural areas who are facing Australian dollar and due to the carbon tax nothing to benefit them. The fact that they have mining industry has enabled them to offer services across the nation. It is giving them the opportunity to service the mining industry across the globe. to take into account when we look at this issue. In summary, this report deals with a series communities which are hosting the growth develop in and around their local communities. service issues and serious land release issues communities. There are other aspects that need make sure when we look at this issue that we challenge that has opportunities for the whole for increased mobility in workforces, we are telling evidence about the different phases that Obviously, the construction phase more heavily into these communities.

This is a very significant inquiry for the what are referred to in the report as the source drive-out workers live and where their families forward to this report. I put in a submission, Coast, where my seat of MCPherson is located. My initial reaction, when I saw the report, title? I think that the title of a report is intended Cancer of the bush or salvation for our cities? really sets a poor scene for the inquiry and am very disappointed with that. But as the member for MCPherson on the Gold was only a very brief reference to the Gold headed 'Source communities'. This was a paragraphs, so it was really quite brief in terms whilst there is considerable detail in the report drive-out on rural communities, there is significantly and the benefits for those communities and As a member of the federal parliament, I am of a mine site; I fly in and out of Canberra and of the impact that my choice of career has no argument from me that the ideal situation But for many workers this is not possible, for accommodation nearby. It may be that the accommodation be that the family does not want to live this issue. We have to be bright enough and is providing wealth to our nation.

Those are the big questions. not want additional bureaucracy, we do not want add to the cost of doing business for mining international competitive pressures. These We need to have a breadth to our vision in how in this report, and now our big challenge is to address these problems in a very sensible way to grow. That is our next challenge. this opportunity to speak on the report on Regional Australia into fly-in fly-out Let me start by saying that I appreciate the secretariat. I am very aware of the site that were made during the inquiry. I do resources sector, for our rural communities and for communities-where the fly-in fly-out/drive-in remain when they go to work. I was looking as did a number of organisations from the Gold was that surely there must have been a better to, and does, reflect the contents of the report. is quite simply just inflammatory. I think it what the findings of that inquiry actually were. I Coast I am also very disappointed that there Coast, at section 4.77, as part of the section section of the report that comprised only 13 of the overall report. I am disappointed that about the impact of fly-in fly-out and drive-in less detail about the source communities for the families of the workers who live there. a fly-in fly-out worker. I do not fly in and out to other parts of Australia. I am acutely aware on my family and has on me as a worker. There is is for people to work close to where they live. a number of reasons. It may be that there is no is not suitable for families. It may there; it may be for any number of reasons. What I think has been overlooked in this choice of a job across the road from where from home where you have to fly-in fly-out or then it is an economic and family decision about the road then the job away from home may individual and by the family. I think that deliberations. Being a fly-in fly-out worker is not something that are establishing themselves as source that they are making: firstly, to actively unemployed and with little immediate prospects secondly, for providing the infrastructure and out worker. Establishing these source communities in Gold Coast as a regional area, and one where fly-in fly-out workers. I must add that there Gold Coast and fly-in fly-out of locations spring to mind immediately as destinations where the oil industry for many years, and they have that because their families are happy to live and there is already infrastructure As part of this inquiry I did invite the committee hearings there. Unfortunately, the committee subsequently found out-and I think this is not travel to the Gold Coast but could travel inquiry when there was ample opportunity on workers and to some of their families. unheeded.

42,Mr HAASE,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak firstly like to acknowledge the secretariat through this report. The aspect of the report taxation zone rebates. Deputy Speaker Scott, on numerous occasions. The taxation zone remained basically the same since that year. has been some rejigging of the rates, some basically it remains the same. This rebate-in a taxpayer who works for a year in a remote report is actually very simple: if you have the you live that pays a certain rate and a job away drive-in drive-out that pays a different rate, which job to take. If there is no job across be a lifeline and is very much needed by the has been overlooked by the committee in its to be demonised for. The cities and towns communities should be applauded for the efforts source work for residents, many of whom are of securing employment close to home; and, amenities to support the family of the fly-in flyregional areas is a positive step. I include the there is evidence that there are already many are many workers who base their families on the around the world.

There is more work that to be done, and must be done, is to identify families and how to put that support in place. I the work of the committee is not done and that it to this report and, in doing so, I would for the magnificent job they did in guiding us that I wish to specifically address is the issue of you and I have shared discussions on this topic rebates boundaries were drawn in 1945 and have Over time-approximately every 20 years-there rejigging of the boundaries in a new shape, but fact, it was not a rebate initially-was worth to area, perhaps with a wife and small preschool age children, an amount of money equivalent to substantial amount of compensation paid each it tough and live in the bush.

In the case of the town that I know the Goldfields, if you spend 12 months working taxpayer, you are entitled to a rebate on your many an accountant has said to me, it would claim it for you, because it is such a paltry sum. The lack of equity in the payments from instance, working in Broome or Port Hedland amount that you would get if you were working Broome, of course, are on the ocean.

Therefore there is no hook, there is no lure and to and live and work in these remote areas. I am the first to appreciate the politics of logical thing and change the system so that those were not entitled to it, there would be some attract residents to country areas, remote areas we have to bite the bullet.

Then you have the other thing to have zonal not, would it be appropriate that it was paid. remote when you are on an oil rig; you cannot where you might say where there is a township justification for fly-in fly-out, it is pretty rig. As I said at the beginning of this contribution, want to look at the history of the development of what were the driving things that took people developed. From time to time in this place we Queensland in the seventies and eighties, Jo Bjelke-Petersen. I am a great admirer of his. What he did is to participate, for example, by way of royalty development of those railways. The other A division having been called",258
47,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"Before the suspension, not Petersen. I was saying that one of the things part in the development of railways and the has always been an element of fly-in fly-out, developed and have survived. A few have gone, Queensland, in the hinterland of the member up in that era-Blackwater, Saraji, Moranbah, went back a bit as the peak came off and certain communities as country towns. So fly-in develop communities and make it a condition construction phase but at the operational stage our early pioneers did in developing this country. I think we should have a bipartisan attitude always be parts of Australia where you will North Queensland, the Territory and Western town; where a mine has a life of only 20 years; mines; or where it is not going to be in an tax could be one of the keys to encourage or talks about zonal taxation, as the previous only apply to the permanent workforce? would be to say, 'Yes, we'd allow it for the or the permanently resident workforce to be dilemma going on in Australia at present of the it sufficiently attractive by way of things like workers to go out and take on these jobs in west and the north, then are you not going to cut resident Australians to participate in that taxation of where, whether you are resident or A case in point would be an oil rigger. You are get anything much more remote. Therefore, and a permanent workforce there is no hard to extend that argument when it comes to an oil this is a very difficult subject. But if you of Australia, you need to have an appreciation into regional Australia and how communities hear criticisms of the National Party leader of I, for one, am not a critic of his; he built railways and things by getting companies or by way of doing special projects in the thing he did is he insisted the townsin the House of Representatives",259

While I am sure there during the Joh era whole communities like Mary Kathleen, but if you go to Central for Dawson, for example, all the towns that grew Dysart-are certainly towns that peaked. They mines closed, but then they serviced those fly-out is not the only answer. Where you can that homes have to be built-perhaps not at the of a mining project-then you are doing what to fly-in fly-out. As I said before, there will have to have fly-in fly-out: in remote parts of Australia, where you would not want to build a where there is not going to be a cluster of agricultural area-where it is going to be a solo operation for the purpose of mining.

49,Mr CHRISTENSEN,COMMITTEES," It is is marking 20 years in this place today. His has not lost it; it is only getting better, like fine wine. In addressing this report, can I first say very important. I am not too happy with the title for our cities?' FIFO is not a cancer; it is not is shared by a lot of people in my electorate. in the local Mackay newspaper every week. To FIFO, or fly-in fly-out-and DIDO, or drive-in bluntly, I find that insulting. The fact that don't live permanently in small communities construed as having no regard for these townships this whole debate we need to step back and There are a lot of strident critics of fly-in in fly-out-and I will get to that. Even the Finlay, who probably agrees with the cancer against FIFO per se but to make it compulsory and the community. And therein lies the rub: as BMA have made it compulsory at some of their choice. It is not about the practice itself, The former Bligh Labor government in Queensland per cent fly-in fly-out workforce at its Caval by me in this place at the time. It was there will always be a need for fly-in fly-out before, things like oil rigs. But where we get transport routes exist, where there is prime land that can be developed, we should take a a view of how we develop our nation and then about earlier. If fringe benefits tax exemptions have a better chance of making those sorts for example. If you made zonal taxation the permanent workforce in a community, there Moranbah, Dysart and Saraji. You would also case, like Springshaw, Emerald, Capella and that we look very hard at the Central of those great coalfields of the seventies and where it is necessary, use it; but do not use it in We all know the price paid for that in broken child support and other things we see in our and for well-balanced families who are prepared a nest egg together, yes I think it is all okay. development of this country would be a great I think we have got a lot more work to do. good to follow the member for Hinkler, who contribution here just shows that in 20 years he that I think language and how we describe things is of the report, 'Cancer of the bush or salvation a saviour, either; it is a work practice. That view In fact, we have got a miner who writes an article quote him, he says: 'Everyone is talking about drive-out-as if it is a dirty word.

I am a critic of 100 per cent flyMoranbah Retailers Association President, Peter comment, is on record as saying nobody is would have a detrimental impact on businesses having 100 per cent FIFO-and businesses such mines-really does go against the spirit of but how it is used by the companies. gave approval for BMA to have a 100 Ridge mine near Moranbah,.

That is a terrible thing. That to should be outlawed. There should be no ability they do not live in a particular place. Unless be illegal to do that. I say shame on the government, for allowing this to happen and and for having it in action. I am against 100 There are quite a number of recommendations The first recommendation regards the ABS and told me they feel the data is not correct at the ABS goes about collecting census data. certain areas because of the data then that recommendations go to research that needs to include commissioning some research on workforces, and on the demand for and the infrastructure by FIFO and DIDO workforces. The report recommends commissioning a work and lifestyle to develop a comprehensive recommends the commissioning of research on of having a long-term FIFO or DIDO parent. research into the economic and social impacts communities. All of those research There is one university that is well placed on the doorstep of the Bowen Basin. It has looked writing to the Minister for Regional Australia his purview, to consider the university when recommended if that is the way the government Another thing I really want to say is we FIFO and DIDO like they are interchangeable. Queensland government statistician show that the Bowen Basin actually reside in the Mackay is because it is in the same region as them. most cases and it is convenient. We need to same basket. That certainly was the recommendation Corporation of Mackay, Isaac, Whitsunday interests of those three local government areas. Basin actually is. They say that the terms exclusive, so they are not the same thing. Page The long term issue is the allocation of services FIFO/DIDO workforces are not counted as resident of their life in those communities. of the Moranbah township. They were not listened have a 100 per cent fly-in fly-out operation. that when a local goes to apply for a job at this have to have permanent place of residence in me is geographic discrimination. I would say it for a company to not hire someone because it is going to affect the work practices, it should state government at the time, the Bligh Labor shame on BMA as well for actually proposing it per cent FIFO and I want that on the record. in this report and a lot that I do agree with. getting the correct data. Local councils have this point in time because of the manner in which If we have underrepresentation of population in needs to be addressed.

I go onto the Regional Social Development president of and which does a lot of good about drive-in drive-out workers, as DIDO workers originate from a larger regional centre work … I have to say that that is what is said here, The impacts of DIDO work arrangements  As a resident of the region, the worker is more ownership, of the community in which they work;  With this connection to the community, DIDO  The worker contributes to the region by spending locally;  The worker will be counted in Again, I urge caution on saying that DIDO and Going to another item out of the RSDC's-the submission to the inquiry: it talks about family where we often look at the economic impacts, and impact on families enough. There is some movement but the RSDC submission says that there are amongst FIFO and DIDO workers, as stated initiative that the RSDC came up with-the stated: It was pretty rocky. I missed out on how my son and she had dramas at work and she couldn't talk through it but when you are apart, the other family help. I have to say, that is a reaction that I get drive-out and fly-in fly-out.

FIFO are the same thing; they clearly are not. Regional Social Development Centre'srelationships. I think this is one of the things all the rest of that, but we do not look at the in this report on that, and that is good, difficulties in maintaining family relationships by workers who actively participated in an Adaptive Communities Initiative. One of them was going at school and my wife was working as well to me. When you are together day to day you work members feel that they are alone, that there is no from a lot of families who are engaged in drive-in Industrial Workforce Development group, which local businesses and local jobseekers with the also raises this issue: support to families of FIFO workers is out there could potentially be a lack of support services mining.

I want to quote two organisations. The CFMEU said: We are not saying that FIFO must or ought to be banned. is not a realistic alternative, such as remotely based combination of resident based and FIFO may be necessary … The Chamber of Commerce and Industry also said: Implemented appropriately, the FIFO and DIDO workforce and State economies, local communities and businesses.

Australia is a Federation of states and, as the evidence make or break referenda. That is certainly the case. They continue: If State governments are largely opposed to change, pass. In the view of Coalition members, the recommendation negotiate to achieve the States' support for financial committee being able to make a recommendation by the Australian people. This view was reinforced be successful, States either had to actively support State governments are probably going to be a support this referendum because it takes away their ability to negotiate in funding allocations directly fund local government projects.

They made the putting a referendum question to the people of In the dissenting report, they say: attests, the support of State governments can history proves it is very difficult for referenda to by the Expert Panel that the Government recognition, is an essential precursor to the on the likelihood of the referendum being supported by a number of witnesses that for the referendum to the measure or at least ""run dead"" on the issue. little bit, and in some cases very, reluctant to some of the power that they have, it takes away and enables the Commonwealth government to is absolutely necessary, as the pool project at as it is in so many other essential projects fund local government and at the moment is not is also related to this debate is Gocup Road. paper mill, to the busy Hume Highway. It is a trucks carrying loads of timber, and quite Buses and heavy haul log trucks are not a good That particular stretch of road had to be a funding. That, to me, is overburdening local government. I know that the Minister for Local Government, Simon Crean, is very interested my electorate a number of times-and I know he sure that he, like so many others, would like fund this road straight to Tumut shire. As I said, to meet the criteria of road funding-but, if in the past, I think this particular stretch Commonwealth to ensure that there I have lobbied hard on this. Certainly it was road through the state, and certainly, while Nationals' last federal council, local government which was debated and carried. The motion read: That this Federal Council of The Nationals supports so as to ensure that the Federal Government can through programs such as Roads to Recovery. And Roads to Recovery, as the member for Parkes things that the Commonwealth has been able to ensure that dangerous roads and roads in receive the kinds of funding they need. The expert panel's final report has stated referendum in 2013, but it really needs to ensure There is no point putting the question to Australians education campaign on the issues. It is now September. Does that give us enough time enough time to educate the Australian public? Australian public are very knowledgeable. issues. They are very switched on; the amount onto their iPads and mobile phones makes them does this particular issue, the constitutional necessary support and have the necessary will do not know whether the time that we have interested in the remarks that are going Makin on that particular theme. Certainly in the period that we have left, for the majority that is needed to pass this will be wonderful. But we cannot put this question think that is one of the reasons why the question is also very much overdue. I am sure most, if I am sure, the member for Throsby, would agree has been delayed and it is now going to more desirable thing because when the question gets betterment of not just Indigenous Australians Certainly, this question of the constitutional fail, because to put it up and have it fail would Regional Australia, Regional Development and in this particular project-he has been to is also overseeing this entire report, but I am to see the Commonwealth be able to directly it is now a state classified road-it had to be that could have been skirted around in some way of dangerous road could have been funded by the is not some sort of future tragedy. coalition policy at the last election to fund this speaking of policy and coalition policy, at the constitutional recognition was a motion the constitutional recognition of local government continue to make direct payments to local governments often attests, has been one of the great to do-that is, funding local government directly disrepair in rural and remote and regional areas that a majority of panel members support a that it is going to be passed by the people. without the benefit of a full public March; the election is going to be held into get the states on board? Does that give us The Australian public are not fools; the The Australian public are au fait with a lot of of media that is beamed into their homes and very aware of all sorts of current issues. But recognition of local government, have the of the people to be passed in a referendum? I left would allow that question, and I will be to be made in a few moments by the member for if there is indeed time enough to get the support referendum, then well and good, so be it, and that to the people if it is going to fail, and I of Aboriginal recognition in the Constitution not all, of the members of this House, including, with me there: it is overdue. That question reviews and committees, and that is probably a put to the people it also has to pass for the but us as a nation as a whole. recognition of local government must also not mean that it would be many, many years, if not decades, before it was put again, if at all.

53,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES," I begin by remarks about my time as Mayor of the City to put the issue of local government in context. Australia, and each exists and is enacted under Territory, under the Territory law. They are and in fact often are-and which prescribe the existence of local government effectively rests local government is and has been entrenched Australian people for decades and decades, services to the Australian people across the country. In fact, the first local government was Adelaide-and councils around Australia formed local government in fact predates federal government part of the Australian landscape and has been this country. Many people I speak to are surprised federal government and yet has effectively no each of the state and territory laws. It certainly recognition in state constitution does not give is, quite rightfully, seeking. There were propositions in both 1974 and order to give local government the recognition was to amend section 51 of the Constitution government to borrow money on behalf of local proposition to amend section 96 in very similar would have enabled the federal government proposition failed. The 1988 proposition was section 119A into the Australian Constitution government as a legitimate level of government state constitutions. Again, that proposition failed. So, 25 years later, we are attempting for Australian Constitution. The member for Riverina important issue and we do not want it to fail. of committee members at the time The report follows a previous report that panel of some 17 other members who reported recommended, amongst other things, that recommendations. The recommendations-and twofold. If you can get the bipartisan support is no point putting a referendum question on a to the good ratepayers and citizens of this nation the coalition wrote a dissenting report. It needs to I will be interested to hear the remarks of the matter. Local government needs recognition, that it gets passed by the people. thanking the member for Riverina for his kind of Salisbury. In speaking on this matter, I want There are about 560 local governments around state laws and, in the case of the Northern state laws which can be amended at any timepowers and functions of local government. The with the state and territory governments. Yet as a level of government in the eyes of the and it is now essential to the daily delivery of established in South Australia-it was the City of soon after that. I say that to point out that by some 60 years. Local government is almost since the time of the first settlement into hear that local government predates the legal status other than that afforded to it by is recognised within state constitutions, but it the national recognition that local government 1988 to change the Australian Constitution in it, quite rightly, deserves. In 1974, the proposal and related to the ability of the federal government. At the same time, there was a terms to what is being proposed now which to directly fund local government. The 1974 slightly different: it was about inserting a new which effectively gave recognition to local in Australia in a similar way perhaps to the the third time to recognise local government in the quite rightly points out that this is an That was very much at the forefront of the minds we were deliberating on this issue. was headed by Justice Spigelman and an expert to the parliament at the end of 2011 and a parliamentary committee pursue their I am simplifying them here-were effectively of this parliament, the support of the state governments and the support of the Local they submitted as part of their proposition to proceed with it. The committee looked at those field. It formed the conclusion that section The parliament may grant financial assistance to state or territory legislation on such terms The additional words were 'or to any local legislation'. That is the addition to section 96 Constitution. The importance of what it says is that we formed in accordance with the laws of the state 1 and it is an important element of that change. can directly fund those local government entities. The issue of including local government in recognition has, I believe, got bipartisan support am picking up loud and clear. The message I generally, as a matter of principle, it is accepted. include local government in the Australian symbolic recognition or you can actually do in the recommendation of the committee by specifically Symbolic recognition may be appropriate, but, go. I would like to see specific reference to it. We gave local government some form of government in a bipartisan way in this parliament importance and existence of local government status in the same way that giving local also done in the nineties, gave local government any legitimate legal status. The only way wording in the Australian Constitution. The proposed by the expert panel, which the parliamentary go. It agreed it was the best way to go because dealing with the Australian Constitution and The fundamental difference between what ago and in 1974 is not only that local government, recognised as a legitimate level of government case, Pape v Commissioner of Taxation, in 2009. Australian government does not have the authority issue is not simply about doing what we think the way this government and this country has Roads to Recovery, which the member for Riverina the regional development programs, community recent years and even direct services that will be able to continue. That is the purpose is important they get through as quickly as possible. Government Association and the recommendations go forward with the referendum, then you should issues. It also heard from some experts in the 96 of the Australian Constitution would read: any state or to any local government body formed by and conditions as the parliament sees fit. government body formed by state or territory which currently does not exist in that part of the can only fund those local governments that are or the territory in which they exist. That is No. The second part is that the federal government the Australian Constitution and giving it proper as a matter of principle. That is the message I have been hearing right across Australia is that, The issue is: how do you do it? You can Constitution simply by giving it some sort of so in the form of words that have been proposed making reference to it in section 96. quite frankly, I do not think that is the way to symbolic recognition when in 2006 the Howard moved a resolution recognising the throughout Australia. But it was not given legal government a seat at COAG meetings, which was a degree of respectability but did not give it we will ever do that is by including the right wording proposed is similar to the wording committee agreed was the best way to it also heard from experts in the field of they agreed that it was the best way to go. is happening now and what happened 25 years quite rightfully, believes that it should be in this country but because there was a court That court case effectively found that the to directly fund local government. So this is morally right; it is also about ensuring that operated for decades continues. Programs like alluded to earlier, and other programs like infrastructure initiatives that we have seen in are provided by local government to communities of the changes that are being proposed now and it It is no longer just something that would be nice to do; it is a matter of dealing with with those funding problems that The argument has been put that we can continue 96 of the Constitution. However, that means with conditions placed on the states that wishes and directions of the federal government. before allocating the funds, and that in turn and adds another layer of bureaucracy to the process will continue to encounter if Questions arise relating to the timing, which his remarks in the chamber. Those were matters careful and considered way. We listened to the needs to go through before a referendum question was considered that, whilst the timing may raise to go through all of those processes. Unless a decision is made by this parliament none of the other steps will take place someone to make the first move. Having referendum be held in conjunction with the federal other sector-that is, the state governments goal in mind and can work towards it. My understanding across Australia generally has accepted that enable the education program that has been respect to getting the people of Australia to true that some of the states will never support get bipartisan support from this parliament to For a constitutional question to succeed states but to be passed by a majority of voters easy. The member for Riverina rightly pointed ever succeeded when they were put to the Australian successes occurred in the 1940s when a similar a change to the Constitution not simply because was not done then it would impact on the way services. This is a very similar case. That constitutional experts that addressed the committee. We have a proposition before us and we board-a couple of the states have indicated strongly indicated their position one way or Local Government Association behind the proposition, go through with the referendum question being there is a proposition before them, will have do so and I believe those hard decisions will it is the right thing to do and is the only way the issue because if we cannot then we have to deal arise as a result of the Pape case. to fund local government through section all of the funding has to go through the states those funds will be used in accordance with the That means you have to deal with the states makes the whole process much more cumbersome itself. That is a problem that I believe we the Constitution is not changed. the member for Riverina quite rightly raised in that the committee rightly addressed in a very experts about the process that the parliament can be put, even in September this year. It concerns to some, it is sufficient to enable us that we will proceed with the referendum, because everyone seems to be hanging back for made the first move and recommended that the election this year, it now means that every and local governments around Australia-has a is that the local government sector and is prepared to get behind a campaign that will suggested to be rolled out across Australia with understand what is behind this proposition. It is this proposition. It is also true that if we do not start with then the proposition will never get up. it needs not only to be passed by a majority of across the whole of the country. So it is not out that only eight out of 44 propositions have people. But it is possible. One of the situation arose where it was a case of making it was the right thing to do but because if it the government of the day could deliver its was one of the arguments put very strongly by have in principle support generally across the concerns but the others at this stage have not the other. Given that we now have the Australian we should now make every attempt to put in September. The others, knowing that to make some hard decisions. I believe they will result in them supporting the proposition because that we can effectively ensure the delivery of services which Australian people have now things have been funded over the last two or three decades. With those comments I strongly urge members of the committee because this place needs to is that that will be crucial as to whether Debate adjourned. Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (19:04): the Economics Committee, Report on Australia's Speaker Owens, that you participated in that-indeed, provide a little bit by way of background. operations at Clyde refinery would be ceasing announcement that their refinery in Gore Bay for importation of petroleum products. Similarly, would close its refinery at Kurnell sometime in close succession, caused many in the community Australia's domestic oil refining capacity? Australia's domestic petroleum and oil refining In response to community concerns the Committee and asked us to inquire into some specific into whether the closure of the refineries would the refineries will lead to a 28 per cent reduction capacity, meaning that we are now in a position demand domestically, the balance of which is the impact this is going to have on the price the closing of some of Australia's domestic What does it mean in terms of energy security? down the track to change our petroleum standards? through a program of mandating cleaner enormous environmental benefits. What would mean for our capacity to make those sorts of mean for the employees within the industry? employed in Australia's oil refineries? What refineries and across the energy sector more generally? I would like to make a few observations about price, the inquiry looked into this and determined have no net impact on the price that consumers this is that over 90 per cent of the terminal consumers are paying for petrol-is a consequence refer to as import parity pricing. That is, it become accustomed to as a result of the way of this place to support the recommendation show leadership on this issue. If it does, my view the proposition gets up in September. Economics Committee Report The question we are debating is the report of oil refining industry. I know, Deputy you presided over that inquiry. I will In June 2012 Shell announced that its refining in September of that year. That added to their was going to be converted into a storage facility in July 2012, Caltex had announced that it in 2013. These announcements, coming together to ask: is this the beginning of the end of Indeed, if it is the beginning of the end of production capacity, what does that mean? minister referred the question to the Economics issues. Firstly, we were asked to inquire affect prices. I should say that the closure of in Australia's domestic petroleum refining where we produce about half of our annual is imported. Many in the community asked: what that we pay at the browser for our petrol? Will refining lead to an increase in bowser prices? What does it mean in terms of our capacity We have over the last two decades gone fuel standards in this country. That has had the reduction in Australia's domestic capacity changes down the track? Finally, what does it Currently some 5½ thousand workers are does it mean for job security within those each of these concerns. First, in relation to that the closure of these refineries would would pay for petrol. The singular reason for gate price for petrol-that is, the price that of what we now know and commonly is set by the international market. Over 90 per cent of the price is made up of that parity pricing rest. The reduction in our domestic refining not on the upside, on browser prices. It was that indeed the risks might be on the downside increase in the South-East Asian region of technology was going to be able to produce providing the availability of refined petroleum observed that the new Jamnagar Refinery, refineries in the world, has the capacity refinery produces in a day in excess of all the It is a very modern plant and it is very efficient certainly on the upside, on prices. Second, in relation to energy security, I because it is something deep within the Australian of going through two world wars and being other countries within the region. People are some security over our energy supplies. I always trading arrangements and good relationships security you can have in relation to any traded energy security with self-sufficiency. Currently we import over 83 per cent of refined into petrol. So, if there was an issue already exists. We have seen through the turbulent last two decades that those concerns have not interruptions, they have been very quickly addressed world market. The other thing I would have domestic supply is already imported. The other observation that was made by Australia is a net exporter of energy, in its uranium or any of the other energy sources exporter and, if anything, countries around the of their energy supplies. So if there The other thing I would like to say on this that were raised. Those concerns go to observations about that. It is entirely understandable employment within the refining industry are future of the industry is. They are asking, employment or within the industry down the track?' years the industry itself has invested over refining industry. It is necessary because we around the country, so businesses were having amount of $9 billion over 10 years has been committee said that they were committed to capacity within this country. plus transportation costs plus insurances and the capacity is going to have no net impact, certainly observed by a number of submitters to the inquiry in terms of pricing, because, with a massive refining capacity, new more modern plant and the same or increased volumes at a lower price, at a lower price to Australian importers. It was in India, one of the most modern and largest to produce over 1,200 barrels per day. This one combined refineries in Australia at the moment. and productive. So there is no net impact, would like to make a couple of points about this, psyche. Perhaps it is from the experience an island continent some distance from many concerned about the fact that we should have say in relation to these concerns that open with your trading partners are the best form of good. In any event we should not confuse I will deal with those two issues. our crude oil.

So each of those concerns, in our view and were able to be addressed to the satisfaction made. I commend the report to the House. I in chairing the committee. There are some today. I thank them for the excellent work they committee in this inquiry, and for their ongoing preparing its reports and conducting its inquiries. committee is very appreciative of that work.
