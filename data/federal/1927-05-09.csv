Wo rejoice that on tha occasion of the establishment of'the permanent Seat of Government of the Commonwealth at Canberra it has been your gracious pleasure to open the new Parliamentary buildings. This ceremony which is the object of your long and arduous mission to these shores is one of great significance to the people of Australia.

11,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [5.16] - I am pleased to have the honour and privilege of supporting the motion. The words whjch have fallen from the lips of the right honourable the Prime Minister respecting Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York are appropriate to this historic occasion. It was proper that we should have a member of the Royal Family to open the new house of Parliament in this new capital city. Their presence here today indicated that the King is keenly interested in the affairs of this great dominion. His Majesty himself visited Australia very early in our federal history and opened the first Commonwealth Parliament, and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone of this Parliament House at Canberra. We are glad that the Royal Family shows this continued interest in Australia. The ceremony performed today was of the greatest importance. Effect has now been given to that provision of the Constitution which required the establishment of the Seat of Government in a truly Federal Capital. Henceforth the legislation and administration of the Commonwealth will radiate from this historic spot. Let us hope that the legislation to be passed in this building will he such as will ensure a continuance of our present peaceful international relations, and bring'in a new era of peace, contentment, and prosperity for the people of Australia. Now that this Parliament has been removed from parochial influences we shall be able to make still greater endeavours to develop our country on truly national lines. Small und local mutters should be left to other legislative bodies. Jn this hour of satisfaction at the transfer of the national Parliament to Buildings) 1025-20. Canberra, I trust that we shall not forget the work towards the consummation of the federation of the Australian States done by many who have now passed away. The noble efforts of those pioneers have been recorded in the pages of our history, but it is fitting that we should call tliein to mind on this great day. As representative men we should strive to develop this country on sane and safe lines, but at a faster pace than hitherto, so that we may not only maintain our White Australia, but largely increase the white population within our shores. If we do this we shall do a great work. I believe that the motion which the Prime Minister has moved will have the enthusiastic support of every member of this Chamber, and also-of every person within hearing of my voice. I am sure also that the whole of the Australian people will endorse our approval of it. I trust that Their Royal Highnesses will continue to enjoy good health, and that they and the whole of their party will return to their homes safely and well. Then' tour has done much to cement the good feeling between our people .and those of the Motherland. Irrespective of anything that appears in the newspapers here or on the other side of the world, Their Royal Highnesses may-rest assured that the Australian people are distinctly loyal to the head of the Empire.

12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I have to announce that, during the adjournment, I received from the Honourable Sir Granville Ryrie a letter, dated 13th April, resigning his seat as member for the electoral division of Warringah. On the 28th April I issued a writ for the election of a new member to serve that division - The dates in connection with the election have been, fixed as follows:-Issu e of writ, Tuesday, 26th April, 1927; nomination, Wednesday, 11th May, 1927; polling, Saturday, 21st May, 1927; return of writ, on or before Friday, 3rd June, 1927. LEAVE OF ABSENCE . Motion (by Mr Bruce) (by leave) agreed toThat leave of absence bo given to every ber of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House the date of its next sitting. DATE OF MEETING . Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House at its rising adjourn until date and hour to be fixed hy Mr Speaker, which time shall bo notified by Mr Speaker each member by telegram or letter. Mx. WEST (East Sydney) [5.25] I should like the Prime Minister to give honourable members some idea of the date upon which the House will re-assemble. It has seemed like one long adjournment since this Government has been in office.",18
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"North Sydney) [5.26]. - I , too, desire information as to probable date of re-assembling, and ask the Prime Minister when replying to indicate the nature of the measures we shall then be asked to consider. Parliament has now taken up its abode in its new home, but if its recent happy practice of meeting for a few days and then adjourning for several months is to be persisted in we might just as well be anywhere else. ConsiderLeader ing the favourable auspices uuder which Parliament has met today, I can see reason why we should not at once begin meeting today. the good work of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has so eloliament quently spoken. It was not by closing Parliament that the work of building this young nation was done. The foundato tion stones of our national life have been well and truly laid, but there is much work still to be done. While I shall not pretend for one moment that I am so passionately addieted to work as to unduly oppose the motion for adjournwhich ment for a period of unknown length, of the general election. I most certainly should like the Prime [21 Minister to tell us that he does not intend the adjournment to be unduly prolonged. About sixteen months of the term of this Parliament has expired; during that period, it has been in session for about four months. If in the next twenty months our sittings are only in the same proportion, we. shall have some difficulty in giving to our constituents a satisfactory account of our stewardship. I suggest to the right honourable gentleman 'that he should consider this matter from the stand-point of Parliament. This country would be better memgoverned, and our legislation would be to more calculated to promote the prosperity of the country, if we sat more regularly, and if, on being called together at infrequent intervals, we were not obliged to work at high pressure, the Government a forcing through legislation almost at the point of the bayonet. That method is not to characteristic of a deliberative assembly, os I understand.it. Mr.'STEWABT (Wimmera) [5.30] I desire to supplement the remarks of the right honourable member for North Sydney. I am curious,firstly,as to when we shall be called together agtiin; and, secondly, as to what business we shall the be asked to transact when we do reI assemble What are the intentions of the Government in regard to the special session, of which we hnve heard so much, to consider amendments of the Constitution, some of which I consider vital to unthe good government of Australia?",19
14,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister [5.32] - Before this House adjourned from Melbourne to Canberra, the of the Opposition, speaking on the Supply Bill, dealt exhaustively with the no date of re-assembling after this formal The Government then indicated that it proposed to call Partogether as soon as possible after the necessary departments could be transup ferred to Canberra to enable Parliament function here. Our conduct in this matter is governed, firstly, by the fact that Supply was granted by Parliament for only a limited period; and, secondly, by the desire of the Government lo proceed with the programme of legislation it put before the people at the time Upon a more appropriate occasion, I shall be able to deal convincingly with the points raised by the right honourable member for North Sydney in regard to the period for which this Parliament has been in session since I have been the Leader of the Government. As to the programme of legislation to be dealt with when Parliament does re-assemble, the Government will continue to give effect to the policy submitted to the country, and trusts that it will have the support of the House in so doing.

15,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTHLINEO F,"Panders-Prime Minister) [5.35] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The Public Accounts Committee had into present its report on the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, but as the Leader of the Opposition intimated to me that his supporters were strongly of the opinion that nothing of a nature should be dealt with during this formal and ceremonial meetd ing, I willingly assented to his sugges- tion that the report be not tabled today, of AusAS this might be regarded by honourable members as a breach of that understandMr E . RILEY (South Sydney) [5.87]. of - The newspapers in the various capital cities have published inspired statements that the Government proposes to sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, in accordance with the recom- mendations alleged to be contained in the report of the Public Accounts Committee. 27. That sort of propaganda by the shipping th combine should be resisted. I have the respect for the members of the of Public Accounts Committee, and I do not suggest that any one of them furnished that information to the press. I understand that the Prime Minister is inquiring - into leakages of information from The proceedings of the Accounts Committee are equally important, and .1 hope that steps will be to prevent inopportune and irregular disclosures of confidential information",20
16,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTHLINEO F,"Lang) [5.39L - In the course of conversation, with Sir George Puller today, I learned that he had received information of the discovery of the first peg driven in connection with the inaugural survey of the base Hue Service. of our new Federal Capital City. I suggest that the peg should be preserved in either the Parliamentary Library or the National Museum, and that steps should be taken to mark the spot from which it was token.",20
17,Mr CHARITON,AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTHLINEO F,"Hunter) [5.40] Having been at one time chairman of the Accounts Committee, I know that it has power to allow press representatives to be present during the taking of evidence; but I understand that, in connection with the inquiry into the Commonwealth Shipping Line, the evidence was taken in camera, because it was considered injudicious to give any publicity to the proceedings before the report was formally 5 resented to Parliament. The Prime [inister should, on behalf of the House, take steps to ensure that confidential information in the possession of any committee is not improperly disclosed - An inquiry should be instituted at once to ascertain who was responsible for divulging information obtained by the Public Accounts Committee in camera. Any member of a committee who discloses information confidentially obtained acts unfairly to the committee and to the House. Parliament should be able to deliberate upon the reports of its committees free of any atmosphere or influence created.hy the press.",21
18,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTHLINEO F,"Flinders-Prime Minister) [5.42] - I shall inquire into the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Lang, and see what action can be taken. As to what has been said regarding the contents of committee reports being published before they have been made available in proper form, I agree that such disclosures are a serious matter, and I shall take every-step possible to ascertain how some of the leakages of confidential information which have recently occurred took place. It is incumbent upon me, however, to say, in fairness to our public servants, that the inquiries which have already been made into some of these coses, show that our officers are particularly loyal and aot with very great discretion. The result of these investigations so far has established that there has been no leakage due to the disloyalty or indiscretion of members of the Public Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at S.43 p.m.",21
