1,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"Oxley) [2.32] - I rise to a matter of privilege. Privilege and abuse of privilege are terms difficult to define. Later, I Bhall conclude with a motion relating to the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) last night in applying the closure immediately after .he had moved the adjournment of the House. I do not deny that he acted within his rights, and in accordance with the practice of the House as laid down by Standing Order 262A, But the Standing Orders are the creation of the House; members are greater than - the Standing Orders, and their rights should be respected. The action of the Prime Minister was unprecedented. On one occasion Mr Andrew Fisher, when Prime Minister, moved the closure while Sir Joseph Cook was addressing himself to the motion for the adjournment of the House, but never has the closure been applied without debate on that motion having taken place. As there is no precedent for this occurrence I have been obliged to examine other similar occurrences. That which most closely approximates the incident of which I complain arose in 1924 when the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, was in charge of the House. It was grievance day; Mr Speaker had put the question, "" That I do now leave the chair,"" and the then honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) had risen to speak when the Prime Minister moved "" That the question be now put"". Mr Mahony raised a question of privilege and was about to address himself to it when he was ruled out of order by the then Speaker, the Right Honourable W. A. ""Watt. There is no analogy between the point of privilege upon which Mr Mahony rose and that to which I intend to address myself this afternoon. The right to speak on the motion for the adjournment of the House has always been greatly prized by private members. It is to them what the Sydney Domain or the Yarra bank is to a man who has a doctrine to preach to the public. The men who speak in the Domain and on"" the Yarra bank are restricted by certain regulations, and if they break them they are prevented from speaking. The motion for the adjournment of the House, is, in effect, a declaration by the Prime Minister that the Government has transacted all the business it desires to do at that sitting, and that if a privatemember wishes to ventilate any subject, he may now do so. The time between the submission motion and the carrying of it belongs to private members, and the Leader of the House should intervene only he thinks that honourable in addressing themselves motion are abusing their That did not occur last night. There was no obstruction; in fact, nobody had an opportunity to speak to the motion. Had the members of the Opposition obstructive I could have understood the action of the Prime Minister, but they had done nothing to obstruct business yesterday. The Prime will recall that on Tuesday night he crossed the chamber and said to me, "" What are these ugly rumours I hear regarding a formal motion adjournment of the House?"" I told him that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) proposed to submit a formal motion for adjournment in order to discuss the rationing of employment in the Defence Department. The Prime Minister said, "" Do you think that is necessary? Why not discuss the matter on the Supply Bill?"" 1 promised to consult with my leader. I saw the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), who, after conferring with the Prime Minister, agreed that a formal motion for adjournment should not be submitted and that the discussion on the Defence should take place on the motion for Supply. The readiness with which the Opposition fell in with the Government's wishes is proof that it had no desire to obstruct business. When the Prime Minister applied the closure to the second and third readings of. the Supply Bill the honourable member for Fawkner Maxwell) voted with the Government, but when later he sought to address himself to the motion for the adjournment the House he was denied the right to Bpeak. Nobody will accuse him of desiring to obstruct the business of the House. I have raised this matter because I regard it as highly important right of honourable members to address the House should not be abrogated. I recognize the obligation of the Prime to conserve government time; and nobody objects to the application of the closure in order to expedite government Mr Bayley.",11

3,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has no right to deprive private members when of the time that, in accordance with members practice, belongs to them. I therefore to the moveprivilege. That this House disapproves of the action of the Bight Honourable the Prime Minister in moving the closure on the question ""That the House do now adjourn"" at a time when no been debate on' the 'question had taken place, and consequently no obstruction could be alleged; as by such action he deprived members of 'one of their most cherished privileges. government Minister Mr MCTIERKAN - On a point of order, I submit that the motion which has been submitted, Mr Speaker, discloses no point of privilege justifying for the an interruption of the proceedings of the House in this way. The motion is an attempt to use the procedure relating to the question of privilege in order to censure the Prime Minister by a motion without notice. It is not suggested that any honourable member was deprived of any right in contravention of the Standing Order; that the Prime Minister took action in breach of the Standing Orders, and dispossessed a member of the House of some right or privilege to which he was entitled.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Norman Makin). Department - The honourable member in raising a point of order is arguing the question of privilege, a procedure which I cannot allow.",12
5,Mr MCTIEBNAN,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to show that the motion does not raise a question of privilege, and therefore is not competent, and should not be allowed. (Mr. The ideas connoted by the term privilege do not include'the right to speak in the House contrary to the Standing Orders. of There has been no breach or disregard of the Standing Orders whereby the rights of honourable members have been violated. I submit that it was for the honourable member for Oxley (Mr . that the Bayley) to show that the Prime Minister disregarded some Standing Order, and thus deprived honourable members of some Minister right; he cannot claim an unreal or visionary right not allowed by the Standing Orders, as a matter of privilege. business. The honourable member's rights can only be exercised subject to the Standing Orders. I submit that, as it has not been alleged that the Standing Orders were contravened, broken, or disregarded in any way, there is no point of privilege in the honourable member's motion.",12
6,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"On the point of order, I submit that there is a distinction between the infringement of the Standing Orders and a question of privilege. The honourable member who has just resumed his scat has said that it is not alleged that there was any breach of the Standing Orders,. That is so. Breaches of the Standing Orders, I submit, are dealt with by rulings from the Chair; the Chair protects honourable members in their rights under the Standing Orders. A question of privilege is a different matter, and is dealt with in a different manner; and, as on this occasion, by a motion. I submit that it is for the House to determine whether there has been an unwarranted interference with the rights of private members as members of this Parliament. That, I submit, is the question which the motion raises; it is different altogether from any question of fringement of Standing Orders.",13
7,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Still , a prima facie case must be made out.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"This matter has given me considerable thought, and I have come to the conclusion that the motion of privilege which has been moved by the honourable member for Oxley must be proposed to the House. It is for the Chair to insist upon the observance of the Standing Orders and rules of procedure; but when the question of privilege is raised, it should, I think, be determined by a decision of the House itself.",13
9,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [2.45] - In seconding the motion, which I do with a perfectly clear conscience, I should like to say in reply to the point of order raised",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The point of order having been decided, the honourable member would not be in order in referring to it.",13
11,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"I recognize that, and I apologize for my error. It is for the House alone to determine whether its privileges have been interfered with. To interfere with those privileges is a right that resides only in this House, and it should be very carefully guarded. For that reason I support the motion of the honourable member for Oxley. Next to the privilege of ventilating grievances on the motion for Supply, there is no privilege more cherished by honourable members on both sides and of all parties than that enjoyed under the motion for the adjournment of this House. I submit that last night there was a definite, interference with that privilege. We, as an Opposition, would have been entirely lacking in our duty had we not taken the first opportunity to express our disapprobation of the unwarranted interference with our rights. No abuse of privilege was attempted, or even contemplated, by honourable members on this side of the House. Indeed, I may claim as much for every honourable member no matter on which side he sits. They sought only to use a right. The attitude of the Opposition towards Government business and the general conduct of business in this House has been generous, and I regret that an in- occasion has arisen when that attitude has been challenged by the Prime Minister. In supporting this motion, I do not propose to do more than reaffirm, as emphatically as I can, that there is nothing that this House should guard with greater jealousy than this privilege which has been possessed by honourable members ever since the institution of parliamentary government. The motion implies no direct censure on the Prime Minister, as such. The basic contention of the motion is that the rights of honourable members of this House must be jealously guarded, and we, as an opposition, should regard it as our first duty to see that our privileges are maintained at any cost, and no matter from where the challenge comes.",13
12,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.50] - We have listened to a sad story; based on nothing real.,13
13,Mr BEENNAN,Unknown,"A bed-time story. Mr Scullin"" - The grievance is purely imaginary. The mover of the motion admitted that my action last night was in accordance with the Standing Orders. Standing Order 262B saysAfter any question has been proposed, cither in the House or in any committee of the whole, a motion may be made by any member, .rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not, ""That the question be now put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwit h and decided without amendment or debate. To deny an honourable member the right to move that motion would be to deny him the enjoyment of the privilege it gives, and what the mover and seconder of the motion are seeking to do is to censure me for exercising that privilege. They would, indeed, deny me a right that every honourable member of this House possesses. Their motion, if carried, would constitute a breach of my privileges. I was quite within my rights in doing last night what I did, and what any other honourable member on either side of the chamber had the right to do.",13
14,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,I made that perfectly clear.,14
15,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Ye t the honourable member challenges my right to do what any honourable member may do! So much for that point. The second point that was made was that action such as mine had never been taken before.,14
16,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,In such circumstances.,14
17,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"What does the Leader of the Opposition mean by "" in such circumstances "" ?",14
18,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,Without any debate.,14
19,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"-Evidentl y the Leader of the Opposition supports the mover and seconder of the motion in saying that on the motion for the adjournment of the House having been moved, the motion "" That the question be now put"" had never previously been put before there was an opportunity given for debate.",14
20,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,That is what I understood the mover of the motion to say.,14
21,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,The mover of the motion can say whether that is what he said.,14
22,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"I said that, so far as I could find out, it had not been done.",14
23,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Then I shall give the honourable member some information. I invite him to refer to page 2843, volume Ixxi, of Hansard, where he will find that on the 31st October, 1913, the motion was put in such circumstances.",14
24,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,That was seventeen years ago.,14
25,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I do not know what limit of time the honourable member, puts to the word "" never "". On that occasion the then Prime Minister (Mr Joseph Cook) moved "" That the House do now adjourn"", and before there was any debate on it he moved "" That the question be now put"". The following day he took the same action in exactly similar circumstances. As I do not intend to allow government time to be occupied by motions of this kind, and as I have answered the points made by the previous speakers, I now move That the question be now put.

26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Norman Makin). - Havin g reviewed the proofs of the report of yesterday's proceedings, I am of opinion that my rulings regarding the asking of questions appear to have interpreted the Standing Orders too strictly. In deciding a point of order raised by the honourable member for Grey (Mr. Lacey), I stated that no honourable member was permitted to anticipate debate upon any business that was before the House. That ruling was strictly correct. No question should anticipate the discussion of business set down on the notice paper. May's Parliamentary Practice, and rulings by Mr Speaker Salmon and BAY Mr Speaker Johnson support that view. I appreciate, however, that a too narrow application might be given to my ruling. A question that seeks to elicit information upon business pending in the House is in order, but must not anticipate dis36 cussion. Therefore, honourable members should be careful to so frame their ques11 tions that they will meet this requirement. It should be emphasized that the AYES. Speaker is, until the House otherwise decides, the sole judge of whether questions are in order or not.",15
27,Mr LACEY,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation in connection with the statement that you, Mr Speaker, have just made.",15
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If it is the intention of the honourable member to review the ruling that I gave yesterday, he is not in order. The Standing Orders NOES. definitely lay it down that if an honourable member takes objection to a ruling, he must do so at once in writing, and debate on the motion to dissent from it is then forthwith adjourned to the next sitting day. If the honourable member was misrepresented by any statement that I had made, it is competent for him to endeavour to remove the misrepresentation by making a personal explanation; but he must not traverse any matter that relates to the ruling that I gave yesterday.",15
29,Mr LACEY,Unknown,"It is not my wish to traverse the matter at length. But there has been some misrepresentation, inasmuch as honourable members of this House know that yesterday I was indignant because of the ruling that you gave, and your explanation today may lead to the belief that such indignation was unwarranted.",15
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I cannot permit the honourable member to proceed along those lines, because he can see quite clearly that that would involve a discussion upon the ruling that I gave yesterday.",15
31,Mr LACEY,Unknown,"Will you inform me, sir, whether it is a fact that on the 4th December last, according to Hansard, page 679, the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) asked in this House certain questions relating to the duty on whisky ? _ ,",15
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Obviously I am not in a position to give offhand an answer to the question. The honourable member in asking it seeks to defeat the ruling that I gave yesterday; and I cannot allow him to do that. NA CUSTOMS. VIEWS ON FKEETBADE.,16
33,Mr WEST,MINISTER FOR TRADE AND,"During the visit to England of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton), whom I congratulate upon his safe return to Australia, the honourable gentleman was interviewed by many prominent persons. According to a report that has appeared in the press, he was interviewed by members of the International Free trade League, to whom he expressed certain opinions. Will he now state what are his views with respect to free trade?",16
34,Mr FENTON,MINISTER FOR TRADE AND,That is a momentous question that requires a great deal of consideration. I ask the honourable member to be good enough to give me notice of it. TASMANIA N SHIPPIN G SERVICE.,16
35,Mr BELL,MINISTER FOR TRADE AND,"The Advocate, a newspaper published in Tasmania, in its issue of the 16th June last, contained a report which stated that the Postmaster-General visited Hobart for the particular purpose of conveying to the supporters of his party the intimation that the Federal Government had decided not to proceed with the purchase of a Commonwealth, line of steamers to link Tasmania with the mainland, because of the fact that no money was available for that purpose. The Sydney Morning Herald today published an article headed ""Shipping Service,"" ""Tasmania and the mainland,"" ""Minister's difficulty,"" which readsBecause of the present financial stringency it is believed to be unlikely that any action will be taken by the Federal Ministry in the near future to establish a shipping service between Tasmania and the mainland. Will the Postmaster-General indicate the Government's intentions with respect to the provision of an improved shipping service between Tasmania and the mainland ?",16
36,Mr LYONS,MINISTER FOR TRADE AND,I ask the honourable member to give notice of that question.,16
37,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR TRADE AND,"Hon. Norman Makin). - The practice of reading extensively from newspaper clippings and letters when asking questions without notice is a growing one. Previous speakers have ruled against it, and, although I am reluctant to curtail the privileges of honourable members, I must ask them to make their quotations as brief as possible. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. TEMPOBABT AND EXEMPT EMPLOYEES. . Mr ELDRIDGE asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. How many temporary and exempt postal employees were listed for discharge when the present Government assumed office last year? 2. Was any action taken by the Government on assuming office to retain the services of all or any of the temporary and exempt employees ; if so, what' was the nature of such action ? 3. What was the number of temporary and exempt postal employees at the 1st November, 1029? 4. What number of temporary and exempt postal employees was employed at the 1st June, 1930?",16
38,Mr LYONS,MINISTER FOR TRADE AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Thirteen hundred, and the services of an additional 400 would have been terminated, as the works upon which they were engaged at the time reached completion. 2. Yes; additional funds were made available which resulted in the retention of the services of 1,720 men on telephone and telegraph construction work. 3. There were 2,195 temporary and exempt engineering workmen in the department's employ on 1st November, 1929. 4. The latest figure available is for the pay period ended 30th A p r i l, 1930, when 2,189 temporary and exempt workmen were still employed. It is unlikely that any marked variation in the number has been made since that time. NA COMPANIES.",16

NEW APPOINTMENTS.",18
49,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC," asked me a question regarding new appointments made to the permanent staff of the Commonwealth Public Service. Information which has been prepared by the Public Service Board shows that the number of persons appointed to the permanent staff of the Commonwealth Public Service during the period 1st December, 1929, to 31st May, 1930, was 615, while the number of persons w'ho left the Service during the same period was 441. The appointments made were, with few exceptions, to junior positions in the Public Service, vacancies for some of which had existed prior to the commencement of the period in question. While the number of positions created during that period was 540, the positions abolished numbered 616. The resultant decrease in the number of new appointments would not be wholly shown in the figure given for the period 1st December, 1929, to 31st May, 1930, but would be reflected in returns for subsequent periods.

I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that it is the practice of the court to include in the daily wage fixed in awards prescribing daily hiring an amount calculated to compensate the employee for time lost by reason of sickness and holidays. Consequently there are no awards of the court prescribing the payment of sick and holiday pay to employees whose engagement is from day to day. NA - AGREEMENT (WILUN A GOLD MINES ) BIL L. .

Bill brought up by Mr Forde, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",19
51,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.31] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of sewing is promachine heads within Australia, and I am of opinion, after careful investigation, that it will, lead to the establishment of a very important industry. Provision is made for payment of a bounty of £2 on each household sewing machine head manufactured in Australia for five years from the 1st October, 1930. The bounty is linked up with customs duties imposed as from the 20th June, 1930, on household sewing machine heads under item 168B of the tariff. These dutiesare 10s. British preferential tariff, and 20s. general - tariff, per head. As 70 per cent, of imported sewing machine heads come from the United Kingdom, itmay be said that the combined assistance proposed for the establishment of the sewing machine industry in Australia is equivalent to slightly over £2 10s. per household sewing machine head. The bill is drawn on the same lines as other bounty acts, except in regard to the following matters that have particular relation to the circumstances concerning - the manufacture of sewing machines:(a) the total amount of bounty payable in any one financial year will not exceed £20,000, but, as usual, the unpaid balance of any year may be paid in any subsequent financial year in addition to the maximum amount for that year; (6) the bounty of £2 per head will be reduced, if the present Customs duties on imported machine heads are increased, to an extent equivalent to the increase in such duties; and (c) no bounty will be payable unless at least 0:3 per cent, of the factory or works of each Australian sewing machine head is due to the costs of material and parts made in Australia, and of labour employed in Australia. In common with other bounty legislation, the bill provides for the withholding of the bounty in the event of the manufacturer not selling sewing machine heads at a reasonable price, or if his profits should exceed 10 per cent, per annum. Furthermore, the bounty will be withheld, if reasonable conditions of employment and rates of wages are not observed by the manufacturers in respect of employees engaged in the manufacture of the heads.",19
52,Mr GULLETT,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,Is provision made again for special tribunals?,20
53,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"Award s are operating in factories in the two States in which we expect manufacture to be undertaken, and, I hope that the appointment of special tribunals will not be necessary. The magnitude of the importations of sewing machines into Australia is not generally realized. For some time, the total imports have been approximately 45,000 sewing machines each year, and the present importations are slightly over 40,000 machines per annum, or 800 weekly. The value of"" the annual importation is: Sewing machine heads, £160,000; stands and cabinets, £170,000; total £330,000. Until 20th June, 1930, no duty was actually imposed on imported heads, but there have been, since the 1921 tariff, deferred duties on heads, namely, £2 10s., British preferential tariff £3 intermediate tariff; and £3 10s. general tariff on each imported head; . These deferred duties have been postponed from time to time pending the establishment of a local industry for the manufacture of heads, and they now stand deferred until on and after 1st January, 1931. In due course, if Australian manufacturers produce a sufficient number of sewing machine heads, the deferred duties will be made operative, and, in that event, the bounty of £2 per head provided by the bill will cease forthwith. If no other action is taken before the 1st January, 1931, the duty will become operative from that date, but the usual procedure is for the Tariff Board, after investigation, to report to the Minister whether the development of the industry cost is. such as to warrant the deferred duty coming into operation. I propose to refer now to the events which led to the Government's decision to introduce this bill. In 1924 Bendigo Sewing Machines Limited, of Bendigo, started making complete household sewing machines on the understanding that the Government of the day would soon apply the deferred duties on heads. The company had a right to expect that the deferred duty would be operative within a reasonable time, or that a bounty would be paid in the initial stages of the industry.",20
54,Dr EAKLE PAGE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,How many machines is the company making now?,20
55,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"No machines are being manufactured by them now, and the Government will not be committed to any liability until some have been produced.",20
56,Mr GULLETT,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,Meanwhil e the Government is collecting 10s. of customs duty for every machine head imported from the United Kingdom.,20
57,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"And £1 pet head unler the general tariff. The best machines are sold for about £19 4s. cash, and £24 on terms, and the importers make over 100 per cent, gross profit on the landed cost. Therefore, I do not think that they will be justified in passing the duty on to the public. The last Government in 1924 did not make the - duties operative, and, in May, 1925, the Bendigo company applied for a bounty of £2 10s. per head. The matter was referred in the usual manner to the Tariff Board for investigation, and, after a thorough inquiry, the Tariff Board recommended, in December, 1925, that a bounty .be paid for three years at the following rates:Output of 1 to 2,000 heads per annum, £2 10s. each; output of 2,001 to 4,000 heads per annum, £2 each; output of 4,001 and over per annum, £1 10s. each. This recommendation was supported hy the Comptroller-General of Customs, and the then Minister for Trade and Customs (the late Honourable H . E. Pratten), but the Government decided not to grant the bounty. It seems that the reason for this decision was that the Bendigo company was then only, producing sewing machines at the rate of 40 per week, or 2,000 per annum, whereas it had been the practice to expect a new industry to meet at lenst 40 per cent, of Australia's requirements before any tariff or bounty assistance would be given. In this case, of course, the Bendigo company was only producing 5 per cent, of the Commonwealth's requirements. I remind honourable members that however necessary or feasible the condition-namely , that 40 per cent, of Australia's requirements should be supplied by new industriesmight have been from the early days of federation up to the end of the war period, such a condition, if applied today, would effectually preclude the establishment of almost any new industry in Australia. During the earlier years of the Commonwealth, there was not such a great disparity between Australian and foreign costs of production, and it was possible for a well-capitalized concern to suffer the initial losses frequently volved in producing 40 per cent, of the Commonwealth's requirements of any particular article, and then, when the necessary tariff, protection had been given, the company could recover the earlier, .losses in a comparatively short time. To-day, however, that would seldom be possible owing to the larger ferences in costs now existing, to say nothing of the present lack of opportunities for mass production in Australia, and the reluctance of investors to face a long period of losses or absence of profits on their capital. As already stated, the Government of the day did not approve of assisting the Australian sewing machine industry, and the result was that the Bendigo Sewing Machines Limited failed and went into liquidation in 1926 after producing 1,500 sewing machines. I visited Bendigo in company with the member for the district (Mr. Keane) and received a deputation whiph strongly urged that something should be done by the Government to assist the industry for four or five years while it was becoming established, after which it would be able to supply a big percentage of Australia's requirements and could stand on its own feet.",20
58,Mr MAXWELL,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,Is there any proposal to require the manufacturers to refund the bounty out of their future profits?,21
59,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"There is a clause in the bill which provides that if the companies concerned make a profit of more than 10 percent, the bounty will be reduced accordingly. The failure of this coir*pany should not be taken as an indication that the successful production of Sewing machines in Australia is impracticable. After all, it must be remembered that the Bendigo cdmpany's failure was the natural result of having to manufacture, under Australian conditions, sewing machine heads on a free-trade basis in competition with similar heads produced in other parts of the world with much lower labour costs and under ideal conditions as to large output, and so on. As a matter of fact, inquiries made by the accountant of my department have proved that the Bendigo machine was practically identical with the best make of imported machine of that time, and, in a considerable number of cases that were ininvestigated, it was found that, after constant use for three and a half years, the Bendigo machine had given almost complete satisfaction. It had been used by dressmakers.",21
60,Mr KEANE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,And in schools.,21
61,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"In educational institutions and other places, and had given difcomplete satisfaction. That was a noteworthy achievement, considering the brief experience of the company in a project not previously tried in Australia, and the results suggest that there is no adequate reason why the major part of Australia's requirements for household sewing machines should not be made within the Commonwealth. I might add that the Wilson Sewing Machine Company, of North Melbourne, produced a few sewing machines in 1925, but it also' had to close down owing to lack of protection* Some mouths ago, the present Government was urged to consider the best means of reestablishing this industry. In view of the fact that a favourable report on the industry had been made by the Tariff Board in December, 1925, a special departmental investigation was made in regard to the plans that had been drawn up for the establishment of a new company at Bendigo for the manufacture of complete sewing machines. That investigation showed that the successful re-establishment of the industry was well within the realm of practicability. The skilled employees associated with the original company will still be available; all production machinery, except a few obsolete machines that have been disposed of, is still in Bendigo, and the persons behind the venture are men of good standing and financial resources. Both the Bendigo aud the Sydney companies are absolutely confident .that they can re-establish this industry.",21
62,Mr WHITE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,Will they guarantee that the whole of the machine will be Ausof tralian-made ?,22
63,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"They guarantee that 95 per cent, of the article will be AusJames tralian-made. The only part of the machine which will not be Australiansible made is worth about 2s. 6d. Furtherworks more, the Government was impressed the assurances of those concerned that adequate capital could be obtained for recommencing manufacture and meeting the initial difficulties of manufacture sale that are common to nearly every enterprise. The Government was also seized of the potential value of the ing machine industry to the Commonthe wealth. When producing between and 50 machines per week, the original Bendigo company employed 60 hands. That means that if Australia can make all the sewing machines it requires, contralian stant employment will be found 1,000 workers in sewing machine factories, in additiqn to which local manumust facture will immediately bring about demand for raw material, such as iron and wood for sewing machine, stands would, and cabinets respectively, and so prostart vide further employment in the timber, furniture, iron and other industries. Furthermore, the sound establishment of the manufacture of household sewing machines will most likely lead to the production of factory sewing machines, such as are used in the boot industry. A factory will be established almost immediately in Sydney, and in January or February next will commence manufacturing the rotary type of household sewing machine. It might be mentioned that the manufacture of sewing machines does not require a large number of highly skilled workmen, because practically au of the parts of the machine are stamped out or otherwise made from mastergauges, dies, templates, &c. It is of course, essential that gauges, dies and templates should be exceedingly accurate, and be maintained in that condition. This latter phase of the industry requires the employment of skilled engineers, and on this point the Bendigo company has satisfied the inquiries of the Government. Accordingly, it decided to, introduce the present bill. It is significant that, immediately following the announcement the Government's policy in this regard, I was interviewed by Mr E. M . MACDougall of Sydney, whose father, Mr. MACDougall, started the steel wire industry, in Australia, and was responfor the establishment of the huge of Rylands Bros. Limited, at Newwith castle, previously the Austral Nail Company. Mr MACDougall, senior, has been for the last four years president of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. and - Mr E. M . MACDougall was works and new sales manager, and a director of the Austral Nail Company, and, later, of sewRylands Bros. Limited. He supervised design and building of those factories 40 and the training of the workmen and staff, numbering between 800 and 1,000 men, who were all Australians.",22
64,Mr LEWIS,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,To what extent are Ausmaterials to be used in the manufor nearly facture of the machines?,22
65,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"The cost of the machine be 95 per cent. Australian. Mr R. a M. MACDougall informed me that he could obtain the necessary capital and if sufficient, protection is granted, a sewing machine factory in Sydney by the end of next November. Mr James MACDougall will be a director and a substantial shareholder of the new company. "" Mr MACDougall expects that his company's production will begin at the rate of 5,000 machines per annum, and soon develop to 10,000 per annum. Already he has a suitable factory under offer. Fifty employees will be engaged at the start, probably 100 next January and 200 the following June. Both vibrator and rotary types of sewing machines will bo made. The company will build most of its plant in Australia and has already obtained an efficient engineering shop. Selling arrangements have been made with two of the biggest distributors of Sydney, subject to the quality of the machines being satisfactory. It is also important to note that, although all sewing machine heads are now imported, local industries have already been established for the manufacture of the ironwork stands, and also the cabinets. Some S,000 machine heads each year are thus fitted with Australian stands and cabinets, which are made in Sydney, and the quality and appearance of the Australian workmanship are exceptionally good. The cabinets are well worth inspection. The bill will certainly stimulate the local production of cabinets and stands, as well as render possible the manufacture of the machine heads. It is important to note that the duties on imported heads, imposed as from 20th June, 1930-10s . British preferential tariff, 20s. foreignwill at once return additional revenue to the extent of £25,000 per annum on the present importations. . That amount will, of course, be reduced as local manufacture progresses. However, it is not expected that more than 8,000 Australian machines will be made during the first twelve months of the operation of the. bounty, or more than 10,000 to 11,000 machines during the second twelve months. Therefore, the duties that are already being collected will be more than sufficient to pay the bounty during the first two years, and the Government is of opinion that these duties will cover the whole cost of the bounty during the five years of the operation of the act.",22
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,Is there to be a trust fund?,23
67,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"There will be no hankyof panky business; the money will be allolabour cated for this purpose as required. The Tariff Board's recommendaful tions of 1925 have been departed the Government. from in two respects. The first is in . regard to the duration of the bounty. The Tariff Board, recommended three years, whereas the bill provides for a five years' bounty. Similarly, the Tariff Board recommended a reduction in the bounty of 10s. per head when the output of any manufacturer is between 2,001 and 4,000 machines per annum, and a further reduction of 10s. per head when the annual output exceeds 4,000. machines. But the Government has decided, for several reasons, that it is advisable to pay the full rate of bounty for the five years without any sliding-scale reductions. When the Tariff Board recommended the adoption of a sliding scale a factory was in actual operation with a regular staff, and it was ready to begin immediately a campaign of quick expansion which might have justified the expectation that after three years the imposition of the deferred duties would be the best course to pursue. But at present no Australian companies are operating. One company is dormant",23
68,Mr KEANE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,The Bendigo company is hibernating.,23
69,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"That is so; and the Sydney company is only now making preparations to start production in a big way. To all intents and purposes, both companies will have to start de novo and will meet the usual difficulties that confront any new project. Moreover the Government is of the opinion, after carefully investigating the effect of increased production on overhead costs, that the reduction' of 10s. per head recommended by the Tariff Board for an output of between 2,001 and 4,000 machines per annum was not justified by the actual trading results of the old Bendigo company. Four thousand machines per annum would be only 80 per week, which is a bagatelle compared with the Australian demand of 800 per week, and it was found in 1925 that an output of only 80 machines per week, or 4,000 per annum would represent, for the first two or three years at any rate, a total cost production, including direct costs of and materials, plus overhead and selling expenses, that would require the l .measure-of assistance proposed by In any case, the interests of the Commonwealth are protected by other clauses of the bill. If experience shows that the bounty of £2, plus the duties-10s . British preferential, and 20s. foreignare too high at the stage when our manufacturers have obtained a large share of the local market, and should have reduced their overhead costs, then the net profits, together with the bounty, would obviously exceed the reasonable amount of 10 per cent, mentioned in the bill under clause 11. In that event, so much of the bounty as may cause the net profits to exceed 10 per cent, will be withheld from, or be required to be refunded by, the manufacturer. It has been arranged for the further protection of the public that the accountant of the department, Mr Townsend, shall, in future, supervise the ment of all bounties and investigate the effects of them, with the object of ensuring that the recipients shall make the best use of them.",23
70,Dr EARLE PAGE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,He will have to work 24 hours a day to do that.,24
71,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"Unfortunately , he is working long hours at present; but that can be dealt with in another way. In this particular instance, Mr Townsend will be able to advise the Government as to whether the conditions are being observed, and whether the company is profiteering. He will also be able to ensure that the consumers will get a fair deal, as they certainly should do when public money is being expended to encourage an industry.",24
72,Mr MAXWELL,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,What will be the ultimate difference in price between imported and locally manufactured machines?,24
73,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"It is expected that when this industry gets on its feet the manufacturers will be able to produce machines equal to the imported machines at a lower price than the people have to pay for machines today. We believe that our experience in connection with sewing machines will be a repetition of our experience in connection with electricity meters. It will be rememberedthat when the New South Wales Electricity Meter Company started manufacturing meters in Australia the price of meters here was 36s. each, but today it 27s. Similar instances of reductions in price have occurred after other manufacturing industries have been established here. First-class sewing machines can be landed in Australia for approximately £8 10s. each; but the public is being charged more than double that price for them. I believe that as soon as there is active competition in this industry in Australia, cheaper sewing machines will be made available to the public. There will be the additional advantge that the money spent on these machines will remain in the country and not go overseas. The Government believes that any provision for lower rates of bounty would cramp the industry at the very time it needed capital and resources to develop its production on the very best technical lines, and to meet the intense competition pay- that may be expected from the wellentrenched, vested importing interests. The investigations that have been made indicate that the Government's policy will result in the public obtaining good sewing machines at less than the present average selling prices.' The original Bendigo machine was usually retailed at £15 cash, and sometimes lower, whereas nearly 70 per cent, of the imported machines are sold in Australia at £19 4s. cash and £24 time-payment. I doubt whether there is any industry in which so much wastage occurs, or the cost of distribution is so high, as in the sewing machine industry.",24
74,Mr GULLETT,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,That - is probably because the sale of machines has to be personally canvassed.,24
75,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"Eve n if that is so, it does not justify the charging of such a high price for the imported machines. I am confident that the re-establishment of this industry in Australia will mean that we shall make available to the public an article at least equal to the imported machine at probably £15, as against the £19 4s. that is charged today.",24
76,Dr EARLE PAGE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,At what price will the machines be sold for in the early stages of the re-establishment of the industry? Has a price list been prepared?,24
77,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"I am not able to give the right honourable member any details on that point at the moment. In any case, it would probably not be wise to is make public the price that the rival companies propose to charge for their machines; but there is every prospect that the public will benefit as the result of the re-establishment of this industry in Bendigo and the opening of a new factory in Sydney.",24
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,Is there any effecadjourned. tive provision in the bill to protect the interests of the public?,25
79,Mr FORDE,SEWING MACHIN E BOUNTY,"The right honourable member may rest assured that the interests of the public will be safeguarded. an amendment. Both the Sydney and Bendigo companies have undertaken to sell their complete machines at substantially less than £19 4s. cash, or £24 terms; and the vernment is of the opinion, after examinpage ing all the facts, that these undertakings can undoubtedly be carried out. I commend the bill to the favourable consideration of honourable members also because it will lead, to some extent at least, to the decentralization of industry. I was delighted when I visited towns like Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo, to find that a big industrial decentralization movement is on foot in Victoria. It was a revelation to me to see such well equipped factories as I found in those towns. We need to encourage people to establish homes outside of the metroprevails politan areas of all the States, and meacult sures of this kind must have a good effect in that regard. One of the great difficulthe ties that we are facing in Australia present is the centralization of our populait tion in the capital cities. We should everything possible to counteract that. I am glad to submit this bill to the ment of the House, for I believe that it well deserves the most favourable concompetitive sideration of honourable members. Apart from the fact that the measure is denecessai'y signed to stem the flow of imports and create more employment in Australia, should lead to the re-establishment of factory at Bendigo, which would, as have said, mitigate the tendency towards the centralization of industries in the already well-developed capital cities, and provide a good means of livelihood for young men in Bendigo, who otherwise might have to leave their homes to secure employment. The opening of the new factory in Sydney should also improve the position of the industry by creating a healthy competition between the Australian companies. When these two factories are in full swing we : may look forward with confidence to the day in the not distant future when Australians will make all the sewing machines that are needed here. Debate (on motion by Mr GULLETT) NA BILL. Bill returned from the Senate with NA ARBITRATION BILL. SECOND READING. GoDebate resumed from 24th June {vide 3132), on motion by Mr BRENNANThat the bill be now read a second time. [Quorum formed.]",25
80,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"Cowper) [4'.13]. In February of this year the Prime Minister made a public statement to the effect that he had been advised from London that among the reasons which had caused Australian stocks to fall in price were the fall in the price of our wool and the industrial trouble that occurred in Australia. The low price of 'our primary products, and the industrial unrest that here, undoubtedly make it diffito obtain capital from overseas for new Australian industries. The fall in price of our commodities also reduces at the wealth of our own people and makes difficult to provide employment for do them and to maintain our present standard of living. These difficulties can judgbe overcome only by meeting falling prices with an increased production at prices. But the co-operation of every individual in the community is to increase our production, and that co-operation is, in turn, entirely deitpendent upon the maintenance of peace the in industry. In these circumstances, I I submit that the value of this bill must be judged by the extent to which it causes the Federal Arbitration Court system to work more satisfactorily than it has done in the past. If we can have peace in industry under proper conditions we shall be able to increase our production. The bill will not tend to eliminate the irritating delays and' duplication of awards which have been a feature of the two past. When one examines this bill in detail one finds that it really does nothing for the various partners in industrylabour, capital, management; and the community. The only section, 'upon which it will confer any benefit are union officials, who may be pointed under the bill as conciliation commissioners, in which office they will exercise practically all the powers now reposing in judges of the Arbitration Court. The bill will tend to weaken or destroy the rights of individual members of trade unions. The Labour party has seriously injured the principle of arbitration by refusing to support awards made after the careful study - of the industries concerned. Its attitude towards the timber-workers' strike and the waterside-workers' dispute went a long way towards destroying the faith of the people in the arbitration system. That faith was wounded in the past; from this bill it will receive its death blow. This is the thirteenth amendment of the Arbitration Act; it was moved on a Friday, and I am sufficiently superstitious to believe that the result will be fatal. Every one must recognize that federal Government has failed a great opportunity of producing something really worthwhile in the way of democratic industrial legislation. The Australian Labour party was created forty years ago for the specific purpose of improving industrial conditions. The party has on been consolidated, and to some extent ordering ganized, by industrial legislation passed in the meantime. Labour was returned at all. to this Parliament with a definite mandate to make the federal arbitration sysphrases. tem work satisfactorily from the point of view of the community as a whole. The Labour Government commands the largest majority ever enjoyed by any single party in this Parliament. It had unique chance to break new ground; to get right above those issues which the past have tended to divide the forces of industry. It should have brought forward a comprehensive scheme of inber dustrial self-government, one which would restore, and maintain, goodwill, and banish the existing atmosphere of conflict and suspicion. It should have evolved a system whereby labour and capital could combine in harmony, giving to industry a real charter entirely.indedore). pendent of politics. The truth of Mr. Dr Earle Page. Samuel Gompers.' statement regarding the eifect of the Labour movement's entry into politics is becoming more and ap- more evident. Speaking in New York, in 1918, he saidThe fact is that an independent political Labour party becomes either radical, social-'istic, or else revolutionary-bu t it is primarily devoted to one thing and that is to vote-getting. Every sail is trimmed to the getting of votes. Because the Australian Labour party has been intent upon winning political honours, the welfare of trade unionists has been, to a considerable extent, lost sight of. Members of the Government, as a result of their association with the trade union movement, were in a position to introduce legislation which would have conferred real benefits upon the trade union movement, but nothing of that kind has been done in the bill now before us. If honourable members will read the speeches made by myself and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) before the last election, they will see that the last Government was proceeding to carry out a constructive the policy in regard to trade unionism. to grasp Speaking in 192S, I said:The bill aims at giving responsible and self-government and control, to the unions that are registered in the Federal Arbitration Court. It places the responsibility of disciplining the members of unions the organizations themselves, and it provides means for the extinction of the smoulfires of job control. All these things will help and not harm or hinder unionism",25
81,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,They are nicely turned,26
82,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"-Yes , and they outline a policy which, had it been carried into effect, would have benefited trade unionism, and industry as a whole. As a Mr Gompers pointed out, the attention of the Labour party is entirely devoted into winning votes. The good of unionism has been subordinated entirely to political exigencies. One has only to rememthe recent coal dispute to understand that. First the miners were induced to give up their work, and they were then encouraged to .refuse the terms offered, because they were hoping all the time for some form of political interference as promised by the Treasurer (Mr TheoThe timber strikers also were led to believe for months that relief would bo given to them by legislation. They have since been undeceived. When the Bruce-Page Government brought down its arbitration amending bil! in 192S, members of the Labour party said that everything done by our Government tended to create industrial turmoil. Last year, however, when we introduced a proposal to abandon the field of industrial legislation to the States, the very same critics produced figures to show that the period during which the Bruce Page Government had been in office had been notably free from-industrial trouble. They cannot have it both ways. This merely provides another proof that the political Labour party is always ready to trim its sails to any wind likely to waft it to political success. It is proposed in this bill to repeal the provision in the act providing that any ten members of an industrial organization may apply to the court for an order requiring the taking of a secret ballot. That provision has, since its insertion, been opposed by the small clique which dominates the trade union movement, aud desires to perpetuate class warfare. They tried to show that the provision was intended as an attack on working conditions, and the Government has heeded their argument. Personally, I should like to see membership of a union recognized as a guarantee of efficiency, but it appears to be the policy of this Government to remove any provisions requiring persons associated with trade unions or their management to be properly qualified. Por instance, conciliation commissioners, with a power formerly possessed by Arbiration Court judges, are to be appointed to deal with industrial disputes, but it is not stipulated that they shall possess any definite qualifications for the work. In my profession a man must first of all be qualified, and then, before becoming eligible for membership of our organization, must prove that he is competent. I should like to see such a standard of efficiency insisted upon that unions would not tolerate bad workmanship from their members. I also think that the executive officers of trade unions should be given move definite tenure of office than they enjoy to-dny. When a man has to stand for election every year, he is compelled to think continually of how the rank and file of the organization will regard his stewardship, instead of being able to take a long view of his work. Provided he is competent, he should enjoy the same security of tenure as the managers of big industrial concerns. I should also like to see trade unions interesting themselves in 1 other things than fighting for awards before the Arbitration Court. Actually, wages and conditions should, as much as possible, be fixed, not by the Arbitration Court, but by bargaining between or. ganizations of employers and employees. 1 should like to see, also, an extension of the social benefits that trade unions are in a peculiarly happy position to give. In otliQr countries, where the workers have not completely immersed themselves in politics, they have themselves secured the benefits of unemployment insurance schemes, benevolent funds, labour banks, and the means of controlling and owning industry. Those activities provide an outlet for the energy and ability of members of unions, and enable them to rise to important positions instead of displaying mental agility in arbitration court cases, or ultimately becoming representatives of the workers in Parliament. One of the causes of industrial unrest throughout the world today is that the active-minded men, who feel that their capacity is great enough to enable them to rise superior to the drudgery of their lives, have not sufficient opportunities to employ their energies. If. those energies were given full play in constructive union activities, there would be more industrial peace, bigger production, lower costs, and better conditions, generally. If there is any body whose duty it is to provide those opportunities, it is the Labour party. That party was brought into existence to raise economically the mass of the workers of this country. But our experience emphasizes the assertion that is sometimes sardonically made, that now that the Labour party has become a political force it realizes that there would be no reason for its existence if it cured our economic ills, and, accordingly, it wishes a number of grievances to remain unremedied so that it can use them for the purpose of obtaining votes. It should have been the object of this Government to bring down a bill designed along the lines that I have indicated, rather than - one which is merely a pale reflection of obsolete measures that in the past have failed to ensure industrial peace, and that in the future may lead to iudustrial war. The people hoped for a comprehensive measure that would wipe out old sores, destroy mistrust and suspicion, allay antagonisms, and lay the basis for mutual trust and goodwill. Instead of that, they are given a replica of old shibboleths and formulas, dressed in somewhat similar garb, but with the difference that capital is to be chastised with scorpions instead of whips. I deplore the time chosen and the methods adopted for the introduction of this bill. It was brought down in the middle of the hearing of a case in the Arbitration Court in connection with the graziers' award, a matter in which the Australian Workers Union, the biggest union in Australia, is vitally concerned. It is well known that the incomes of those who carry on the grazing industry of, Australia are today less than half what they were two or three years ago. When times were good and prices high, the shearers earned big money.",26
83,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,"The cost of living was high, too.",28
84,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not dispute that. I point out, however, that during, and since the war, the grazing industry carried Australia on its back, and enabled, not. only the shearers, but also many other people to enjoy much better conditions than otherwise they would have had. Now the industry has met such troublous times that many of those who are engaged in it can see their incomes disappearing. Dozens of men with whom I am acquainted are unable to employ any labour, even in their households. Large numbers of those who, last year, had an income running into thousands of pounds, this year are not able to meet the expenses of management. The industry has been the sheet anchor of Australia's prosperity for the last fifteen or twenty years, and has paid high wages to those who have been employed in it. Surely, now that it is under the weather, th s is not the time to hring down a bi'l which aims a blow at the procedure adopted in the making of its awards and to push the industry deeper into the morass from which it is making gallant efforts to extricate itself. The provisions of the bill place individual members of unions at the mercy of union officials. .It is an ironical jest to call the measure a conciliation and arbitration bill, and to state in the title that it is ""to promote goodwill."" According to the Sydney Morning Herald of today's date, the President of the Chamber of Manufactures, in Sydney, holds the following opinion :Under a plea that the hill was designed to promote goodwill in industry by conciliation and arbitration, the Federal Government was threatening to land Australia still deeper in the bog of industrial instability and unrest. The measure had all the elements of discord and unrest.",28
85,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,"He is suffering from hallucinations, as are many other people.",28
86,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"He and other manufacturers have a large amount of capital involved. They must consider not only that capital, but also the well-being of every worker who is dependent upon them for employment. That is a very serious obligation, and they speak with a due sense of their responsibility. If honourable members wish to make this a bill that-will bring goodwill and peace to industry, they should pay attention to what manufacturers and employers generally say regarding the provisions which, in their opinion, will lead to conflict. Their suggestions must hot be' brushed aside; they have not been made in any partisan spirit.",28
87,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I am sorry to say that they ' have been bitterly partisan, and entirely unjust in their criticism.",28
88,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"The . statement that I have just read is hot a partisan one. If every honourable member opposite approaches this matter in the oiie-eyed manner suggested by the Attorney General's interjection, there is not the slightest hope of Australia being benefited! In my opinion, the bill will do a great deal to make unionists themselves dissatisfied with the arbitration system as well as with the control that is exercised over them by their officials. The democratic ; safeguards that were incorporated in the last amending measure do not find a place in this. Just as the 1890 depression .brought about a revolt of the workers against the employers, I should not be surprised if the existing depression results in the workers revolting against the tyranny of union officials. The bill will bring, not peace, but a sword. Many of its provisions contain the elements of class warfare, and will tend to create division where there should be unity. The result must be an accentuation of the bad impression that has already been created by many of the hasty and ill-considered actions of this Government. In February last, the Prime Minister said that he had received from London advice to the effect that in the opinion of the outside world the low prices of our products and the industrial troubles that had occurred in Australia were the two great contributing factors to the loss of Australia's prestige abroad. The abolition of compulsory military training, the imposition of embargoes on imports, the Government's refusal to face the vital question of the cost of production, and its interference with the gold standard of currency, have tended to bring Australia's prestige to the lowest level that it has ever reached. We should be careful to avoid doing anything further to accentuate that impression. It is worthwhile quoting the view of the London Times on this matter. Referring to a statement by the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) with respect to the cost of production, it said It is, of course, immaterial what Mr . Scullin subscribes to, because the purchasing power of the workers is not a matter within his control. Wages in terms of money arc one thing, purchasing power is another. The point that really concerns the workers is the exchange value of their labour in terms of the necessaries and luxuries of life. In the long run the wealth production of any country divided by the number of its inhabitants decides the average standard of living, and nothing Mr Scullin can do will alter it important, however, to emphasize the condition in the long run, because Australia by borrowing abroad has been able hitherto to postpone the evil day. How little the position is yet understood there is shown by the recent complaint of the maritime workers that reduced imports have rendered thousands unemployed. That, too, was inevitable because, though the workers do not realise it , Australia's difficulty is not internal but external. Imports would have diminished, tariff or no tariff, 'because, as the exchange rates show, tralia had failed to create by exports, services, or borrowing the necessary credits abroad to pay for them. Meanwhile, there is no escape from the fact that if wealth production is diminished the people will have less to share. In the long run, the only remedy for Australia's plight is increased production of goods at prices that w i ll enable them to be sold in the world's markets; loans, if she is fortunate enough to get them, should be regarded as temporary accommodation to provide a breathing space to enable her to put her house in order. It seems to me that this bill represents Labour's most abject failure since its assumption of office. It was given a special mandate to remove from the arbitration system all legalisms and difficulties that prevented the consummation of industrial peace. After a period of nine months, the mountain has brought forth, not a mouse, but a germ which may cause lockjaw in the industries of this country. Instead of' putting unions under the control of the members themselves, they are to be governed by union officials. . Under clause 31, the principle of absolute preference to unionists is placed in the forefront of the bill. A worker will not be able to obtain a job under this provision unless he is a unionist. I am prepared to admit that unionism may be a good thing; but, if there is to be compulsory unionism in every calling, there should be certain fundamental qualifications associated with it. The first requirement is that there should be easy entrance by means of nominal fees, at any rate, into the unions. In New Zealand any man can join a union on payment of 5s. Extravagant entrance and maintenance fees should not be charged. The second requirement is that the members themselves should have complete control over their organization. Therefore, it is essential that the members should have the right to express their opinion by means of a secret ballot, which should be part and parcel of the constitution of every . It is union. Everybody who has had to deal with large bodies of workmen knows that there is a tendency for a few dominating spirits, who very frequently do not properly interpret the mind of the whole organization, to take charge in union affairs. If there is no provision for a secret ballot, which makes possible the same independent expression of Ausopinion as that obtained under the electoral law, the great body of the unionists will be unable to give ful l expression to their wishes in union matters. There should be a secret ballot clause in the constitution of every trade union.",28
89,Mr LONG,CONCILIATION AND,Can the honourable member name any organization of workers that has not such a clause in its constitution?,30
90,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,The bakers' union has no such clause.,30
91,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"The marine cooks in their recent industrial dispute complained most bitterly that for several years Mr Tudehope had not given them an opportunity to express their views. At the time of the trouble I quoted statements made in the press, including a letter from the organization itself, which bear out my contention. If honourable members say that such a provision is part and parcel of the constitution of every union registered in the Arbitration Court, what harm can there be in leaving the act as it is? What advantage is to be gained by eliminating it? If we are to have compulsory unionism, the members of unions are entitled to take secret ballots when they desire to express their opinion as a body.",30
92,Mr BKENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The provision for a secret ballot has proved to be very irritating,. and quite futile in practice.",30
93,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"That is the most weak and unconvincing statement that I have ever heard a lawyer make. The Attorney-General suggests that we must not pass laws for the guidance and safeguard of the people of this country, because they may prove irritating to wrongdoers. If any organization is, working satisfactorily there will be no desire by its members for a secret ballot; but, should they be dissatisfied with the management of their - organization, what democrat enjoying manhood suffrage, which gives the right of a secret ballot at election time, can possibly defend the attitude of the Government on this matter?",30
94,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,Te n men could now dislocate the affairs of the union.,30
95,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"Unde r the present act such a ballot can be taken only at the discretion of the judge; and, under the bill, it could be at the discretion of the conciliation commissioners. If the Government expects .the last word in wisdom to come from these commissioners, and if it has supreme confidence, in them, they ought to be able to exercise sufficient discretion to determine whether or not a secret ballot should be held in those cases in which members of the union ask for it. The second fundamental requirement of compulsory unionism is that if a mau does not desire to remain a member of a union, because, perhaps, he has accepted another job, or has started on his own account, surely he should be permitted to resign when he pleases. The bill stipulates that there can be no resignation while a plaint is under consideration. He would be a very poor secretary of a big union who could not keep a plaint continually under consideration by the Arbitration Court.",30
96,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,There ought to be some limitation of time.,30
97,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . It is absurd to suggest that this provision should operate for ever and a day. It is au iniquitous proposal. The Government should not be given power to force men into unions unless the unionist is given compensating safeguards. I notice also that the individual's right of appeal to the court against expulsion from a union is eliminated by this bill. At the present time, a unionist has an opportunity to appeal to the court, and for some extraordinary reason the Government proposes to abolish the right of appeal. This is another right of the individual that is to be sacrificed for some mysterious reason. I am afraid that this proposal, if agreed to, will result in a certain amouut of tyranny. It is proposed that unqualified auditors shall be allowed to examine the books of the unions. The late Government brought in a provision to ensure that only qualified auditors should be permitted to examine those books. If there is to be compulsory membership of unions, compulsory payment of union fees, and no right of resignation from a union- a person, will be unable to obtain work unless he is a unionist-surel y it is reasonable that the funds of the unions should be safeguarded in every possible way. The bill merely provides that a competent auditor may be appointed. In the medical association a qualified auditor is insisted on, and whether he is competent or not is ascertained by experience of his work. A similar course is pursued in the legal profession, members of which must first qualify themselves before they accepted. Unionists, themselves should have. control over their leaders and the handling of their funds. Some time ago the Miners Federation pointed out that out of about £64,200 contributed in union fees since 1920, only £19,103 had been drawn out. There should have been a profit of £45,096, and the Queensland section of the union claimed that the central council of the organization had nothing to show for it.' If the payment of union fees is to be made compulsory, the unionists should be protected. The Bruce-Page Government applied to unions the same rules as those appertaining to friendly societies, to ensure the proper control of union funds. Finally, it is essential that, if there is to be compulsory unionism, the members of 'the union should not be called upon to pay political levies without their definite' consent.. In a civilized community there should be the freest possible expression of individual political views. If unionists are to be forced into a political party organization in order to get work, their funds should not be used contrary to their convictions. It is incompatible with compulsory unionism . to compel men to join political parties in which they may not have the slightest interest. It is worthwhile to consider the reasons why American unions decided not to engage in politics. Mr Samuel Gompers says, in his autobiographyThe emancipation of the working class can be achieved through their own efforts and that emancipation will not bring class rule and class privileges for them but equal rights and duties for all members of society. Economic betterment is the first step to the desired end; to its achievement all political effort must be subordinated. Political action can be effective only by constituting the labour class a separate political party. The emancipation of labour' is not merely local or national, but is international. He stated that what he desires-and I imagine that it is what everybody desires - is that in seeking emancipation the working classes' should not be segregated as one section, but should have equal rights with all members of the community. That; can be done only if unionism is divorced from politics. On many occasions Mr Gompers pointed out that engaging in politics tends to dissipate the economic influence of the unions, and has an adverse effect on their econoare mic betterment and wage conditions. He says, at' page 268 of volume 2, of his autobiographyThe federation has maintained that economic organization is adequate to deal with all of the problems of wage-earners. Its political action is simply to .utilize the functions of the trade union in another Meld. He relates that he visited England and discussed this subject with representatives of the trade unions of Great Britain. He continuesWhen it came time for me to speak, I referred to the fact that since the British Labour movement had inaugurated its political activity and launched an independent Labour party, progress in securing better wages, hours, and conditions of work had been retarded. At the conclusion of my remarks David J. Shackleton, then Leader of the Labour party and prominent in the Trade Union Congrees, said substantially: "" Mr Gompers is . absolutely right. I know from my own knowledge of the textile trade that wherever textile workers have been most active in. politics they have been the poorest organized with the poorest conditions."" After the dinner Mr. Whitehorn, Official Reporter for the Parliamentary Committee, told me that Mr Shackleton had asked him to make no mention of that portion of the above statement. It seemed that for political expediency economic truth had to be suppressed. What must happen all the time was described by Mr Gompers in 1918The fact is that an independent political Labour party becomes either radical so-called or else revolutionary-bu t it is primarily devoted to one thing and that is vote getting. Every sail is trimmed to the getting of votes.",30
98,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,How did he know? He had no practical experience.,31
99,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"He has been connected with unions all his life, and has been instrumental in lift in g the standards of the American worker higher than those of any other workers in the world.",31
100,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,Moonshine !,31
101,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,The statement can be verified by official statistics and other authoritative publications. The effective purchasing power of wages in the United States of America is higher than in any other country.,31
102,Mr MARTENS,CONCILIATION AND,That is nonsense.,31
103,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"It is true. In Philadelphia, the effective wages are from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, above those in Canada, and Canadian wages''are 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, above those of Australia.",31
104,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,What did Mr Adam say?,32
105,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"^The honourable member contends, that he and his. colleagues are. better qualified to speak on industrial matters than I am because they have had practical experience, and I am only a theorist. Now he asks us to accept the observations of, Mr Adam, who passed through America in four or five months, against the experience of Samuel Gompers,. who. spent his, whole life in the industrial movement there. Politics makes the Labour party continually shift its ground, because it has allowed unionism to get away f'r,om the only true and safe basis,-economi c facts. Absolute preference tounionists must be accompanied by these qualifications- a minimum entrance f,ee, reasonable financial provision for carrying on. the work of the union, no political! levy, maintenance of the unj.on as. an economic organization, the right to; resign at any time, right of appeal, against expulsion and, proper pretention, Q£ the. funds of, the organization.

Nothing would' do mojie .toi damageAustralia in the eyes of the: wonldi than the blazoning fOjit<h, as part of' the policy of this Government, that,, in future^ economic facts, are tor be-ignored, and that we inr tend to act; asif Australia were at Ro.bin , sonCrusoe.! island, economically.,, politi-. cally, and financially detached from the' rest of the world.. W.e must recognize that w,e cannot take outof' the pot more than isjuitunto it, aiid that the highest-average wage that, can, be paid, is represented by the total wealth, produced divided by thetotal number of workers in. the community. During the> last few years, we have shut ojir eyes, to thatfact. As. a result, of. the intrusion off politics, into., the economicfield-,aijd:the«user.of the,-arbitration systemi as a. fairyi godmotherdis-; pensing borrowed moneyand the high-, prices received for products, in the pro-, duction of which only a limited amount of labour is employed, we have been able to shorten hours, increase wages, and bring about a rigid demarcation of industry and employment which has led to considerable overmanning. Now we have reached the end of that period; the loan money available has diminished, and the price of wool has dropped. Yet the Government still refuses to face the facts. Recognizing that intelligent judges will not find it possible to award wages which are so much at variance with economic realities, it has decided to, substitute untrained partisans, who, as industrial commissioners, will! award a wage which cannot be justified by sober economic facts. It is interesting to quote the opinion expressed by Mr Sawkins, Statist to the Industrial Commission in New South Wales. He was formerly associated with Mr Justice Beeby on theBoard of Trade, and has had a long experience of industrial matters. He. shows, conclusively that whether economic effects, be mentioned in the act or not, they have, neverbeen disregarded, and never can be disregarded by the, court.. In, July,, 1929,.he said Twenty years? his tor, j ; hasshown, that; it is beyond, the. power, of the wage-fixing authorities to raise the average standard' of living, either of thebasic-wage' earner or of thei whole Body of' wage-earners. This can only, come as a result, of'increased production by, the nation, as a whole making mor.e goods, to be divided amongst us all, In addition, an examination of the history of the basic wage as fixed by the States indicates clearly thab economic, necessities periodically bring; into being a uniform' basic-wage rate im all the States.. In fact, at the present time the figures of the, variousState basic wage rates-, have asmaller rangethan that of r the Federal, Arbitration Court-basic-wage rates in'j the) different: localities.* The recital of the history of the attempts to establish abasic-wage rate in Australia is extraordinarily interesting' as demonstrating these points as well as from the point of viewofits, effect upon pricesand its effect upon unemployment. When the basic-wage rates of all the authorities, State-or Federal; are examined it is found thai, the-universal practice in. determining-the basic-wage rate has been, to choose. approxi T mately the ruling, rate as a basic-wage rate and then to seek methods* of justifying the chosen rate-in terms of-whatever domestic-unit was .taken or prescribed. Experience, has-shown these authorities that marked departures from ruling ra.tes, even when gradually applied; were inevitably, followed' by acorresponding movement of .the pricesi level (and,, when-applied instantaneously, were followed by instantaneous movement in unemployment. Postwar history, which has been a period of disturbed prices in Australia, is sufficient to demonstrate these points very clearly. That wage regulation does not of itself increase the effective values of wages is proved by the figure's of the Commonwealth Statistician (Mr Wickens) as to the value of effective wages over a period of years. These figures show that in 1920, thirteen years after the "" Harvester decision"", the basic wage being paid, despite the increases in the nominal wages, was not then equivalent to the actual wage of 30s. per week paid by MCKay in 1907, and which the ""Harvester decision"" set out to rectify. All the wage fixation up to that time, whether founded on the number of children and a wife, or propped up by various devices of using index numbers, had gone for less than nothing. The basic-wage standard of living remained where it had been. The effective wage of 1907. disguised in a money garb which was certainly twice as voluminous but of only half its original texture and belittled, if anything, by the persistent efforts to improve it , remained the average living or basic wage of 1920. To correct this position the New South Wales Government of 1920 brought in an 8s* rise in the basic wage suddenly. The reaction was swift. In three months the unemployment percentage rose from 7 per cent, to 14 per cent., whereas other States showed only slight increases and. their unemployment percentage remained between 8 per cent, and 9 per cent. A similar result of increase in unemployment percentage to 10 per cent, occurred in Queensland mi its attempt to raise the basic wage suddenly. Then the wage-fixing tribunals throughout Australia, recognizing the disastrous effects that .had come from the sudden raising of the iiomiiial basic wage, tried the otlier alternative. In October, 1921"" New' South Wales reduced its livintr wage from £4 Ss. to '£3 18s. In April, 1922, Victoria averaged 13s. Od. per day. In ' Apri l J922 South Australia averaged 1 2 s . ' l i d . per day. In Queensland, in A p r i l, 1922, the Arbitration Court reduced the basic wage from £4 2s. to £4. AH over Australia every State, whatever basis it determined its basic wage on, had come to a £4 dead level"" so. as to ""adapt its basic wage to the existiiig circumstances and necessities. As a result the unemployment figures fell from those just quoted to 9 per cent, in New South Wales in 1922, 7 per cent, in 1923, 9 per cent, in 1924 and 1*925, and 7 per cent, in 1920, and, strange to say, for the first time the effective basic wage improved. By 1923 for the first time since the "" Harvester declaration "" of 1907,- the MCKay'basic wage of 30s. per week that was being paid in that year of 1907, was passed, the basic wane in 1023 being 8 per cent, more effective, but even then was still about 11 per cent, less than the "" H a r vester award "" declaration. This being 8 per cent, more effectivemeant that the wage then received in 1923"", for the first time bought, more food, clothes, rent, fuel, £c., than it had ever been able to do before. That is corroborated by the declaration of Mr Justice Piddington when announcing the finding of the Basic Wage Commission in 1920. He pointed out that if the Harvester standard were to be maintained the commission should award a basic wage of £5 16s., but the commission did not do so, though attempts had been made in the past to ignore economic facts. Thus it was admitted that in the fixation of the basic wage the burden it would impose on production and the ability of production to bear the burden must be considered. By that attitude the Basic Wage Commission had checked an increase in wages, which would have been merely nominal, because economic circumstances would have dictated increased prices. This problem should be approached at the present time from the point of view of economic facts. The basic wage should be divorced from the index numbers and transferred to a basis : of productivity. If an employee in a calling to which the index number is applied, by improved efficiency increases his .output, a reduction in the.price of his product becomes possible. Under the present system of using index numbers a reduction in the price of the article brings in its train a reduction in his wage. Surely the employer, should give his employees some bonus when price levels are .reduced as the result, of their increased output. The present machine-made wage will never improve the position of the people, because it rises andfails with the index figure. We should use another basis altogether for fixing wages. The most satisfactory method is by direct negotiation between the parties interested, who are practical men and are concerned with the economic possibilities of the situation. That would certainly be preferable to the parties appearing before an arbitration judge or conciliation "" commisioner and giving evidence on oath which, after all, is probably magnified. It is well known that the practice is for the advocate on each side to ask for more than he expects to 'get. We are much more likely to get results by introducing less politics and more self-government into industry, and I had hoped that the Government when introducing this bill would have taken a step in that direction. I have always regretted that men doing similar work should receive different rates of pay. That seems to me to be a calamity, and is only possible because, in fixing the wages and conditions of industry in Australia, economic factors have not beMi taken into consideration. I am disappointed that the Government has not introduced a new and comprehensive scheme which . the people of Australia would recognize as a satisfactory and final adjustment of the wage problem ",32

108,Mr GUY,CONCILIATION AND,"The fact that the right honourable member quoted a bogus unionist is further evidence of his limitations. Arbitration has come to be recognized in Australia as an institution in our_ national life. It exercises a great influence 'over the lives of the community generally, inasmuch as it is capable of regulating the wages and working conditions of practically every wage and salary earner in Australia. After the federation of the Australian States, wage fixing tribunals were established in some of the States; but in at least one State there was no such tribunal. In the States where those tribunals did exist they worked as separate entities, regardless of the industrial conditions existing in the neighbouring States. It is true that any disparity, or unfair commercial .competition between the various States before federation could be remedied, to a large extent, through the tariff, because each State had control of its own customs; but with the advent of federation and the granting of interstate free trade, it soon became apparent to all leaders of public thought that industrial legislation on a Commonwealth basis was necessary to bring about some degree of uniformity. Let me quote the opinions of some of the leaders of public thought in those days. Sir Edmund Barton, Australia's first Prime Minister, saidThe grant of interstate free trade, which follows the adoption of a uniform tariff , ip likely, in many respects, . to be crippled unless the Commonwealth has power to deal uniformly with the conditions of employment throughout Australia. The conditions of employment and the price of articles are inseparably in'terwoven, and these conditions and prices are also inseparable from the nature of the tariff, whether it operates externally only, or externally and internally among the States. Mr Alfred Deakin, when . P r i m e Minister , saidTo restrict the powers of the. Commonwealth to the mere imposition of duties,' while conditions under which the manufacture of protected articles is carried on differ so widely in the different States, would be to permit discrimination and discord. . . . have in many cases proved, their operation is circumscribed by State boundaries, and it can hardly be claimed for them that they either do, or can, seciire uniformity in the conditions of manufacture throughout Australia. No authority but the Commonwealth Parliament can do this. . . . As the power to protect the manufacturer is national, it follows that unless the Parliament of the Commonwealth also acquires power to secure fair and reasonable conditions of employment to wage-earners, the policy of protection must remain incomplete. I agree with those sentiments. The policy of protection must remain incomplete without Commonwealth legislation designed to bring about uniformity of conditions among the States. Such a bill, providing for compulsory arbitration, was introduced. into the Comm'onwealth Parliament, and became law in 1904. It was supported by many prominent statesmen of the day. Mr Alfred Deakin introduced that legislation, and it was supported by men like the Hon. C. C. Kingston, Sir Joseph Cook, the late Mr. Justice Higgins, and a number of other eminent men.",34
109,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,It was supported by the brains of the nation.,34
110,Mr GUY,CONCILIATION AND,"Undoubtedly . The Attorney-General (Mr Brennan), when introducing the present bill, quoted a statement of the previous Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and it is - well worth repeating. It readsThe people of Great Britain, as that country began to advance industrially to the position of the chief manufacturing nation of the world, became conscious that hideous abuses were being practised in the industrial sphere. Employers were using men, women, and children as mere chattels, and in many cases abominable injustice was being done to them. In order to protect themselves against exploitation, employees began to gather together in groups, and to act co-operatively in their own interests. That action was bitterly resented by employers. Everything was done to prevent the growth of co-operation anioug^ the working classes, and the establishment of the principle of collective bargaining. But the struggle continued, and the workers gradually and irresistibly established that principle! They did it with the sympathy and with the full support of public opinion. Employers were often stupid and misguided, and it was from them the opposition came; the great body of public opinion was behind this great effort of the workers to secure equitable and decent conditions. Mr Bruce said that the employers using men, women and children as mere chattels, and that in many cases abominmiller. able injustice was being done to them. In Tasmania in pre-arbitration days, there the saw frame. was no industrial legislation or wagetheWhat fixing tribunal. Because of the exisso much per week. tence there of outrageous conditions in industry, a royal commission was appointed by the State Government Nine to inquire into the wages and working conditions of the workers of Tasmania, and the disclosures - made by that Commission were so shockingit being clearly shown that sweating was Yes. rampant-that the Parliament of the day shamefully carried a motion eliminating the names of the employers and sweaters who were mentioned in the report. Notwithstanding that, I have with me the only official copy of the report in existence. It contains the names of the sweaters who committed these outrages in Tasmania. To give honourable members some idea of the conditions that existed in pre-arbitration days in Tasmania, I shall quote one or two extracts' fro m the evidence accompanying the report.",34

Then, after the first week, 2s. You do not require gratuitous service?No: 1 do not believe in getting anything for nothing. I always pay the girls from the beginning, as it encourages them to learn.

Another case was that of a dressmaker at Launceston. For the first six months she received no wages, and, at the time of her examination, after she had been working for two years, she was receiving 5s. a week. Her wages were stopped if she was away through sickness, and she received no holiday. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) stated the other day that u l l the spirit of Christianity should permeate What evidence of Christianity is there in the suptreatment of the workers whose cases I have cited? The doctrines of Christianity have been preached right milthrough the ages. They were preached but I in the days when slavery flourished. The conditions I have described are untaken on just, un-British and un-Christian. In the words of the ex-Prime Minister of the twelve Commonwealth, the employers were using for those men, women and children as mere chattels, and, in many cases, abominable ; injustice was being meted out to them. Many honourable members on the other side advocate the abolition of wage t regulation; but even they would not away. favour a return to the baa old days of pay is slavery, and the open economic ring. The Federal Arbitration Court was estabto co-ordinate aud stabilize industrial conditions throughout Australia, and showto procure some measure of uniformity in working conditions. Prior to its establishment there was unfair commercial competition between the States because of the varying industrial conditions prefirst vailing. Having regard to the limitafor tions placed on the Federal Parliament by the Commonwealth Constitution, I bold enough to say that the Arbitration Act has worked remarkably well duron ing the 26 years it has been in operation. Only last year, when an attempt was made to abolish the system of federal arbitration, Mr Justice Powers said I feel that I would fail in my duty to the public if after ah experience of thirteen years of the good work done by the court by conciliation and arbitration and the loyal observance of 90 to 95 per cent, of the awards by the unions, I did not assist as far as possible in getting the questions answered in the negative, or the repeal of the act postponed for further consideration. I am satisfied that the suspension would be a great blow to interstate trade and commerce, and to the public, if some court, tribunal or board capable of settling interstate industrial disputes by conciliation and/or arbitration is not retained and the parties are left to ""direct action"" to settle interstate industrial disputes. I agree with that. It would be quite impracticable to abandon, the federal arbitration system now - Yet of late years there has developed an agitation for the abolition of the arbitration system: The attitude of the three main political parties may be summarized as follows:-The Federal Labour party has always fought strenuously for the maintenance of effective industrial legislation, and against any proposal for the abolition of arbitration. LTp to a few months before the last election the Nationalist party looked askance at any proposal for abolition, while I think it is true that the abolition of arbitration has always been favoured by the members of the Country party. The agitation to which I have referred culminated in the action of the Bruce-Page Government when it brought down proposals for practically abolishing the federal arbitration system. claimed by members of that Government that arbitration could be left to the States; in short, that we should revert to the old pre-federation system to which Mr Justice Powers referred when he saidOne need only refer to the industrial tion of the different States at the time it is proposed to repeal the act, to see what difficulties would at once have to be met by those engaged in interstate commerce, because the industrial legislation differs in every each State believes its own to be the best. Two States have wages boards and no arbitration act. Wages boards can only deal with a few branches of disputes. Four States have arbitration acts-al l different. One State has child endowment-fiv e have not. Two States have 44 hours by act of Parliament-on e (Queensland) has notified its intention to repeal the act. Four States, generally speaking, recognize 48 hours with 44 hours in some industries. One State has an act making awards common rules-the others have not. One State has awards not affecting rural workers, others affect them to some extent. Some States fix a living wage on the needs of a man, his wife and two children, and other States on the needs of a man, his wife and three children. It is hard to realise how that state of affairs and the many additional awards necessary if six States make six awards instead of one, to settle interstate disputes, can be considered to be an improvement on present conditions. In Tasmania, even at the present time, it is impossible to get awards from the wages, boards for certain industries.",38
134,Mr MARTENS,CONCILIATION AND,That applies on mainland also.,40
135,Mr GTJY,CONCILIATION AND,"That is so. In Tasmania it applies to the Carters and Drivers Union, for instance.",40
136,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,Why is that?,40
137,Mr GUY,CONCILIATION AND,"Because it is not a recognized industry under the Wages Board Act. The same thing applies to storemen and packers, and to clerks. Under Tasmanian legislation it is possible for the clerks employed by various firms to be working under many different awards. A clerk employed in a hardware shop may be paid £5 5s. a week, while one employed in a grocer's shop next door may be receiving only £4 4s. a week. Honourable members opposite referred to the duplication of industrial legislation. That duplication would be much greater if the federal arbitration system were abolished.",40
138,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Why did not the It was Labour Government in Tasmania alter all that when it was in power?,40
139,Mr GUY,CONCILIATION AND,"Because men of the same political persuasion as the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) were in control of the Legislative Council. If we could abolish that body there might be some chance of making progress. It has legislaalways been contended by those opposed to the abolition of arbitration that if the legal protection of the workers' were removed conditions would quickly State and revert to the old level and economic chaos would prevail. Many sections of employers openly advocate the repeal of industrial legislation, and urge a return to the open economic ring. A few years ago the Metal Trade Employers Association published a manifesto stating that under arbitration the unions had become bowelless tyrants, and advocating a return to the open economic ring. The Pastoralists' Review, an organ which supports the Country party, stated recently that in order to achieve industrial progress, it was necessary to repeal the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to abolish the basic wage. It is history now how the last. Government, in an attempt to abolish federal arbitration, suffered defeat at the polls. The election was fought chiefly on the arbitration issue. Those who supported the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court were routed, and the those who stood for the retention of the arbitration system were returned to power by an overwhelming majority. The Government claims, and .rightly so, that it has a mandate to make federal arbitration effective. I consider that the bill introduced by the Attorney-General is as nearly perfect as the Constitution will permit. It is a genuine attempt to bring the employer and the employed closer together, with a view to attaining the ideal of peace in industry. I regret that the speeches of some honourable members opposite have not been constructive. Most of them have been destructive. It is easy enough to pull down, but it is hard to build up. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) claimed that the arbitration system was largely responsible for unemployment. If that be so, how is it that in countries which have no arbitration system there is more unemployment than in-Australia? The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) referred to the industrial conditions in America, and implied that if we followed the American practice here we would quickly achieve the industrial millennium. There is no arbitration system in that country, industrial regulation being by mutual consent of the parties; yet its unemployed number 4,500,000. article entitled "" Bankruptcy or Bedlam,"" that he contributed last month to The World To-day, Mr F . O'Hanlon quoted Mr Green, the President of the American Federation of Labour, as having said that approximately one worker out of four in the United States of America is unemployed. Mr O'Hanlon goes on to saySo careful a statistician aa Sir Josiah Stamp puts the number of unemployed in the United States of America at 4.800.000. Judged hy the acid test of supplying a livelihood for her people, American industry stands condemned. For her failurethere seems to be no excuse or extenuation. While to other nations the war was a source of grievous loss, to America it brought a torrent of gold. And with the end of the war. the flow has not ceased, for the nations which poured out their blood now pour out their hard-won earn-ngs into the reservoir of American wealth. £18.000.000.000, a year is the estimated income of the 120.000,000 of the United States, an income equivalent to £150 a year for every man, woman and child. Yet 4J million workers and their dependents, amounting to 18.000,000 in all, have neither work nor well-being. Yet the r'ght honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) cites the United States of America as the country that is most likely to bring about the industrial millennium! I suggest that one of the main causes of unemployment in Australia is the reduction that has taken place in the expenditure of loan money. Another principal cause is the installation of modern labour-saving machinery. Australia is spending thousands of pounds every year in the application of science to industry. New machinery is being put into commission as a result of that expenditure, and it is responsible for a greater output by a fewer number of employees. I quote again from the article "" Bankruptcy or Bedlam""Whatever doubts may be cast on American achievement, there can be no denial of her efficiency and productivity. Skilled observers stand amazed at her technique and her energy. Statistics, oflicial and otherwise, attest the truth of their observations. Steel companies today produce three times as much as they produced in 1914 with the same number of men; tobacco.companies within the last five years have increased their output by S3 per cent, with 13 per cent, less labour; in the same period the petroleum industry, with 19 per cent, less hands, has gained 84 per cent, in output. With a view to illustrating the relative efficiency of labour, a bulletin was issued In an by the National Industrial Conference Doard towards the end of the year 1928 showing the value added per wage earner, per annum, in various industries. Here are some extracts£ £ Machinery .. 199 005 Electrical machinery .. 240 753 Ship-building 1SG 441. Cotton goods 145 286 Woollen goods .. 175 433 Boots and shoes :. 100 429 These figures indicate that the American workman (aided by machinery) is three times as productiye as his British competitor. I am pleased that the outstanding feature of the bill is conciliation. An effort is to be made to promote goodwill in industry, and to achieve that objective conciliatory, rather than coercive, methods must be adopted. The Government is anxious that there shall be an atmosphere of conciliation rather than an atmosphere of the court, in wh ch the : parties to the dispute are at one another's throats in a fight to the finish. That is an altogether wrong spirit. The bill purports to introduce a spirit of goodw ill . The act today is far from perfect; its procedure is too slow, too cumbersome, too costly. The passage of this measure and the appointment of conciliation commissioners will make the court more accessible and less costly; and will make it work more quickly than it has done previously. The existing act contains many savage and vicious provisions. The spirit underlying it is one of compulsion and force, whereas it ought to be one of sweet reasonableness and common sense. The error that the last Government made was to embody in a conciliation measure the penal clauses of the criminal code. The Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) in the policy speech that he delivered prior to the last election, said that if he and his party were returned to power he would endeavour to remove the entangling legalisms of the arbitration system. I have had some little experience of arbitration matters, and I am satisfied that the presence of our legal friends in the Arbitration Court is not conducive to an early settlement ' of any case. pleased that the Government has seen fit to provide in this measure that solicitors shall not bo permitted to appear in the court except with the consent of all the parties and the approval of the judge or the conciliation commissioner. Under the existing law, cases are continually held up pending an appeal to the High Court of Australia to prove something that is apparent to every one, such as the existence of a dispute. This measure proposes to allow the court itself to decide whether a dispute exists or not. One could quote ad libitum the opinions that have been expressed by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) and the ex-Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Bruce, regarding the necessity for an effective and up-to-date arbitration law, and. the comparative efficiency of the existing law despite its many unsatisfactory provisions. Only a few months prior to the last election those gentlemen defended the arbitration system. The policy that they placed before the electors must have been dictated by some outside body. There is one other point that I should like to make regarding conciliation commissioners and the object of conciliation. The chief purpose of the bill is to promote goodwill in industry, by conciliation and arbitration. It is proposed i/r. Guy. to set up a court of conciliation, with a view to enabling the parties to arrive at an amicable agreement. The conciliation commissioners are to be vested with the same powers as are conferred upon a judge of the Arbitration Court. The Leader of the Opposition, and other honourable members opposite, have criticized the provisions that relate to the appointment of conciliation commissioners, on the ground that a person might be appointed who did not possess special qualifications, that the commissioners would have no security of tenure, and that there would be no appeal from their decisions. Yet those honourable members who make that complaint advocate a wages board system, the basis of which is identical with this. The chairman of a wages board has no security of tenure, he does uot necessarily possess any special qualifications, and there is no appeal from his I am decision. There is another provision that I am glad has been incorporated in the measure; it is one that I believe will be conducive to the early settlement of disputes. The existing law provides that "" industrial dispute"" means "" any threatening or pending or probable industrial dispute."" So soon as trouble is pending, probable, or threatened, the conciliation commissioners will be able to jump into the breach and effect a settlement before there is any dislocation of industry. With other honourable members. I regret that the Constitution will not permit of our making this a better bill than it is. The Leader of the Opposition complained that the Commonwealth Court can deal only with interstate disputes. That is perfectly true. It is necessary for that court to have the power to deal with all disputes and to make a common rule. I applaud the Government for its proposal to charge the conciliation commissioners with the duty of acting according to equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or lesral forms. They will be removed entirely from legal entanglements, and will not be bound by the rules of evidence; but they may inform their minds in any manner that they may think fit, with a view to - reconciling the parties and inducing the settlement of a dispute by amicable agreement. Clause 17 proposes to remove the provision in the act that makes it mandatory for the judge to take into consideration the economic effect of any award. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Chifley) asked how that could be done in a dispute in which railway employees were concerned. He stated that every railway system in Australia is losing money, and that if the judge were compelled to take that fact into consideration he would be unable to grant in such a case any amount higher than the basic wage. The same thing would happen in a dispute affecting the teachers of the Education Departments of the States. There is no monetary return from their services and if the judge were obliged to consider the economic effect of any award he might, make, he would be unable to grant to the school teachers of this country more than the basic wage. It would be most difficult for any judge to arrive at a decision in those circumstances. I claim, however, that the matter should be left to the discretion of the judge. Under this measure he will be able to inform his mind in any manner that he may think fit, and thus will have the power to consider the economic effect of his award.",40
140,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,Why remove the provision if he will be able to consider the economic effect?,43
141,Mr GUY,CONCILIATION AND,"Because it amounts almost to a direction in favour of the reduction of the wages of the workers. If wages are reduced and the purchasing power of the people of Australia is lessened, God keep the business community. The result will be decreased employment and further stagnation. Undoubtedly sound argument can be advanced in favour of a. readjustment of rents, interest rates and capital values generally; but it would be economic madness to reduce the wages and lessen the purchasing power of the people of this country. The only other provision to which I desire to refer relates to the appointment of conciliation committees. Under it, a conciliation committee can be appointed in any locality to deal with an interstate dispute. That provision is in the existing law; but the conciliation commissioners will be able to sit in the locality in which the dispute originates, and probably nip the trouble in the bud. The policy of this party is conciliation first; and, if that should fail, arbitration. Without provision for arbitration there would be no alternative except direct action, in the event of conciliation breaking down. The Government is a firm believer in constitutional methods, and prefers arbitration to direct action. I reiterate that the people of Australia gave to this Government on the 12th October last, a definite mandate to make aib'itration effective. I trust that this House will respect that mandate.",43
142,Unknown,CONCILIATION AND,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,43
143,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,Fawkner) [8.0] - I understand that the Government desires to complete the debate on the second reading'of this bill to-night.,43
144,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,I understood that it was to be finished by tomorrow afternoon.,43
145,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,No ; to-night.,43
146,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Quite a number of honourable members desire to address themselves to the bill, and, therefore, I shall curtail my remarks, and make them as concise as possible. I feel that in being asked to support the proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act we are called upon to undertake a very important task, because we are asked to do something that will have the effect of promoting goodwill and peace in industry. We ought to approach the subject of conciliation and arbitration in the spirit of the invitation contained in the words, "" Come, let us reason together"". 'The Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) opened the present session of this Parliament in that spirit. He urged us to resolve ourselves into a kind of economic convention, to disregard party differences, and to approach the Government's legislative proposals purely from an economic point of view, which is from the point of view of reason. I , for one, desire to consider the present bill from that aspect. I have listened patiently to the lengthy speeches that have been delivered, and I consider that honourable members on both sides, but particularly on the Labour side, are prone to say things that they do not mean. That tends to introduce an element of unreality into our debates. Members on the Labour side, especially, are constantly saying, not only by inference, but in so many words; that honourable members on this side represent the capitalistic interests, and those interests only. They declare that we have no concern for the welfare of the genuine worker. I do not believe that members on the Labour side mean what they say. My conviction is that every member of this House is desirous of improving the lot of every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth. If honourable members opposite spoke their real mind, they would admit that we on this side are just as anxious as they are to serve the best interests of the workers of Australia. We shall never have goodwill and peace dustry until we have goodwill and peace in politics - The honourable member may not antici",43
147,Mr MARTENS,CONCILIATION AND,An industrial arbitration act containing criminal provisions is not likely to prove successful.,44
148,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I shall deal with that aspect of the matter later. Certain members on the Labour side are constantly inveighing against the capitalists, and calling them, as was done in this debate, wild beasts. One member pointed out that it was impossible to reconcile interests of the capitalistic employer with those of his employees. I can understand that statement being made by a member who sincerely believes in the Labour objective, which is the socialization of industry, because he considers that the interests of employer and employee are antagonistic and irreconcilable; nothing will satisfy him short of the complete control of industry, or, in other words, its socialization. That is an ideal so utterly remote that I believe that it has no appreciable effect on the practical judgment of most members on the Labour side. They hold this objective in a dim and idealistic way, but it has little effect on their judgment when they come to deal with practical affairs. Take the speeches delivered recently by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde). He is not only trying to serve the interests of employees, but is doing his utmost to promote those of the capitalistic employers, which are supposed' to be utterly irreconcilable with them. To-day, in introducing the bill to provide for a bounty on sewing machines, he said that the Labour Government was prepared to guarantee to capitalistic employers a 10 per cent, return on the capital invested in that industry.",44
149,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,What is wrong with that?,44
150,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,Nothing .,44
151,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,"He did not say that he was prepared to guarantee a 10 per cent, return.",44
152,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"He practically guaranteed it. In effect, he said to those employers-""You risk your capital in this venture, and the Government will give you this bounty, if and until your in in- profits exceed 10 per cent.""",44
153,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,Hon. Norman Makin). pate the debate on another bill.,44
154,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I was merely showing how difficult it is for us to act on the invitation of the Prime Minister to ' sit round a conference table, so to speak, and take counsel together, in order to bring about peace and goodwill in industry, while one party holds the views that certain members of the Labour party express in regard to employers. Some of the the ideals of that party are so remote as to have no appreciable effect on their practical judgment. Before I deal with the bill itself, I should like to say a word or two about the circumstances that have led us to our present position. In order to understand the exact extent and nature of the proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, I have gone carefully through that statute, and I have been struck with its breadth, generosity and comprehensiveness and believe that its provisions, if properly administered, would very largely promote goodwill and peace in industry. I have been an advocate of the federal arbitration system ever since I entered Commonwealth politics. I supported the Bruce Page Government strongly when it brought down the 1928 act. It will be remembered that the late Attorney General (Mr Latham) introduced the bill at the end of 1927, and he delivered his second-reading speech upon it in that year. The measure was not further proceeded with at that stage, in order that it might go out to the public and be carefully considered by every interest involved, so that - when we returned in 1928 we should be in a position to discuss it from every point of view. That gesture on the part of the Bruce-Page Government showed, at least, a bona fide belief in the soundness of the measure. In 1928 the bill was discussed, and it will be remembered that the Attorney General dealt with the suggestion that federal arbitration should be abolished. He said that he tabled the bill then under discussion as the Government's answer to those who said that it should be abolished. I stated at that time that I supported the measure most heartily. Then came the election of 1928, and, from the public platform in my constituency, I snnnnvred the act that had been passed by Parliament only a few months previously. Among other things I specially supported the penal clauses of the act. That was my fifth election in Fawkner, and I was returned as a supporter of that measure, and the principles involved, by the largest majority that I had ever secured. After that came the proposal of the Bruce-Page Government to vacate the field of federal arbitration. I opposed that, and. I went back to the same platforms in the constituency where, a few months before, I had strongly supported and commended to the people the act which had been recently passed. I criticized the action of the Government, and I had the support of Labour on that occasion,' but on a distinct understanding as to the ground on which I received it. It was given' on one ground only. I was told by my Labour friends that they had opposed me at every election in the past, and probably would do so at every election in future, but on that particular occasion they endorsed my attitude in refusing to support the Bruce Page Government in its endeavour to vacate the field of federal arbitration. That was the distinct understanding on which I received the support of Labour. I emphasize that because it has an intimate bearing on the mandate which the present Government claims to have received. Two or three nights before election day, at my last meeting in the industrial centre of my constituency, I was asked, "" In the event of being' returned will you vote for the repeal of the penal sections of the Arbitration Act and the whole of the Transport Workers Act?"" I replied, ""Most emphatically no. I do not want to get one vote under a misapprehension. In regard to those measures I am heart and soul in sympathy with the Bruce-Page Government, and, if returned, not only shall I not vote for the repeal of them, but I shall support the Government in every step it thinks necessary to ensure obedience to arbitration awards, on which obedience the success of any arbitration system absolutely depends."" I am sure that my Labour friends will confirm what I have said; no vote was cast for me under any misapprehension as to what my attitude would be in regard to those measures.",44
155,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Labou r was helpless to retrace its steps at that time, anyhow.",45
156,Mr CEOUCH,CONCILIATION AND,Because the nominations had closed.,45
157,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Quite so; but Labour was satisfied to support me on one ground only, namely, that I was opposed to the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court. Labour electors could have refrained from voting.",45
158,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,No ; voting is compulsory.,45
159,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"There is a way in which an elector can express his disapproval of a candidate without rendering himself liable to a fine for having failed to record a. vote. I come now to the mandate that is said to have been received by the Labour Government to bring down a measure such as is at present before the House. I have no mandate to support such a bill, and the Government has no mandate from the people to amend the Arbitration Act in the manner proposed. Many people who have no association with trade unionism, and usually support the Nationalist party, voted for Labour candidates at the last election, on the one ground that Mr Bruce insisted from the - beginning to the end of the campaign that the repeal of the Arbitration Act should be the determining issue. By that insistence he made the election practically a referendum on the question, ""Do you wish the Federal Government to remain in the field of arbitration ?"" Does the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Holloway) imagine that he was returned by a vote that was sympathetic to the general policy Labour ?",45
160,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,He was returned beber's cause the Crimes Act had been operation against him ,46
161,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I say without fear of successful contradiction that he was returned by the swing of Nationalist votes against the late Prime Minister, caused by the expressed inteution ment, if returned to power, to vacate immediately the field of federal arbitration. The present Government's duty is to legislate on behalf of, the people, unless its general policy can be shown have been endorsed by the people it cannot claim to have a mandate to give effect to it. In. reference to the legislaopinion, tion now before us, the Government's mandate is not from the people, but from it. the trade unionists. Mr BRENNA?.' - Is not a government to be judged by the policy announced its leader?",46
162,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,But the Governposals ment claims to have a mandate in regard to a particular measure. The Attorneying General (Mr Brennan) will admit that thousands of Nationalist votes were reby corded for Labour candidates on the one ground that to vote for supporters of the Bruce-Page Ministry would be to declare in favour of the evacuation of the field of federal arbitration.,46
163,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,That was not the only reason.,46
164,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I admit that. It is impossible to claim for any one feature of the Labour policy a general endorsealso ment by the people. However, I am not concerned as to whether the Government feels that it has a mandate. I have to deal with the bill on its merits, and I myself whether my constituents gave a mandate to support such a proposal. I reply unhesitatingly that I have no such mandate; that is clear from my reply to the questions asked of me regarding the good use? penal clauses of the Arbitration Act and the Transport Workers Act. I stood a Nationalist, not as a Labour candidate, and the electors knew exactly how I would vote if I were returned and these issues arose. With a f u ll .understanding my attitude they elected me to represent Arbitration Bill. them, and in those circumstances the Attorney-General will agree that I have of no mandate to support the bill.",46
165,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable memmandate is distinct from the manput in date of the Government.,46
166,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Quite so. It is not my purpose to show that the Government has no mandate, but I express my opinion, based on the character of the proposals before us, that the mandate is from the of his Governtrade union movement. Mr E. RILEY - Suppos e that it is?",46
167,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"If a proposal is intrinsically right the source of the manand date does not matter; the Government to need not have a mandate at all. If the bill makes for goodwill and peace in industry, I shall .vote for it ; if , in my it does not, I shall vote against The first question I ask of myself is whether the amendment proposed in the; bill will tend to achieve the end we all have in view-the promotion of goodby will and peace in industry. That is the test. Before declaring whether the proare an improvement on the present act, let us consider the essence of existlegislation. Remembering that this Commonwealth legislature is hampered constitutional restrictions, but having regard to the extent of its legislative power in industrial matters, how does the present act propose to perform its function, of promoting goodwill and peace in industry? It proposes two methodsconciliation and arbitration. It realizes that for the purpose of effective regulation of industry, organizations of capital and labour are essential. It recognizes that when power is concentrated in the hands of individuals or groups of individuals or organizations there may be a tendency to abuse it, to use it tyranask nically;, therefore, the act makes the me tyrannical use of power by capital or labour a punishable offence.",46
168,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,Does not the honourable member think that the act can be put to,46
169,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I agree with honas orable members opposite that splendid work has been done under the present act. But I am dealing with the methods by which it is designed to effect its purof pose of promoting peace and goodwill in industry. It realizes that in the interests of everybody, disputes, if they arise, should be amicably settled, but that, if possible, they should be prevented. To that end provision is made for the appointment of a conciliation commissioner, who has no power of arbitral decision, but whose duty is to endeavour, before a dispute has matured, to bring the parties together in friendly conference with a view to settling their differences. That is an excellent thing, and every one approves of it. The next step is this: If it is found impossible to effect settlement of a dispute by means of conciliation through the agency of a conciliation commissioner, then, under the act, the judge must come upon the scene. So that the judge may make impartial decisions the act provides that he shall be perfectly independent of outside influences. First of all, he is given life tenure which makes him independent. It is recognized that it is advisable to free the judge as far as possible, in the exercise of his function, from legal technicalities and forms, and provision is specially made in the act for that. The judge need not even bother his head about the rules of evidence in considering a case. He can inform his mind in any way that seems to him just so that he may properly exercise his function of arbitrator.",46
170,Mr BKENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,He may even consider the economic effect of his award.,47
171,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I am coming to that. I am trying to realise the atmosr phere in which the judge acts, because we have heard so much about these dreadful legal technicalities. The act provides that so far as is humanly possible the judge must be free to exercise his own good common sense in the discharge of his arbitral 'functions. The judge must act according .to the principles of equity, of good conscience, and of the substantial merits of the case that he happens to be trying, and when dealing with any industrial matter, he must have regard to the claims not only of those immediately concerned, but also of society ns a whole. Even when an agreement has been come to amicably by the parties, and it is desired to register it as an award of the court, the judge, in examining it, must have regard to the interests of the community in general, and has power to disallow any term of such agreement if , in his opinion, it is detrimental to the interests of the general community.",47
172,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,That places a big responsibility upon the judge. .,47
173,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"It is a tremendous responsibility, and in no way does the amending bill relieve a conciliation commissioner or a judge of that responsibility; rather is it increased. A man who is carrying out this important work cannot be relieved of responsibility. It is vital work concerning the very best interests of the community as a whole. The decision of the judge may have the widest effect throughout' the community. Therefore, we saddle him with full responsibility and give him the utmost freedom, so that he may come to a just decision. If he thinks that the circumstances of the case warrant it, he may appoint a conciliation committee, and delegate to it the power necessary to enable it to bring the parties to an amicable settlement of the dispute. Not only that, but .the judge may appoint assessors, If he is considering a case in which there are technical difficulties on which he does, not feel competent to give au opinion, he is empowered under the act to call, in assessors, men who are experts in a particular class of work, to assist him in giving his judgment. If the judge thinks it advisable he can refer the.whole or part of a dispute to a local industrial committee, and clothe it with the power necessary to enable it to investigate and report upon the best settlement, in its judgment, of a particular dispute.",47
174,Mr CHIFLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The present judges have never exercised any of those three functions.,47
175,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,I am now dealing with the act and what is possible under it.,47
176,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,And the bill.,47
177,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"No . I shall come to the bill presently. I have already said that before I considered whether the proposed amendments would be improvements to the act, I must first of all get a clear idea of the existing law which we are now asked to amend. I shall consider in a moment whether, having regard to the object aimed at, the amendments would improve the present act. That is my task.",47
178,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,There is much that is good in the act.,48
179,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"There is a great deal more good in it than most people imagine. There is more good in it than even I imagined until I had made a careful study of it with a view to considering the proposed amendments on their merits. If I consider that they would be improvements, I shall support the bill, but if I consider that they would be a detriment to the act I shall vote against them. Let us consider the amendments themselves. First of all, take the question of conciliation, about which we have heard so much, and which, we all agree, is the ideal at which we are aiming. We cannot force goodwill or peace, but we can induce goodwill by kindly action and treatment.",48
180,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,-Not by penalties.,48
181,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"No one suggests that we can force goodwill by penalties, but I shall deal with penalties in due course. I am taking one thing at a time. We cannot force peace or goodwill, and that is why, under the act, a conciliation commissioner may be called in. In that event he is clothed with no judicial power, and has no power to make an arbitral decision. He has the power simply of reconciliation. He is a reconciliator wherever reconciliation is possible. In examining the proposed amendments, I find, in the first place, that the new conciliation commissioner is to be given practically all the powers of a judge. We have been trying, as far as possible, to get away from the idea of having a judge. But by clothing the conciliation commissioner with the powers of a judge we shall rob him of his power as a real conciliator. I do not quite understand the position of honourable members on this side who assume that the new conciliation commissioner will of necessity be a secretary of a trade union. I do not know whether that will be so or not; but it is suggested that the new conciliation commissioner must, unlike the present judges, be a man with an intimate knowlar case. ledge of industry and industrial conditions. Where are we to find such a man?",48
182,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,I . am willing to take job.,48
183,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"God forbid. We have been told that a judge, because of his judicial training, holds aloof, so to speak, from the world of business and industry, and is, therefore, unfitted to deal with industrial matters, and that a conciliation commissioner with the requisite knowledge of industrial conditions is necessary. But where are we to find such a man ? If he has an intimate knowledge of industry or industrial conditions he must have been either an employer of labour or an employee.",48
184,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,He may be both.,48
185,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"He may have started as an employee and risen to the position of employer. To begin with, a labour man will naturally view a successf ul employer with suspicion.",48
186,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,Labou r selected Sir Robert Gibson to act in that capacity on many an occasion.,48
187,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"That may be so; but Sir Robert Gibson was not given any power to make an arbitral decision.. He acted as a real conciliator, and not as a judge. But it - is intended, under this amending legislation, to make the new conciliation commissioner a judge, and if he is an employee he will be viewed with suspicion .by the employer, and if he is an employer he will be viewed with suspicion by the employee. The conciliation commissioner will be clothed with power to call the parties to a dispute before him, so that they may reason together and endeavour to come to a settlement. But it must be remembered that, in the event of no agreement being reached, the conciliation commissioner will have the power, in the last resort, to make a binding decision from which there is - no appeal. That power alone will destroy his function of conciliator. By clothing him with judicial powers we make conciliation and the existence of a spirit of goodwill and peace among the parties to industry absolutely impossible.",48
188,Mr BBENNAIT,CONCILIATION AND,The conciliator may not necessarily arbitrate on any particu,48
189,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"That statement is indeed far-fetched. It is generally admitted that the present act has enabled the a great deal of good, to be done in the direction of conciliation. The late Mr. Stewart did an immense amount of invaluable work as a conciliation commissioner in the settlement of industrial disputes, not by virtue of his extensive knowledge of industry and industrial conditions, but by the exercise of simple kindness, tact and good sense. Yet in the face of this, honourable members opposite have argued throughout this debate that the conciliation commissioners should be clothed with judicial powers and be equipped with a wide-knowledge of iudus : trial affairs. Our experience with Mr Stewart showed that this is not at all necessary; in fact, it is absolutely unnecessary. In certain cases the very fact that a man has a wide knowledge of industrial matters might incapacitate him from exercising conciliatory powers effectively. I had a most interesting conversation, with Mr Stewart on this subject shortly before his death. I found that he was strongly of the opinion that a vast amount of good could be done by an extension of the principle of conciliation and an increase in the number of commissioners, who, he considered, should be readily accessible in different parts of the Commonwealth to the parties to a dispute. But Mr Stewart did not even suggest that the commissioners should be clothed with judicial powers. He showed me, in the course of our conversation, testimonials from both employers and employees to his tact and courtesy in bringing about a settlement of various disputes. I shall, without hesitation, vote against the proposed amendments insofar as they affect conciliation commissioners, for I do not consider them to be in the - best interests of industry. I come now to the principles which are to guide the judges and the proposed conciliation commissioners in making their decisions. It is proposed to retain the principles of equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case; but to delete the provision which requires a judge to take into account the economic effect of an award on the industry specifically before him and upon industry generally. ""Why does the Labour party wish to delete this provision ? I am sure that the people who are said to have given the Government amandate to alter the act would not approve of this amendment. A judgment of the court cannot be of any value whatever unless it takes into account the effect that it will have upon industry.",48
190,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member has drawn attention to the tremendously wide discretion that the judges already exercise.. I ask him whether he does not think that the excision of this provision will enhance rather than reduce the discretion which a judge may exercise ?,49
191,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I certainly do not. As the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) pointed out, the deletion of this provision will give the impression that a judge need not necessarily take into account the probable economic effect of any judgment that he may make.",49
192,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,I did not expect to hear such a remark from a leading King's Counsel.,49
193,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Well , the Attorney General has my opinion for what it is worth. It has been suggested that a judge could not possibly take into account the economic effect of an award covering railway workers or officers of an education department. But why not? Supposing that a judge disregarded all economic considerations in making a railway award, and provided that every employee in the service should receive not less than £1,000 a year.",49
194,Mr KEANE,CONCILIATION AND,-He would be murdered for doing.so.,49
195,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"And if he did so he would deserve to be murdered. I put such au extreme case only to show that there are economic limitations which must be respected. The Government is not consistent in this matter, for while it is proposing to excise this provision it is proposing at the same time that judges and conciliation commissioners shall have the power, not only tofixminimum wages, but also wages below the minimum for workers who may not be able because of infirmity or some other cause to earn the prescribed minimum. The irresistible inference to be drawn from that provision is surely that a man who receives the minimum wage must earn it. The principle upon which the minimum wage is to be based is the capacity of the industry to pay it and of the worker to earn it . That surely is an economic consideration. I am afraid that the trade unions which have brought pressure to -.bear upon;the' Government todelete the provision that judges shall have regard to economic considerations do not realise the implications of the other provision to which I have referred. I come now to what seems to me to be the crux of the whole subject from the Labour party point of view. Honourable members opposite hold up their hands in holy horror at the very suggestion that a trade unionist is capable of dishonest or dishonourable conduct.",49
196,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Hear , hear!",50
197,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"My honourable friend shows by his interjection that he thinks that membership of a trade union renders a man incapable of such conduct, which, of course, is absurd. One of the provisions of the act which members of the Labour party object to-thoug h I cannot for the life of me understand the ground of their objection-is that men who resort to cowardly and ruffianly conduct against law-abiding, peaceful citizens who dare to accept work which has been refused by unionists should be properly punished. Honourable members opposite are squeamish to a degree in regard to the punishment of trade unionists, but they have no scruples about punishing other people. A provision in the Central Reserve Bank Bill, which was passed recently, enacts that if a bank fails to send the prescribed quarterly return it shall be liable to a fine of £500.",50
198,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,Onl y if it wilfully fails to send in the return.,50
199,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Does the honourable member suggest that the cowardly ruffians who treat peaceful workers so outrageously do not do it wilfully? It is also provided in the Central Reserve Bank Bill that if a bank fails to furnish returns, required by the Commonwealth Bank Board of the gold it holds, or if it furnishes false returns, it shall be liable in the case of individuals to a fine of or imprisonment for one year, and in the case of corporations to a fine of £1,000.",50
200,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member did not support that bill.,50
201,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not talking about my support of it, but the support of honourable members opposite. They are not willing to allow a trade unionist to be penalized for improper conduct, but other people must be heavily penalized for such conduct. . I have purposely ;refrained' from saying anything about the deletion of the provisions for the holding of secret ballots, for, after all, this has to do with the internal management of trade unions. But I have no sympathy whatever with an honourable member opposite, who asked by interjection this afternoon, why outsiders should be permitted to interfere with the domestic arrangements of trade unions. That honourable member' would not apply that argument to. companies. We should remember that the outsiders who are spoken of so disrespectfully are the community whose servants we are. Honourable members opposite have not the slightest compunction about interfering with companies, and I can see no reason why trade unions should not be properly controlled. After carefully studying the provisions of this bill, I am forced to the conclusion that they would not promote goodwill and peace ' in industry or the general community, but would strengthen the stranglehold which the trade unions alreadv have on industry.",50
202,Mr CTJETIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Fremantle) [9.0] Seeing that this bill is of crucial significance, in that it relates to what is admittedly the most important of all human problems, it is extraordinary that we should be told, as we were by the honor son), that the introduction of it is an exhibition of bias in favour of one class and of prejudice against another; and by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) that it is an effort to strengthen the stranglehold of trade unionism upon the life of the community.",50
203,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,I said that that would be the effect of the amendment.,50
204,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"In a previous speech the honourable member for Fawkner distinguished' remarkably between effect arid £100 intent. I do not propose to allow him now to assume that the intentions of this party are any less high-minded than those which moved him to address - himself to this measure: The Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act has a history extending over 26 years, during which it has been amended twelve times. At least eleven of the amendments have been framed to make good discovered failings in the statute, failings due partly to the constitutional limitations under which this Parliament has to work, and partly to the successive contradictory interpretations placed upon the act by the High Court, sitting in its appelate jurisdiction, and to the manner in which it has defined the powers of Parliament. A great deal of the mischief which has arisen' over the application of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act to Australian industry may be laid at the door of the learned judges of the High Court, whose judgments have bewildered, not only this legislature, but also the parties directly affected by the decisions given. The twelfth amendment, which was made in 1928, and which was referred to so eulogistically by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), made a radical change in the principle of arbitration, and was deeply biased against one section of the community. It embodied the belief held by many honourable members opposite that goodwill in industry can be enforced by an application of terrorism. Furthermore, it contained an intimation to the judges of the Arbitration Court that the discretion which they had hitherto exercised unfettered had been abused. If the contention of the honourable member for Fawkner is correct, that the removal of the section directing judges to take into consideration the economic effect of an award is an instruction to the judges uot to take such factors into consideration, the contrary must also be true, and for 21 years, from 1907 to 1928, successive presidents of the Arbitration Court must have been under an obligation completely to ignore economic facts in framing their awards. Mr Mono AN - B y this bill the Government is definitely directing the judges not to take economic factors into consideration.",50
205,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"It is doing nothing of the kind.  Mr. Curtin"" - Before honourable members opposite can justify their protest against the deletion of this section from the act, they must prove that during . the period it has formed part of the law the judges have actually proceeded on lines fundamentally different from those they previously followed.",51
206,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,Some of them have. [121 1,51
207,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not think sol ' ,  deleting this provision?",51
208,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"In my opinion, the successive awards made by the Federal, Arbitration Court have really only adjusted wages to the purchasing power of money as compared with what it stood at in 1907, '\at the time of the Harvester award. There is this' exception, that in 1921 Mr 'Justice Powers introduced an addition' of 6d. a day to overcome what he described as the "" lag"", meaning the delay which usually occurs in raising wages upon a. rise in prices.",51
209,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,Why should this section be excised?,51
210,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Because Parliament is not competent successfully to instruct Arbitration Court judges as to what economic facts they should take into consideration. In the library attached to this building there are scores of books written by eminent economists. I thought for a moment of bringing in half a dozen of these books, and quoting from them to show how divergent are the vieW3 held by economists even on the definition of economics. Most of us think that we know at least what is meant by the science of economics, but hardly any two writers on.the subject can be found to agree on a definition.",51
211,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member will find as much diversity of opinion over the definition of equity, a term which is to remain in the act.",51
212,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"What we have to ask ourselves is, has arbitration failed? We have the testimony of practically all , parties in this House that arbitration, as a general principle, has worked effectively in Australia. If there are faults, they' are not inherent in the system,"" and canbe overcome. There is a wealth of ' testimony to the effect that the awards of. the court have been observed reasonably well. There have been only two instances in which awards of the Federal Arbitration Court have been violated by trade unionists; but there have been quite a number of instances in which employers of labour have failed to carry out the provisions of awards. I do not propose to pursue that aspect of the subject now,. because there exists provision for correcting any such abuses. What is the reason for the attack which has been made on this bill? The charge against it is that it favours the unions, that it will increase their power, and that it is biased against the employers. The bill, if passed, will excise from the act the section which provides that a secret ballot of members of an organization may be conducted by a court on the petition of a few unknown persons. It will also repeal the penal provision against strikes and lockouts. It will enable one judge to reduce hours or increase wages, and it provides that a bench of three judges must deal with applications to increase hours or reduce wages.",51
213,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member think that that is right?,52
214,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . The bill will also greatly extend the conciliation provisions of the present act, and make conciliation the paramount feature of the whole system. It will also restrict the appellate'jurisdiction of the High Court, and vest in judges of the Arbitration Court the authority to finally determine whether or not a dispute actually exists. It will repeal section 25 D of the act, which directs the court to take into consideration the probable economic effects of a proposed award, or of an agreement which is to he certified. We have to ask ourselves why it is desirable that the penal provisions in respect of strikes and lockouts should be repealed. There is nothing in the bill to provide for the repeal of all penalties in the present act; it repeals only those relating to strikes and lockouts. In my opinion, no argument need be advanced to justify the repeal of penalties for strikes and lockouts other than the plea of expediency. This was the reason advanced by the late Prime Minister from his place in this chamber for not enforcing the penal provisions.of the act in connection with a notorious lockout last year. That was the justificakick tion offered by the late Prime Minister, and he was valiantly and eloquently-and I might add, logically-supporte d by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham). If my memory does not fail aie, the honourable member for Fawkner iilso justified the action of the Governarbitration, ment in declining to enforce the penal provisions of the act against John Brown.",52
215,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,No ; I protested against the then Government's action.,52
216,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member protested, but when it came to the crucial test, which would determine whether the Government should stand or fall, he supported the Government.",52
217,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,It was a choice of evils.,52
218,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"The law provides that any one found guilty of causing a lockout is punishable by heavy penalties. That provision was not enforced, because the last Government thought it inexpedient to enforce it. But the law as such will remain unless the amendment proposed in the bill is effected. We propose to make that amendment. The late Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) put it to Parliament last year that it was more important to achieve industrial peace, to open the minesand to resume production than to enforce penalties. That argument seems to me to go to the very root of the matter. I cannot see that the existence of legal provision for the enforcement of heavy penalties is likely to assist in healing such ruptures as may occur in the relations between employers and employees. The parties to industry must accept responsibility for their actions, and will be judged by the community for anti-social behaviour. Government after government has been compelled to recognize the. impracticability, and even the entire undesirability, of enforcing the penal provisions of the law in relation to strikes and lockouts. If any body of men feel that the conditions of employment offered to them are an affront to their sense of decency, or to the hopes of a better social life that they entertain, they have a right, which is inherent in their manhood, to refuse to offer their services to those who seek to purchase them.",52
219,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,They have no right to into insensibility other men who accept the work that they refuse.,52
220,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"My honourable and learned friend cannot "" get away "" with that. Penalties for assault and battery do not find a place in an arbitration act; that offence has no connection with or the settlement of disputes between organized employers on the one side and organized trade unions on the other. Any man who commits an assault can be dealt with under the ordinary processes of the law; and that is the right way to do it. Surely the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), with his years of experience, does not contend that men who commit atrocious crimes against the 'individual go scot-free in this community ? If they do, it is not because I go to their defence when"" they make answer to the charge in the civil courts. I propose to deal briefly with the visions that relate to the secret ballot. feel that a case can well be made out the. right of this community to control every form of organization; but I do not believe that we have reached the stage when so tremendous an assertion, of power of the State would be acceptable to honourable members opposite. For example, before the directorate of the national bank is added to in a time of knocking him over. economic crisis and commercial difficulty, do they agree that a secret ballot should be taken of the whole of the sharemembers holders ? The crux of this measure, from the the lowest price. stand-point of honourable members opposite, is that we propose to allow one judge reduce hours or increase wages, but insist that three judges must hear any application for an increase of hours or reduction of wages, and that, in addition, the provision which requires a judge to consider the economic effects of his award conception. is to be excised from the act. The fixation of the wage level at an lian irreducible living standard goes to the for Balaclava? very roots of the history of arbitration in this country. Do honourable members opposite stand for the postulate labour is a commodity to be bought and sold according to strict economic conwe siderations? If they do, I can quite understand their objection to the pronity posal to excise that provision from the act. But for my part-and I believe that I have the support of every humanelyhave minded man in the world-we , have long since passed the stage when industry should consider itself the master and dictate the terms upon which he shall find subsistence. I believe that should be able to stand up and say that .honourable member industry is his servant. Bightly organized and properly conducted, it is capable of ministering to his needs. has the right to refuse to be a mere piece of machinery, to be oiled and greased so many times a week, and expected to incorporate himself in the soulless mechanism of the ordinary technical processes of modern production. If honourable members opposite still cling to the dictum of the mid-Victorian economists that labour is a commodity and that peace in industry depends upon peace in politics, I can assure them that they are on the wrong track. ""We refuse to accept so ghastly a prodogma as that men and women, huniai? I flesh and blood, are to be regarded as so for many units, to be measured on the basis of the cash nexus, and. that they are to have in themselves no right to participate in the fruits of the earth, except upon the the best terms that they can make.",52
221,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member is building a straw man for the purpose of,53
222,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,Then we will burn the straw man. I can take it that honourable opposite do not agree that labour is a commodity to be bought and sold at,53
223,Mr FKANOIS,CONCILIATION AND,"At the highest price. to "" Mr. Curtin - May I contend that labour, rightly considered, is not to be bought and sold at all; that it is a partner a in the processes of production, a collaborator with the captains of industry.",53
224,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,That is the American,53
225,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,What is the Austraconception of the honourable member,53
226,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,"It is not practised in a single union in Australia, but it is to be that found in every American union. - ' Mr. Curtin - If it be admitted that can discard the old dogma that labour is a commodity, and that it has the digof human status, we have to fix a level below which that human status will not be permitted to be degraded. We must a yard-stick that will at least measure up to what shall be the irreducible minimum at which .men and of man, women will be expected to live. That brings me to the history of the man working of the Arbitration Act. Every remembers the Higgins' formula, that men have a right He to be employed, and that when employed they have a right to be assured that their wives and families will be. given, according to the normal standard of the time, a reasonable subsistence. I put it to honourable members opposite, that any industry which employs a man at a wage that does not give to him and to those who are dependent upon him a standard conformable to what has come to be regarded as the minimum human standard, takes out of that man more than it gives .back to him, and, therefore, it is parasitic ; it lives upon what it does not earn. It becomes a vampire, sucking, as it were, : f rom labour that which belongs to .labour. If. the working men of this community 'were to form themselves into a public 'company; if they were to regard themselves as representing so much capital, 'and were to expect at the end of the year, not only an income that would meet every running charge necessary to carry on 'their family lives,- but also ""would make provision for a big fat dividend of 10 per eent. upon capital or turnover, as well as 'a certain surii for reserve, as-'the banks ''and other big companies do, labour-would 'not be Obtainable in Australia Let me examine in some detail the standard of living in this country. It ! is extraordinary that the Commonwealth - Court has never made a general inquiry into, - the standard bf living, except the - admittedly inadequate investigation that the late Mr Justice Higgins made in the (Excise case .21 years ago. In the Com1 monwealth-Statistician's Labour Report, - No. 17, will be found the statement that "" only-one. comprehensive-effort has been made by the federal authorities 'to ascertain specifically what the actual requirements were in the various States-according to .reasonable standards of comfort . in respect of . . . a man. wife, and three children."" The late Mr. Justice Higgins in the Harvester case in ,1907 did not .declare the merits of. the ;issues on the equivalents in that year-of - the. findings of the commission - If..he ;had done so, the basic, wage for unskilled labour would have been fixed at 53s. lOd. instead of 42s. a week. I said earlier that, whether or not the .court had a . direction, to take into - account economic considerations, it had never done other than vary the original ,rate to the new purchasing power of {money. To prove the correctness of that statement, I quote the testimony of Mr. Sfr. Cvrtin. Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician, who, in reply to a question put to him by a royal commission, pointed out that, as a fact, it would be found that thewage-fixed by Mr Justice Higgins, instead of being sufficient to provide for a man, his wife, and three children, was sufficient only to provide for a man, his wife, and but one child. I know that there has grown, up in this community the absurd fetish that the court compels an employer to pay a wage that is based upon the 'assumption that every man who receives it has a wife and three children. I submit that any careful dissection of the basis upon which the late Mr. Justice Higgins made his 1907 award, and of the variations that have been made since that time, will show that, on the evidence that the Commonwealth Statistician has been able to compile, the wage fixed is sufficient for but one child and not three. The tables that the Commonwealth Statistician published a year ago show the importance to this community of having a living standard; that is to say, of insisting that there shall be a minimum below which even the courts .may not be permitted to go. They show that the 92 per cent, of the children of wage and salary earners whose parents are said to have an income of less than £250, aud the 85 per cent, of the children of non-employees similarly restricted, constitute nearly 90 per cent, of the total dependent children in the Commonwealth. Professor Wood, Lecturer on Economics in the Melbourne University, has said- Despite our boasted prosperity, far too - large a proportion of the children of our wage-earners pass some portion of the schoolage in households where the standards of life, health and decency do not measure up to any. reasonable option. Properly administered help to these children constitutes our best form of investment. The primary purpose of the bill is to rid the act of certain hindrances to peace and goodwill in industry, and to remove the. .provocative provisions that were incorporated, in the amending legislation of 1.928. ""The bill is designed, further, to develop effectively the extension of - the conciliatory functions of the court. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) offered the opinion that we could not obtain competent men for that work. > He said that it was wrong to vest the arbitral and conciliatory functions in one man or in one body. I remind him that, in a speech made earlier in this debate, the honourable member for  I think, wisely, and certainly very ably-the Victorian wages board system. He said that it was a most admirable method of regudustrial lating wages.. While making due allowphrase ance for the fact that the States have sovereign powers to enforce industrial laws, it must be admitted that the system of wage regulation in operation in Vicpute toria brings the two partners in industry together in an attempt to arrive at settlement of their differences. The prowill posal of the Government in this bill combines the conciliatory and arbitral funcis tions, which the honourable member for Fawkner has said could not and should not be done. The conciliation commiswill sioner will resort to conciliation as far possible, and when conciliation fails he the will proceed to exercise distinctly arbitral we cannot do it in any power, and decide the issue between the two parties who have failed to respond his efforts at conciliation. The honour the able member for Fawkner, who doubts the practicability of this proposal, has self acted as chairman of a wages board in Victoria.",53
227,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,But a wages board is not called together to deal with a dispute.,55
228,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Nin e out of every ten cases that come before a wages board are the direct result of differences . of opinion between employers and employees, as to the wages to be paid, the hours be worked, and other industrial conthe ditions, and those are precisely that emerge in the Federal Arbitration Court. If there were no dispute between, the parties who go before wages' employees boards, there would be no occasion for them to do so,- because they allowing could make an - agreement outside their and register it. Everyone knows that the bulk of the matters that come before the Arbitration Court, and which are labelled "" disputes "", are merely result of a refusal on the part of one side to agree to the demands of the other.",55
229,Mr BEENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,We on this side are frequently charged with making these technical disputes.,55
230,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . Many of them are pure fakes, in order to establish right to appear before the court. One of the amendments to the act made by this, bill is to strike out certain words in the statute that have been.prc4 - ductive of real disputes. Sub-section 1 of section '2 provides that among the chief objects of the act are "" To prevent lockouts and strikes in relation to indisputes."" Every word in that is capable of misconstruction. What is a dispute? What is a lockout? What is meant by "" preventing a lockout or dispute""? Whtt is an industrial die^ as distinct from a dispute? It is proposed to eliminate that phrase and ; a substitute the words "" To promote good.in industry by conciliation and arbi. tration "". I submit that this Parliament not yet bankrupt in regard to its ability to deal with this problem. If we cannot pass a measure that will promote goodinstead of strife, on the sole as basis of ' a sincere desire to obtain best results from industry, other way. Bad conditions are responsible for to bad men. If there is antagonism between two parties to industry, it cannot be removed by the imposition of the penal himprovisions which the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) wishes' to preserve. The world cannot carry on its' industries under the present industrial system if there is not a readiness on the part of employers and employees to do the best they can to give opportunities to' the millions of men for whom no work is' now offering. If ever the gospel of conto ciliation should evoke a response from employers of Australia it should do the issues so at the present time. Nothing is to be gained by threatening with a penalty of £1,000, and their leaders with imprisonment, or by officers of the court to go into organizations and conduct ballots. If ever there was a time when industry should be conducted on a new basis it is. now. If this measure is biased at all, its; the bias is to promote goodwill between employers, and employees. It puts Aus-' tralia first. In reply to the .sophistry - of the honourable member for Fawkner,' who suggests that the Government of the day had no mandate to wipe out the penal provisions of the act, I remind him of the what was said in the last Parliament. Those provisions became a dead letter as a result of the administration of the late Government. The trade unions will never tolerate their members being heavily fined, in view of the black chapter in our history relating to the failure of the late Government to prosecute the coal-owners in connection with the lockout on the northern coal-fields. The interests of society and of industry will be best promoted by the encouragement of conciliation conferences rather than by launching prosecutions. Wage determination is the most fundamental and difficult problem in connection with industrial relations, involving both the prosperity of industry and the standard of living of the workers. Demands for increased wages are often countered by the argument that they will result in business depression and unemployment. That is one of the arguments frequently put forward in recent years, and the reply is that in many countries the level of real wages has risen, while industrial prosperity has been maintained, and even increased. In his Recent Economic Changes Professor Wesley C. Mitchell states, at page 864That organizations of wage-earners should grasj) the relations between productivity and wages, and that they should take the initiative in pressing constructive plans for increasing efficiency upon employers, is not wholly out precedent; but the spread of such ideas and the vigour with which they are acted on by large organizations must startle those who have believed that trade unions are brakes upon economic progress. That quotation is taken from a chapter in which the writer testifies that one of the greatest stimulants to efficiency in industry is the demand that the workers have made for increased wages. He points out that the lower the ""wages the less pressure there is upon business executives to improve efficiency, develop productive capacity, and put industry in a position to compete with impending changes in methods of production. The fact that it is beneficial to improve wages, reduce hours of work, and give the employee a better share of the fruits of production is well illustrated in a book by Rowe, sarily. entitled Wages in Practice and Theory, in which the author says The ordinary stimulus of competition can and should be, reinforced by a constant presfalling sure to raise wages, if the utmost is to be got from the present, or indeed any system industry. Within limits, which are probably capital ? Sfr. Curtin. in most industries, and at most times, appreciably wide, an increase in wage rates, if it is maintained for a reasonably long period, is more than likely to generate sufficient improvement in the efficiency of production to pay for itself, in the sense that though the first results will be some unemployment, and some reduction of the national dividend,.the ultimate result will be the re-absorption of these unemployed workers, and an increase in the national dividend. Trade unions ought consciously to try and keep wages not in exact adjustment with, but a trifle above, the cm-rent marginal product i v it y equivalent; to accept the fact that this is bound to produce a variable, but permanent, margin of unemployment.",55
231,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,"Does the honourable member agree that, the basis should be productivity?",56
232,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,Yes .,56
233,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,That is different from what the honourable member said earlier.,56
234,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"The basis of life is productivity. Because I say that industry should be the servant, of man, does the honourable member imagine that I believe that man could live without industry? Everywhere throughout the world industry is owned, controlled and directed by a comparatively small section of the community. The great majority of human beings have no access to the with- fields, factories, or workshops, and have no proprietary interest in the equipment used for the purposes of production. Ownership resides in a small class. I have nothing against those who comprise it ; I am merely stating an economic fact. A few persons in every community are the owners and directors of the .equipment that society must use in production to maintain its. existence. By what means can we insure that the instrumentalities of production shall be made available for the common good, and that the great mass of human beings who are deprived of ownership rights in this equipment shall have access to it? Without such access they are doomed to be industrial exiles.",56
235,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,Not neces,56
236,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Is it not true that more and more the control of production be, in all the great spheres of industry is into the hands of gr,eat trusts and of monopolies, and huge aggregations ef",56
237,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,"That is the outcome of the tariff. Mr CtmTIN - Whateve r its origin, we cannot ignore the economic fact that millions of persons have no proprietary right in production, no means of ensuring admission to a factory or field, no equipment with which to produce on a competitive equality with those who are already in possession. Dr Clifford saidIt is as unfortunate as it is true that - of every ten children born in England yesterday eight will all lose their lives to pay tribute to the other two. Eight of them are the servants from birth of the two who are born to the inheritance of ownership over land, factories, or workshops. That is true to a large extent of Australia. In the cities of Melbourne and Sydney, thousands of workmen have no access to the factories. They cannot enter a boot factory or any other manufacturing establishment and say that they will work. The opportunity to produce is denied them. We must have regulation of the relations between the owners and controllers of industrythe employers-and the workers. This bill is not put forward as the final answer to the age-old problem of what constitutes a fair deal to the masses, on the 'one hand, and the employers on the other. But if we give more emphasis to conciliation and less to arbitration, and remove from the act the punitive provisions inserted in 1928, we shall contribute another practical instalment to the long series of efforts during the history of this Parliament to make the federal arbitration system of service not only to industry, but to the nation also.",57
238,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"Wentworth) [9.51] There are no honourable members to whom I listen with more delight than the honourable member for Fawkuer (Mr. Maxwell), and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin), and there was little in the speech of either of them with which I disagreed. The honourable member for Fawkner devoted a great deal of his speech to defining the mandate he had received from his electors. I agree with him that the issue at the last elections was mainly the continuance of the federal arbitration system. By an. overwhelming vote, the people of Australia gave a definite mandate to this Government to remain in that field, and do what it can to improve the existing machinery. The act has already been amended twelve times, and Hansard during the last 26 years has been filled with hundreds of speeches on the subject. I have said inside and outside this chamber that industry will not know real peace except upon the conditions which have, been very ably specified by the honourable out member for Fremantle. Labour is not a chattel to be bought .and sold; it is entitled to co-partnership in industry. Only when the workers who produce the wealth of the country have a fair and equitable share of what they produce will peace in industry be assured. Short of that, we shall never find a complete remedy for industrial ills; but the Government is bound by the mandate of the people at the last election to try to improve existing legislation. I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) that the bill, good though it is in the opinion of ministerial supporters, is only a stopgap, and that nothing effective can be done until the people by referendum give to the Commonwealth Parliament increased powers in industrial matters. I am strongly opposed to the first of the referendum hills introduced by the Government, and defeated in another place, and strongly in favour of the other two, and I ' hope that the Government will persist with them. The right honourable member for North Sydney, although a great believer in arbitration, did not claim that it was wholly responsible for Australia's extraordinary growth and the increase of wealth during the last quarter of a century. In the last ten years the population of this country has increased by 1,000,000, the annual production by £100,000,000, bank capital and fixed deposits by £127,000,000, and savings bank deposits by £89,000,000. That is an extraordinary record of which we ought to be intensely proud, and in the making of which the workers have played a mammoth part. I claim that the Government has received a solid mandate from the people, and the honourable member for Fawkner spoilt an otherwise excellent speech by saying that the mandate was given only by the trade, unionists. What about the reduced majorities of the honourable members for  (Mr Latham), and Henty (Mr. Gullett), and the loss of the Nationalist strongholds of Martin, Barton and Parramatta? Were the Nationalist candidates rejected by the votes of the unionists only? The truth is that there was a sweeping movement throughout Australia against the Bruce-Page Government, and the Labour party undoubtedly received a mandate.",57
239,Mr NAIBN,CONCILIATION AND,Canno t the honourable member think of something else?,58
240,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,Nationalis t supporters do not like to be reminded of the fact3. What of my own position? The whole power of the late Government was directed against me.,58
241,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,And the wealth of the picture interests wasbehind the honourable member.,58
242,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"The interjection reminds me that the honourable member was returned with a majority of only 100 votes. Mr Bruce and his Ministers, and Mr Bavin and members of his Cabinet, spoke against my candidature night after night; yet the great majority I have held for twelve years was only slightly reduced.",58
243,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member was returned by the Labour votes.,58
244,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"The Labour votes helped me; I am not so foolish as not to recognize that. I repeat that the Government has a mandate from both trade unionist and nationalist voters to retain the federal arbitration system and, if possible, improve it. What are the objects of the act?1. To promote goodwill in industry by ciliation and arbitration. Are the people opposed to that? Of course not 2. To constitute a Commonwealth Court Conciliation and Arbitration, having jurisdicinterjection, tion for the prevention and settlement dustrial disputes. 3. To provide for the exercise of the diction of the court by conciliation with a view to amicable agreement between parties. 4. In default of amicable agreement between the parties, to provide for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court by equitable award. 5. To enable States to refer industrial disputes to the court, and to permit the - working of the court and of State industrial authorities in aid of each other. 0. To facilitate and encourage the organization of representative bodies of employers and employees and thesubmission of industrial disputes to the court by organizations, and to permit representative bodies of employers and of employees to bo declared organizations for the purposes of this act. 7. To provide for the making and enforcement of industrial agreements between employers and employees in relation to industrial disputes. No honourable member would hesitate to address his constituents in favour of each of those seven objects; and they are in accord with the mandate given to the Government by the electors. The honourable member for Eawkner, by reason of his early association with the wages board system of Victoria, favours conciliation. One of the principal features of the bill is that it proposes to increase the number and powers of conciliation commissioners. The bulk of the work to be done under this legislation will be entrusted to such commissioners rather than to the Arbitration Court. I am not greatly in favour of courts, although I have been appearing before them for 27 years; in fact, I instructed the right honourable member for North Sydney in the first case heard in the Federal Arbitration Court 26 years ago, and I had enough of arbitration on that occasion.",58
245,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,It was the only case that the honourable member ever had.,58
246,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course the. honourable member for Warringah and I hate one another like poison. At the last elections he used faked photographs against me, and also published extracts from my conprivate letters in the press of Australia. It is certainly bad form on his part, while I am speaking, to sit at the table laughing and grimacing. I remind him that when he made his speech yesterday, of I listened to him without making one and he might extend to me of in a similar compliment. If there is onejuristhing that we should prize in our political life it is the courtesy that it is usual to the extend one to another. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is not much in favour of conciliation commissioners. His speech, I thought, was a spoilt because of his suspicion of the tive of the Government in introducing the bill. He is suspicious of the powers that are to be given to these commissioners and the use that may be made of them. He is afraid that any decision given by them will be in favour of the working man at the expense of his employer. He should at least realise that, if his suspicion is justified, the people will deal with the Government at the next elections. The people are our masters, and if this Government does wrong, as the last Government did, it will lose office. If under this legislation one tion of the people is favoured at the expense of another the Government will perish. I therefore do not share in the intense suspicion of the honourable member for Fawkner, who seems to think that everything that this Government does is evil. I shall support the second reading of this bill if I am here when the vote is taken, and I hope that it will be amended in committee. I urge the Attorney-General to accept any amendment, no matter from which side it comes, if it will improve the bill. If we are sincere we should try to do our best for the industries of this gorgeous land of ours, because after all, the foundation stone of the wealth and prosperity of this country is the happiness and contentment of our people. This Parliament alone is not able to maintain the standard of living of this country. That is only possible if goodwill and peace existbetween the employer and the employee, and, as representatives of the people, we should do all that we can to improve the position as we find it. I have looked through the bill. One cannot but be impressed with the enormous powers of the conciliation commissioners. If the right men are not appointed we may certainly have chaos in industry. Whether the commissioner is to have an intense knowledge of commerce and industry, or whether, as the honourable member for Fawkner suggests, he is to be an ordinary layman who, by his tact and courtesy, will bring the parties to a dispute together and arrange an amicable settlement, remains to be seen. On many occasions settlements have been arranged through the agency of conciliation commissioners; but we never hear of that; we hear only of strikes. The mo- members of the Ministry are not fools, and will not appoint men as conciliation commissioners who are likely, by their decisions, to wreck the Government. The other day an employer said to me, "" If this bill is put through Jock Garden will be appointed as a conciliation commissioner."" I replied, "" You do not know the present Government as well as I do, and I do not think that it will do anything foolish."" I am going to trust the Government, but if it does wrong I shall oppose it. I shall do everything in my power to improve the bill. There are cersectainly some strange clauses in it. Clause 18c deals with conciliation commissioners, and paragraph 4 readsA conciliation commissioner shall also have all the powers which the court or a judge has under this act for the purpose of preventing or settling industrial disputes, including the powers contained in section 38, other than(a) the powers contained in paragraphs (d) and (/) of that section, and (ft) the power to give an interpretation of any term of an existing award, contained in paragraph (o) of that section. The conciliation commissioner cannot impose a penalty for the non-observance of an award. He cannot declare a common rule. He cannot give au interpretation of any term of an existing award. But, strange to say, under clause 38 oa, the commissioner can set aside an award or any of its terms. That power is also given under paragraph 3 of clause 28. We should watch the position closely at the committee stage, because I think this is a blemish. If the three judges give an award the conciliation commissioner may upset it, and I think that that is going too far.",58
247,Mr MCTIEKNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Bot h parties to an industry may want an award set aside as a preliminary to a new agreement.,59
248,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"Unde r clause 19B 1 the conciliation commissioner may make a representative order to bring before him during any hearing any interested person. I have no objection to that. Under clause 20 1, the commissioner may make an order restraining any State industrial authority from dealing with an industrial dispute. That is certainly a large power. Under clause 28 1, the commissioner may make an award for a period not exceeding five years, and at the end of that period the award will continue to operate unless the commissioner decides otherwise. Under clause 35 1, the .conciliation commissioner may appoint two assessors to assist him. That a .very necessary power. Under clause 40A the commissioner may, by his award, bind a board of reference. Some of those powers are, of course, very necessary. I know nothing about unionism, and I wish that I had one-quarter of the knowledge that the supporters of the Government have on industrial matters. But, as honourable gentlemen know, I am a great traveller. I have had seven trips to America, and on many occasions I have inspected thegreatfactories atDetroit and other places. The Minister for Trade aud Customs (Mr Fenton), who has just 'returned from America, is well aware of the enormous extent to which industry has grown in America. Quick measures arc adopted in that country. If there is trouble with a working man in a factory ,at 9 a.m., it is settled that afternoon. Things are done at once. If a man severs an artery and no doctor is available, a ligature is applied immediately. If a man cuts his finger he is told to look after it and not to let it fester. The same direct method is adopted in the industrial world. If trouble arises in a factory the foreman forwards a report to one of the directors. The director, the foreman,'the man concerned and a representative of the union, if there is one connected with the works, are called together and the dispute is thrashed out and settled. There is nothing in this bill to prevent us from adopting similar methods in Australian industry. [Quorum formed.] When a dispute arises we should attend to it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Section 18A deals with the jurisdiction of the court. Under the section the chief judge and two other judges now have power to increase decrease hours, but not wages. The proposed amendment will give the three judges power to increase, reduce, or alter both hours and wages.",59
249,Mr KEANE,CONCILIATION AND,Includin g the basic wage.,60
250,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"Ful l power is given service to the chief judge and the other two judges to deal with wages and hours in any way they like.' In these circumstances it seems to me that section 18AA, which deals with interpretations affecting standard hours, is superisfluous. We shall have to watch this at the committee stage of the bill. It is strange that, although it is agreed that Parliament has no constitutional power to authorize the court to make a common rule, it is proposed to amend paragraph c of section 29 with the object of making an award of a conciliation commissioner ""binding as a common rule"" on all organizations and persons to whom it is at any time declared to apply. Apparently this is an effort to obtain a common rule in another way; but I do not think that it will succeed. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that the penalties provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act have never been effective. Although, I must admit that I voted as a party man with my party for the bill which provided for the imposition of these penalties, I think a conciliation aud arbitration act is not' the place for them. The John Brown case, which was the most appalling of its kind that ever happened in the history of the Commonwealth, showed the ineffectiveness of the penalties. It will be remembered that I scathingly criticized the Government of which I was a supporter for withdrawing the quasi-criminal prosecution launched against John Brown, although I voted against the censure motion to save the Government, because I believed that the prosecution had been withdrawn through an error of judgment. The honourable member for Fawkner took the same stand as I did on that occasion. We all commit errors of judgment at times, and we should have sympathy with each other in this regard. The Australian people cannot be forced to do what they do not desire to do; but an appeal to their sense of justice is and nearly always effective. It has been said that all penalties are being withdrawn against the employees, but not. against the employers. This is not so; for section 9 (2) provides thatAn employee shall not cease work in the of his employer by reason of the circumstance that the employer(a) is an officer or member of air organization, or of an association that has applied to be registered, as an organization: or (fc) is entitled to the benefit of an industrial agreement or an award; or (c) has appeared as a witness, or has given any evidence, in a proceeding under this Act. Penalty: Twenty-five pounds. Then section 78 (.1) saysAny organization or person bound by industrial agreement shall for any breach or. non-observance of any term of the agreement be liable to a penalty not exceeding amount as is fixed by the industrial agreeAssociation. ment; and if no amount is so fixed, then to a penalty not exceeding in the case of an organization Five hundred pounds, in the case of an employer Two hundred and fifty pounds, and in the case of an employee Ten pounds. It will be seen, therefore, that some penalties against employees are being retained. It is wisely proposed in clause 11 of the bill that section 21AA of the act shall .be amended to enable an application to be made to ""any judge sitting in chambers"" for a declaration that a dispute exists. At present, it is necessary at times for organizations to go to a great deal of trouble to prove that a dispute exists in more than one State. Reference has been made to the case with which my firm was concerned 25 years ago, in which our clients had to spend hundreds of pounds to create a dispute outside of New South Wales before they could approach the Arbitration Court. It is a farce that this should be necessary. At the same time, I feel that this proposed amendment may lead to a good deal of costly litigation, and land us in the High Court. Still, it is a good thing that the Government is trying to do something to facilitate arbitration. I am glad that steps are being taken to prohibit legal practitioners from appearing before the court, for that will be the effect of the amendment proposed to section 27. I have earned a good many pounds by appearing before the court, but I am convinced that by prohibiting the legal fraternity from taking part in its proceedings we shall overcome 25 per cent, of our troubles. After all, legal practitioners live by their profession, and they are not likely to cry their eyes out because cases in which they are engaged occupy many weeks longer than the parties expected. Lawyers are fine fellows, but they should be kept out of the Arbitration Court. I realise that the speeches that we make on this bill are not likely to have any. great effect, for industrial unrest can be alleviated or aggravated solely by the employers and employees. We have received many circulars from different bodies in connection with this bill. I trust au that the Attorney-General will look into one or two points made in the letter such sent to us by the United Bank Officers",60
251,Mr BKENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,I shall do so.,61
252,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"We have also received letters from the council of the Employers Federation, in which the fear is expressed that if this bill is passed our whole industrial arbitration edifice will crumble to the dust. There is, undoubtedly, fear in some quarters, as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has said, that the Government is about to do something that will wreck our industrial structure. But if the Government is responsible for anything like that the people may be trusted to deal with it. We are the servants of the people, and I trust that we shall do our best .to put upon the statute-book a measure which will conserve the interests of, and deal equitably with, all sections of the community.",61
253,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Grey) [10.25] - When ever a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is introduced a spirited debate may be expected, for the measure must necessarily raise controversial issues. The members of the Parliamentary Labour party have stood for arbitration almost ever since the establishment of their party; but the members of the parties opposite are not in that position. It is true that members of the newly-formed Australian party who have spoken in this debate have supported the bill, but the members of the Nationalist party and the Country party have opposed it. In my opinion these two parties have always been against arbitration. It is a great pity that the seriousness of the industrial disputes that have occurred in Australia in recent years has been magnified for political reasons. No subject has been more used for political party propaganda in Australia than industrial unrest. The last three elections have been fought on this issue. In 1925 the election campaign was held while a shipping strike was in progress, and the next election was f ought during the waterside workers dispute. Political capital was made out of both these unfortunate troubles. But the last election was caused because the Government of the day dared to attempt to destroy the temple of arbitration. A good deal of extraneous matter has been introduced into this debate) particularly in regard to the number of strikes that have occurred in Australia. It is almost impossible to avoid this, and I suppose that I shall take the opportunity of referring to a number of matters that are not specifically dealt with in the measure. I u my opinion industrial arbitration has been a great success, but the Government is entirely justified in introducing this bill because it is designed to improve the system. The last Prime Minister, in almost every speech that he made in introducing a bill in this House, referred to the mandate which his Government had received from the people; but if ever a government had a mandate from the people to do anything, this Government has a mandate from them to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I believe that the amendments set out in the bill merely give effect to election promises made to the people. If the Government had not introduced this measure this session it would have deserved severe censure. The following statement was issued on behalf of the Labour party during the election campaign, following upon the attempt of the last Government to abolish the Federal Arbitration Court:The Labour movement pins its faith to the federal principle. But it does not necessarily want a federal court as at present constituted. It wants a federal system freed from the entangling legalisms that now surround the court. It believes in round table conferences and the work of conciliation generally. But it wants to have in the background a federal tribunal to which recourse can be* had if conciliation fails. In many cases agreement has only been reached with employers because the employers knew that if there was no agreement, then the matter would go to arbitration. If that safeguard goes, there will be chaos, confusion and strife. We are now giving effect to the promise we then made. Every amendment we are now seeking to make was forecast in the speech of the present Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin) before the last election. As au honourable senator stated some time ago, Mr Lacey, if ever a party had a mandate, this party has one for' its industrial programme. In 1928 the Bruce-Page Government amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. We opposed its action, and promised the people then that when we got into power we would have the act altered by repealing the penal provisions. We are how honoring that promise. In this bill conciliation is rightly placed before arbitration. In the last amending bill introduced by the Bruce Page Government all prospect of conciliation between employer and employees was destroyed. So little confidence had the workers in the Government's intentions that they even refused, in some instances, to have anything to do with the judges it appointed. The present Prime Minister (Mr Scullin), in his policy speech, promised that the Federal Arbitration Court would be retained; that the act would be amended by eliminating the penal clauses; that legal entanglements would be abolished; and that conciliation would be encouraged. It is not very long since some honourable members on the other side spoke in the same terms, the late right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) among them. Honourable members have said that the Arbitration Court has been proved to be a failure because it has not prevented strikes. As a matter of fact, the awards of the court have been obserced quite as well as have any other laws on the statute-book. If there were no Arbitration Court, Australia would be in a condition of constant industrial turmoil, and practically all disputes would have to be settled by costly industrial warfare. It has been suggested by members of the Opposition that, instead of approaching an Arbitration Court, the parties should confer and settle their disputes. That is what the Government wishes, and employers and employees are encouraged in this bill to follow that method of reaching agreement; but there must be some authority to adjudicate when they are not able to come to terms. It would have been a good thing for Australia if we had not been so willing to broadcast news of every industrial disturbance which occurs. As a matter of fact relatively less time is lost through industrial disputes in Australia than in practically any other country. We do not hear about the strikes that occur in other countries, and it would be a good thing if we took steps to prevent other countries from hearing about ours. Honourable members opposite have said that some workers' advocates are opposed to the principle of arbitration. If there are any such, they do not speak for organized labour in Australia. It is true that there are many employers opposed to arbitration, despite the fact that it would be beneficial to them to have uniform rates and conditions prevailing throughout the Gommonwealth. Such employers have affinity with the unscrupulous group who organized themselves into the Single Purpose League, pledged to the abolition of arbitration. Their object was to reduce the standard of living, and force down wages. Those who oppose the principle that industry should pay a living wage, range themselves with the section whose avowed purpose it is to force down the standard of living. They are prepared to submit to the inconveniences arising from the existence of different wage standards in different States in the belief that will more than make up any loss by exploiting their workers. The people of Australia will not stand for that sort of thing. They have expressed themselves in favour of the principle of arbitration and of a fair living wage. Some honourable members opposite desire wages and conditions to be governed by supply and demand. We opposed the last Government's policy of unrestricted immigration because we believed it to be part *of a plan to force down living conditions. The Federal Arbitration Court was first to be abolished, and then the labour market was to be flooded with people from overseas. This Government desires to make the Arbitration Court more accessible to the workers, so that they may approach it with confidence, and have their cases heard without delay. Wages have already been reduced to a considerable extent in Australia-more , perhaps, than is generally thought. I believe that many men are today working under conditions which they are reluctant to disclose. The Arbitration Court is not responsible for depression in industry. It has been proved that high wages do not contribute towards unemployment. As a matter of fact I do not admit that [122] wages have been either increased or reduced by our arbitration system. Since 1911, at all events, the effective wage has been the same. In proof of that I shall quote figures that have been published by the Commonwealth Statistician. They show that in 1911 the average wage per week in Australia was 51s. 3d.; in 1914 it was 55s. 3d., and in 1929, 101s. 5d. The index cost of living figure was fixed at 1,000 in 1911. By 1914 it had risen to 1079, and in 1929 it stood at 1979. Therefore, it is absurd for any honourable member to say that arbitration is responsible for high wages, and it is equally incorrect to say that it has not maintained our standard of living.",61
254,Mr ISTAIEN,CONCILIATION AND,"If the wage has not increased since 1911, how can it be said that there is a higher standard of living?",63
255,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The conditions of the workers have been considerably improved, even though the value of the wage that they receive is only equal to what it was in 1911. Those who oppose arbitration they are not in favour of a basic wage. In the last Parliament, honourable members who sit opposite supported a measure that made it mandatory for the judge to take into account the economic effect of his award upon industry. They are now opposed to this bill because, under it, that matter is to be discretionary and not mandatory. I consider that the Government has taken the right course. It is not possible for the economic effect of an award to be absolutely proven, although it is possible to prove positively the cost of living. Under the provision in the act as it stands, a mining company, for example, knowing that it would be going to the Arbitration Court, and that the economic effect of an award would have to be taken into consideration, could work the unprofitable portions of its mine and make it appear that if the claim of the men were granted it would be inimical to the welfare of their enterprise. Thus, with an award covering a period of five years, it would be able to make a considerable profit. I contend that not only the immediate effect, but also past profits should be taken into consideration. There are in Australia big mining companies that have paid huge dividends to their shareholders ever since they commenced operations. is said that recently they have not been making any profits, and some are threatening to close down. In passing, let me say that this Government would act wisely if it brought down legislation to prevent a mining or any other company from closing down, and indiscriminately throwing its employees out of work. During the war period, when excessive profits were made and huge dividends were paid, there was not very much talk of the economic effect of an award; the basic wage was then good enough for the worker. Every worker is entitled to a living wage.",63
256,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,We are all agreed that.,64
257,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member cannot say that, and at the same time argue that the economic effect upon industry must be the first consideration. The paramount concern should be the fixing of a living wage for every employee. The fundamental principle of arbitration is to provide a reasonable standard of living for a worker and his family. In the past, the judges of the Arbitration Court have determined what is a reasonable standard, and I do not believe that their judgment on that point can be questioned. Those who advocate that the economic effect of awards should be taken into consideration, and that piecework and other methods of breaking down a living wage .should be provided for in our Arbitration Act, are never willing to adopt the suggestion that the fixing of a sufficient basic wage should be the first consideration. The miners at Broken Hill are today working for a basic wage under the contract system. It was their suggestion, that provision for such a wage should be embodied in the agreement, and, at first, it was strenuously opposed by the employers. That has always been the experience of the workers under the contract system.",64
258,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,Such a provision is included in all agreements.,64
259,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Despit e what honourable members may say, they are opposed to the principle of first fixing a living wage. I maintain that awards are broken more often by the employers than by the It employees. As a matter of fact, I believe that almost every award that has been made by the Arbitration Court has been broken in some particular by the employers. I know of many cases in which a judge, having determined what the living wage shall be, has left it to the employer to give extra remuneration for dirty work, extra skill, and so on; and in hardly any case has that suggestion been adopted. On practically all occasions the minimum wage has been the maximum wage. There are in existence today, awards, in the securing of which I was concerned, that have never been put into operation. After an award is made the employer immediately on alters the conditions in the industry. That is just as much a breaking of the award as would be a demand by the employees for extra pay. I have known that to happen in almost every large industry. [Quorum formed.] I said in my opening remarks that I was pleased that conciliation had been given a foremost place in this bill. Every advocate of arbitration must derive satisfaction from the fact. When the late Mr Justice Higgins was the President of the Federal Arbitration Court, he encouraged conciliation whenever the opportunity presented itseK. I was interested in three or four cases that came before him. Before proceeding with a case, he would suggest that the parties confer with a view to agreeing upon as many points as possible, leaving for his determination only those matters upon which there was no hope of' agreement. Dr Jethro Brown adopted a similar procedure in the South Australian court, and he was able to deal with twice as many cases as was possible under our act when it was minus this provision. Had a spirit of conciliation operated in the early stages of the last waterside dispute, the principal trouble would have been obviated.",64
260,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,What is the use of talking of conciliation ? Why was the award not obeyed?,64
261,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The trouble on the waterfront was largely due to the alteration of the pick-up time. That alteration was incorporated in the final award by Judge Beeby, and the union was not aware of the fact until the award was promulgated. Both the union representatives and the representatives of the shipping companies agreed that two pick-ups should operate in every port of the Commonwealth, and they put that decision before the judge. Judge Beeby remained adamant, and refused to alter the judgment. Had an opportunity occurred to find out what prompted the action of the judge, I should have been foremost in asking that an inquiry should be held. Had conciliation been practised and the desire of both parties to the award acceded to, the trouble would not have occurred.",64
262,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,"Eve n allowing for that, does not the honourable member agree that the unionists should have been sportsmen, accepted the award, and then made application for an alteration?",65
263,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"As a matter of fact, I advised them to take that action. I also advised the men at all ports in my electorate to continue working. They did so, and there is no trouble at those ports today. Had the spirit of conciliation been in evidence at that time there would have been no occasion to incur heavy expenditure on additional policing of the waterfront. If Judge Beeby's example were followed, and objectionable conditions placed in the awards in the same fashion, disputes could be precipitated in any industry, although neither employer nor employee desired them. The incorporation of this provision in the bill will obviate such occurrences in future. I am glad that the Government has withdrawn the penal clauses from the act. They merely created an atmosphere of hostility and distrust. The Government is wisely endeavouring to foster a better ing between parties to any dispute. Those penalties did nothing towards bringing about industrial peace; they merely engendered trouble. Honourable members opposite are continually crying out for piece-work instead of a set wage. They are entirely wrong in their attitude. I .believe that the Australian worker will do a fair day's work if he is paid a reasonable wage, and that there is no need to introduce piecework in Australia. I admit that some industries are peculiarly adapted to the practice, and that in them it operates successfully. Instead of the workers of the world receiving a reduction of wages, they are entitled to an increase. I know that that contention is objectionable to the conservative minds of honourable members opposite, but I direct attention to the daily encroachment of labour-saving appliances in industry. Surely workers are entitled to some of the advantages of the innovation. That view is endorsed by arbitration judges, whose advocacy of it should be considered. The honourable member for Bichmond (Mr B. Green) maintained that the Australian worker is going slow. I remind the honourable gentleman that 200,000 Australian workers have produced so much that warehouses are ful l of the fruits of their labour; they have worked themselves out of a job. Our workers have not gone slow. Unfortunately, there is some defect in our industrial system. Our method of distribution appears to be wrong, as we are producing too much of certain - commodities, and are failing to extend the products of others. I do not blame the captains of industry for installing labour saving devices. They have a perfect right to keep abreast of the times. I know some of the industries of Australia particularly well. Since 1913,1I have visited the quarries at Iron Knob, which-supplv the iron stone for Newcastle. A few years ago, that stone was quarried by day labour, and if two men handled 90 tons of stone in a day they performed a good day's work. When I visited Iron Knob last February I saw a machine in operation that lifted some 3,380 tons of iron stone in eight hours. That machine is working three shifts in 24 hours, and affords an example of what is happening everywhere in the industrial world. We are feeldefinitely reaching saturation point. Something will have to be done to establish additional industries in Australia, and to give some of the advantages of modern invention to the workers who are suffering through the extensive use of labour-saving appliances. Every machine placed in operation puts some persons out of work. There should be some method of adjusting the matter, but it cannot be done by cheap, carping criticism concerning the output of Australian workers. In solving the problem, it will be necessary to maintain the standard of living of the workers.",65
264,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member admit that the use of the machine to which he has referred cheapens the cost of steel and so allows the expand ?,65
265,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"There is only a limited amount of work available for our steel manufactures, and they are supplying the demand. Honourable members opposite are always urging that wages must come down.",66
266,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,"""Who said that?",66
267,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,I have never heard the honourable member for Henty (Mr trial Gullett) advocate that rates of interest should be lowered..,66
268,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,No r has the honourable member heard me say that wages should come down. I urge the honourable memlegislation-brough ber to display a little honesty.,66
269,Mr LACEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member and his colleagues continually refer to the effect of a living wage on industry. When they contend that the c*ost of prothe duction is too high they mean that are too high, and seek a reduction. [Quorum formed.] Those who oppose compulsory arbitration say, either that wages must come down, or that the cost of production is too high, and they also contend that we have an artificially high standard of living; but they do not plain that interest or the value of proequivalent perty is too high. If wages were reduced 25 per cent, there would be a 25 per increase in the cost of living. A few years ago a Labour government in South Australia built 1,000 homes for the workers in the city of Adelaide. The of these houses to the occupants was £700 or £800 each. They are occupied whole by wage-earners, who are paying for their properties under the provisions of the State Bank Act. If those employees' wages were now reduced by 25 per cent., they would still have to pay the whole the originaj purchase price of their homes, the value of which would been reduced by 25 per cent, owing to the reduction in the purchasing power their wages. The claim that wages should be reduced is prompted by a desire that the poorer classes should pay the piper in the present period of economic deprestheir sion. It is hoped by those who oppose arbitration, that the rich shall be wealthier, and that those who have little shall have less. Labour does not stand for that proposal, which, like the ""go slow "" canard, was rejected by the people industry to at the last election. I realise that every strike must be dealt with on its merits; but many strikes have been encouraged, even by employers. No political section in this country, or, perhaps, in any part of the world, has gained more advantage from strikes than the party represented by the Opposition. For three consecutive elections that party made political capital out of industrouble. It would never have survived the 1925 election if the seamen's strike had not been'in progress. Eventually the very principle that it depended on for its tenure of office-industria l t about its defeat. Although the bill does not go so far as one would like, it is a step in the right direction. It is calculated to promote industrial peace to a greater extent than amendments of the act for which the wages late Government was responsible.",66
270,Mr NAIEN,CONCILIATION AND,"Perth) [11.20] - I am not opposed to arbitration; but, if T accepted all the statements of the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey), my confidence in it would be sadly shaken. He has told us that the effective value comof wages at the present time is only to that of 1911. If that be true, arbitration has completely failed in cent, its object. We know that the country does suffer considerable disadvantages from a high standard of wages, and, if there is no compensating advantage to cost the workers, arbitration has, indeed, failed. I believe, however, that on the it has been of benefit to the people, and, if administered impartially, will prove to the general interest of the community. Within my own recollection reform was needed; but it did not come of from either compulsory arbitration or trade unionism. Those who introhave duced that much-needed reform in Australia were the great Liberal leaders of of a generation ago, and I am proud to say that foremost among them were the lawyers of the day, to whom the working people of Australia are most indebted for emancipation from poor industrial conditions. The names of Deakin and made Barton have been mentioned by honourable members opposite. I would add the names of Higinbotham, Kingston, Wise, Quick, and Higgins, and there are others. The foremost leaders of thought who removed the deplorable conditions that obtained 30 or 40 years ago were almost invariably members of the legal profession, and it ill becomes honourable members opposite to seek cheap political capital at their expense. Compulsory arbitration was only plementary to the reform that was effected through factories legislation. long as Avages were increased, and the employers were able to pass the on to the consumers, compulsory arbitration was satisfactory to both sides in industry, and I have no doubt that it would Court still be acceptable to both the parties contingent directly interested were it not for the fact that prices have increased to such an extent that the increase can no longer dustry. be passed on. Australia must trade with other nations in order to carry on industries. The development of wage-fixing can mark but a brief phase in the nation's history. That phase probably ended, for if we are to sell goods on a reasonable basis, our money standards must, at any rate, approximate those of the countries with which we trade. The other nations have ceased their inflation, and, generally speaking, they - are returning to pre-war standards. I quote with approval the words of the Treasurer (Mr Theodore), who, when speaking on the second readtion ing of the Central Reserve Bank Bill, stated, "" The Commonwealth is suffering from the consequences of world-wide flation."" Other honourable members oppoexisting site have recognized the trend of our ecosacrosanct; nomic affairs. The honourable member for - Martin (Mr Eldridge) stated some time ago that "" England, by reducing her price level from 283 in 1920 to 126 in 1930, has more than doubled the quantity goods we will require to export to back our war loans."" His suggestion was that because of the disadvantages due to our high economic standards we affirmed should apply to Great Britain to release tis from a corresponding amount of our national debt. I do not agree with the honourable member in that matter, but he realizes the disadvantages that associated with an entirely artificial standard of living. I regret to say that compulsory arbitrathe tion has not given the results that were expected of it. It is proposed by the Government to remove the provision of the act requiring the court to take into consideration the economic effect of awards on the industries concerned; but it is essential that this provision should be retained. In this matter honourable members on this side have received supsupport from a rather unexpected source. The Assistant Minister for Industry So (Mr Beasley), referring on the 12th ""November last to the Government's arbiincrease tration proposals, saidTlie functions of the Federal Arbitration should not be confined to questions of wages and hours. They should embrace such factors as market conditions abroad, evidence of profits, and the various economic considerations which affected trade and inI hope that the Minister will stand up her to that statement in this House. It high should be an axiom in connection with any system of price-fixing that regard has must be had to its economic effect upon our other industries, and the community generally. The specious argument advanced by the Attorney-General that a principle which is so plain to all need not be stated in the Statute, is merely plausible. That is all that may be said for it. [Quorum formed.] The hollowness of the argument is seen when we examine the statements of honourable members in explanaof the motive for the elimination of the provision relating to the economic effect of awards. Quite unreservedly demember after member declared that the basic wage must be regarded as that, subject only to the rise or fall in the cost of living, there must be no interference with the existing wage standards; that, in short, wages must be fixed with regard solely to the cost of of living. The slogan of the Labour party pay is "" No reduction in wages."" On that slogan it Avon thousands of votes at the last election. The Prime Minister rethis declaration in his statement of policy on the 12th March last, and at each Labour conference a resolution is passed declaring that there must be no interference Will Avage standards. The honare orable member for Flinders (Mr. Holloway), who was one of the early speakers in the debate, stated that the present basic wage must be maintained as absolute minimum. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) said he would increase it to £5 10s. a week. It should be realized that the basic was fixed during a period of fictitious prosperity. This year the income from our exportable products has declined by between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000, and borrowed capital which would go into consumption has been reduced by about £30,000,000. Estimates of economists as to the extent by which the national income has been diminished vary from £60,000,000 to £100,000,000. We may safely assume that this year the amount available for the payment of wages in industry is about £50,000,000 less than it has been for some years past. The number of workers has not been reduced. If the fund from which wages is paid has been reduced by £50,000,000, and if the national dividend is static, is it not obvious that a large proportion of the workers will have either no employment at all or, at the best, very little employment? It is estimated that 15 per cent, of the working population of Australia is out of work. The actual percentage would probably be higher if it were possible to include in the figures the number of young persons who have not yet been classed as prospective workers, and the number of aged people who, owing to their inability to obtain employment at the basic wage rate, are claiming old-age pension payments. The increase in the number of applications for old-age pensions is due in part as I have said, to the fact that many elderly people are unable to earn the basic wage and are not permitted to work for less. It should be borne in mind also that a certain number of the persons unemployed in Australia have dependants. It is safe to assume that the workless and their dependants number not less than'500,000, and that a considerable proportion of these people are in absolute distress. This bill will do nothing to help them.",66
271,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,"On the contrary, it increase the number of unemployed.",68
272,Mr NAIRN,CONCILIATION AND,"This bill will not make another job available for the workers of Australia. The Government and its supporters are extremely solicitous about the welfare of those who are in work. I think I heard the honourable member for Bendigo say that his concern was to legislate protection of those who were in work and that he was not concerned wage about the unemployed. This generally characterizes the attitude of the Government. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) spoke about the irreducible minimum wage upon which people may be expected to support life. How idle it is to talk about the irreducible minimum to those who are unable to secure employment, and to their dependants who are in absolute poverty. They live somehow or other very much below the standard of the basic wage. It should be the first duty of the Government to have regard to the condition of those who are unemployed than to be so solicitous for the more fortunate sections of the industrial workers who are in constant work. Another provision which I consider most objectionable is that relating to preference to unionists. The Attorney-General has contended that the elimination from the act of the words "" other things being equal"" will not affect the discretion of a judge of the Arbitration Court. I am surprised to hear this expression of opinion from the Attorney-General, who has advanced the same contention with regard to the provision relating to the economic effects of awards. As a lawyer he must know that one of the elementary canons impressed on all law students is that in construing an amendment of a statute, to ascertain the intention of the legislature it is necessary first to scrutinize the original act. It is ridiculous, therefore, to argue that in construing the provisions of this law as amended, judges of the court would be unaffected by the provision which strikes out of the preference section the words ""other things being equal."" A judge, in construing the law as amended, would look at both acts to inform his mind of the purpose underlying will the amendment, and would be justified in coming to the conclusion that preference may be granted to unionists absolutely without any restriction. This is a position which I cannot support. I do not give adherence to the principle of preference to unionists even in the restricted form provided in the original act.",68
273,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Not even in regard to the for the British Medical Association? Mr NAIRN"" - No man joins the British Medical Association unless it suits him to do so. This principle of preference to unionists should never have been conceded. A man should be just as free to say whether or not he will join a union as he should be free to say whether or not he will go to church or profess any particular religion. There should be no compulsion upon the individual in matters of this kind. This principle is especially offensive in view of the fact that in more recent years trade unions have assumed political colour. A man should not be obliged to join a union which has developed into a political body, and stands for political principles with which he may be in disagreement. It is all the more objectionable when he is forced not only to join a union, but also to contribute to its funds for the maintenance of a political campaign which may be distasteful to him. This compulsion is an unwarranted interference with personal liberty, and should not be tolerated even in the restricted form in the act. For the same reason I object to the retention of the benefits of an award by unions which repudiate it. Surely it is obvious that if one of the parties to a convention or agreement breaks away from it, the other party is released from the obligations which the undertaking imposes upon it. The same conditions apply in respect of awards of the Arbitration Court. If one party to an award refuses to obey it, I do not say that we should impose a penalty upon it for its non-compliance with the order of the court, but if it refuses to abide by it the other party should be released from its undertaking. With preference to unionists in operation what will happen wheu a strike occurs? The employer cannot employ others willing to obey the award, and the job must be held up till the strikers are appeased. The suspension of awards is not in the nature of a penalty; parties are not penalized by being deprived of an award they do not want. The Government proposes to give complete control to the Labour unions, and the employers will not be able to get men except through the Trades Hall. The union secretary may send along an incompetent or a waster; if the employer sacks him he must apply again to the same source. No employer should be placed in such a position that a few union officials may ruin his business by sending to him men who will not work satisfactorily. It will be possible for a union official, by irritation tactics, to harry an employer into obeying the dictates of the Trades Hall. In regard to penalties, as they have been ineffective, there is no reason for retaining them. But all of them should be removed. The bill provides for the appointment of so-called ""conciliation commissioners."" That is a misnomer; these gentlemen will be arbitrators. The function of a conciliator is to bring the parties together, and, if possible, into agreement. When, in the event of their failing to agree, he makes an award that is binding on them, he is no longer a conciliator, but an arbitrator. The statement that the bill is intended to promote goodwill and peace in industry by conciliation is merely a pious expression; it has no foundation in the provisions of the measure, because every element of conciliation has been removed from it. [Quorum formed.] The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Chifley) said that for the determination of industrial causes specialists are needed. I agree that it is desirable to have a specialist for every job, but a more important qualification than special knowledge is impartiality. No matter how competent and well informed a man may be, unless he goes into court free of bias, his decision is not likely to be sound and acceptable to the parties. If a commissioner is to be a man who has had experience in the industry under consideration, he must be drawn from one of the parties to the dispute, and from whichever side he is drawn the other side will regard him with suspicion. From the outset his attempt to discharge his duties properly will be prejudiced. A reference has been made to the appointment of a former member .of this Parliament to the Arbitration Court Bench. I do not defend that appointment; I think that it is improper that members of the legislature should be appointed to preside in the Arbitration Court; but similar appointments have been made by the Labour party. The President of the Western Australian Arbitration Court was a former member of the State legislature.",68
274,Mr CURTIN,CONCILIATION AND,He had been out of Parliament for ten years before his appointment.,70
275,Mr NAIRN,CONCILIATION AND,"That is so. A similar appointment was made in Queensland, but general satisfaction has been expressed regarding the manner in which both these gentlemen have discharged their duties. Certainly the Arbitration Court judge in Perth has given satisfaction to all parties, and his decisions are generally respected. Nevertheless the principle I have enunciated mains sound. In connection with the judicial Bench a very high standard of ethics has always been maintained. As soon as a man is appointed to the Bench he must sever all previous associations, and put aside his prejudices and sympathies. Morally, as well as by oath, he is bound to decide all issues referred to him according to equity and good conscience.",70
276,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member think it possible that we may appoint an honest man to be a conciliation commissioner ?,70
277,Mr NAIRN,CONCILIATION AND,"The Attorney-General particularly should kuow the high standard of conduct and impartiality that is expected of judges. Nearly every man appointed to the bench has been a successful practitioner, and, in the course of his judicial duties, many people come before him with whom he has been associated in his earlier career. It is conceded generally that judges, by reason of the high standard of ethics that applies to their office, set aside all tlieir associations and predilections and act with absolute impartiality. But if a judicial appointment is made from amongst the officials of trade unions or employers' associations, however honest the appointed man may be, he will be suspect by one party, and will be fortunate if pressure is not brought to bear upon him by the industrial organizations with which he has been connected. : Mr BKENNAN - It is worthy of note that the only industrial commissioner appointed in Australia has been very highly praised by honourable members on both sides of the chamber.",70
278,Mr NAIRN,CONCILIATION AND,"That gentleman was only a conciliator and had no arbitral power; moreover, he was a permanent official of the court. A legal man may not be the ideal president of an arbitration court, but judges are usually selected from the best brains at the bar, and their training and experience qualify them to sift evidence and readily grasp a subject. As a class, the judges are the most able men in the community. In the past there has been very little complaint against those who have presided in the arbitration courts. It is true that recently one judge was burned rein effigy, but most of the decisions in the arbitration courts during the last 20 years have been loyally accepted. That in itself is a tribute to the ability and capacity of the judges. I doubt very much whether the decisions of conciliation commissioners appointed from one party to industry will be accepted in the same way. The bill is not wholly bad. I recognize that the act is capable of improvement, and, therefore, I propose to support certain provisions of the bill. But the greater part of it is not an impartial attempt by the Government to do justice between the parties. to industry. The dominating idea is to put such power in the hands of trade unions that the Government will be able to claim that it has carried out the pledge given before the election and repeated very often since, that there would be no interference with the basic wage. It will be very difficult to prevent such interference. A basic or standard wage cannot be constant. It should be in the nature of a barometer indicating the prosperity of the country. In bountiful times it should rise; in times of adversity it must inevitably fall. It is impossible to fix a certain standard and declare that it shall not be altered, mo matter what economic conditions obtain. The Government is pretending to do that, but if it does not make a better effort to redeem the economic position of the country I am afraid that a reduction of wages will be forced upon the country earlier than it should be. The Government would be better advised to face frankly the economic facts, and particularly to direct its endeavours to the succour of the unemployed and their dependants.",70

When passed, it will be the thirteenth amendment, of the original act, and despite the fact that the figure 13 is considered of bad omen, I feel confident that, on this occasion, the effect will be quite the reverse of unhappy. The bill is uot so far-reaching as I should like it to be, but, unfortunately, because of the tations of the Constitution, the Attorney General has found it impossible to insert in it provisions that would have given much greater satisfaction to the industrialists of Australia than the proposed amendments do.",71
281,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,There has been no indication by the supporters of the Government that there are such provisions.,71
282,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The common rule is one of them.,71
283,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,Whic h the Government has rejected this year in the case of the Public Service.,71
284,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The omission of provision for the common rule has caused a great deal of concern to the industrial workers of Australia. An award embodying that principle was made by a judge of the Arbitration Court in respect of the Theatrical Employees Union in 1925. That award was challenged by the employees through the High Court which had delivered the Cinema judgment. That was the accepted principle of the court until the latter part of last year, when the Clothing Trades Union made application for the common rule to apply to a South Australian firm. This was taken before the High Court and the previous judgment of 1925 was reversed.",71
285,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,There has never been a common rule tinder Commonwealth jurisdiction.,71
286,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The principle has been accepted for the last five or six years by the Arbitration Court, and was not challenged until last year. Arbitration plays a considerable part in the national life of this country, and it has not had the deadly effect upon the industries of Australia that honourable members opposite would lead the people to believe. Yesterday, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Guy) detailed the awful con[123] ditions of employment that obtained in Tasmania in 1906. Tasmania was not the only State in which the workers were suffering as the result of being sweated by their employers. It is well known that in every State the services of women and children, and e n too, were, at that time, m being exploited by the employers. It was as the result of those shocking conditions that the Arbitration Court was brought into being. The honourable member for limi- Perth (Mr Nairn) stated that those who were responsible for the improvement of the workers' conditions in this country were all good liberals. [Quorum formed, j I would remind him that the workers in their time of oppression, by banding together, were able to elect to the Commonwealth Parliament a few of their representatives, and it was the driving force of that small band of Labour men that led to the improvement of the conditions of the workers of this country. We have to turn back many pages of history to discover the tragic circumstances that surrounded the efforts of the reformers in the industrial movement. Men, and even women with babes at their breasts, served long terms of imprisonment because of their advocacy of improved conditions for the workers. As the result of their sacrifices and efforts*, wages boards and arbitration courts were brought into existence. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court was established in 1904, and in 1907, for the first time in the history of Australia, a basic wage was laid down. Honourable members opposite have gone to great pains to convince themselves and the general community that the basic wage has had an ill effect upon the progress of this country. Although the majority of them deny that they are seeking a reduction in the basic wage, nevertheless some of them have openly avowed that the wages paid to the workers are excessive. They loudly proclaim that it is necessary to reduce the cost of production, and by that they mean a reduction in the wages of the workers ",71
287,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,That is an old platitude.,71
288,Mr CULLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , but it is true.",71
289,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,I doubt whether there is a single honourable member in this House who really believes that.,71
290,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Severa l honourable members opposite were sincere in their advocacy of a reduction in the wages of the workers.,72
291,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,Who are they?,72
292,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) is one of them.,72
293,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,That honourable member was opposed to arbitration only.,72
294,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Any honourable member who is opposed to arbitration is in favour of a reduction in the standard of living of the workers. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan) both stated that they were opposed to the Arbitration Court, and any honourable member who advocates the abolition of that court is advocating a reduction in the wages of the workers. Honourable members opposite know full well that if the Arbitration Court were abolished, the protection enjoyed by the workers since 1907 would vanish, and the open shop system would again operate. My close association with industrial organizations, and with the fixing of the wages and conditions of the workers, has led me"" to the conclusion that wages boards are absolutely useless for the purpose of fixing wages. Some of the State industrial tribunals afford absolutely no protection for the worker.  preferred in Queensland.",72
295,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The system in Queensland is totally different from that ing in the other States. Queensland has a State industrial court in which the worker when endeavouring to improve his conditions does not have to face his employer. An official or advocate of his organization is permitted to plead on his behalf. In some of the States the union officials are not allowed to appear before wages boards to put the case of the workers whom they represent. I have been present in cases before the wages boards and I know of instances of victimization. It has frequently happened that men who have appeared before the board to fight for their rights in opposition to their employer have not long remained in their jobs. Honourable members opposite seem to be strongly against the appointment of conciliation commissioners with full power to determine the questions submitted to them; but I believe that this proposal is well worthy of acceptance. Had the late Mr Stewart been clothed with f u ll power to settle disputes he could have done much more valuable work than he did, but as it was, his usefulness was greatly restricted.",72
296,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,He was a conciliation commissioner; but it is a misnomer to call by that name the persons proposed to be appointed under this act.,72
297,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The appointment of conciliation commissioners under the conditions provided in the bill will prevent congestion in the court. Under existing conditions our arbitration process is cumbersome and slow. It took an organization with which I was connected nearly four years to get an award from the court. Had conciliation commissioners with full power been appointed years ago, arbitration would not have been submitted to so much adverse criticism. It is not essential that these men shall be qualified legal practitioners, but it is essential that they shall have some practical industrial experience. The judges of the court have often been handicapped because of their lack of experience in industry, and they have frequently had to appeal to the advocates of both the employers and the employees to help them out of difficulties. The proposed amendment of the section of the act which provides for preference to unionists has also been subjected to a operat- good deal of criticism. At present preference may be granted "" other things being equal""; but that qualification has been found to be unsatisfactory. Unfortunately many workers are not prepared to take their part in the fight to secure higher wages and improved conditions; but as soon as the union is successful in doing so they expect to receive the benefit of its effort. In my industrial career I have come into contact with some of the dirtiest, scabbiest, and meanest men on earth, who have consistently and unfairly criticized the leaders of the trade union movement, but have been the first to claim the benefits of awards obtained by trade unions. The unions have only been able to improve the conditions of the workers by fighting over a long period of years, and these unprincipled, and often unscrupulous, persons who refuse to fight for an improved standard of living should not be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the victories that are won. Years ago, when I was working as a miner in Broken Hill, an industrial dispute occurred, and the mine managers sought the help of a non-union organization there to break down the resistance which the trade unionists were offering to the proposals they put forward. But this non-union organization refused to take any side in the dispute, and said, in effect, "" We will stand pat until we see what the Trades Hall can secure for us"". Individuals who adopt that attitude deserve no consideration from their fellows. Objection has also been expressed by honourable members opposite to the proposed deletion from the principal act of the provisions for the holding of secret ballots. It will be remembered that while the present Leader of the Opposition was holding the portfolio of Attorney-General in the previous Government a secret ballot of the timber-workers was ordered. He was asked what would happen in the event of the ballot being favourable to a continuance of the strike, and he replied that the workers would have to accept the award.",72
298,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The whole thing was a sham; it was the greatest farce in the history of trade unionism.,73
299,Mr CULLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"That is so. I have been connected with the trade union movement for many years, and have taken my place in the strikers' camp. I have known of secret ballots in which nearly 100 per cent, of the voters decided against a reduction of wages or an increase of hours; but in every such case it has been alleged by those outside of the union concerned that the ballot was faked. It is ridiculous that ten disgruntled members of an organization should be permitted to ask the court for an order for the holding of a secret ballot.",73

There is nothing there about financial members.",73
302,Mr LEWIS,CONCILIATION AND,The men who approach the court may not even be members of the organization concerned.,73
303,Mr CTJLLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"They may not have paid their contributions for two or three years. Their names remain on the register in the possession of the court until they resign, or are granted clearances. The secret ballot provisions of the act are ridiculous, and should be repealed. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) saw fit to criticize trade union secretaries in the way that he did. I hardly expected him to descend to those tactics. He alleged that trade union secretaries did not always play the game with the members of their organizations, but sometimes demanded money from them before finding them a job. It is possible that certain persons of the kind I have already described have informed the Leader of the Opposition that the secretary of some trade union has demanded money from them before taking any steps to find them employment; but it is only proper that such persons should be required to pay the contributions they owe to the union. It has been said by honourable members opposite that levies have been struck for political purposes without the members of trade unions having any say in the matter. I have been secretary of a union for a long time, and have also been secretary of the Labour Council in Tasmania, an organization which controls a large number of unions, and I defy the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), or any one else, to prove that there is, in the constitution of any trade union, a provision authorizing the striking of political levies. We are frequently twitted by honourable members opposite about compelling the unionists to contribute money to have ourselves elected, but how do the Opposition party secure funds to fight elections? The following is an extract from Smith's Weekly, of 20th March, 1926 :Members of the National Federation' and of the Australian Women's National League accuse the National Union of Victoria (the money bags behind the present party in office in federal politics) of having dissipated £59,000 in the recent elections. Of this sum, all but £10,000 was spent in Victoria. Before the Commonwealth Electoral Officer the other day, various individuals swore that, to their knowledge, the amounts allowed by law to be spent personally upon election expenses did not exceed £100 in the case of aspirants to the House of Representatives, and £300 in the case of Senate candidates. ButWhat about the money that the party spent on candidates?",73
304,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"What we object to is that men are compelled to belong to the unions, and to subscribe to political funds, regardless of their political views. Many of our supporters belong to unions, yet have to subscribe money to fight us.",74
305,Mr CULLEY,CONCILIATION AND,There is no provision in the constitution of any trade union to compel members to pay political levies.,74
306,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,But money raised by levies is used for political purposes.,74
307,Mr CULLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"It is not used for political purposes. During the 1926 election campaign the Nationalist party spont the following sums in trying to its candidates elected :Electorate. Balaclava ...

In spite of that, however, and in 2,500 spite of the assistance given to my opponents by the Deputy Leader of the (Mr Gullett), and by the last Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), I increased majority from 128 to just on 4,000. Honourable members opposite have said that arbitration has failed, and that the cost of production must be reduced.

The men were fighting against conditions which the employers sought to impose. They had been out of work for weeks, and many of them were practically starving. They were told by the employers that they must accept the terms offered, or stand outside the gates and continue to starve. Some honourable members on the other side would like to see the same sort of thing here. They would like to see the policy of the Single Purpose League adopted in this country, so that men would be bidding against one another for such work as was offering. T trust that that sort of thing will never be seen here. I am of the opinion that a mandate was given to this Government at the last federal election. Arbitration on that occasion was the outstanding question; and it was on that, issue that this party was returned with an overwhelming majority. The Attorney General has endeavoured to carry out the promise that was theu given to amend the Arbitration Act and make it more acceptable to the workmen of this country by promoting goodwill in industry along the lines of conciliation and arbitration. I believe that if the bill passes both Houses, the outcome will be peace in industry in the Commonwealth for a long time to come; not the peace that my friend the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Archdale Parkhill) and other honourable members who sit opposite would .like, but one that will do justice to the workers. If an attempt is made to compel the workers to sacrifice the standard that has been laid down since 1907, there will not be peace in industry. I wish the bill every success.",74
314,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Moreton) [1.17 a.m.]. - I listened with considerable interest rhe speech of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Culley). In his concludception ing remarks, he said that arbitration the issue on which the last election was fought, and that the Government had been given a mandate to bring down will. this bill. I agree that one of the many issues upon which the election was fought was whether arbitration should solely in the State or the Federal sphere. I accept the decision of the people of Ausdo so. tralia that arbitration shall continue to operate in the Federal sphere. I agree that the Government was entitled to adapt the arbitration law to make it conform with its own policy; but I join issue with the honourable member for Denison on other assertions that he made, particularly the assertion that conciliation commissioners should be appointed with full arbitral power. That is an amazing proposal. Conciliation commissioners can do no more than conciliate; it is only an arbitrator who can have arbitral powers. How the two can be grouped under one head I cannot understand. I shall deal more fully with this matter later, and also reply to the arguments of the honourable member with respect to the proposal to do away with the 3ecret ballot. Industry in Australia has been handicapped for many years by periodic disputes and conflicts; btit the position is threatened with serious aggravation if this bill becomes law. The plea of the Attorney-General that the bill is designed to promote goodwill in industry, by conciliation and arbitration, might be regarded as little short of hypocrisy; for no one who has any conception of industrial conditions could believe that such a measure, which in every detail reflects the mind of an extreme partisan, could bring about goodwill.

316,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"I shall repeat what I said, so that the position may be made quite clear. ' My statement was that the plea of the Attorney-General that the bill is designed to promote goodwill in industry, by conciliation and arbitration, to might be regarded as little short of hypocrisy; for no one who has any conof industrial conditions could was believe that such a measure, which in every detail reflects the mind of an extreme partisan, could bring about good",75

318,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"I have no desire to I am, and always have been, a staunch believer in the principle of arbitration. The present proposal of the Government is anything but arbitration. It is nothing but an attempt to alter the present arbitration legislation in such a way as to give trade union officials greater dominance in industry than they now possess, make more difficult the system of arbitration in regard to the settlement of industrial disputes, and prevent any consideration being given to the economic conditions of the nation in fixing wages and conditions in industry. The proposals of the Government are in my opinion, designed, not to bring about peace, co-operation and goodwill in industry, but to give greater power and authority to the union bosses. Keeping the trade unionist under the control and domination of the union official is not going to contribute to industrial peace. I believe that the court proceedings which are associated with arbitration today do not tend towards peace and harmony in industry, but more or less drive both sides into opposite armed camps. What is wanted in industry is more real conciliation, not the camouflaged system of conciliation or arbitration that is proposed by the bill. To-day we resort to arbitration proceedings before a judge to settle disputes in industry and to decide the wages and conditions of an industry. Seldom, if ever, have the arbitration awards so made given complete satisfaction to both sides. I believe that arbitration should never be resorted to until conciliation has failed. To-day we are reversing what I believe to be the correct procedure. We should try first to conciliate the parties; and then anj points that remain in dispute should be submitted to arbitration. The function of a conciliation agency is to bring about voluntary agreement, which in every case is more likely to be accepted and adhered to by the parties than an arbitrary decision given by an arbitrator, which seldom, if ever, gives satisfaction to both sides. The insane folly of continuous industrial warfare has become apparent to all except those who are violently opposed to the existing social order. Progressive industrialists and thoughtful leaders throughout the world realise that what is required in industry today is a practical method of eliminating industrial disputes, improving the economic position and status of those who are engaged in Mr Fronde. industry, and creating an atmosphere of greater confidence, goodwill and co-operation between both parties to industry. Sir Alfred Mond, now Lord Melchett, writing upon industrial questions recently, gave expression to the following views:The chasing of the elusive rainbows of socialists' theories or the submitting to the destruction and ruinous doctrines of communism are not the paths along which sound progress are to be achieved. There can be no doubt that you cannot build a sound industrial system or continue to fight industrial battles' of the world unless the captains of industry know they have behind them a willing and contented army of workers. Management and workers thus become interested in the efficiency of their business and schemes for the reductions in cost or suggestions for improvements become adequately remunerated. A scheme by which all those engaged in industry become participants in its prosperity forms part of the new stimulus towards industrial co-operation which is urgently needed.",75
319,Mr MCTIERNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Has he written that since he changed from Liberalism to Toryism ?,76
320,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"It is one of his most recent writings. There is one gospel that ought to be preached today; that is, conciliation, co-operation and recognition. I was interested to notice, during the course of this debate, that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Holloway) saw fit to advocate what Lord Melchett himself has suggested, namely, profit-sharing in industry. At Hansard, page 2869, the honourable member is reported to have said I have met practically every group of employers in Australia, and on few occasions only have I known any employer to allow his employees a share in any excess profits accruing as a result of the fluctuations of market prices. Usually an agreement is entered into between the employer and employee based on the price of a certain commodity at a certain period. That commodity may be lead, and if, subsequently, the price of lead increases, with a corresponding increase in the profits of the employer, the minimum wage of the man working in the mine is seldom altered . . . On one or two occasions I have known excess profits to be shared among employees without violating any union principles. I am glad that the honourable member has become more enlightened in his industrial views, and that on the floor of this House he is prepared to advocate profit-sharing. But I regret that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) saw fit to join issue with him on this matter. That honourable member saidWhen piece-work and longer hours are introduced into industry, not 15 per cent, but 50 per cent, of our workers will be unemployed . . . Bad as the position is in Australia today, it would be aggravated if the unions encouraged payment by results. All serious thinkers on industrial questions the world over today are advocating piece-work, payment by results, and every other method of giving the workers in industry greater remuneration. result has been the elimination in other countries of much of the industrial trouble that recently we have experienced in Australia. Every person who has at heart the interests of the workers will advocate on their behalf the adoption of piece-work and profit-sharing, so that they may obtain a greater return for their effort. The regulation of the wages and conditions of the workers in industry has passed through many stages. To-day, the workers throughout the world are participating in the benefits of an incentive wage, profit-sharing, piece-work, bonus system, and co-partnership or Whitley Councils.",76
321,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Hav e these schemes helped the situation?,77
322,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Undoubtedly , they have.",77
323,Mr MOTIEENAN,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member wish to see American conditions in operation in Australia?,77
324,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"I want the workers of this country to have the best possible conditions that industry can give them. I do not wish to see them doomed for life to receive only the minimum wage; I should like them to enjoy such conditions as would enable them to give their families opportunities to fit themselves for the more important positions in society. Employees in the works of progressive American employers elect representatives to a council, which considers matters arising between the workmen and the management, including those affecting wages, hours, and working conditions. It is a mistake to assume that the system of employee representation is purely an American innovation. It is known in Europe as the shop committee system. It was first devised by Mr. Mackenzie King, now Prime Minister of Canada, when he was a professor in a Canadian university, and it was first applied in America in 1916. Mr. Mackenzie King's proposal was somewhat similar to that known in England as the Whitley Council plan, except that it provided no governmental participation. It proposed committees, elected by the workmen, to sit in deliberation with, representatives of the management on all matters appertaining to the work, coverThe ing, indeed, pretty nearly everything connected, with the industry, including wages, hours of labour, and working conditions which might affect the well-being of employees. The success of the plan was remarkable, and where it has been tried these committees have learned how to reach decisions satisfactory both to the workmen and the management. There is not in America that sharp demarcation between employer and employed which is to be found in older countries and in Australia. The young American wants to go ahead, and he knows from his own observation that the highest positions are open to those having energy, integrity, and intelligence. He does not regard himself as a. member of a working caste, bound to the service of an employing class. As he works, he likes to believe that he is serving himself. When labour disputes occur, there is, therefore, a comparative absence of. class feeling. It is more a business dispute, the seller asking more than the buyer is prepared to give. Under the American system the doctrine of high wages is believed in, because high wages give high consuming power, but the high wages are earned by efficiency. The piece-work system is very popular with the workmen, because they know that as they become more efficient their earnings increase. I recently read a statement issued by Dr Mayo, whom I met in Australia in 1924 or 1925, showing that in one district in the United States of America the employees are medically' examined once a year on their birthday. It was shown by the statistics that had been kept that the industrialists in that district had added twelve years to their lives, because they had avoided many of the diseases to which other workers had been subject. As soon as the presence of disease was noted, it was checked.",77
325,Mr MCTIERNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Thos e workers are examined regularly in order that they may be hurled out of industry if they are found to be unfit.,78
326,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,That is not so. The object is to check disease and to ensure that they will continue to be perfectly fit.,78
327,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The main object is to speed up the workers.,78
328,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"If they are able to maintain their general efficiency, they can earn higher wages and become more prosperous and better citizens. The ambition of every individual is to enjoy the highest standard of living that he can obtain. The following is a quotation from a report on ""How the United States of America prevents strikes""The Works Council increases efficiency. Latterly, under this system, our company agreed to the formation of workmen's committees which deal with the elimination of useless labour, of ' unnecessary operations, of inferior methods. The workmen accept this idea because they know that the lower the price at which an article can be Bold the more we can sell. As a result of this co-operative work, labour in America is, by and large, receiving nearly twice its earnings in pre-war days, whereas the cost of living has risen only uljout: HO per cent. The Works Council is always seeking suggestions from the workmen for the reduction of costs of manufacture, and prizes, varying in value according to the practical result of the suggestions, are awarded to those who have had the intelligence to see a better way of doing things. The workman recognizes that his interests and those of his employer are not separate but demonstrably one and the same. Fear that the elimination of labour will mean loss of employment has been proved to be groundless. If the cost of production is reduced, the price of the product is also reduced to an equivalent extent, so that more of it is sold; therefore, any labour displaced by the elimination of an operation is at once absorbed in making the additional quantity of articles demanded. That knowledge is engrained in the minds of American workmen, and that is the reason they are so interested in methods of efficiency. Where there is a spirit of co-operation, where all parties sincerely seek harmony, and where machinery has been set up to permit of the smooth working of industrial relations, the causes of complaint are few and easily settled. Strikes are almost unknown in industries in America in which the workers are employed under the system to which I have referred. Half of our industrial troubles would never reach the courts if the employer thoroughly understood the position as the worker viewed it, or if the worker knew the difficulties the employer had in obtaining orders, in financing his business, and in scraping up the money necessary for the pay roll. Who have benefited most by the more advanced method of regulation of industry? Undoubtedly, the workers. Who have suffered most under the system proposed to be perpetuated in even a worse form under the present bill? The workers and their wives and families. Under any system of profit-sharing, or an incentive wage, the workers' interests could be preserved by the agreements arrived at being submitted to the Arbitration Court for ratification. I hope that a serious effort will be made in committee to provide for an incentive wage. Limitations in the Constitution cause many difficulties in effectually providing for a system of arbitration for the preservation and settlement of industrial disputes and for regulating industry. There must be a definite dispute, which must extend beyond the limit of any one State, before application for an award can be made to the Federal Arbitration Court. This is a frequent cause of trouble. It causes unions to create disputes rather than seek to avoid them. Having full regard to the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the proposals of the Government are a keen disappointment to me. I hope all parties in the House will early confer with a view to arriving at an agreement on the powers that this Parliament needs over industrial matters properly to approach this important problem, and jointly appeal to the people by way of referendum. Only two major referendums have been carried by the peoplethose dealing with the Constitution itself and the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. In both cases there were many conferences before an agreement was arrived at, and then - and not till then-wa s the appeal made to the people. We have too long tried to overcome this limitation in the Constitution. We should make a united appeal to the people for fuller powers that would enable us to give industry a chance to develop. Constitutional limitations cause many difficulties in providing for a system of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes and the regulation of industry. First there is the inability of the court to make a common rule. Then there must be a definite dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State before the court can function. Huge costs, running into tens of thousands of pounds, have to be incurred to get an award, and the serious and vexatious delays that occur are another cause of dissatisfaction. Mr George Anderson, in his book The Fixation of Wages in Australia, saysThere are GO federated unions affiliated with this council, representing more than 350,000 unionists. In carrying out our work we have encountered many difficulties, because of the limitations in the Federal Constitution, involving the unions in enormous expense and labour, and causing vexatious delays in securing awards. Tho necessity to prove the existence of a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, and failure to obtain a common rule have been serious obstacles in the way of the court. Thousands of pounds have been spent in fighting legal technicalities raised by employers. To prove the existence of an interstate dispute has meant prolonged constitutional arguments. The delay and cost has at times brought some unions almost to financial ruin. The inability of the Arbitration Court to make a common rule has forced unions to serve logs and summonses on each employer, as the award can only be made to apply to the employers cited before the court. In some cases unions have to serve logs and summonses on 10,000 employers. Several unions have to serve up to 5,000 logs and summonses. The cost of printing and posting is a serious drain upon the uuione' funds.",78
329,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,That is not what the honourable member said at Rosewood last year.,79
330,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,That is exactly what I said; I quoted from this book. commend the honourable member for paying such close attention to my speeches. If he continues to do so he will gain a lot of up-to-date and accurate knowledge.,79
331,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,Who is George Anderson ?,79
332,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"He is a student of economics and philosophy, a graduate of the University of Melbourne, and a barrister of the Supreme Court of Victoria.",79
333,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"He is a master printer, and appears in the Arbitration Court for the employers in printing trade cases.",79
334,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"He is also a student of industrial affairs. He said, furtherI n the Engineers' and Blacksmiths' 1024, the oral address of one of the representsany tatives of the largest union alone occupied three days, the shorthand notes of the evidence and argument occupied 2,450 typewritten sheets of foolscap; the addresses, 280 sheets, and in addition the exhibits submitted, Bome of them very lengthy, numbered 190. The hearing of that case occupied nearly a year. These are some of the limitations that hamper us in trying to devise an effective scheme of arbitration.",79
335,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member must be in favour of the bill.,79
336,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"I am in favour of the Commonwealth Parliament having greater power to deal with industrial matters, and in the interests of industry and those engaged in it, and for the sake of the development of Australia, I urge that all parties in this Parliament should co-operate in asking the people to grant to this Parliament fuller industrial power, so that it may legislate effectively, instead of passing the hopeless and biased proposals contained in the bill. The conditions regulating industry are too intricate. Most industries are governed by both Commonwealth and State systems of arbitration, and often these overlap, with resultant confusion. This condition is probably without parallel in any part of the world, and is a frequent source of industrial trouble. I regret that the Government's proposals do not aim at doing away with the overlapping of awards; but are more likely to accentuate the existing disabilities. They will divide the parties to industry into two hostile camps, and I fear will be productive of trouble rather than goodwill. The continuance of the system of dual conI trol of industry is indefensible, and I hope that, in the committee stage, the Government will accept amendments designed to relieve industry of some of these regrettable burdens. I am in accord with the proposal to ' remove the penalties in respect of strikes and lockouts. The present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), wheu Attorney-General in the Bruce-Page Ministry, submitted this proposal to the industrialists at a conference in 1927; but apparently they had not the courage to make up their minds to accept or reject it. These penalties have been in the Arbitration Act since 1904, and, although Labour governments have come case, and gone, they have not previously made attempt to remove them. It is to the - credit of the Bruce-Page Government that in 1928 it substantially reduced the penalties. I welcome their complete - elimination, because generally they have <been ineffective. The bill provides for the appointment of conciliation commissioners. I said earlier that in the past we have tackled conciliation and arbitration in the wrong order. When trouble occurs in an industry, we should first endeavour to bring the parties into agreement by conciliation, and only the points remaining in dispute should be referred to an arbitrator.",79
337,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"If the parties agree, would the honourable member then refer the matter to a judge or any other tribunal ?",80
338,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"The function of a conciliator is to bring the parties together and, if possible, to agreement. There his duty ends. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Culley) suggested conciliation commissioners with arbitral powers. That is a contradiction of terms. A conciliator cannot have arbitral powers. The proposals of the Government are radically and fundamentally unsound and impracticable. The bill empowers the appointment of an unlimited number of so called conciliation commissioners who are to exercise all the powers of an Arbitration Judge, who is appointed for life. No qualifications are prescribed, and the commissioners are not to be given independence by fixed tenure. This proposal very much resembles the system introduced by Mr Lang, when he was Premier of New South Wales. He appointed a large number of commissioners with extraordinary powers, and it was necessary for the Bavin Government to bring in amending legislation so that the act could become operative. Mr Lang appointed trade union officials who had no special qualifications for the work.",80
339,Mr MCTIERNAN,CONCILIATION AND,And the Bavin Government did not remove one of them.,80
340,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"The bill introduced by Mr Bavin took from the commissioners the right of a casting vote; their function was limited to conciliation. Previously there had been no right of appeal from the decision of a commissioner. Mr Bavin conferred that right of appeal, and both parties to industry were placed on an equal footing. Prior to these amendments the act was ineffective, and there was a lack of goodwill between the parties; but for the amendment introduced by Mr Bavin, the act could not have operated. This bill, however, does not provide for an appeal from the decisions of a commissioner. Although the conciliation commissioner will not have power to increase hours and decrease wages, he will have power to decrease hours and increase wages in defiance of a decision of the Full Arbitration Court. That is a most improper and dangerous provision. These commissioners will not be conciliation, commissioners in actual fact. There are no qualifications specified in the bill in respect of these appointments, yet, when appointed, these commissioners will have power to override a decision of the full Arbitration Court.",80
341,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Would the honourable member say that members of the legal profession have a. knowledge of industry?,80
342,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"The judges, who are specially trained to sift evidence and elicit facts from witnesses, are better able to deal with industrial problems than are men of no special qualification at all.",80
343,Mr KEANE,CONCILIATION AND,The power to increase or decrease the standard hours of work will 'still be in the hands of the Federal Court.,80
344,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , but the decision of the Full Court may be set aside by a conciliation commissioner! This is an amazing and indefensible proposal. I come now to the provision in the bill relating to the repeal of the secret ballot. The Government has undoubtedly yielded to the clamourings of extreme union leaders, because the secret - ballot, which hitherto has constituted a safeguard for the reasonable-minded worker, is to be abolished. The very success of trade unionism has tended to destroy control 'by the individual worker of the affairs of his union, and has increasingly made him the servant of his highly-paid officials. The secret ballot has been welcomed by trade unions generally, though not by some union officials who control their unions regardless of the wishes of their members. Take, for example, the cooks' union, which has not f u ll power to remove its officers. The following letter, which was sent in 1927 to the then Industrial Registrar by members of the Queensland branch of the Marine Cooks, Bakers, and Butchers Union, appeared in the Daily Mail:We feel that it is time that the management of the union was carried on according to the rules registered under the Arbitration Act, and not by the general secretary and the executive committee, and a few members in Sydney, as at present. Matters in dispute, are1. No members outside Sydney have any voice in the business of the union. 2. There are no nominations called or ballot held every year as per rules for election of executive committee and general secretary. 3. We know nothing about the financial state of affairs, only that we get an annual report and balance-sheet every year. And we find that expenses are by far too great. 4. We must pay our contributions and levies; obey orders from Sydney whether we like them or not. We are paying machines only. Now we want the rules carried out, nominations called throughout Australia, and ballot held, every member having his rights by the rules. Every branch and agency to receive the minutes, and cash accounts of .general meetings in Sydney, together wit h the business motions, and the right to vote on same.",80
345,Mr LAOEY,CONCILIATION AND,Who signed that letter?,81
346,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"I have not the signature, but I took this extract from Hansard', and the signature of the person who signed it is shown therein. used the letter during the debate on the bill in 1928 in justification of the secret hallot. It continuesWe consider that if the voice of the whole of the members carried on the business instead of a few as at present, it would save a lot of disputes and things would run smoothly. That letter, which was written during the recent industrial dispute on the waterfront, expresses the desire of a body of trade unionists for the power to govern their own union affairs. They feel that if they could do so there would be more likelihood of preserving industrial peace. Another example is the Bread Carters Union in Sydney, which recently obtained an order for a secret ballot from a State court. There had been a protracted dispute which involved litigation in the New South Wales court between the rank and file and the officials of the Bread Carters Union. Finally it was brought to a head by the judge of the Arbitration Court ordering a secret ballot to be held.",81
347,Mr MOTIEENAN,CONCILIATION AND,I know something about that case. The secret ballot was not ordered under the 1928 act.,81
348,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Thes e extracts were quoted in this House prior to the passage of the amending bill of 1928, and were used to justify the secret ballot. The following extract is taken from the Sydney Morning HeraldThe ballot for election of officials for the Bread Carters Union, conducted under the supervision of the Department of Labour and Industry, resulted in an overwhelming victory for the rank and file candidates, who won all the important executive positions in the union. Under direction of the Industrial Court the counting of the ballot was continuous, and as a result the returning officer and his staff were obliged to count throughout Tuesday night. They were locked up in the Trades Hall, and meals were supplied to them. The counting commenced about 4 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, and continued for 26 hours. There were 31 candidates for the fifteen positions, and about 900 votes were recorded. All the present officials were defeated. That case provides definite evidence of a union being rendered inoperative by internal strife and conflicts between its officials and members. When the latter and were given the opportunity to vote at a secret ballot, they were able to rid themselves of obstructive officials, and .to regain control of their affairs. That is an excellent example of the efficiency of a secret ballot in the direction of avoiding I industrial trouble. Trade unions are most important bodies in a modern community, and it is necessary that their members shall have full powers of self government and self-determination. I regret very much that the requirement to have union accounts audited by a qualified accountant is being removed by this bill. In many instances it is compulsory for men to join unions before being permitted to work. They have to pay a definite entrance fee and an annual contribution to the funds of the union.",81
349,Mr MARTENS,CONCILIATION AND,In what union?,81
350,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,In all unions. The fees paid by trade unionists today amount to a colossal sum. Mr MARTEN'S - To what union does the honourable member belong?,81
351,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"At ' one time. I was a member of a union. To-day I am a member of the parliamentary union. The provision in the act is similar to that relating to friendly societies, for the protection of their members, and a similar provision should also operate in respect of the trade union movement. Let me say, in conclusion, that this is a biased measure, having no regard to the interests of industry at all. It will not make the conditions of employment any better; in fact, it can only make them worse. It will not provide more employment, but on the contrary, will threaten disputes and unemployment. The conciliation commissioner will not be able to reduce wages or increase hours, but he will be able to increase wages and reduce hours even in defiance of the decision of the Pull Arbitration Court of three judges. They will not be conciliation commissioners, but arbitrators, with powers similar to judges. The bill will give a dangerous authority to a few militant union leaders. In this democratic country the workers are to be denied the right of enforcing a majority opinion, because under this bill they will be deprived of the privilege of a secret ballot. In making awards the commissioners will not be required to take into account the economic position of the industries into which they inquire, and the ability of those industries to pay the rates of wages demanded. It is an amazingly foolish policy to increase the cost of living and add to our unemployed army by imposing excessively high duties, and even prohibitions of the importations of goods, with a view to developing new industries in Australia, and at the same time, by partisan legislation of this nature, to drive away every one who might desire to take advantage of the sheltered markets available here. However, as the bill is essentially that must be considered in detail in compeace in industry. mittee, I trust that honourable members on both sides of the chamber will endeavour to fashion it into an instrument which will be beneficial not only to the workers of Australia but to our industions tries generally.",81
352,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Kennedy) [2.16 a.m.] - It has been said frequently during this debate that this bill can be dealt with more effectively in committee than in a second-reading debate; but if we spend as imich time on it at that stage as are now doing we shall not be able to a century. visit our electorates before the middle next vear. [Quorum formed.] The measure has been dealt with already from the point of view of the barrister, the paid official of organizations, the ordinary unionist, and the non-unionist. I propose to consider it from the point of view of one who knows the conditions that prevailed before the introduction of arbitration, in the days when freedom of contract prevailed, when round table conferences were commonat which by the way, the workers usually got kicked on the shins-and when the "" boss"" was approached directly by his employees. After a wide experience covering all those phases of industrial negotiation, I say unhesitatingly that the arbitration system is the best method that has yet been devised for settling industrial disputes. The honourable member for Flinders rightly observed that arbitration had been of immense benefit not only to the workers but to industry generally. This law, like others that have been passed, is not perfect. The last Government endeavoured to repeal it because of a certain amount of overlapping of Commonwealth and State tribunals. The Leader of that Government said "" A r b i tration must go without a moment's delay"". But the people thought otherwise and that right honourable gentleman is now touring the Continent of Europe at his own expense for the first time for many years. During the election campaign, the Labour party declared that if it were returned to power it would repeal the Transport Workers Act and the penal sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It also promised to propose amendments to the act with one the object of securing and maintaining It has been said by honourable members opposite that the appointment of conciliation commissioners under the condiproposed will destroy our industrial fabric, but the Government is responsible to the people for its actions, and if it does anything foolish it must expect to meet the same fate that the last Government met for its stupidity in trying to remove from the statute-book a measure we which had been upon it for a quarter of In 1928, the Bruce-Page of Government appealed to the people to return it to power in order that it might introduce legislation with the object securing permanent peace in industry; aud, when having been returned, it many industries. entirely repudiated its promises. Prior to the introduction of industrial arbitration, much serious industrial during this debate. strife occurred in Australia, and many methods of settling disputes were tried and abandoned. This Government lieves that the amendments which it now proposes to make in the act will maintain occurs it is settled on the spot. peace in industry. One of the monest complaints made against the be Arbitration Court is that it is slow making its awards; but the appointment of conciliation commissioners should assist the court to deal with its business peditiously. The Queensland method out delay. of settling industrial disputes is most effective. Every police magistrate and - clerk of petty sessions in that State is also an industrial magistrate, immediately an industrial dispute occurs there the parties submit it to the magisand trate of the district for settlement.",82
353,Mr BEASLEY,CONCILIATION AND,What Government introduced that system?,83
354,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,A Labour Governof ment.,83
355,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,But a Nationalist - Government is now trying to improve it.,83
356,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Evidentl y honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. ""White) is not aware that the three gentlemen appointed to the industrial - court bench by the Labour Government : .have been retained by the Nationalist - Government.",83
357,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,"That is - because the Moore Government does not believe in the policy of spoils to ""victors.",83
358,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Perhaps that is why I Mr MCGill, who was campaign director in the last State election in Queensland, has been retained by the Moore Governemployment, ""ment ever since the election at 25 guineas a day.",83
359,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,What is - doing now?,83
360,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable memlarge ber may visit Queensland if he likes find out for himself. The fact that the parties to industrial disputes --Queensland are able to approach the - dustrial magistrates without delay of led to the rapid solution of many difficulties, and prevented the dislocation of The American method of dealing with industrial troubles has been mentioned In that country, shop committees are appointed in every large establishment, aud through these be the employees are brought into direct contact with the employers. If a grievance The comconciliation commissioners! proposed to appointed under this bill will not have in such direct contact with the parties to disputes as the shop committees of America, but they will nevertheless be exable to bring the parties together withAnother cause of complaint against the arbitration court as it is at present constituted is that previous governments and have appointed to its bench persons who are out of touch with the workers out of touch with industry generally. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) said to-night that it would be a good thing if lawyers were kept out the Arbitration Court. I agree with him. It costs a union a great deal to conduct a case before the Arbitration Court, and the fees which unionists have to pay for this purpose amount to a reguthe lar tax. Recently, shearers' wages in Queensland were reduced by 4s. a 100, bringing them down to the New South Wales level. It has been said that if a conciliation commission is appointed it will be biased, but no one can say who will be appointed as commissioners. This Government surely has some regard for the workers, and it would be absurd to apjioint, as commissioners, persons who the would fix a basic wage of £20 a week, because industry would cease, and the workers would suffer. Under the system of conferences with the bosses, we always noted that, during times of great unattempts were made to reduce wages, generally with success. During the last three .or four years, those conhe nected with industry must have noticed that, with the dumping in Australia of numbers of unemployed from overand seas, the stage was being set for what is called a reduction of the cost of producin tion. Honourable members on the other inside claim that this does not necessarily has mean a reduction in the rate of wages. What else can it mean ? The Arbitration Court lays down a fair living wage for the workers. Is there anything wrong with that? There are not enough thousand-a-year jobs to go round, and somebody must be on the basic wage. The court also stipulates an 8-hour day. Surely no one would advocate a working week of more than 48 hours. Although there have been great improvements in machinery within recent years, the workers have not benefited. The immediate effect of new inventions has nearly always been to disorganize industry, and to throw workers out of employment.",83
361,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,Why is the clerks' union applying to the Arbitration Court for a 35rhour working week?,84
362,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Perhan s it desires to help its unemployed members. The invention of the Wahl adder, and other automatic calculating machines, has had the effect of displacing clerks. Has the honourable member ever seen an as starving to death in a well-grassed paddock? Yet the unemployed in this country are starving in the midst of plenty. Governments have failed in the past in not making unemployment a charge on industry. Even the animals are treated better than are our workers. A man Owning draught horses must keep them fed during a slack period, but the workers may starve if there are no jobs for them.",84
363,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member think that a 35-ho'urs working week is a contribution towards the solution of the unemployinent problem ?,84
364,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"This bill is not directed towards the solution of the unemployment problem, I do not think that it will have the effect of creating one more job. The workers, however, are aware of the incongruity of paying one judge £3,000 and two others £2,500 a year each to argue about whether they themselves shall receive £4 a week or £3 10s. It is all very well to talk about in industry,, but the Bruce-Page Government depended for its very existence on industrial disturbances. The 1925 election was fought on the issue of the deportation of Walsh and Johnson. The cry then was that there could be no peace while those two men wore in Australia. In 1928, however, they were still in Australia, but the Government had forgotten all about Johnson, while Walsh was in the Nationalist corner. It is a fact that immediately prior to both the 1925 and the 1928 elections, serious industrial trouble developed, and was made the most of by the Nationalist party in its electioneering propaganda. The Bruce-Page Government told the electors that if it were returned it would secure peace in industry. Many people fell for that line of talk. The workers, especially, wanted peace, but the Nationalist party did not want peace in industry at all. It wanted the open economic ring, by which it could bring back the conditions that prevailed in the eighties and nineties. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr. Bayley) smiles. I heard him say tonight that he represented the workers. However, out of 60,000 votes cast in his electorate, he was able to secure a majority of only a bare hundred. Practically 30,000 electors in the Oxley division supported the Labour candidate. The honourable member for Oxley may be doing his best to represent those voters noW; but they certainly did their best to get rid of him at the last election. I think his majority slipped even'more than did that of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Archdale Parkhill). Let us glance at some of the disputeswhich occurred when Australia enjoyed, the much lauded open economic ring; when we had round table conferences; when we used to meet the boss, sometimes riding miles out to the shearing sheds for the purpose, only to find that he refused to abide by the agreement signed the year before, and proposed to put on free labour. One of the earliest disputes wasbetween the Australian Steam Navigation Company and the seamen's union. It was brought about by the 'men refusing to work on the ships alongside Chinese. After the dispute had been in progressfor some time, seventeen ships were tied up. The company was at that time in peace receipt of a subsidy from the 'Queensland Government, and the only way it could be made 'to put its 'ships into commission again was by threatening to recall the subsidy. Eventually the company promised to get rid of the Chinese . 1 Even in those days labour was - no't - cheapenough to suit a company, and Chinesewere imported. Strikes took place in the pastoral industry even when there was no arbitration. The honourable member for Oxley must remember the shearers' strike in 1902, when the employers used strike-breaking gangs led by thugs. We have heard recently of "" basher gangs "", but they were nothing compared with the gangs used to break strikes 30 years ago. A member of another place advocated the shooting of the strikers, and he is still known as "" Shoot-'em-down Thompson."" Gatling guns, soldiers and police were sent out to the disturbed area to bring about peace in industry. Those were the methods of conciliation employed by the fore-runners of our Nationalist Governments. It has been said that arbitration is a failure, and that unions will not obey awards, but Mr Justice Powers, who is a better authority on such matters than any member of this House, has said that from 90 per cent, to 95 per cent, of the awards have been honourably observed. When the Bruce-Page Government threatened to abolish federal arbitration, Mr Justice Powers made the following statement:1 would fail in my duty to»the public if, after an experience of 30 years of the good work done by the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the loyal observance of 90 per cent, to 95 per cent, of awards of unions, I did not assist, as far as possible, in having the repeal of the act postponed for further consideration. I am satisfied that the repeal of the act will be a great blow to interstate trade and commerce, and to the public, if some court, tribunal, or board, capable of settling interstate industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration is not retained, and the parties are left to direct action to settle interstate industrial disputes. It will be found legally impossible for the States to settle interstate industrial disputes. Mr Bruce put the case for his Government in the following way:There is only one issue to be faced at this election. The .Bruce-Page Government realizing the chaos that overlapping of Federal and State awards has brought upon Australian industry, particularly in view of the continual industrial upheavals that take place in the 'Southern States, decided to abolish the Federal Arbitration Court, and leave the matter to - each individual Arbitration Court. By this means no worker is deprived of any arbitration privileges at all. A great champion of the cause of arbitration has been the ex-Attorney-General, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham). He said in April, 1928Those who say that arbitration has broken down are not acquainted with the facts . . . Those who make broad statements that the whole system has failed, completely disregard the fact that, while in three or four industries there have been serious difficulties, scores of other industries are working under awards or agreements of the Arbitration Court with reasonable satisfaction to both sides. Speaking in London, he is reported to have saidSince he had arrived he had noticed that there was a strike in the coal industry, even in London. People in Australia were too prone to advertise their difficulties. The Arbitration Court in Australia had worked most successfully. Would the abolition of the Arbitration Court mean greater employment, as is claimed by honourable members opposite? There is a Nationalist Government in New South Wales and Queensland, in both of which States the rural workers' award has been withdrawn. That action did not cause one additional worker to be employed in the rural industries.",84
365,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,It certainly did in Queensland.,85
366,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"It did not result in the employment of one extra man. Men who previously tramped the country searching for work were able to sell their labour at the rate provided by the rural workers award. The award was policed by the Government, and the employers were afraid to pay less than the ruling rate of wage. The majority of those who today are tramping the roads must take what is offered to them, even though it be only bread and beef in return for the chopping of wood. When the Labour party was defeated in Queensland in 1929, the ratio of unemployment was less than 7 per cent. If the abolition of the rural workers' award has led to the provision of additional employment, why is it necessary for the Nationalist Government in that State to commence relief works?",85
367,Mr BATLET,CONCILIATION AND,Fro m the stand-point of humanity.,85
368,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,Humanit y at £2 10s. a week is a bit thin. Has the honourable member for Oxley ever tried to maintain a wife and three children on £4 a week?,85
369,Mr BATLET,CONCILIATION AND,It is far better to have £2 10s. a week than nothing.,86
370,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"That is quite right. While the Labour j)arty was in power in Queensland it gradually reduced its expenditure until it was in a position to carry out public works. It left over £3,000,000 in the Treasury.",86
371,Mr BATLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Loa n funds.,86
372,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Ha d it remained in office, it would have been able to absorb the unemployed at award rates of pay. To-day those men are being exploited, not only by the Government, but also by the local authorities. The Greater Brisbane Council dismissed thousands of men. Thousands were thrown out of the railway service, also, after the advent of the Moore Government. The honourable member for Oxley must know that after the defeat of the Labour Government the railway awards went by the board, porters who carried luggage were dispensed with, and the work was given to the "" redcaps,"" and the six saints' days that previously were holidays, were cut out of the awards. But it is impossible for any government to ruin, or even hurt, a State like Queensland. It has just come through a five years' drought; yet, despite what the honourable member for Oxley designates as the disability of fourteen years of Labour rule, it is better off financially, and has fewer unemployed, than any other State in the Commonwealth. When the Moore Government was returned to power its first act was to attack the workers. The loss of six holidays in a year was a serious blow to the working man. \Quorum formed.] The working week also was increased by four hours. The claim was that the new Government wished to relieve the unemployed position; but the re-introduction of the 48hour week threw one man in every eleven out of employment, leaving him to be exploited and to be forced to accept £2 10s. a week if he were a single man, and £3 a week if he were married. It Was necessary for the Government to bring about a change in the Federal Arbitration system, because the people had lost faith in it as the result of statements made by persons in responsible positions with regard to cases before the court. We had the spectacle the other day of an organization, which has abided loyally by the Arbitration Act, taking a secret ballot of its members to determine whether it would have compulsory arbitration or direct action. But its case had been pre-judged before it went to the court. It knew what the fate of its case would be before the evidence was heard. On that occasion the union advocate withdrew from the court. If the proposed conciliation commissioners could be more biased than the gentlemen who made the. recent statements they would prove a failure. Legislation was passed in Queensland recently causing the retirement of judges in that State at the age of 70 years. The result was that judges who retired from the Queensland judiciary were placed on the bench of the Federal Arbitration Court. Men approaching their second childhood cannot be expected to bring about peace in industry.",86
373,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Is the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) in order in referring to members of the judiciary as men who are entering their second childhood ?,86
374,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,Hon. Norman Makin). - It would certainly be unparliamentary for an honourable member to refer to the judiciary in those terms. I ask the honourable member if he applied those words to the judiciary.,86
375,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,No . I said that arbitration could not be successful under a judiciary in its second childhood.,86
376,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Hansar d will show that the honourable member used different words from those.,86
377,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member has given me an assurance that he did not apply those words to members of the judiciary.,86
378,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,Coul d the Hansard report of the words used be read at this stage ?,86
379,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,A motion could be made that the words be taken down.,86
380,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,I take it that the words used have already been recorded by Hansard.,86
381,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,When a member gives an assurance it is usual to accept it. I accept the assurance of the honourable member for Kennedy that he did not use the words in the way suggested.,86
382,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) has evidently been in the habit of putting into the mouths of honourable members words that they have not used. I said that there had been an amendment of the Judiciary Act of Queensland to compel judges in that State to retire on reaching the age of 70 years, that these men had been appointed to the bench of the Federal Arbitration Court, and that arbitration could not be a success if administered by men in their second childhood. I am aware that reflections should not be cast on the judiciary, but honourable members opposite, and particularly the honourable member for Henty, do not hesitate to insult the class which members on this side represent. Since I have been a member of this. chamber, he has often tried his bouncing and bullying tricks.",87
383,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,Do not cry!,87
384,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I am rather inclined to laugh at the man who advised his previous leader, to "" spend fifty millions bravely"", and referred to the late Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) as the "" tragic Treasurer"". When he is not insulting the workers he insults the members of his own party. The unions take no exception to the provisions for a secret ballot. I know of no union or organization of workers that is prevented from holding such a ballot. I have attended many union meetings, and I have taken part in numerous industrial disputes. The question has often been raised whether there should be a - show of hands or a secret ballot to determine matters at issue, and, in most cases, when the members desired a secret ballot, it was held. But the unions take exception to the amendment of the act made by the Bruce-Page Government, which provided that ten members of a union might call upon their organization to take a secret ballot. This would enable a handful of unionists to hold up the settlement of an industrial dispute indefinitely. In some cases, over twelve months has elapsed before the hearing of disputes. I believe that this bill will be welcomed by the workers. It is an effort to bring about peace in industry, and I think that it will be appreciated by the employers, too. The late Government, even after promising the people peace in industry, tried to escape from its responsibilities by transferring the control of compulsory arbitration to the States. The opposition has a majority in the other branch of the legislature, and it will be interesting to note what happens to the bill in that chamber. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) was returned in 1928 with a majority of 3644 votes, but in 1929, when the arbitration issue was submitted to the people, his majority was reduced to 100. Sir Granville Ryrie, when he proceeded to England, left the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Archdale Parkhill) a majority of 20,000 votes, but that majority fell last year to under 2,000. The recent struggle on the Northern coal-fields left the workers high and dry after twelve months, although the late Attorney-General (Mr Latham) said that he was convinced that a breach of the arbitration law had been committed by the coal-owners. He issued a summons against one of the proprietors, but did not proceed with it. In the case of the Timber Workers Union, however, once the summons had been issued against it, the prosecution was carried out, and the organization was fined ' £1,000. The waterside workers were penalized, and practically starved to death, owing to the action of the late Government in issuing licences under the Transport Workers Act. Judge Beeby did not take evidence in Queensland on account of having met with an accident. He said that he would go to that State later to hear evidence. There was no trouble in Queensland in the industry, apart from one port, yet the whole of this organization was drawn into an industrial dispute as a result of the Beeby award. Conciliation would have saved considerable trouble in Queensland at the time of the waterside dispute, but that would not have suited the Bruce-Page Government. The Parliament had nearly run its course; the Government was without a policy upon which to go to the country; it would not adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Henty to ""spend £50,000,000 bravely""; and a waterside dispute extending from Brisbane to Perth, came opportunely to provide the Nationalists with an election cry. I do not think the people ever paid so much for arbitration and got less results from it than during the last six years. The workers will appreciate a change to a system which will enable them to approach the tribunals with some confidence.",87
385,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,A system that will create a little more unemployment.,88
386,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND,"What is wrong with the constitution of the Queensland court, which operated successfully during the fourteen years of Labour government ? In that time nothing was done to the detriment of industry. I welcome this bill, and I hope that it will pass in its present form, and will prove just as beneficial to the workers as the Queensland act has been during the last fourteen years.",88
387,Mr GARDNER,CONCILIATION AND,"Robertson) [3.18 a.m.] - The Attorney-General, when moving the second reading of the bill, spoke the general success of the Federal Arbitration Court, and quoted speeches by the late Prime Minister and the present Leader of the Opposition to that effect. Although we must concede that a measure of success has attended the operation of the act, it is an unfortunate fact that the dislocations of industry, although not numerous, have been very serious. One of the major causes of them was the failure of Labour leaders in the organizations, and in this chamber, to take a courageous stand against such interruptions. The Attorney-General speaks optimistically now "" of a new province of law and ordei\"" but this is quite a new role for him. I was gratified to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie, who alone amongst the Government supporters has stated definitely that he stands for constitutional practices and believes in obedience to the awards of the court. We all were interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Holloway), who has had a considerable practical experience in the working of the Arbitration Act. But a disappointing feature of his speech was that he was' not as definitely in favour of the observance of awards as was the honourable member for Macquarie. Although he said that the decisions of the court should be obeyed, he immediately offered excuses for the conduct of the leaders of the unfortunate timber-workers'' strike, which resulted in the unemployment of many members of the unions and much suffering to their wives and children. The dislocation caused by that strike and the trouble on the waterfront was not readily forgotten by the people, nor can Labour leaders lightly divest themselves of responsibility for their attitude in. those disputes. To-day the red element practically controls the Trades and Labour Council in New South Wales, and we can appreciate the quotations of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Archdale Parkhill), who showed that many of the organizations of Labour have candidly avowed that they are opposed to the principles of arbitration. That is important, because in federal elections, New South Wales is usually the pivotal State. Mr Lang, when Premier, tried his prentice hand at conciliation, of and with such results that at the following elections he was hurled out of office. Undoubtedly conciliation is the ideal method of composing industrial differences, but there is nothing in the bill that ensures real conciliation. When the regulations were first framed under Mr. Lang's act in New South Wales, they provided for the appointment of six chairmen of conciliation committees. As that number was not sufficient to provide positions for those who expected them on account of their services in Labour organizations, it was increased to twelve. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) took the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) to task for having referred to one of the chairmen, Mr. Morgan, as an ex-pugilist. I am sure my leader did not intend to reflect personally on that gentleman; he merely suggested that a career in the ring was not necessarily a qualification for the chairmanship of an industrial committee. Mr Morgan is a friend of mine, and I know him to be a very estimable and honourable citizen. A flaw in the New South Wales act was that the chairman of a conciliation committee had a casting vote, and by the exercise of it he became really an arbitrator. It is true that matters could be referred from a committee to the industrial commission, but Parliament never intended that the committee should have arbitral power^ or that a. chairman should have the right to dispose of an issue by his casting vote without the agreement of the parties. Mr. Justice Piddington, in the Rylands case, upheld the right of a chairman to record a casting vote. The Lang Government had intended that the committees should be conciliatory, and to that end had accepted an amendment inserted in the Upper House; but it was overruled by Mr Justice Piddington in the Rylands case. Mr Bavin, by abolishing the chairman's casting vote^ restored the committees to their proper functions of conciliation. I am afraid that if this bill becomes law in its present form the experience of the Commonwealth will be very similar to that of New South Wales. The bill refers to. conciliation commissioners, but as they will have arbitral powers equal to those of judges, their functions will be no more conciliatory than were those of the chairmen under the New South Wales act.",88
388,Mr BEENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Are not the judges conciliators?,89
389,Mr GARDNER,CONCILIATION AND,"The judges may act as conciliators, but they are not conciliation commissioners, whose duties are entirely conciliatory and not arbitral in character. The qualifications for appointment, as commissioners are not laid down in the bill. It is therefore treinely likely that leaders of the Labour movement will be appointed as conciliation commissioners. Our experience of official unionism has been expensive, and the action of the union leaders during the timber-Workers' strike is not likely to be forgotten by the general community for some considerable time. I am not suggesting that union officials are less honourable than the members of any other section of the community, but it seems to me that the conciliation commissioners are to be chosen from one side of industry only, and that is the employees' side. They will be men who have been connected with Labour organizations all their lives.",89
390,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"r-Why does the honourable member say that? Mr GARDNER:-That is only my opinion. It is evident that this Government intends to follow the example of the Lang Government in New South; Wales, which appointed as a conciliation commissioner a former Labour Attorneyi General. This bill, when it becomes law, will have the same effect as had industrial legislation of New South Wales. There are many large industries in New South Wales, and in view of the employers' experience of State commissioners it is only natural that they are now viewing with some apprehension this proposal to appoint federal conciliation commissioners. If the Attorney-General really desires to bring about conciliation in industry, he should allow the act to stand as it is, because the Bruce-Page Government in introducing its amending legislation in 1928, did aim at true conciliation.",89
391,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Did not the Nationalist party want to repeal that legislation?,89
392,Mr GARDNER,CONCILIATION AND,"At the last election the policy of the Nationalist party in regard to arbitration had changed. At that time a lot of misrepresentation was indulged in by the Labour party. It was said that the Nationalist party did not stand for arbitration at all, but that statement was nothing but camouflage and misrepresentation. During this debate it has been admitted over and over again by honourable members supporting the Government that this bill is restricted because of the limitations of the Constituex* tion. There was no mention of the limitations of the Constitution during the election campaign. At that time the Labour party told the people that if it were returned to power everything in the garden would be lovely. It was because of the dual systems of arbitration and the overlapping of awards that the Nationalist party decided to remain in the arbitration field only in respect of the maritime industries, and to vacate the remainder of the field to the States. The conciliation commissioner will have the power to reduce hours and to increase wages. There is no objection to that on the part of employees in industry, but to the employer it seems to be a one-sided arrangement, because the commissioner will have no - power to increase hours or decrease, wages. That can be done only by a majority of the full Arbitration Court of three judges. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. A fair deal should be given to the employers as well as to the employees; Is it any wonder that this legislation is not being welcomed by the employing section of the community? Employment can be found for people only if the wheels of industry are kept moving, and any interference with the hours and working conditions of employees, to the detriment of the employers, must result in increased unemployment. The bill also provides for preference to unionists, and, in this connection, the Government is going to a length that was never dreamed of by the general community. When preference to unionists was included in the industrial legislation introduced by the Lang Government in New South Wales, it applied not only to unionists seeking employment, but also to unionists in employment. This Government is indeed taking a headstrong stand in insisting that before a man may earn his living he must join the trade union movement. Surely it should not be necessary to conscript workers in a democratic country like Australia. By compelling a man to join a union we deprive him of his individual liberty, and if he stands for the principle of free citizenship, and refuses to join a union, his wife and children must starve. That is carrying the principle of preference to unionists too far. I would agree to extending a reasonable preference to unionists, because I quite understand that there are certain individuals in the community who are prepared to enjoy the benefits obtained by the trade union movement without taking any active part in it. If a man does not wish to join a union he.should not be forced to do so. Every man has the right to earn his living in this country. I should not object to preference to unionists, all other things being equal, but the proviso "" all other things being equal"" is to be withdrawn, as it was in New South Wales under the Lang administration. provision will have a dire effect on the volunteer waterside workers. Much has been said about the fight that was put up by the waterside workers, a considerable number of whom are returned soldiers. We are sorry for them if they are suffering individually, but it must not be forgotten that they brought the trouble upon themselves. If this bill becomes law, volunteer labour will become a thing of the past. Primary industries are largely carried on in my electorate. The present Mr Gardner. Government is making an appeal to the farmers of this country to grow more wheat. It has acknowledged that the financial salvation of this country lies in the exports of our primary products. I ask in what position would the primary producers of this country be if volunteer work were not permitted? During one strike the primary products of Queensland and Western Australia were allowed to rot on the wharfs, and as a last resort the primary producers themselves transferred their products from the wharfs to the vessels lying alongside. It is inconsistent for the Government to appeal to the primary producers and at the same time to introduce legislation which, if it becomes law, will prevent them from marketing their produce when a transport strike is in progress. Is it any wonder that they view this legislation with apprehension ? I regret that the secret ballot is to be abolished, because it is a fundamental principle of democracy. It is of such importance that centuries ago blood was lost in order to retain it. Surely we may assume that the trade unions of this country are democratic in character. I admit that the secret ballot failed in the case of the timber-workers' strike, but only because of the lack of police. The Bruce-Page Government inserted the secret ballot provision in the Arbitration Act, and had the Attorney-General taken a firm stand and insisted upon its retention, I do not think any animosity would have been engendered in the minds of those who politically were opposed to the late administration. Had a secret ballot been taken on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales, whei* the trouble first started, the miners would have returned to work This fifteen or eighteen months ago. Every honourable member knows that the terms under which the coal-miners have resumed work could have been secured fifteen or eighteen months ago. I have been informed on the very best authority that if a secret ballot of the coal-miners had been held at that time these terms would have been accepted then. This would have saved a tremendous loss to the coal-miners in particular, and to industry' in general; but instead of that we - have today - 16 per cent, of our workers unemployed.",89
393,Mr MAHTENS,CONCILIATION AND,What was authority to which the honourable member,91
394,Mr GABJJNER,CONCILIATION AND,"It was a reliable authority. If the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens) is well-informed on trade union matters he will know that the officials responsible for the continuance of the dispute in this industry have been removed from office. The honourable member has told us frequently that the rules of trade unions make provision for the holding of secret ballots, and that the waterside workers could have held a ballot had they desired to do so. But a prominent member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales .has told us how one secret ballot was held by the Waterside Workers Union. The returning officer merely announced that all uallot-papers in favour of the question were to be placed in a ballot box on the right of the room and those - against it in a ballot box on the left of the room. In these circumstances, it is no wonder that the rank and file of trade unionists desired provisions for the holding of proper secret ballots to be placed in the act. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Brennan) upon providing for the repeal of the penal sections of the act. These have never been workable. Very many years ago the Honourable James Ashton, M.L.C., predicted that the penal provisions of the act would prove to be unworkable. He said that it would be possible to gaol the few persons among the employers who might be found guilty of offences; but it would be impossible to gaol the thousands of employees who might offend, for there would not be sufficient gaols to hold them. I am sorry that the Attorney General did not consult the employers as well as the employees before drafting this bill. The previous Government wisely - consulted both parties. In these difficult times, when the financial position is so - serious that the banks are withdrawing - overdrafts and increased Commonwealth - taxation is almost certain on account of the deficit, it is desirable that everything possible should be done to improve our industrial relations. The Attorney-General has intimated ithat he is prepared to consider any prothe posals that may be made for the improvement of the bill, and I trust that he will accept some of the amendments that will be moved with the object of making the bill as useful as possible.",91
395,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,Oxley) [3.52 a.m.] When the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) was Attorney-General in the Bruce-Page Government he consulted every branch of industry before he drafted the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration bill for which he was responsible; but the same cannot be said of the present Attorney-General (Mr Brennan).,91
396,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,He consulted only the arbitration committee of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions.,91
397,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"A perusal of the manifesto issued by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions forces one to the conclusion that that body, and not the Attorney-General or his colleagues in the Government, is responsible for this bill. There is not an amendment in the bill that is not included in the manifesto. The Attorney-General, in his speech in introducing the measure, paid that in the forefront of it were not the clashing weapons of the strike and lockout, but the solvent remedies of goodwill and conciliation. It is quite true that the clashing weapons of the strike and lockout are not placed in the forefront of the bill; but they lie hidden, like so many masked batteries, ready to pour out their murderous fire when the order is given by either the leaders of the Trade Union movement or the leaders of industry. The solvent remedies mentioned by the honourable gentleman are solvent only in the spirit of goodwill and co-operation which is entirely missing from the bill. The Attorney-General also said in his speechWe do not put this measure forward as a full and final expression of our policy in this regard. Was the honourable gentleman trying to save the face of his Government when he said that? Probably his conscience has been troubling him for having introduced this bill, with which he can have very little in common. We must recognize that the obsequiousness of the honourable member is part of the price that he is called upon to pay for his association with the Labour party, of the members of which it may be truly saidTheirs not to reason why; Theirs but to do or die. The Attorney-General has preferred, on this occasion, to do what the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has directed him to do. Let me contrast the action of the members of this Government in that regard with the action of the members of the Bruce-Page Government. cided that certain things should be done with the object of increasing peace in industry in this country, but owing to treachery in the ranks of their own party they were prevented from doing what they set out to do. Having the courage of their convictions, however, they preferred to go to the people and ask them to decide the matter, rather than prove false to the trust that had been reposed in them. They preferred to die politically rather than prove false to themselves. opinion it would be far better for the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to be removed from the statute-book entirely than for this bill to be passed in its present I am certain that if the bill is passed without amendment we shall slowly but surely revert to the practices referred to particularly by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Holloway), but also by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), and others that existed in the early nineties prior to the advent of arbitration even the appointment of wages boards, shop committees and the like. It is useless for the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens) to say that we would like to see those conditions restored. The members of the Nationalist party stand four square for arbitration. Ever since I have been a member of this House I have supported arbitration, and in 1926 I assured the electors that I stood for the continuance of federal arbitration. Our party was returned to power at the next election. In 1928, when the Leader of the Opposition, who was then Attorney-General, brought in certain amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, I and others on this side of the House supported him. We were determined to make arbitration workable in Australia. Mr Bayley. Unfortunately, however, there were those within the Labour movement whose activities rendered it impossible for federal arbitration to function as it should. Mr Bruce, on several occasions, declared that arbitration was on its trial, and that unless some of the unions changed their tactics it would be necessary for his Government to change its arbitration policy. In 1929 we went before the electors on the issue of whether or not arbitration should be handed back The latter de- to the States.",91
398,Mr MABTENS,CONCILIATION AND,And the honourable member's party lost.,92
399,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"We did, but it was largely the result of misrepresentation. Another factor contributing to our defeat was that we were compelled to face the electors at a time when there was a great deal of unemployment, and when privation stalked through the land. Those who were opposed to us politically told In my the people that we were out to reduce wages, and increase hours. No such thing was in our minds. A few months previously the Bruceform. Page Government had introduced the Transport Workers Bill, the passing of which ushered in a reign of peace on the water-front such as the country had not enjoyed for many years. The last speaker on the Government side referred to disturbances on the water-front, and mentioned the Beeby award. He said that Judge Beeby had given out that he would visit Queensland, and take certain or evidence there. As a matter of fact, Judge Beeby found it impossible to go to Queensland himself, but he called for written evidence from that State. On the evidence, and on the evidence obtained in other States, he framed an award that was to apply throughout the whole of Australia. The award issued by Judge Beeby was almost word for word the award under which the waterside workers had been operating in Queensland. I do not ask honourable members to accept my statement for that; I refer them to the statements of some of those who were selected to contest Senate seats at the last elections on behalf of the Labour party. One of these went so far as to take a copy of the Queensland Waterside Workers Award in one hand, and a copy of the Beeby award in the other, and to prove to his audience by* quoting first from one and then the other that they were identical. It was desired to bring these men under the provisions of the federal award, because theirs section of the maritime industry which federal in character. This is particuI larly the case in regard to seamen. Supcontrolled pose a ship were to leave Melbourne with a full complement. If each State were working under its own award those men, recruited in Melbourne, would be engaged under the terms of the Victorian award. If , through sickness among the crew for some other reason, it were necessary to engage more men - at Sydney, the new under a State award. arrivals would have to be engaged under a New South ""Wales award; and if it were necessary to take on still other men at Brisbane they would be employed under a Queensland award. This would create an impossible situation. We desire, therefore, that maritime workers shall all come settling under the federal court, but that other classes of workers shall be under their respective State industrial tribunals. sides maritime workers, I would also clude journalists and theatrical workers among those who should work under federal awards. A journalist may be living in Sydney, but may be employed by newspapers printed and published in two other States. Therefore, his wages and conditions should be governed by federal award. Theatrical performers travel from State to State in the course of their work, and they also should have a federal award. It wr- claimed by some that teachers should have a federal award, but I do not accept that.",92
400,Mr MARTENS,CONCILIATION AND,"What about the shearposed ers? Do they not go from one State to another, travelling from Western Austher<) tralia to Queensland in the course of their work?",93
401,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course they do, but men in the oiie shed work one State award. In 1928, when Mr Jim Riordan was contesting the Kennedy electorate against Mr G. Francis he pubstatement. lished a pamphlet headed "" Bush workers and pastoral workers, protect your cloven hoof is shown. interests."" The pamphlet saidIf the Bruce-Page Government be returned you will be compelled to work under the federal court, and will suffer the following at every turn. losses in your wages. And then follows a list of the amounts which pastoral workers would lose if were compelled to operate under a federal rather that a State award. However, in 1929 the Bruce-Page Government was no is a longer advocating that all industries is should be governed by federal awards. t was urging that nearly all industries be by State awards. On this occasion Mr Darby Riordan, a brother of the former candidate, was contesting the Kennedy electorate, and he also opposed the return of the Bruce-Page Government, but now it was on the ground that or if that Government were returned the shearers, &c, would be compelled to work If this bill passes in its present form we shall be slowly but surely forced back to the conditions existing prior to 1890. At that time the only method at the disposal of employers and employees for their industrial differences was the strike or lockout. Both thes means were 0 used with the utmost rigour. Sometimes Bethe employees won, and sometimes they inlost, but even when they won their gains did not make up for what the victory cost them. The same might be said of the employers. The effect on the workers of this condition of affairs was to induce them to turn their faces towards Parliament, and to look for political assistance. a The shearers' strike of the nineties was really the genesis of the Labour party as we know it today. It is to be regretted that the trade unions, instead of remainingpurely industrial organizations as they are in America today, should have become both industrial and political. That has been their undoing. It is proin this bill to grant absolute preference to unionists. In the present act is a saving clause, "" other things being equal."" Under the proposed amendment, those words will be deleted from the act, and there will then be absolute only under preference to unionists.",93
402,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,That is an inaccurate,93
403,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"It is here that the The Attorney General has attempted to make it impossible for volunteers to obtain employment on the waterfront, but has been defeated This will give him the opportunity that he requires; and if the bill should pass in its present form it they will not be long before the number of volunteers working on the wharfs is greatly diminished. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Holloway), in his opening remarks, referred to the fact that, for the first twenty years, federal arbitration proved very successful. The reason is not far to seek. That period marked an era of great prosperity in Australia. It may safely be said that wages were continually increased, the employers being unwilling to refuse the demands of the men for fear that the wheels of industry would be stopped, and they would lose the greatvolume of trade that was coming to them in the form of contracts. It was not until that prosperity was checked, as it has been during the last three or four years, that arbitration was truly tested as a means of bringing about industrial peace.",93
404,Mr KEANE,CONCILIATION AND,It is still successful.,94
405,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I still stand for tration. While it. may have failed on a few occasions, the gain that has resulted to the community far outweighs any disadvantages. The problem is to bring about harmony in industry, and that can only be done if all concerned receive an adequate return, the workman for the labour that he puts into industry, and the employer for the capital that he invests. At the present time the condition of the world's markets makes it imperative for the cost of production to be lowered. I stated previously that a rising market, which made possible increases of wages, and frequently a decrease in the number of hours worked, resulted in arbitration proving so successful. To-day, however, not only the system of arbitration but industry itself is imperilled throughout Australia, and both will remain in that state unless the products of our primary and secondary industries are increased in volume. Such an increase would result in a substantial decrease in the cost of production, which would make it possible for our primary products to be sold overseas, and would increase the local demand for our manufactured articles. The question arises, how can such a highly desirable position be brought about? One fact may not be successfully challenged; that is. that the present wage rate is not more than sufficient to enable a man adequately to maintain himself and his family. A reduction of wages at this time would mean a lessening of the spending power of the community, and, eventually, more unemployment. But our standard of living is sacrosanct. Thus it will be seen that a reduction of wages does uot provide a solution of the problem. Where, then, is it to be found? To my mind, it lies in the further application of the system of payment by results.",94
406,Mr KEANE,CONCILIATION AND,That system would put more men out of work.,94
407,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"It would put more men in work. It is interesting to note that the honourable - member for Herbert (Mr Martens) has not interjected at this stage. The reason is that he and the union that he has represented for so many years stand for payment by results, and piece work. Many attempts have been made by the militants to break arbidown the system; because, wherever it has been adopted, peace and contentmentare to be found, and that is not desired by a certain type of union official. I refer honourable members' again to the waterside workers' strike in Queensland to prove that officials of that type are to be found in this country. As I said previously, the Beeby federal award was an exact copy of the Queensland award..",94
408,Mr MARTENS,CONCILIATION AND,Nothin g of the kind.,94
409,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"It is useless for the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Martens) to say that it was not. 1 challenge him to produce a copy of the Beeby award find a copy of the State award that existed when it was superseded, and to show wherein the two differ. Queensland waterside workers had been working contentedly under the State award; but no sooner did they come under the federal award than they were advised by the president and the secretary of their organization to strike against it. They did so; and we are all familiar with what happened. That brings me to the question of the secret ballot, because such a ballot entered largely into that industrial disturbance. The majority of the men, despite what they had been told by Mr. Andy Brown and the president of the union, knew full well that they were foolish to strike against the Beeby award. They desired to return to work, and demanded that a secret ballot be taken. That ballot was taken; but no one will ever know the result of it, because the ballot box with the ballot papers inside was kicked to pieces in the place where it was taken. The secret ballot was provided by the Bruce-Page Government with the object of giving to trade unionists the control of their organizations. To my mind it was one of the finest contributions that has yet been made to the principle of arbitration. A number of honourable members opposite view this bill solely from the standpoint of the unions, and the effect that it will have upon the working of unionism. Neither the unions nor the employers have any right to regard arbitration as an instrument which was designed purely for their benefit. [ f they alone suffered as a result of industrial disputes, they would have been allowed to do so. But the general public must be considered; because, whether a man manufactures goods or sells his labour, it is the general public that has to pay. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the welfare of the general public has not been taken into consideration by the Attorney-General. Arbitration undoubtedly was introduced to save the general public from the sufferings that industrial disturbances entail, and any amendments of the act should have that object in view. As I am convinced that strife, and not harmony, will be engendered if this bill passes, I shall oppose it.",94
410,Mr BEENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Batman-Attorney General) [4.30 a.m.] - Amon g the many mis-statements and inaccuracies glibly uttered by the honourable gentleman who has just concluded his address, was a statement to the effect that the amending bill now before the chamber made preference to unionists absolute. The honourable member should, and, indeed, must, kuow that that is not so, and that ordered preference to unionists, in the clear words of the statute, is, and will remain, in the absolute discretion of the court. The terms are that "" the court, by its award, or by order made on the application of they any organization or person bound by the cept award, may "", and then follow the words preference which empower the judge to give preferagainst unionists. ence to unionists in his absolute and untrammelled discretion. I would not find myself gravelled for argument if I were asked to establish a case in favour of absolute preference to unionists. As a matter of fact, it stands to the credit of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) that, in the first bill that was introduced by him in the House of Representatives, there was a provision for mandatory or absolute preference to unionists, and because it Avas considered unconstitutional, or likely to be declared so, the proposal was abandoned, and a provision was inserted in the bill, leaving the matter to the discretion of the court. It has remained in the discretion of the court to the present day, and it is not being removed by the bill now before this chamber. Under any system of arbitration which prescribes machinery for awarding a minimum wage, it is arguable on just grounds that preference to unionists should be absolute, and while I declare that this bill contains no such provision, I do not exclude myself from the possibility, with wider industrial powers, and. taking the stand that the right honourable member for North Sydney, supported by the present Leader of the Opposition in another place, took of claiming absolute preference to unionists for those bound by Arbitration Court rules and entitled under those tribunals to a minimum wage. The basis of that argument is the sound ethical theory that those who by organization and sacrifice win higher wages and better conditions should not be subject in the wage market to competition by those who hold themselves aloof from the struggle - The fact is, as stated by the late Mr Justice Higgins in his work, A New Province for Law and Order, at page 18 of the edition in my hand, thatThe only case in which the court has preference is the case of a tramway company which deliberately discriminated against unionists and refused not to discriminate in future. In the exercise of the discretion which the court has and wil l continue to have, the rule they have laid down is that will not give preference to unionists exi n those cases where there has been clc:ir against unionists or discrimination The most striking modern case coming under my notice in which, there has been discrimination against unionists was that mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley), namely, the water T side workers' case, in which we have proof of flagrant discrimination against unionists. By reason of that fact, an application was recently made to the court in the hope that preference to unionists in the discretion of the judge. might be. given. The judge, in the exercise of that discretion, and in view of the history of the case, thought otherwise. But whatever his view-it is entitled to respect, and it will be respected-the fact is that discrimination is today, and has been for some time, so exercised in an invidious and cruel way against the unionist workers on the waterfront. This bill has been debated by members of the Opposition under two vital, or, at least, serious misconceptions. One is that the measure has been dictated to the Government by militant industrialists; the other is that it is, in its character, biased and partisan. Neither of those statements, so freely made by members on the Opposition side, has the slightest foundation in fact. It is true that the industrialists of this country, represented by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, have taken the stand which they are entitled to take regarding the proposals submitted by the Government to this House. It is equally true that as earnest of their industry and interest they conceived a more ambitious and comprehensive scheme of arbitration for submission to this chamber; but the fact remains, notwithstanding the friendly consultations that proceeded between representatives of the Government and representatives of the trade unions, this modest effort is the draftsmanship of myself alone, approved by the Cabinet, and accepted by the party whose spokesman for the moment. I have the honour to be. So far as the criticisms to which I have referred are honestly made, I may hope to remove those misconceptions. So far as they represent unscrupulous propaganda, it would be idle for me to concern myself with them any further. The bill has been introduced by reason of the pledge which the Labour party gave, to the people before the Government assumed office-a pledge which was endorsed by the people-and the preMr Brennan. sentation of the bill, modest as it is in its conception, represents a fulfilment, at least in part, of the mandate given to this Government by the electors of Australia, The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the acute industrial problems which beset us at the present time, the existence of which we must only too sorrowfully acknowledge. He adds that this bill will provide no solution of the problem. I have never said that it would, or could, provide a solution; it would be absurd to make such a claim on behalf of this measure. It will provide neither the solution of those problems, nor amelioration of the conditions arising out of them, if the motives of those who submit this bill are aspersed, and its terms deliberately and wilfully misrepresented. But if the words written in black type on the memorandum on the bill before the House, namely ""to promote goodwill in industry by conciliation and arbitration,"" could be written in letters of gold in the hearts of the people of this country, and if there was a real and generous effort to achieve the ideal set out in the forefront of the measure, some good might reasonably be expected from the bill. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) has invited honourable members on both sides to "" reason together."" I welcome the spirit in which the invitation is given, but I cannot think that it is entirely consistent with the honourable gentleman's bitter regrets that to some extent, at least, we have modified the penalties and the litigious character of the act. The Leader of the Opposition admits the constitutional limitation under which we labour; but I am bound to remind him that, if we may judge by his attitude to the appeals recently submitted for the amplification of the powers of the Commonwealth, through the medium of its Constitution, he has not done very much to assist us to obtain fuller and ampler powers. The honourable gentleman congratulates himself-perhap s he also congratulates us-that there still remain in the Arbitration Act some 40 sections for which he claims responsibility. I have not checked those figures, but I am prer pared to accept them as being about correct, and I accept that fact also as at least a Blight additional proof that we are not proposing to amend this bill vindictively against the honourable gentleman and his proposals, but discriminatively to preserve the best, and, from our point of view, to reject the worse, that we find in I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) that if the court is to function effectively, win respect, and achieve the results for which we hope, its awards must be respected and obeyed. I do not say that for the first time today; I have frequently said it, both before the recent election and on every occasion since when I have been called upon to make a public declaration on the subject. So the Leader of the Oppo-. sition and I are agreed on that point. It is gratifying also that the honourable gentleman, and the Government, are in harmony in regard to ""the repeal of that section of the act which provides for the imposition of fines of £1,000 in respect of strikes and lockouts, and also in regard to the declaration of the Prime Minister that the Government has a mandate to maintain the federal principle in industrial arbitration. The honourable gentleman has asked the Government to consider the desirability of taking the further step of prohibiting awards which, in themselves, provide penalties for strikes and lockouts. That is a matter for consideration. I ask him in return, to consider the general policy of the bill, a substantial part of which .is not to fetter the discretion of the court. I acknowledge gratefully the temperate and argumentative manner in which the Leader of the Opposition addressed himself to the bill; I have no complaint of his attitude as a responsible and able Leader of the Opposition. I could have greatly wished that the standard he set had been maintained by some of the honourable gentlemen associated with him. If they had patterned themselves upon their leader the debate would not have degenerated to the level to which it was reduced by the captious addresses of certain honourable gentlemen, who skipped airily from one inconsequential inaccuracy to another, never seeming to be certain of a fact, or, if they were certain of it, never inclined to state it fairly. I assume that the honourable member for Kooyong was spokesman for the Opposition as a whole. One of the first remarks he made by way of objection to the bill was that from 1927 to 1929 there was a developing it. evidence of lack of faith in and loyalty to the principle of arbitration on the part of the trade union movement. Apparently that was his excuse for the broadside attack which he made upon arbitration ; with such disastrous consequences to his party at the end of last year. But if there wassome weakening of the allegiance of the trade union movement to arbitration-and I do not admit it might not the honourable gentleman have remembered also that, unlike the Leader of the Government, he leads a party which contains members in this House the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan), and others-wh o are wholeheartedly opposed to the principle of arbitration ? He should not have forgotten the Single Purpose League, men like Mr Ashworth, president of the Employers Pederation, and many supporters of the Opposition, whose antagonism is not to the amending bill, but to the whole principle of industrial arbitration and the.regulation of wages and working conditions. The Leader of the Opposition said that the bill is heavily biased in favour of trade union officials. I challenge that statement, made by him apparently as a considered opinion, and repeated with gross intemperance inside and outside this chamber by others. May I say at once that the bill is designed to provide machinery for holding the balance fairly between the interests concerned, and is a mild instalment of the accepted policy of the Government? If it be partisan to keep one's pledges and apply one's policy, submitted to, examined and accepted by the people, then only in those circumstances do I admit that the bill is in any sense partisan. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) questioned the mandate of the Government to introduce such legislation, but I was strongly impressed with the view that the honourable gentleman was considering, not so much the mandate of the Government, as what should be his own fluctuating attitude in regard to this measure, supporting arbitration as he did with""'the help and concurrence of Labour at the last election, and, opposing it in the House this evening. The Leader of the Opposition criticized the bill in detail, and he referred particularly to the conciliation commissioners. They represent an institution introduced not by this Government but by the last government, which alone was responsible for the origin and tenure of these commissioners. Only one has been appointed, and he has been applauded for his knowledge, judgment, and tact. Therefore, one wonders why, having regard to the only experience we have had of the system, there should bo such profound distrust of commissioners as arbitrators. Mr BELJ, - But the bill gives greater powers to the commissioners.",95
411,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I acknowledge that wo are now proposing to give to the conciliation commissioners extended powers, but surely the appointment of men like the late Mr Stewart-describe d in such glowing terms as a man whose life was devoted to conciliation-as conciliators first and arbitrators secondly, might honestly be accounted a move towards freeing the court of those ""entangling legalisms "" to which my right honourable leader referred. Still , I appreciate the argument that the conciliation commissioners under this bill are to be vested with extensive powers. The fact must be borne in mind, however, that they are not to exercise judicial or penal powers, though they will certainly be entrusted with such responsible duties as will require of them integrity, experience, nnd unpurchasable honesty and i m partiality. My own view is that the commissioners should act in association with the judges, one or more, who should lie the spinal column and the directing brain of. the system. As uniformit y is desirable, it obviously must be sought after and attained between awards of the conciliation commissioners, if and when awards are made by them, and awards made by the judges. The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition that in certain circumstances a commissioner may override or alter the decision of a full court is worthy of further consideration, although I think the danger is more imaginary than real. I believe also that a limited tenure is a safeguard as well as a danger. Under the wages board system, which has been so greatly extolled by honourable members opposite, the chairman exercises, subject to the very rare industrial appeal which is permitted by Victorian legislation, very wide powers; he has no particular qualifications, except insofar as he has been wisely chosen as a person deemed in all the circumstances to be suitable, and he has no security of tenure. We hear fantastic stories about the impending appointment of trade union officials as conciliation commissioners under the bill. I read in the Argus of the 24th JuneThe proposed appointment in the various States of industrial commissioners under the Arbitration Amendment Act has caused a stir in labour circles. Already a number of union secretaries are pressing their claims for appointment, and some have made special visits to Canberra for that purpose. Provision has been made in the act for the appointment of two commissioners for New South Wales. The truth is that no trade unions secretaries have approached the Government on this matter. They have not made any suggestion or application, either directly or indirectly, to me or to any member of the Government, and it would be strange indeed if these gentlemen had come to Canberra, and the Government had remained in ignorance of the object of their mission. The truth is that nothing of the kind has taken place. Again, the Melbourne Herald, of 23rd June, refers to "" a bludgeon against in dustry "" and in its leading article saysIn its general effect the bill gives a dangerous amount of authority to a few militant union leaders. It gives no such authority at all ; none whatever. The Melbourne Argus, of the 5th June, published this heading: "" A r b i tration proposals; absolute power for unions."" There is no power at all, much less absolute power, for unions any more than for any other citizens. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 12th June, among other things in its leading column, says The penal clauses of the existing act are to be repealed as far as unions are concerned, but not for the employers. The unions will he free to flout awards which the employers will be constrained to obey. I need only say, in reply, that such an intention is not expressed in the bill, nor implied in it. Would any honest man, certainly not the Leader of the Opposition, contend that these statements quoted, not from the gutter press, but from leading daily journals, are anything but totally incorrect? They go further, because the Melbourne Herald, which is known to have a wide influence in Victoria, and has associations and interests in London, makes, under the heading of "" Arbitration Bill blunder,"" this statementAdverse comment is being made in financial circles regarding the Australian Arbitration Bill, says the financial editor of the Times. It is hardly likely if the Herald is read and credited in London that the position would be otherwise. The statement continuesSome of the provisions of the measure are considered to be decidedly one-sided, and unlikely to give confidence to investors thinking of establishing industries in Australia consequent on the tariff increases, and the reverse of encouraging to those invited to subscribe Australian loans. That statement is most regrettable, and, indeed,, deplorable, because I kniow thatthis journal is interested in sustaining Australia's credit aud Australia's good name. I know also that it is working to maintain Australia's credit abroad and yet in Victoria it prints about this bill something which is not in it, and which is a veritable travesty of the truth so far as its meaning and contents are concerned, which is subsequently reprinted to our discredit in London. I adrait that there is room for differences of opinion about this legislation. There is any amount of opportunity for honest argument on it, but that very fact is a substantial reason why the contents and the meaning of the bill should not be deliberately misrepresented, and the misrepresentation scattered abroad so as to injure the reputation, not only of the Government, but also of the country for which, at the moment, the Government speaks. Mr Robert Menzies, a barrister practising in Victoria, has not disdained to join in this defamatory chorus, subordinating his legal reputation to somewhat cheap political phrase making. The fact that he has himself associated his status as a KC. with that of an honorary advocate of Argus policy has doubtless led well meaning men like Mr Ashworth, President of the Employers' Federation, and others into serious error and misrepresentation. I adopt Mr Menzies' view, however, that the conciliation commissioner must be highly qualified and sufficiently paid. No doubt he would retire in terror if I were to suggest meeting him on the question of the extended tenure of office of these conciliation commissioners. Does the Leader of the Opposition invite me to give these commissioners a substantial tenure, five or ten years or some such period? That may be worth considering. The honourable gentleman referred to the inequality of the provision relating to the basic wage and standard hours, as evidence apparently of bias. Apparently the suggestion is that that clause is deliberately intended to favour the employee as against the employer, but I submit for his consideration that the two principles involved are radically different. The reducing to of basic standards is a much more serious matter than the increasing, in circumstances of economic buoyancy of wages or the shortening of hours. The former is a matter of grave national concern to be approached in the most deliberate way by responsible men in council with the right in the Attorney-General to intervene, if he so desires, as representing the public interest. The other represents the adjusting in more buoyant conditions of wages and hours, which matter may well be left to a single arbitrator. That is the difference between the two principles involved. The one is a question of improving the standard of the worker on a rising market; the other is a question of whether his basic wage, his necessaries of life, are to be rendered by an award of the court more difficult to procure. The honourable gentleman stated that section 25D means that no regard is to be paid to economic facts.",98
412,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,I referred to its repeal.,99
413,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"- I stand corrected. The honourable gentleman said that the repeal of section 25B means that no regard is to.be paid to economic facts. That represents the first descent of the honourable gentleman to ill-considered criticism. The truth is that the - reference to economic facts was removed because it was regarded as a political gesture designed and calculated to impair the discretion of the judge. It has no other meaning, and I point out, as the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) pointed out this evening in his admirable speech, that for 24 years the Commonwealth Con1 ciliation and Arbitration Act contained no reference whatever to these economic facts. During that time, the greatest judges that we have had in that jurisdiction, if I may be permitted to compare without disparagement, presided over the court. O'Connor, Higgins, Quick and others administered conciliation and arbitration without any necessity for direction by the legislature the question of economic facts. Does anybody think for a single moment that these judges disregarded economic realities? No one does. It was not until 1928 that political pressure was originated for the purpose of directing and influencing the court, and I venture to hope that those responsible for the movement did not succeed in influencing the court. These words having been removed justly, because we think they were improperly inserted, it will be for the judges themselves to consider any facts that occur to them as relevant and proper in making a just award. The honourable member for Fawkner pointed out in his speech that the judges enjoyed a wide discretion in that they were not bound by the rules of evidence, but were required to administer the act having regard to equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the cases that came before them. That is perfectly true. The provision that they shall have regard to economic facts is, insofar as it has any meaning at all, a limitation of the amplitude of the power expressly given to them by the legislature. One wonders when it became a principle of construction that judges, in administering law, are required to construe statutes by reference not to what they contain but to what has been removed from them. However, we are in this happy position, that if any judge desires, as seems to me unlikely, to refer to the objects of this amendment, and to find out what was in the mind of the responsible Minister who submitted Mr Brennan. the bill to Parliament, he may find it on record that it is intended to discourage governments from using the legislature to direct improperly or lead the mind of judges in respect to matters regarding which they should have complete discretion. However, if the clause stands as at present, we may yet have the interesting experience of a full-dress debate in the High Court as to what it really means. This reminds me of the reference of Mr Menzies to the bill as "" a choice morsel of legislative atavism."" Refreshing my memory by reference to the dictionary I found that atavism means reversion to an original type. Candidly, on that is what this bill, in a certain sense not implied by the critic, really is. It is a reversion to the original form of the arbitration act, plus certain sections for which the Leader of the Opposition has taken credit, and plus some other, but not revolutionary, proposals submitted by this Government, minus others to the repeal of which we are committed by popular vote"". I was interested to find in my researches into the meaning of atavism that the present Leader of the Opposition in another place (Sir George Pearce), was himself associated with an earlier bill which made preference to unionists mandatory and absolute, but made no reference to economic facts. One wonders whether Mr Menzies, speaking as he did from a safe Tory electorate in Victoria, expects to dragoon the gentleman to whom I have referred into rejecting this measure which, in this phase at all events, is precisely the same as he fathered many years ago, and which, in fact, in all its principal features, is the same measure. One also wonders whether the leader of another place, in thinking of atavism and of fledgling economists, will remember the dictum about teaching one's grandmother to suck eggs. the There is only one political gesture which this Government recognises as fitting for this or any other Parliament to make in this matter- It is that this and all other systems of arbitration must fail, and none will be encouraged by the present Government, unless recognition is given to the fundamental principle laid down by Mr. Justice Higgins in his own imperishable words that wage fixing can in no circumstances be permitted, without challenge, to do violence to the social conscience. Arbitration can never be tolerated to become, and I hope is not likely to become, an instrument of social oppression or an offence against social decency. The Leader of the Opposition has complained of the removal of the inhibitions contained in section 38D of the act. This reminds me that the most flagrantly unfounded charges against the bill is that it removes all penalties upon the workers. One could wish that it were practicable to do this; but I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the penalties to which he referred are themselves one-sided, in that they operate only against trade unionists. That from the nature of the case may be understandable, but the general policy of this bill is to reduce the penal provisions of the act to a minimum. But the various penal disciplinary clauses which unhappily still remain in the act have added to them the additional disciplinary power in proposed new section 38, paragraph oa to set aside an award or any terms of an award. When honourable members opposite say that this bill abolishes all penalties upon the employees they forget that the following provision still remains in the act:38. The Court shall, as regards every industrial dispute of which it has cognizance, have power(c) to fix maximum penalties for any breach or non-observance of any term of an order or award, not exceeding One thousand pounds in the case of an organization or an employer, not being a member of an organization bound by the order or award, or ten pounds in the case of on individual member of an organization. (d) to impose penalties, not exceeding the maximum penalties fixed (or, if maximum penalties have not been fixed, not exceeding mum penalties which could have been fixed) under the last preceding paragraph, for any breach or non-observance of any term of an order or award proved to the faction of the court to have been committed; In addition to that, there are many other grounds upon which the registration of a union may be cancelled. It may be cancelled, indeed, for any cause which the court thinks fit. Penalties are still provided for breaches of agreements, contempt of court, and so on. It will be seen therefore that it is totally incorrect to say that all penalties against the employees are being removed! Much ill-considered vapouring has been vented upon the proposal to abolish one of the secret ballot provisions of the act. The Labour party is not opposed to the secret ballot; it is favourable to it ; but it is against espionage, disloyalty to majority rule, and interference with the domestic affairs of a union. It is against the application of an inquisitorial procedure to trade unions which is not applied in anything like the same way to any other organization, company, friendly society, or club of self-respecting men. If this argument fails to convince the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) of the justice of the present, proposal he should be convinced by the undeniable fact that the secret ballot provisions of the act have proved to be futile and impracticable. In one instance only, namely, that of the New South Wales branch of the Federated Clerks Union, has there been a moderately successful ballot under these provisions, and that was conducted largely with the consent of the union. Secret ballot by consent may be held at any time, and with that policy the Labour party is in entire accord. I do not propose to refer in detail at this moment to other objections that have been taken to the bill. There will be opportunities at the committee stags to do that, and I shall avail myself of them. The Government does not expect that the passage of this bill will result in either miracles or revolutions, but it submits the measure to the House as an honest contribution to the peace, order the maxi- and good government of the Commonwealth. I regret that it should have been the subject of so much ill-informed and ill-considered criticism from persons satis- of an order of intelligence which would lead one to expect that they would at least inform themselves of its contents before proceeding to asperse the motives of the Government in introducting it.

416,Mr THEODORE,CONCILIATION AND,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [5.42 a.m. ]-by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. I desire to outline the reasons which prompted the Government to enter into this agreement, and also to give the particulars of the agreement itself, so that honourable members may become familiar with the proposal. The purpose of the bill is to ratify the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and Western Australia granting financial assistance to that State by indemnifying it in respect of certain guarantees given by it to the Midland Bank Limited in relation to the advances made by the bank to the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited. Besides ratifying the agreement, the bill provides for the appropriation of such an amount as may be necessary to meet any liability of the Commonwealth arising under the agreement. The agreement to be ratified is printed as a schedule to the bill. The annextures to the agreement have not been printed, but photostat copies are available for perusal by honourable members, and I have handed one to the Leader of the Opposition. The agreement contains the following particulars :- (1) Particulars of the gold mining leases owned by the company near Wiluna in the East Murchison gold-field. (2) That the company has borrowed £300,000 from the Midland Bank. (3) That the company has given the bank notes promising to pay the bank £25,000 each half year in reduction of the advances. (4) That Western Australia has given the bank guarantees for the due payment by the company of the notes. (5) That the Commonwealth is prepared, subject to ratification by the Commonwealth Parliament, to indemnify the State against any loss in the matter. (6) That the company has executed in favour of the Treasurer of Western Australia a mortgage of its leases, and a bill of sale of its chattels. The principal provisions of the agreement are(1) The Commonwealth is to indemnify the State in respect of any los3 suffered by it under the guarantees given by the State. (2) Moneys so paid by the Commonwealth to be as an addition to the special financial assistance granted to the State in recognition of the disabilities suffered by the 'State under federation. (3) The State, before calling on the Commonwealth, to recover from the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited by enforcing its rights under the mortgage and bill of sale. In November, 1929, representatives of the Wiluna Gold Mine Limited asked the Commonwealth to guarantee an overdraft of £300,000 with the company's bank. []24] The company stated that its capital of £1,000,000 would shortly be exhausted; that it required a further £550,000 to complete its first unit of plant; that it desired to raise £300,000 from its bankers subject to a Government guarantee; and that it could then raise the balance of £250,000 from the public. The company undertook to repay the £300,000 by halfyearly payments of £25,000 each, commencing in June, 1931. The company stated that it was adopting improved methods of mining which, if successful, and applied to other mines known to possess large deposits of. low grade ore of similar characteristics, would result in an increase of the output of gold from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 yearly, and would greatly increase the number of men employed. The company was informed that the Commonwealth Government would not grant financial assistance direct to the company, but would be prepared to cooperate with the Government of Western Australia in extending financial assistance provided the Government of Western Australia was satisfied that the Wiluna enterprise was of such a nature as to warrant Government aid. The Commonwealth undertook that if th-j Government of Western Australia was willing to guarantee a bank overdraft up to £300,000 repayable by the company at the rate of £50,000 per annum, the Commonwealth would be prepared to recoup the State against any losses arising from such guarantee. It was stated at the time that, any assistance in this case was to be regarded as an addition to the special assistance granted to the State in recognition of the disabilities suffered by the State under federation. The offer, of course, was to be subject to ratification by Parliament. The Western Australian Government subsequently guaranteed the overdraft granted by the Midland Bank to the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited. The Commonwealth has now entered into an agreement with the State of Western Australia on the lines indicated. Satisfactory reports regarding the prospects of the mine, and special reports in regard to the mining and metallurgical processes to be adopted, have been received by the Commonwealth. The most important aspect of this proposal is that relating to the methods to he adopted hy this company in carrying on mining operations. It is expected that these new methods will make possible profitable mining operations in .many centres for some years to come. special method adopted by the Wiluna Qold Mines Limited are dealt with in the reports of the technical officers of the company, and of a State mining engineer. I have a number of documents from which I desire to quote, because they throw light upon the mining and metallurgical methods that are to be adopted at Wiluna,' and indicate also the progress that has been made up to date. The first is a letter from Mr H . E. Vail, consulting engineer, addressed to the then Premier of Western Australia, the Hon. Philip Collier, and dated the 16th January, 1930. In it Mr Vail, on behalf of the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited, sets out the proposal that he made to the Commonwealth Government, and recounts the proposition that was placed before the Government of Western Australia for financial support. The relevant paragraphs are as follow:Following on my recent interview with you on behalf of the Wiluna Gold Mines, Limited, I now make formal application for your vitally necessary assistance which will enable us to provide further capital to complete the installation of plant and preparation of our mines at Wiluna, for an output of 40,000 tons of ore per month. The original capital of £1,000,000 provided for the purchase, development and equipment of the mines is now exhausted and according to the estimates provided by our General Manager, we require a further £550,000 to complete our undertaking. My principals advise me that this sum is absolutely beyond their ability to raise. They have, however, intimated that if the Government will provide a bank guarantee for £300,000 it will not be beyond their ability to raise a further £250,000 of fresh capital, in view of the confidence which will be inspired by the Government's action in responding in this practical manner. It has been known to us for some considerable time that we would exceed the capital available in bringing our property to production and under ordinary circumstances it would not 'have been difficult for our principals to provide the necessary funds, but owing to the crash of the New York and London exchanges, it has become very difficult to obtain loans, and to undertake to raise money by an increase in the capitalization of the company at this stage wo.uld be absolutely impossible. The first instructions I received were 'that I approach the Federal Government for an Mr Theodore. advance of a very substantial nature; alternatively to. request the State Government to provide a bank guarantee of £300,000. On interviewing the Prime Minister ('Mir. Scullin), and the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Theodore), I was informed that it was absolutely impossible for the Government to The comply with our request as they themselves were much in need of cash. It then occurred to me to request them to guarantee our bankers rather than to approach the State Government, realizing as I do that the State Government has at all times shown a disposition to assist mining as far as their resources would permit, and that in regard to Wiluna they have gone very far in providing a railway for our convenience. I therefore requested the Commonwealth Government to guarantee our bank for £300,000, and while they expressed, their sympathy and desire to assist us, they pointed out the inadvisability of making such a grant to an individual company, but suggested that if your Government would, make the guarantee which I desired, they would guarantee your Government against loss. These are the terms on which I now ask you to consent to giving us a guarantee. You will realise that in so doing you are incurring no risk whatever; in fact, there is no risk to the Federal Government as our undertaking is a sound business proposition, and we are prepared to enter into an agreement to reduce the guarantee at regular intervals at the rate of £50,000 per year from the commencement of operations. To substantiate my claim that the undertaking is a sound business proposition I will call your attention to the fact that before our principals undertook to raise any capital they satisfied themselves by reports by competent mining engineers that there was an abundance of ore and that it could be successfully treated at a profit. When the State Government was approached to lay down a railway, they caused an examination to be made by their responsible officer and on his report the railway was constructed. Thus, we have the reports from two independent sources by engineers fully qualified and reputable. . . . It is acknowledged that the cost of preparing the mine and equipping it for' 40,000 tons is enormous, but I justify the expenditure with the assurance that we are pioneering mining methods not previously employed in Australia. It is recognized by all those familiar with gold-mining in Australia that there are millions of tons of ore which only require a reduced cost of production to restore gold-mining to the high position of the principal primary production of the State that it enjoyed in the best days of the Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie goldflelds. That our efforts will be successful there can be no doubt whatever, and following our success interest will be revived in gold-mining, and many mining centres throughout Australia which are now mere remembrances of the early days 'will again blossom into prosperous mining centres. . . . . Already the Lake View and Star Company have recognized that the adoption of modern mining and treatment methods will be the salvation of tlieir group of mines at K a l goorlie and have committed themselves to a policy involving an expenditure of over £1,000,000. What applies to the Lake View and Star and Wiluna mines will be followed by other companies in. Australia and in complying with my request for assistance you will be granting to mining generally a concession of enormous value.: The output of gold from the first unit of the Wiluna plant will amount, to approximately, £60,000 per month, and as soon as the Lake View and Star have increased their tonnage from the present, output to 40,000 or 50,000 tons per month, from these two properties alone the output of gold from Western Australia will be approximately double its present figure. I combine these two mines in my argument, as the financial interests supporting both Wiluna and Lake View ventures are identical. There is nothing which will so quickly and permanently stabilize the finances of Australia and improve her credit abroad as an increased production of gold. There is also no primary industry which requires so much capital to establish production as gold-mining and there is no industry which distributes so much of its production locally. It is quite safe to assume that 90 per cent, of the value of the gold produced will be distributed in Australia. I venture to say that every £1 sterling produced from our Australian mines is of greater value to the Commonwealth than £1 sterling value of any other primary productions. In pursuing our present programme we will , during the next twelve months, according to  salaries alone, £190,000. . . . I have pleasure in handing your herewith a copy of the methods proposed and adopted, whicfl I am sure will prove interesting reading to the mining section of your administration. . . . The next document is a report hy the State Mining Engineer, who was in office in 1927. He reported on the request of the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited for the railway connection of Wiluna with the State railway system. He summarizes the mining proposals at Wiluna in the following termsThe Wiluna Mines Limited's proposition has now been well proved. The lodes are long and wide. They have provided 340,711 tons of ore from above the 100-ft. level, returning £565,604 worth of gold, and it is now proved that good ore extends beyond the limits of the older workings, so that there is strong probability that the output from the first 100 feet will be not less than 400,000 tons. The work at 140-ft., 200-ft., and 290-ft. levels has shown that the lodes maintain size and value similar to those above the 100-ft. level, leading to a very reasonable expectation of a like amount and value of ore being obtainable from each 100 feet in depth down to 300 feet, while the, diamond d r ill boring which has been, done,* gives, good grounds for believing that the size and value will continue much the same for another 500 feet in depth. There is no visible geological reason why they should not continue to like depths as the Kalgoorlie lodes, and have a similar life of not less than, say, 25 years. Other mines at Wiluna, not at present working, have produced to the end of 1926 a further amount pf 197,974 tons of ore, returning 122,065 fine ounces of gold of value £518,133,. bringing the total production of the field to 538,685 tons of ore., returning 225,220 ounces of fine gold of value .£1,083,737, showing that the company's mines are not by any means the only ones in the district; that if the field be revived there is great promise that a further large production of gold will come from leases other than those of the Wiluna Mines Limited. A. proportion of the mine sampling and assays on which thevaluation of the ore reserves has been made has been checked, with the result that the mine returns of assay values may be accepted as entirely reliable. The estimates of tonnage and total value more or less "" in sight"", may also be accepted as quite reasonable, although, as explained in Appendix 1 (A ) , I should personally prefer not to include any tonnage below the lowest levels on the lodes. The mine estimate of ore reserves as at 18th May, 1927, is 686,460 short tons of average assay value 40s. 3d, per short ton. There appears to be every reason to expect a long life for the mine, say, 25 years at least, at the estimated output of 1,000 short tons per working day. There is no reason to fear any unusual metallurgical difficulty in getting a quite satisfactory extraction of gold from the Wiluna ore. It is expected that concentration by flotation followed by roasting and cyaniding of the concentrates can be made to give an even better and cheaper economical result than the standard sulphide treatment by roasting the whole of the ore before cyaniding, but the latter can be relied on for very satisfactory results if flotation should not come up to expectations. . . . The last document is a report hy the present State Mining Engineer, which was communicated to the Commonwealth Government by the Government of Western Australia. It states the views of the writer, and gives an account of the up-todate mining system known as the sublevel system, as well as of the metallurgical processes that are to be adopted in the treatment of the ore at Wiluna. The relevant at portions are as followThe main vertical shaft is larger than any other vertical shaft in this State, its dimensions being 24 f t . 4 in. x 5 f t . 3 in. inside timbers. It is divided into four compartments, two of which will be used for hauling ore in skips holding 4 tons each, capacity 60,000 tons per month from 1,500-ft. level. . . . The ore will be stoped by means of a sublevel system. Between the main haulage levels, drivi'S of small dimensions arc put in along the lode about 25 feet under one another, and from these sub-levels the ore can be stoped from a maximum number of faces, thus providing a fast rate of extraction. It is claimed for this method of stoping that it not only gives quick extraction, but that it provides for close mining of the ore, quick delivery of broken ore to the surface, good ventilation, a maximum of safety, and low costs. The sub-level method is shown in longitudinal section of the company's report for the year ended 31st March. 192!i. It has not been used in this State previously (shrink, r ill or flat back stoping arc customary here), but it is employed in America and elsewhere with good results. The 8-ft. by 8-ft. haulage levels driven parallel with the lode will accommodate locomotives electrically driven by storage batteries, and capable of hauling rakes of trucks loaded with 30 tons of ore. The ore will thus be transported from various points along the main levels to ore pockets or bins near the main shaft. From these pockets (capacity 400 tons) the ore will bo filled into 4-ton skips and hauled to the surface. Near the service station or plat at each haulage level wil l be a chamber in which the storage batteries used on the locomotives will be charged. The lqcomotives will go to the chamber at intervals to deposit discharged batteries and take on re-charged batteries. This w i ll bo the first occasion in the history of mining in this State when underground haulage of ore will be done by motive power. It has been the custom to the present time for ore trucks to be wheeled by men or drawn by lu.scs, and the improved method to be adopted by this company wil l provide a welcome advancement . . . The underground workings are being opened up for a production of 40,000 tons of ore per month, the largest in this State from one mine. It can be said with complete justification that the methods adopted are in conformity with best modern practice. It is many years since a large mine was opened up in this State, and as the advancement in mining engineering has boon great during the past two ov three decades, it is not surprising (although very pleasing) that the lay-out for - this mine's development is abreast of the times and superior to anything we have had in the past. There are features new to this State at Wiluna gold mine, but not new to mining engineering. There is no suggestion of the application of untried methods, but, on the contrary, the choice of the most suitable of approved methods has been carefully made. It may not be amiss to state that the use of electric haulage underground is included in the large development programme now being pushed ahead at the Lake View and Star Limited's group of mines at Kalgoorlie. The ore will be treated for the recovery of its gold contents briefly as follows:-From ' time the ore is fed into skips until treatment has been completed it will be handledmechanically. When it is automatically discharged from the skips it falls Mr Theodore. (into, a gyratory crusher and is reduced to 4 inch size, and passes to Symonds cone crushers which reduce it to i inch, and is then conveyed to bins. It is automatically fed to Hardinge mills which reduce the grade to 10 mesh. After classification the ore passes through tube mills which reduce it to minus 200 mesh. The pulp is thickened and pumped to the flotation section, where the mineral containing the gold is recovered, filtered; andi washed with fresh water. The residue is discarded. The concentrate is then conveyed through Lowden driers heated with waste heat from the roasting furnaces. The dried concentrate is roasted in Edwards type furnaces, then cooled, mixed with cyanide solution, agitated, and the gold-bearing liquor is recovered in Oliver filters. The gold is precipitated from the solution by the MerrillCrowo process, and reduced to metal by the usual well-known methods. The gold contents of the ore are held in mineral which consists mostly of pyritc and arsenopyrite in the average proportion of 3.5 per cent, of the former and 2.5 per cent, of the latter. The mineral is disseminated in a fine state of division throughout the ore, and it is necessary in the first place to crush and grind the ore very finely, so that it will pass through the meshes of a sieve containing 200 apertures to the lineal inch, ov 40,000 apertures per square inch. Since the advent of the flotation process for the concentration of minerals from ores, improvements in fine grinding machinery have been made rapidly. At the present time, thousands of tons of ore per day are being finely ground at mines in Australia at small cost."" The machines and methods selected for this part of the process at Wiluna gold mines are the most efficient obtainable. The ore having been reduced to a very fine grade, the recovery of the gold-bearing constituents is commenced. A great deal of research work has been done both in the laboratory and in a pilot plant to determine the best procedure to be adopted for the successful concentration of the gold-bearing mineral by the flotation process. W it h the aid of re-agents a very thorough concentration can be effected, and I am satisfied that the success of this part of the process is assured. Before the concentrate is roasted, it must be well washed with fresh water to eliminate salt contained in the mine water in which it is treated up to this point. Tho presence of salt in the concentrate would readily volatilize the gold during roasting, a condition certain to cause losses of a serious nature. There is no reason why this cannot be done; in fact, it is a simple operation, and also an important one. The roasting process is very well known and understood in this State, as are also the subsequent stages of recovery of the gold. The application of the flotation process to the concentration of auriferous ores has not been generally necessary. The process is most the extensively applied to the treatment of base underground metal ores, some of them also containing gold and silver. In quite recent years a few gold 1 mines in various parts of the world hove successfully adopted the process. We have arrived at the stage when it can be stated, as a result of research work done by mining companies and at our own laboratory over a period of several years, that many pyritic gold-bearing ores in this State, including those at Wiluna and Kalgoorlie, can be successfully treated by flotation. The ore at Wiluna contains arsenic as well as pyritc; the ore at Kalgoorlie contains tellurium in addition to pyritc. The proper regulation of heat when roasting concentrate from either ore will obviate losses of gold. The roasted products w i ll yield their gold contents to chemical treatment . . . There is no doubt that the methods new to this State relative to underground workings and surface plant, which have been mentioned previously, will prove to be valuable factors in the mine's operations. It is my opinion that they will lie introduced into other mines in this State and elsewhere in Australia as circumstances permit. The general lay-out of underground operations, treatment plant, and equipment, combined with the efficiency of the plant and machinery, must result in low working costs, and thus provide a sound margin of profit. Some of our auriferous ores cannot be treated successfully in the raw state on account of refractory mineral contents. It is an expensive inatter to roast the whole tonnage of finely-ground ore. so costly, indeed, and in some casus so unsatisfactory, that mines have been compelled to cease operations in consequence. In the hope of definitely establishing a satisfactory process for certain ores, close attention has been given for some years to research work. As a result of investigations there are two flotation plants at present in course of construction. It seems certain that the time is not far distant when refractory ores will be treated profitably at mines now closed down. The vast sulphide lodes at Wiluna have had to lie unworked for many years awaiting the development of a successful treatment process. It can be confidently anticipated that the ment process now being installed on such sound lines after searching investigation will not only be a profitable undertaking for the company, but will also lead to a revival of the gold-mining industry. Those documents, I feel sure, will he sufficient to make honourable members quite familiar with what is intended at Wiluna. A careful perusal of them will show that the Commonwealth Government is justified in standing behind the Government of Western Australia in this guarantee. The two Governments have great expectations with respect to the results that are likely to accrue from the granting of this support to the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited, not so much in relation to what may be developed at Wiluna itself, but as a demonstration there of modern methods of mining, and their applicability to other low grade propositions in different States - continent",102
417,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,"Wit h this sum, what will be the total amount of assistance granted to Western Australia?",107
418,Mr THEODORE,CONCILIATION AND,"If there were an entire loss under this guarantee, the liability upon the Commonwealth would be £300,000. But that liability will have to be reduced at the rate of £50,000 per annum, commencing next year; and it is secured upon the whole of the present assets of the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited. There is, of course, in addition, an annual grant to Western Australia amounting to £300,000 under the States Grants Act of 1927. Debate (on motion by Mr GULLETT) adjourned. NEW BUSINESS APTER 11 P.M. SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS . M o t i o n (by Mr Scullin ) agreed to The Standing. Order No. 70 (eleven o'clock rule) be suspended for the remainder of this sitting in order to allow further new business to be taken. FORESTRY BUREAU BILL . 4 SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 10th June {vide page 2578) on motion by Mr BLAKELEI*That the bill be now read a second time.",107
419,Mr GULLETT,CONCILIATION AND,"Henty) [5.53 a.m.] This measure, as the Minister pointed out in his second-reading speech, is practically identical with that which was intreattroduced by the last Government in 1928, the differences being immaterial. The measure has my cordial support. The Minister referred to a ""forestry sense."" Unhappily, the forestry sense in this country, and I fear also in most other countries, is a sleepy, careless sense. It is a good thing, therefore, that at last the Commonwealth-in a modest way, it is true-is beginning to tackle this great subject. Although the amount to be expended annually is small, the objective is fairly comprehensive. The bill proposes that a good beginning shall be made. The work to be undertaken by the Commonwealth, although at first of somewhat trifling dimensions, will, I believe, give a stimulus to the States, and lead to an increasing recognition of the great importance of forestry in all its branches in this young country. When one, considers forestry, one visualizes this as it appeared when the first pioneers landed upon it. At that time, practically from ocean to ocean, with the exception of some portions of the interior, Australia was a great, wide, sparkling greenwood. The changes that have come over the face of the continent, owing to the activities of man in the course of a century, are remarkable. As we all know, the destruction of the timbers of Australia, insofar as they have been destroyed, has not been so damaging as might at first sight appear. The destruction in the great pastoral and agricultural areas, first by ring-barking, and later by clearing, was, of course, necessary. But although that was so in connection with much of the elimination of the forests of Australia, we have perhaps prosecuted that work with somewhat relentless activity, and probably have carried the destruction far beyond what was essential to the winning of sustenance and profit from the soil of our rural areas. There is, however, still time, if we take this great subject seriously, and devote to it that expenditure and labour which it well merits, and which would meet with a substantial and relatively early return, to make wonderful progress within the next 25 years in placing the whole matter upon a thoroughly satisf actory basis. As the Minister pointed out, the object of preserving and replanting our forests is not merely to win commercial timbers in the future. There is an equally great, if not a greater, urge upon us to take forestry more seriously because of its effect upon rainfall, not in the promotion of precipitation, but in its .proper conservation and distribution precipitation. We know that over wide areas in Australia the destruction of timbers by ring-barking, and particularly by firing in the mountains, has already had a profound effect upon the with which rainwater, once it has descended, is collected in our streams and carried to the sea. That is of the greatest importance to 'the welfare of this country. Even in this Federal Capital Territory, with' its undulating one may find in the course of an hour hundreds of extensive courses that are the ' direct consequences of forest destruction -'- In the Mr Gullett. old days, when the country was under forest, the moisture due to the rainfall was held in the soil, slowly percolated through it to the watercourses or was largely conserved in springs. The distribution of the water through the soil continued more or less throughout the year. To-day, however, if the rainfall is at all heavy, the bulk of the water passes away within a few hours, and on this account the value of a good rainfall is very greatly diminished. It was my good fortune to travel a few thousand miles in China and Korea five or six years ago. In visiting China one is surprised to note the bleak and bare appearance of that remarkable country. Even the mountain systems have been entirely denuded of their forests, and when there is a heavy rainfall the water no longer lingers and gradually flows into the streams, but quickly rushes into the great rivers and is carried out to sea. When the Japanese took over Korea-and I am neither applauding nor condemning their occupation of that country-its condition with respect to timber was like that of China, but, when I visited Korea vast areas of young forests had been planted by the local inhabitants under the direction of the Japanese. These forests extended up the mountain sides, and within a few years the whole aspect of the country will have been changed, and an enormous additional value given to the land, because of the timber growing on it and the agricultural possibilities due to afforestation. As I have said, the bill is a modest one, but it is comprehensive. It will give a distinct stimulus to the whole after practice of afforestation in the Commonwealth. It will encourage the training of forestry officers, for service in the various States, and for these reasons I constant cordially support the measure.",107
420,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong) [6.3 a.m.]. rapidity - I regard the bill as profoundly important, though probably entirely noncontroversial. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) has said that the proposal originated with the late Government, which had a very real concountry, ception of the importance of forestry to Australia. I intend to speak, in particuwater lar, on two matters. The Federal Territory is near the south-eastern corner of Australia, where we have the greatest natural system of water conservation existing on this continent. If we had mountains well inland corresponding in size and extent with those in this portion of Australia, the advantages would be great. On the highlands amongst these mountains, with many parts of which I am familiar, we have wonderful and beautiful areas known as the Snow Plains. Years ago they were largely covered with morasses, marshes.and swamps. I visit them, I am glad to say, nearly every year, and I have seen them drying up by degrees. As the forests on the sides of the mountains have been largely destroyed, when rain falls the water rushes down the slopes more rapidly than it did. The whole south-western aspect of Kosciusko is like a grey ghost compared with what it used to'be. On the highlands the snow gums and the heaths which covered the gravel and the rocks have been burned. In places there are little trees about a foot high a.nd with a spread of six or eight feet and with trunks as thick as a man's arm, which must have taken a great many years to grow, but when a fire sweeps through them they are destroyed in a few minutes, and will never come again. Large areas which used to be veritable sponges, so well did they hold the water, are now mere dry gravel or rock, and the erosion is constantly increasing. On these highlands falls the water that fills the Hume Dam, and upon the proper conservation of water in these mountains depends the success of the irrigation system fed from that reservoir. As the vegetation decreases the silting due to erosion increases. The flow of water becomes more rapid year by year, but there is not the constant supply of former years. Accordingly, the preservation of forests in this part of Australia is, I suggest, one of the most important national problems that confronts the people. I speak not only as one interested in the welfare of the nation, but also as a lover of this portion of Australia, and as one who is desirous of seeing our natural forests preserved. Year after year fires are allowed to destroy the snow gums and other forest timber. I most cordially support any measure that offers a chance of dealing with these important matters. I am glad to notice that the bill, in clause 5, provides that the powers and functions of the Bureau shall extend to the establishment of experimental stations for the study of sylviculture and forest management and protection, and for the provision of facilities for the education and training of pro* fessional foresters. The subject of forestry education in Australia has, until very recent years, been rather deplorably neglected. Various efforts along these lines have been made, and most successfully in South Australia, but there has not been that determined continuity of effort which alone can bring useful results. Forestry, I suppose, is referred to in the policy speech of every State Premier, but very little in the direction of afforestation or other definite forest policy has been done. Only recently an Empire Forestry Conference was held at Canberra, and it recommended that higher education in forestry should be undertaken by the State Universities conjointly with the Canberra School of Forestry. That conclusion was arrived at with the approval of the representatives of all the States. In South Australia a forestry school had been in operation before the establishment of the Canberra institution, which was set up as the result of an understanding between the States and the Commonwealth that higher education in forestry should be given in the national capital. In Victoria, there is a forestry school of long standing at Creswick, and, unfortunately, some difficulties have arisen between the Victorian and Federal authorities in relation to the nature of the training to be given, and the place at which it is to be provided. I refer to this matter for the purpose of expressing the hope that the Minister will do whatever he can to see that the recommendation of the Forestry Conference is carried out. I am a member of the governing body of the University of Melbourne and have been for a number of years, and I was astonished not long ago to find that the Council of the University had received an offer from the Government of Victoria to provide the salary of a senior lecturer in forestry. As a member of the Council of that' institution, I can assure this House that I usually accept with both Lands, and very readily, any. offer of financial assistance for any branch of education. But the significance of the offer was that its acceptance would involve the introduction of higher education in forestry upon what I regard as an attenuated and entirely unsatisfactory scale, notwithstanding that an agreement had been entered into by the Victorian Government itself that this education should be given at the Canberra school. There is to be a two years' science course at the universities, and a two years' course at the forestry school, subject to approval by the universities, of staff and Curriculum, which I , as a university man, would always seek to insist upon. These conditions were acceptable to the forestry authorities in Canberra. The degree is to be granted after the four years' course. I hope that the Minister look into this subject, and see that there is no further division and dissipation of effort. In too many directions in Australia we are dividing our efforts unnecessarily. I am not a believer in unification as such, but I do favour unity of effort, and, in such a matter as forestry, where we are able to carry out an agreement of the nature proposed, I think ' that everything should be done to give effect to it. If the present Government of Victoria proposes to continue the offer of the late Government of that State to provide advanced instruction in forestry at the University of Melbourne, I suggest that the Minister might look into the matter and. see whether there can be a thorough discussion of it, in order that there shall not be an entirely unnecessary division of staff and a dissipation of the too limited resources available for this work.  I have been interested in this blems subject for many years, and I take exception to the action of deficiency the Government in forcing the second reading of.the bill through the House this hour of the morning. I had made good deal of preparation by way of search to enable me to discuss the meas^ ure; but it is not fair to other honourable members that I should detain them by making a long speech at this hour, and do not intend to do so.",108
421,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member may proceed with his remarks.  chamber had any idea that this bill was to be hurriedly passed, and particularly after an all-night sitting on the Arbitration Bill I am sure that a number of honourable members would have liked an opportunity to discuss the bill. The development of the science of forestry and the part played by South Australia in it is a very interesting subject, to which I had proposed to devote some time. But at this hour of the morning I have no option but to put my notes aside. I suppose that other honourable members also will regret that the preparations that they have made to speak on the subject have been in vain. Although I regret the tactics which the will Government has adopted, I shall support the bill.",110
422,Mr NAIRN,CONCILIATION AND,"Perth) [6.16 a.m.] - I commend the Minister, for the careful and thoughtful resume of the problem of forestry he gave when moving the second reading of the bill. The conservation of forests is of the greatest importance to Australia, and it is unfortunate that only in recent years have our Governments and people developed a forestry sense. Whilst the Commonwealth is to be congratulated on having obtained for its forestry branch an able principal and staff, it is regrettable that the branch should have to operate in a climate so unsuitable as that of Canberra. The best forests are grown in districts with a fairly heavy rainfall, and we have only to look at the vicinity of Canberra to recognize that this Territory is entirely unsuitable for the production of large timber. It is pitiable to see eucalypts being propagated in hothouses. One of the greatest timber prois the shortage of softwoods, and an effort is being made to supply that by plantations of pines in the Federal Capital Territory. I do not at profess to have any technical knowledge a of this subject, but I am authoritatively reinformed that the trees have not made much progress, and do not offer any bright prospect of developing to a commercial size. I think the branch would I have been wiser had it undertaken these activities in some of the wetter portions of the Commonwealth, including Tasmania, where the chance of success would have been greater. Softwoods are urgently required; today Australia is importing these timbers to four times the value of the hardwoods it is exporting. That regrettable state of affairs is due largely to the fact that our forestry policy in the past was not wisely conceived. The Minister stated that in many areas milling has ceased because the forests have been cut out. That is true to some extent of eastern Australia, where milling is. not profitable under existing conditions. There the saw-milling industry has become almost a negligible activity. At one tifpe the export of heavy woods was an important feature of the country's trade, but now it is confined to the sending of a few piles from New South Wales to New Zealand and the export of a small amount of hardwood from Tasmania. greater portion of the export trade is from Western Australia. The only reason why saw-milling has been able to continue in that State with some measure of success is that it still has extensive forests which can be easily and economically worked. That is illustrated by a table prepared by Mr Green, of the Commonwealth Forestry Branch, showing the relative quantities of timber that can be produced in the various States per man to be:-Wester n Australia, 3,400 cubic feet; Tasmania, 2,300 cubic feet; Queensland, 2,000 cubic feet; New South Wales, 1,611 cubic feet; and Victoria, 965 cubic feet. Yet even in Western Australia the value of the industry as a producer of wealth is diminishing, not because of a shortage of timber, but through the absence of profitable markets. Millions of feet of timber is awaiting export, and the manager of the State saw-mills has twice been sent round the world to search for markets. Unfortunately the hardwood export trade has been killed by the increased cost of production. I have an authoritative statement from the largest saw-milling company in Western Australia that the cost of producing sawn timber has increased since 1914 by approximately 100 per cent. The timber is available in abundance, but the cost of milling it is so great that people, find it more profitable use cheaper substitutes,' and hardwood is being ousted in many capacities by iron. Honourable members opposite talk a great deal about unemployment. Although thousands of workless men are walking the streets of Sydney, several thousands of pounds worth of imported timber is being used in connection with the construction of the North Shore bridge; Australian timber could"" have been used had it been obtainable at a reasonable price. It is distressing to see the timber industry following gold mining and other native industries into oblivion. I am glad .that the Commonwealth is paying attention to the subject of forestry. The scheme that has been undertaken by the bureau is rather ambitious, and I hope that the bureau will not be another of those government activities which continue to grow until they become a serious burden on the finances. I have every appreciaThe tion of the work it is doing, but the Minister will be wise to see that it develops gradually. It is valuable for instructive and advisory purposes, but the practical work of forestry must be done by the States. Very useful operations are being carried out by the Forestry Department in Western Australia, and it is expending £80,000 per annum on reafforestation. It would be a pity if its activities were made subsidiary to those of the Commonwealth Bureau. I welcome the interest that has been taken in this matter by the Commonwealth, and I hope that the Ministry will continue to recognise the importance of forestry research and education, and give to it all possible assistance. [Quorum formed.]",110
423,Mr JONES,CONCILIATION AND,"Indi) ['6.30 a.m.]- I welcome this bill as a belated effort on the part of the Commonwealth Government to take an interest in forestry. We do not recognize the value of the timber industry of Australia. I understand that all the timber used in this chamber is Australian, and one cannot but admire the beautiful panelling and polished-floors. We have in Australia extensive forests of timber, hundreds of mills, and thousands of men who are capable of working in that industry, but unfortunately they are out of work today. During the last few days I have received, telegrams from one porto tion of my electorate in which 500 timber workers are unemployed, and there is a possibility of another 200 being unemployed shortly in view of our large imports of timber. During the last financial year we imported timber to the value of £4,000,000. Practically right in the heart of the timber country in my electorate a large guest house was recently constructed entirely of foreign timber. That is certainly a Gilbertian situation. Unfortunately, our timber millers are unable to compete against foreign millers. I have had the privilege of seeing the result of the extensive afforestation undertaken in France. There, miles of undulating country is covered with timber, and as trees are cut down others are planted in their place. I also have had the privilege of visiting South Africa, where extensive areas of pines are growing on land that would not keep a rabbit to the acre. I have seen in the northeastern districts of Victoria forests of pines grown on land that would otherwise be valueless. I agree with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) that we have a market for softwoods. Many of the softwoods that are imported can be grown here. They should be, and will be, grown here more extensively when the Commonwealth sees fit to assist afforestation. Recently, I had the pleasure of inspecting the new city hall in Brisbane, in the construction of which Australian timber was used. In the Herald this week I read that our timbers, to the value of £250,000 were exported to the United States of America to be used there as veneers for furniture. That country appreciates our woods, although we do not. We have beautiful timber in our siliy oak, Queensland maple, and fiddleback. I welcome the bill and I trust that some benefit will result from it.",111
424,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Oxley) [6.35 a.m.] When the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) was addressing himself to this bill he invited honourable members to visualize Australia as it existed prior to the advent of the white man. He then proceeded to draw a picture, and as he-did so my mind went back to a few paragraphs which I had read some years ago in a book written by Edward Bok. They read as follows:Along an island in the North Sea, five miles from the Dutch coast, stretches a dangerous ledge of rocks that has proved the graveyard of - many a vessel sailing that turbulent sea. On this island oncelived a group of men who, as each vessel was wrecked, looted the vessel and murdered those of the crew who reached shore. The Government of the Netherlands decided to exterminate the island pirates, and for the job King William selected a young lawyer at The Hague. "" I want you to clean up that island "", was the royal order. It was a formidable job for a young man of twenty-odd years. By royal proclamation he was made mayor of the. island, and within a year, a court of law being established, the young attorney was appointed judge; and in that dual capacity he ""cleaned up "" the island. The young man now decided to settle on the island, and he began to look around for a home. It was a grim place, barren of tree or living green of any kind; it was as if a man had been exiled to Siberia. Still, argtfed the young mayor, an ugly place is ugly only because it is not beautiful. And beautiful he determined this island should be. One day. the young mayor-judge called together his council. "" We must have trees "", he said: "" we can make this island a spot of beauty if we will ! "" But the practical seafaring men demurred; the little money they had was needed for matters far more urgent than trees. "" Very well"" was the mayor's decisionand little they guessed what the words were destined to mean- "" I will do it myself."" And that year he planted 100 trees, the first the island had ever seen. ""Too cold"" said the islanders: ""the severe north winds and storms will kill them all."" "" Then I will plant more "" said the unperturbed mayor. And for the 50 years that he lived on that island he did so. He planted trees each year; and, moreover, he had deeded to the island government land which he turned into public squares and parks, and where each spring he set out shrubs and plants. Moistened by the salt mist, the trees did not wither, but grew prodigiously. In all that expanse of turbulent sea-and only those who have seen the North Sea in a storm know how turbulent it can be-ther e was not a foot of ground on which the birds, storm-driven across the water-waste, could rest in their flight. Hundreds of dead birds often covered the surface of the sea. Then one day the trees had grown tall enough to look over the sea, and spent and driven, the first birds came and rested in their leafy shelter. And others came and found protection, and gave their gratitude vent in song. Within a few years so many birds had discovered the trees in this new island home, that they attracted the attention, not only of the native islanders, but also of the people on the shore five miles distant, and the island became famous as the home of the rarest and most beautiful birds. Meanwhile the young mayor-judge, grown to manhood, had kept on planting trees each year, setting out his shrubbery and plants until their verdure now beautifully shaded the quaint narrow lanes, and transformed into cool wooded roads what once had been only barren sun-baked wastes. The trees are now majestic in their height of 40 or more feet, for it is nearly a hundred years since the young attorney went to the island and planted the first tree; today, the churchyard where he lies is a bower of cool green, with the trees that he planted dropping their moisture on the lichen covered stone on his grave. This much did one man do. The point I wish to make is this, that although the amount covered by this bill, £20,000, is a mere trifle, and, with it, the Government can do little, we must aim at securing in this country a forestry sense and a love of trees. If we can instil in even a small proportion of our people the same love for trees that Edward Bok's grandfather had, then we shall have in Australia a country that is beautifully timbered, and of which we can well be proud.  I commend the Government on introducing this measure, the purpose of which is to assist afforestation! I was aroused a little by the remarks of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones). There seems to be a certain amount of inconsistency, not only in his mind, but also in the mind of the Government, in regard to our timber. There seems to be a dreadf ul fear that we may buy foreign timber, and yet, on the other hand, we have been told by experts that there is a possibility of our timber resources being exhausted. ""We should reciprocate. In Western Australia, there are idle timber mills. We have splendid timber there, for which at one time we had a sale, but there is no sale for it now, because of the enormous increase in the cost of the timber. South Africa used to buy our jarrah for sleepers, but because of the increase in price it was forced to use substitutes such as reinforced concrete, and, as a result, men are unemployed in Western Australia. During the time that I have been in that State, the price of timber has trebled, even for our own consumption.",112
425,Mr JONES,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member would not say that a wage of £3 a week is, too much for the bush worker of nineteen years pf age?  relative purchasing power. It is better to have that wage than nothing at all. In Australia, there is a tremendous number of people unemployed. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Guy) yesterday afternoon were significant compared with the wages that these people are earning, for they are not getting a penny for the whole of their 24 hours of misery! In the interests of our forests certain timbers which are ripening should be cut and sold, but we should not be using our hardwoods, which are admittedly the finest in the world, for purposes for which fine quality hardwoods are not necessary. If we would indulge in a little reciprocity we could allow some of the softwoods from other countries to be admitted into Australia under reasonable conditions, and export some of our fine hard timbers to other countries which need them. But we must first get down to an economic basis. There should be a great deal of co-operation between the Commonwealth and .State Governments in the matter of reafforestation.",113
426,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,"Warringah) [6.47 a.m.] - I do not think it matters very much whether this bill is passed or not, as the afforestation scheme it provides for is insignificant compared with the schemes being developed in the various States. There should be, at least, some measure of co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States in afforestation.",113
427,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member has shown that he does not understand the bill.,113
428,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONCILIATION AND,"If I do not, it is because of the manner in .which the Minister introduced it. His speech contained a good deal of theory in regard to forest sense, and so on; but very little practical explanation of the objects of the bill. In that respect it was in marked contrast with the speech made just afterwards by the Assistant Minister, Mr Beasley, in introducing the Superannuation Bill, which he explained clause by clause. I believe that it is proposed to deal with a limited area in the Federal Capital Territory in an expert way. To that there can, of course, be no objection, and it should be an excellent thing for the Territory. But' the various State forestry departments are proceeding with far larger and more utilitarian schemes. In these circumstances it would, in my opinion, be better for the Commonwealth to assist the States by special forestry grants than to proceed with this scheme. I do not agree with the views put forward by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones). We have denuded this country of certain valuable softwoods which are necessary for building purposes, and we are seeking to compel people to use hardwoods which are not suitable for use in buildings. The effect of this is to increase the cost of building to all secthing tions of the community. I sympathize with the honourable mem ability to place before the House the able information which he has gathered in the course of his extensive travels, but I respectfully suggest to him that there is still time for him to make his spqech.",113
429,Mr MORGAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs) [6.54 a.m.] - I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah that the honourable member for Boothby should make the speech which he has prepared on this subject, which is of great importance to Australia. We should not be asked to rush this bill through the House under pressure at this hour of the morning. Seeing that these proposals were approved by the last Government, they should receive more than passing Consideration. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn) argued that this bill should not be passed because it would benefit only the Federal Capital Territory. I dissent from that view, which is narrow, restricted and characteristically Western Australian. To my mind the scheme of the bill deserves every support and encouragement. A few days ago I travelled in a motor car to the Brindabella range over part of the Cotter Catchment Area and I was informed by one of the Forestry officials that it was intended to plant suitable parts of that reserve with trees. As the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) has informed, us, China and Korea are outstanding examples of the serious effects of denudation and erosion. It - is probable that the authorities in Canberra fear' that if they do not plant the Cotter catchment area, it may, in the. course of the years, suffer seriously from erosion. Incalculable harm has been done in Australia by the ruthless destruction of our forests. I refer particularly to the rain forests of North Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales, from which, at one time, we obtained most of the soft timbers that we used. The supplies from those forests are, however, in process of exhaustion, and we are faced with the problem of planting new forests to meet our future requirements. Someis being done in that direction in the Federal Capital Territory and in Victoria by the planting of pinus insign is; but the schemes on foot will not ensure valu- an adequate and permanent supply of softwoods. It is regrettable that the Cunninghamii, and Bunya pines and kauri have been cut out of our rain forests to such an extent that it will be impossible for many years to restore them. Possibly it will take centuries to do so, for the removal of the trees has reduced the rainfall. The western plains of Queensland have also been denuded of their forests and serious erosion is occurring there. Nothing is being done in those areas in the way of reafforestation. The pastoralists receive no encouragement to carry out this work. It might be different if they were freeholders, but as they enjoy only a limited tenure of their holdings there is no inducement for them to engage in reafforestation. The result is that the situation is going from bad to worse The Minister said in the course of his second reading speech that there was no forestry sense in Australia. I am prepared to debate that. It may not be very strongly developed, but it is there, and it is growing. There is little in the subject of forestry.to inspire popular imagination, and that is why governments should place every assistance at the disposal of those far-sighted and enthusiastic forestry experts who are prepared to take this work in hand. Here in Canberra, in the employ of the Federal Government, is one of the best qualified and most able forestry experts to be found anywhere in the world; I refer to Mr Lane Poole. I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is proposed to exploit his ability to the fullest extent in the interests of re-afforestation in the Federal Capital Territory - The honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn), after venting his spleen on this measure as it applied Canberra, waved his aims, and declared that Western Australia supplied practically the whole of Australia's hardwood requirements. I join issue with him on that, and inform him that there are on the east of the continent great hardwood forests which can be drawn upon for years to come.",114
430,Mr CUSACK,CONCILIATION AND,How will it be drawnwith bullocks?,115
431,Mr MORGAN,CONCILIATION AND,"For the information of the honourable member for Eden Monaro I may state that when the trees have reached a certain height and thickness they arc felled. The logs are then dressed, and bullock teams, directed by expert timber-getters, are employed to drag them out of the forest. Arrived at the mill, they are converted into a commercial commodity. Mr C. RILBY - The ghost of ""Jaw Bone"" Nield has come back!",115
432,Mr MORGAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not desire to emulate the exploits of "" Jaw Bone"" Neild, nor am I speaking now in any frivolous spirit. I feel that I am discharging an obligation to ray constituents :in addressing myself to this measure. Besides the honourable member for Boothby  - on this side had prepared voluminous - notes on this subject, and were anxious to .speak. In the circumstances, I can - understand their very just indignation at being denied the opportunity. 1 agree - tentircly with this legislation, which the ""Minister introduced in such a convincing . speech. I sincerely hope that honourable members opposite will stand behind him, .and see that it goes through. Anything that may be done by recalcitrant or in-surgent members on that side should not be allowed to weigh with the Governrznenr. It should prove its bona fides. . If it fails to pass the bill, it will be ...guilty of a dereliction of public duty that - it will long regret.",115
433,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"Moreton) [7.17 a.m.]. - I desire to express appreciation of the action of the Government in bringing forward this measure. I make no protest regarding the hour at which the debate ""has been resumed; the measure is so im- portant that it warrants the consider a' tion of honourable members at any time. The bill is almost a copy of that which to was introduced in 1928 by the Bruce Page Government. The proposal is to place on a sound basis the Forestry Bureau that has been established in Canberra, so that forestry will be in a better position than it has occupied previously. This is one of the most important of our primary industries, and it has been neglected far too long with possible serious consequences. The Forestry School has done exceptionally good work. It hns already trained a personnel of 24, who have taken up positions in the various States with the object of assisting them to co-operate with the Commonwealth in preserving our forests and enlarging upon any schemes that have been commenced. I regret, that the staff at the Forestry School is so low, and trust that efforts will be made to increase it, so that many more students will be trained there. I know that there is a keen desire on the part of many young men to become students at the school, gain the knowledge that it imparts, pass through the university, and take a special degree in forestry, and then go overseas to obtain the experience necessary to fit them to play their part to develop this national undertaking. Our trade balance today is seriously affected because of the extraordinarily large quantity of timber, particularly soft timber, that for many reasons we have had to import, probably the chief of which is that our resources are not so great as they should be. In a very short time we will almost certainly have to depend on imports of soft timber. When that day comes we will ' have to pay much higher prices for soft timber. Honourable members will be amazed to learn that the records show that we have only a fifteen years' supply of softwoods, even if the utmost care is exercised in preserving them. We have ample supplies of hardwoods; but softwoods are needed for many purposes. I regret the statement of the Minister that country mills are closing down because of the cutting out of our forests. This is certainly not the.case with hardwood.",115
434,Mr JONES,CONCILIATION AND,That is not the reason.,115
435,Mr FRANCIS,CONCILIATION AND,"I am privileged to represent some of the largest timber areas in Queensland, over whioh. I have travelled extensively. It grieves me to find that, so far as softwoods are concerned, nature is apparently unable to develop and restore our forests to the extent that is required. In the Oanungra, Beechmount, Beaudesert, Nerang, Brisbane Valley, and other districts from which for many years mainly softwoods have been taken, an effort at re-afforestation has been made; but because close attention cannot be given to the matter, or the cost cannot be met privately, the timber industry there cannot as in other countries replace by young trees the timber removed. The replenishing of our forests must be taken up as an urgent national question. The work of the Forestry School, and its activities, are not sufficiently known. I hope that, when the bill is in committee, it will be amended to provide that an annual report of the operations of the Forestry Bureau is furnished to Parliament. When the last ""budget was before this chamber the Minister was then new to his present position, and I was amazed when he exhibited such rudeness when information was sought concerning the Forestry School and its activities. We cannot afford to treat this industry lightly. It is not the duty of the Minister to keep back information. It should be obligatory on' the director of the school to furnish a detailed report of its operations to Parliament. I wish the bill a speedy passage.  a.m.]-Si r Walter Scott made one of his characters .say, in giving advice to a .youpger member of his household, "" When you have naething else to dac, Jock, you can aye be stickin' in a tree. It ' l l be growin' while you're sleepin'"". I am not so free from the physical limitations which assert themselves at the close of an all-night sitting as some honourable members on this side appear to be. For my part, I am quite prepared to support this non-contentious measure and to leave those trees about which they have said so much to do some growing while we do some sleeping. With that object, I wish the bill a very speedy passage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read' a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clauses 3 and 4 negatived.
