0,NA,Unknown,"notes. I point out to the honourable member that I am not trying to stifle him, but the general political career of the Minister for Information is not under discussion at the present moment.",82
1,Mr LANG,Unknown,"""Why was mine?",82
2,The TEMPOEAEY CHAIBMAN,Unknown," L do not know what the Minister said about the honourable member for Eeid. I was not in the chair at that time. I am pointing out to the honourable gentleman that he has all the freedom in the world to say what he likes, in parliamentary language, about what the Minister has done or failed to do in administering the Department of Information. He cannot, however, roam around the world, attacking the Minister for Information or any other member of the committee under the guise of discussing the Estimates. What the committee is now. discussing, among other things, is the Department of Information and the Estimates in relation to it. The honourable gentleman is entitled to give his reasons for saying why he thinks that the administration of the department is faulty and why the Estimates should not - be approved. He can attack the administration of the department and suggest that it has been right or wrong, but he cannot rove around the world in order to follow the political history of the ister for Information or any other Minister.",82
3,Mr LANG,Unknown,"So far I have not got beyond New South Wales. I was stating what the Minister did, and showing that he is unfit to be a Minister of the Crown. I am trying to show the committee what kind of an administrator he is. I was telling honourable members of how the honourable gentleman acted in the second conscription fight, how he vilified his then leader, and how he circulated copies of manifestos that were issued and signed by his leader in the first conscription fight.",82
4,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,- Was that done through the Department of Information.,82
5,Mr LANG,Unknown,This Minister did it.,82
6,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,- The honourable gentleman was nbt a Minister then.,82
7,Mr LANG,Unknown,"I have been attacked, and I am attempting to reply to the attack. I have listened to Ministers talking about the brothers-in-law, sistersin-law and other relatives of members of the Opposition. I have heard remarks about men marrying for money. None of those comments had anything to do with the Estimates of any department. Surely I have the right to say something. I point out how the Minister for Information dug back into the files of the Melbourne Herald for 1906 to discredit his then leader, and how he dug up an anti-conscription speech that was delivered by his leader in the Melbourne Trades Hall as a young man and circulated it privately throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Even then the honourable gentleman was training, and that was his training ground, to become the "" Minister for Quotations "". He did all those things, ancl still remained within the ranks of the Labour party.",82
8,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,- Order! The honourable gentleman's time his expired.,82
9,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration) [9.6] - I propose to tell the committee something about the Department Minof Information. I have no intention of replying to anything with which the old gentleman from Eeid (Mr Lang) has regaled the committee to-night.,82
10,Mr MCLEOD,Unknown,The old gentleman?,82
11,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,The failing septugenarian.,82
12,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I rise to order. Sine* the rules of debate are being strictly enforced, I point out that it is proper for an honourable member to refer to another honourable member as the honourable member for whatever his electorate may be. The Minister for Information has referred to the honourable member for Eeid as "" the old gentleman from Eeid "". I submit that that expression is unparliamentary and out of order, and suggest that the Chair direct the Minister to conform to the rules of debate that apply in this chamber.",82
13,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"- My attention was diverted and I did not catch what the Minister said. I ask the honourable gentleman to refer to the honourable member for Eeid and other honourable members by their electorates. - Mr Calwell - Now that the game is 'becoming clean, I shall refer to the honourable member for Eeid, and also to the honourable member for Eichmond (Mr Anthony) .by their parliamentary titles. That is the form of address that we have in this Parliament and I shall keep to it.",82
14,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"I rise to order. A ques- his notes. tion was raised last week concerning the correct method of addressing an honourable member of the Parliament. I ask you, sir, to say whether it is not correct to address a member of this honourable House in the same way as a member of the House of Commons, which is the Mother of Parliaments, is addressed, namely, as the honourable and gallant gentleman.",83
15,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"- The honourable member has raised no point of order. Whatever may be the practice of the House of Commons, the rules of this Parliament require an honourable member, when speaking in this chamber, to address another honourable member by the electorate that he represents. That is all that is required.",83
16,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I should like to tell this committee and, through it, the people of Australia of what is being done under the Parliament's authority to publicize Australia abroad. I am the better able to do this because during my overseas tour last year I was able to examine on the spot our publicity activities in the countries that I visited. Erom being principally the servant, and by no means always an honest one, of sectional interests, publicity has grown to national stature in the use to which it is being .put by the Commonwealth Department of [nformation. We are not unique in this, because in recent years, organized national publicity has become increasingly a principal means of national expression; but we are today in the vanguard of those progressive nations which have realized the necessity and the possibilities of publicity and we are already harvesting its results.",83
17,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I rise to order. I point out that the Minister for Information is reading every word of his speech, and I understand that that constitutes a breach of our ' Standing Orders. I direct your attention, sir, to a ruling by the Temporary Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini), that a member must not read his speech in this chamber.",83
18,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The Minister is not reading his speech. He is referring to,83
19,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,The Standing Orders do not prohibit a Minister from reading his speech.,83
20,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I rise to order. As there seems to be some doubt about whether or not the Minister is reading his speech, will you, sir, as a test, ask the honourable gentleman to hand a copy of his notes to you so that as he proceeds with his speech you may satisfy yourself whether he is or is not reading it?",83
21,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,- There is no point of order involved.,83
22,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"As the Minister in charge of a department, the Estimates for which are under discussion, I am entitled to read my speech, if I desire to do so. The Standing Orders do not apply in this case. The principal aims of our national publicity are to help the other peoples of the world to understand us, our aims and endeavours, and to foster good relationships in all our dealings with them. In a sentence, the Department of Information exists to make Australia better and more favourably known to the rest of the world. Our national publicity is also a powerful aid to our immigration plans. It is a means of letting people know, factually and faithfully, the sort of people we are, the conditions which immigrants will encounter here, and the opportunities which this country offers them. With this knowledge, those who elect to make their future in Australia are far more likely to make successful citizens than many who in the past have come here, ill informed, and perhaps misled by sanguine slogans and glib generalities. The officers of the Department of Information abroad have gained a fine reputation in the short history of this organization for telling the truth about Australia. They are information 'officers and not propagandists, and as such have the confidence of the press, writers, lecturers and others with whom they deal as being a source from which accurate information on Australia can be obtained. Broadly, in the organizational structures of the Department of Information, which performs these publicity tasks, Australia is the main production base, the Australian Government's overseas offices are its principal outlets, and its media are every means of presenting Australia to the peoples of the worldprincipally in print, over the air, and on the screen. The department's main activities in this country are, consequently, the production of letterpress, photographs, radio scripts, and films. The product goes chiefly to the Australian News and Information Bureau at Australia House, London, to a similar bureau in New York, and to Australian diplomatic and trade establishments overseas. Omcers of the department are attached to such establishments in America, Canada, France, India, Egypt and Malaya. . Because publicity for Australia in other countries is the department's principal activity, I shall try to give the committee some idea of its extent and of the success it has attained. I feel sure the facts will surprise many people, especially those whose impressions of the department hav.e been gained mainly from criticism by newspapers which have not bothered to inform themselves or their readers of the extent of its services to this country. With dollar spending limited, we have had to make each dollar do the work of two or more in dollar currency countries. Mr E. G. Bonney, formerly Director-General of the Department of Information in Australia, assumed the post of Director-General of the Australian News and Information Bureau in New York last April. He took over at a time when Australia's dollar position was becoming extremely acute.",83
23,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,"I rise to order. An honourable member suggested a short while ago that the Minister was reading his speech. You, sir, ruled that the lionorable gentleman was merely consulting his notes. I now ask you, Mr. Temporary Chairman, if you are still of the opinion that the Minister is merely consulting notes, and I draw attention to Standing Order 256, which states, without any possibility of its being misunderstood, that a member shall not read his speech. I suggest that the Minister is merely taking the opportunity to make a press statement through the medium of the Parliament. He is not making a speech, but is merely reading notes passed to him, and I contend that he has no right to continue.",84
24,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, It is the practice to allow Ministers to refer to prepared statements. Ministerial statements and second-reading speeches are invariably read.,84
25,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,I desire to take the point of order that this is not a second reading speech.,84
26,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,- It is a ministerial statement.,84
27,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,It is not a statement.,84
28,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"B y streamlining the organization to meet the new conditions, the bureau has maintained all its vital information, radio and film services,, although its expenditure has been reduced by 20 per cent. We continue to secure excellent placements of Australian articles and pictures in the American press. Throughout the country these are so numerous that the mere task of keeping a record of them has become too. costly and cumbersome to be justified, but during the last month for which there are records, some 12,000 clippings wero sent in by a press-cutting agency which operates only in the. eastern States of America. Full-length magazine articles, mainly illustrated and of the type which appear in the department's publication South-West Pacific, are placed in the United States of America at the rate of about one a day, and these are of great importance a3 they give a balanced picture of the Australian way of life. Our magazine material appears, as major items have done recently, in publications such as Life, with its circulation of 26,000,000 copies and the Sunday supplement of a New York paper with its 4,000,000 readers. It is accepted also by magazines of lesser circulation but great influence, such as the Christian Science Monitor, The Botarian, and specialist journals devoted to engineering, trade, and similar matters. Daily and weekly news summaries go to all leading American editors and commentators. News bulletins are issued regularly in such specialized fields as agriculture, finance, aviation and women's interests. Large quantities of descriptive booklets and maps are sent to school teachers, children, universities, colleges and libraries. In many American schools, classes are doing regular studies on Australia. Requests from American schools often total 500 a month, and requests of a. general nature about Australia's arts, sciences, industries, sports and other activities run at the same high rate. The department's documentary films for publicizing Australia abroad are popular in America. The cost of production is now being offset by increasing revenues from rentals. Television has opened up new avenues for publicizing Australia. Programme organizers have already featured much Australian material from films made by the department. We expect more placements in this direction as television expands. Extra revenue from this field will help considerably in meeting the costs of producing films. The' New York bureau has had an outstanding success in arranging with 160 radio stations throughout the United States for a weekly broadcast of an Australian programme, "" A Look at Australia "". Outstanding Australians visiting the United States are featured in these broadcasts and in radio and television interviews over the major networks. Most of these broadcasts are given in the evening, when the potential listening audience is highest. It is impossible to measure the results of activities such as these; but a valuable indication of the acceptahility of the department's material and the work of the bureau was given when the bureau asked people on its mailing lists to fill in cards indicating the subjects relating to Australia in which they were interested. More than 60 per cent, of the cards were filled in and returned, although experience by much larger organizations had shown a 25 per cent, response to be a maximum result. As a result of the demand indicated on the cards, the number of items of mail despatched from ' the bureau rose to 2,000 each working day. Reporting on its work among edhicational institutions, the West Coast officeof the bureau, at San EranciscOj saysthat some American university studentshave written their theses on Australian subjects, mainly from material prepared and supplied by the office, and this is a common occurrence in the other areas where our services are available. The work of the bureau, in association with that of the Department of Immigration's representatives in America, is reflected in the fact that up to the 30th June last, despite the very limited passengershipping available, nearly 1,000 immigrants had reached Australia from the United States.",84
29,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I rise to order. I request, Mr Temporary Chairman, that you rule under what circumstances Standing Order 256 may be invoked. You have stated in a previous ruling that a Minister is entitled to read a ministerial statement or a prepared speech on the second reading of a bill. I point out, however, that a ministerial statement has to be made by leave of the House' and that this debate is in committee. I also point out at this stage what the highest authority on Britisli parliamentary procedure, May, says on this particular subject. He says that the purpose of Standing Order 256, which provides that speeches shall not be read, is primarily to maintain the cut and thrust of debate, and goes on to sayThe reading of speeches is even more improper in committee than in the House itself. This chamber is at present in committee. I suggest that the Minister is only taking up time in order to prevent other honourable members from speaking, and is therefore abusing the rules and privileges, of the Parliament.",85
30,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"- The Minister is only following the practice of the Parliament and taking advantage of a privilege which has been invariably extended to Ministers. He is giving a detailed statement of the work of his department, by means of a prepared statement.",86
31,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,Honourable members opposite sat down to allow the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Lang) to deliver a tirade.,86

36,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"As the Minister stated before the division that he still had eighteen pages to read, I suggest that he ask for leave to incorporate the remainder of his speech in Hansard",86
37,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The activities of the mean Australian News Information Bureau, are similar to those of its bureau in New York, and are correspondingly successful. The London bureau's photo(Mr graphic section contains a stock of approximately 40,000 photographs which is constantly being drawn on by publishers of magazines, books and newspapers and by schools, and for display purposes. As part of its work, it maintains a reference and research library in charge of an officer of the Australian National Library. It carries out press and public relations work as required for the High Commissioner for Australia and other Australian officials stationed in or visiting the United Kingdom. It revises and checks encyclopaedia material. It assists in the representation of Australia at international conferences. It also deals with hundreds of inquiries each day on all aspects of life in Australia. By placing the department's films for theatrical distribution, the bureau not only ensures wide publicity, but also obtains approximately 70 per cent, of the net receipts from exhibitors. The bureau's biggest exhibition during the year ended on the 30th June last, was the "" British Enterprise in Australia"" display at Australia House. The exhibition was opened by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, and drew an average attendance of 1,000 people a day for a month. The bureau co-operates with the Senior Australian Trade Commissioner in trade publicity throughout Europe. The activities of the department's officers at other overseas posts resemble those I have outlined, although smaller financial resources a^e available to them. Whether in Canada, Europe, Egypt, India or Malaya, these officers have succeeded to an astonishing extent, as the department's records and my observations fully confirm, in reaching the eyes and ears of the world - with Australia's national publicity. Much attention has been given to educational work by our officer at the office of the High Commissioner for Australia in Canada. He reports that from the 1st July, 1947, to the .31st May, 1948, he distributed 2,551 special packages of Australian educational material to schools. Canadian schools have special study projects on Australia. He statesCanadian scientists and others are realizing more and more the fact that Australia, and Canada have many problems in common, and arc keen on exchanging information. Many journals in France have given pride of place to articles on Australia supplied through the department's press attache at the Australian Embassy, Paris. Not long ago, an important French commercial review devoted an entire issue to an economic study of Australia prepared by the department's writers. Material is supplied from this centre to other European countries, and the attache maintains a reference system which is frequently used by journalists, authors and students. In the Middle East and the arc of Asiatic countries which stretches across Australia's near north, pictorial publicity material is of special importance, because pictures speak all languages. Thus, our information officer in Cairo reports that the greatest success is being achieved by means of our films. These are fed into circuits which extend from Egypt as far afield as Tripolitania, Kenya and Iran. Despite newsprint shortage, and heavy demands upon their space by a long succession of dramatic events in their own country, Indian newspapers have given generous space to Australian publicity material supplied through the department's officer at New Delhi. He reports that when Indian editors have occasion to deal with Australian news and affairs they mostly tend to approach them in a friendly frame of mind, because they are accustomed to receiving from the Australian office, not propaganda material on contentious subjects, but material which has been prepared in an effort to supply the sort of information which will interest their readers. Having recently emerged as a dominion, India has shown particular interest in the Australian Constitution, and in our methods of administration. Departments of the Government of India have drawn heavily upon material supplied to our officer for information on these subjects, and there seems little doubt that this has influenced, for instance, the draft Indian constitution. The Trade Information Officer at the Many office of the Senior Australian Trade Commissioner for the Indian Ocean zone is concerned with publicity relating to Australian trade, primary and secondary industry, and economics. Austral News, an eight-page monthly newspaper produced from his office, has been widely acclaimed as the most useful publication of the kind in the area. An economic survey, agricultural newsletter, and technical newsletter are among the features regularly distributed from the office to the press and interested authorities. Month after month, Australian publicity material distributed by the Trade Information Officer at the office of the Australian Commissioner, Singapore, has occupied hundreds of column-inches of space in Malayan newspapers. Working under difficulties, this office has succeeded on several occasions in placing such conclusive facts before editors that they have withheld, or re-ca9t, items which, by misrepresentation or bias, would have been harmful to Australia. Use of films as a vehicle for Australian publicity in Malaya is illustrated by the record of an open-air screening at Penang of some of the department's colour films to about 3,000 Malayans. Although rain was drizzling upon the audience, they sat throughout the programme. At its conclusion, five village head-men approached ithe officer in charge of the screening, and ibegged that such films be sent to --their villages. The duties of our 'Trade Information officers include ^answering press comment where necessary, publicising visits of Australian business, men, assisting in promoting exhilhiiti©n« aand displays and selling campaigns, and directing the flow of trade publicity material to oversea media from the Department of Information and the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. The material provided by these departments is made available also to a number of trade commissioners at points where there is no information or publicity officer..",86
38,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Does the department distribute 35-mm. or 16-mm. films for ordinary screenings ?,88
39,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"In answer to the honourable member who asks intelligent and important questions, both 35-mm. and 16-mm. films are used in a number of ways. With the consent of honourable members. I shall incorporate the remainder of my prepared statement in Hansard without reading it. A great deal of the work of all our overseas officers, hureau staffs and press attaches, as well as trade information officers, is associated with trade promotion. A very high percentage of the articles prepared in Australia and published in the overseas press deals with trade subjects, new Australian inventions and new processes, and there has been a very heartening response in inciuiries from overseas business men and importers following the publication qf these'articles. Our overseas officers, too apart from the trade information officers, work closely with the trade commissioners, particularly in bringing their specialized knowledge to bear on the preparation of exhibitions and other graphic displays designed to promote trade and closer understanding. Although I have referred at length to the activities of the department's overseas officers, I have provided no more than glimpses of their work, which involves the use of practically all forms of publicity media. Results of their activities are readily apparent in those countries in which they are engaged, but are little known in Australia. Where experience shows that in any particular country circumstances do not justify continued maintenance of an officer, we do not hesitate to withdraw our representative. This, was the case in Nanking, China, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where press attaches were initially posted. It is a principle underlying the department's work that the national interest is served best by factual, informative material, provided this' can he made sufficiently attractive tor the reader, the listener, and the film audience to gain attention and hold interest. The radio time alone gained by Australian Department of Information activities in other countries is literally invaluable. I feel safe in saying that even if it were bought at the rates usually charged for time on the air, the value of such publicity would amount to a very substantial part indeed of the £324,448 which the entire activities of the department, at home and abroad, cost last year. It is because of the interest-content and integrity of the department's material that the question of payment does not arise. The radio and press overseas are glad to accept and use it on. itsmerits alone. Another important part of my department's work is the winning of recognition abroad for Australian eulture. Australian literature has come of age but this is not generally realized abroad and my department has attempted to overcome this lag. It does this in a number of ways. One is the distribution, in co-operation with Australian publishers, of review copies of Australian books to overseas editors, and publishers. Another > is the holding of exhibitions of Australian, books in. Britain and in the United. States of America. Another way is. the placing of articles on all aspects of Australian literature in overseas Uterary journals and reviews. Publicity foil the Department of I mmigration is carried.out both, overseas and in, Australia! by a. specialized, seotion* of the Department of Information. Memhers of this, section are experienced journalistswha have made. a. close study of Australia's immigration policy and the problems associa tedi with, ite The seetion is in constantliaison with the. senior officers of the Department of Immigration-, and with the.

Londonoffice of the Department; of Informationand the Commonwealth Migration Branch, A'ustfrali'ai House: This officer also handles puiblieity throughout Europe) in co-operatiom with Australian? representatives in Europe, including the Australian Military Mission in Germany. The work of the section is three-fold;, First,, it carries outdirect publicity overseas to make kno.wn Austi:alia!s immigration schemes and Australia, as a home for the migrants.;, secondly, it provides advice to migrants, on health,, customs, quarantine requirements, &c, and maintains) the migrant's interest, in Australia while awaiting passage-;, and thirdly,, it. conducts, publicity in Australia to assist the assimilation"" of newcomers into the Australian community, and to-encourage non-British, migrants, to adopt Australian citizenship. In accordance, with a directive issued before thepublicity section began operations, all information supplied for overseas consumption is. of a strictly factual nature. Emphasis is always placed on such items as the housing shortage in, Australia. The publicity section has produced' bookletswhich have had wide distribution in Britain, Europe and the United; States of America. Several of them have gone, into second and third editions. These booklets, explain the way. of, life in Australia;, our customs, social services, and< institutions, and, other points, of interest. to> the-.prosstricted pective migranti; the free. and. assisted passages. schemes operating from the 1 United Kingdom;- and theassisted passages, scheme, from the.

During the last, financial year, the: section's, publicitywork was reby the limited number, of ships available to.bring migrants., to. Australia. This year the section has plans which will enable it to provide as wide a cover of immigration publicity as circumstances and policy dictate. The Shortwave Division of the Department of Information, which made a significant contribution to the waging of the war against Japan, has been serving an important peace-time purpose as Eadio Australia. To-day, every important nation is using shortwave as an instrument of goodwill and publicity. Although the cost of Eadio Australia is small compared with that of comparable services in other countries, it has a worldwide reputation. A recent survey made in Sweden, a country noted for its avid interest in shortwave broadcasting, rated Eadio Australia with the British Broadcasting Corporation and the shortwave services of Canada and the United States of America, as the four leading services of their kind in the world. Eadio Australia operates from the most extensive and powerful station in the Southern Hemisphere, and is on the air for 22 hours of programme time a day. Broadcasting in five languages, it transmits seventeen news bulletins daily. In these bulletins and in its talks features, it presents Australian events and their background clearly and impartially to the world. The number of letters received by Eadio Australia has been steadily mounting over the past three years. They come in now at the rate of 25,000 a year- a clear indication of its popularity, for only a minute proportion of radio listeners bother to write to their stations. Eadio Australia uses talks, features and music to tell Australia's story, to develop trade, to encourage migrants, investors and tourists, and to publicize the achievements of Australians in music, art, science, in dustry, sport and other spheres. news is quoted and requoted hy radio stations, newspapers and periodicals throughout the world. During the last year, Eadio Australia programmes have heen relayed hy AllIndia Eadio, Singapore Eadio, the big Mutual System in the United States, New Zealand's National Broadcasting vice, the Canadian and South African Broadcasting Corporations, and British Broadcasting Corporation. Mr Calwell. news bulletins and other features are relayed three times every day over mediumwave and shortwave by occupation forces' stations in Japan. When, owing to the volume of work involved, 500 people occupying important position; were asked by the department's London bureau whether they would accept a weekly Australian news bulletin in place of the daily bulletin transmitted by Eadio Australia and distributed by the bureau, remarkable tributes to the service flowed in. Among these was a letter from the secretary of Dalgety and Company in London in the course of which he saidThia publication is of vital importance to this coniipany, and owing to the large number of directors and executives who are concerned with the information contained therein, it is necessary for them to have copies of the daily bulletin in tlieir hands at early as possible. Hence we are unable to reduce the number of copies we require. The manager of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in London wroteAs the Central Bank, we are daily called upon to answer numerous inquiries on Australian affairs, and to provide up-to-date statistics, many of which we can find only in the bulletin. Mr W. S. Eobinson, of Austral Developments Limited, replied to the bureau's circular as follows:Your bulletin has a wide circulation in our office, and we find it always of great interest. More than 70 films have heen produced by the Film Division of the Department of Information. These have been of all types, from instructional films for technical training to general interest films on subjects as diverse as Antarctica, ballet, arid aviation. Many have heen designed for theatrical release, to stimulate interest in Australian achievement. One of them, titled School in the Mailbox, achieved the rare honour of nomination Its for an academy award. In Australia, there has been a great increase in the theatrical distribution of my department's films. As many as four have been running at one time in capital cities, where it is estimated they have been seen by more than a million people. Thousands more will see them on suburban and Ser- country circuits. Press critics have been warm in their praise of such films as the Spotlight on Australian Ballet, School ir> Its the MaUbox. Namatjira the Painter and Antarctic Adventure. In the present year, distribution will be expanded and more films released theatrically. Besides bringing Australian activity to the attention of the Australian public, distribution represents a source of revenue to the Government. The department's policy is to contract with commercial distributors for straight-out fees or for a percentage of returns. As the number of films grows, returns will increase. Preparation of the stream of material necessary to maintain the department's world-wide press publicity services naturally is a big task. It is exacting especially because of the high standard of accuracy needed in acting as an official mouthpiece of Australia. Yet it is performed by 28 writers, and a photographic section which supplies the necessary illustrations. The size of the literary staff employed is less than is required by a daily newspaper in one of our big cities. So well and favourably have the department's services become known, that a large proportion of the material is supplied in response to requests by various publications. Feature articles produced by the department cover almost every aspect of Australian affairs. In addition, the department supplies a vast amount of information in the form of newsletters for use by newspapers, periodicals, lecturers, radio commentators and others. A feature known as Talikabout, relating to unusual and interesting aspects of Australia, has for two years been supplied to the great Associated Press newsagency, which circulates it, with illustrations by the agency's artists, to 1,500 newspapers in the United States of America, and to newspapers in 21 other countries. We face constantly increasing demands for pictures of Australian life-ou r sports, tourist attractions, industrial activities and so on. Investors, working men, tourists and immigrants want to know what Australia has to offer, and pictures help to tell them the story. Each week approximately 1,500 prints are distributed through our overseas representatives to newspapers, magazines, libraries, schools and other organizations interested in. Australia. Honourable members have received from time to time copies of the Department of Information overseas publicity magazine, South-West Pacific, and I feel confident that they have been impressed by the high quality of its contents and the craftmanship evident in its appearance. Practically every article and many of the illustrations have been reproduced in important overscfi.s publications. Australia in Facts and Figures, also prepared and produced by the department, is widely used as a source of reference and reading, both in Australia and overseas; and its circulation continues to grow as demand for the booklet increases. It is included in reading material placed by the department on outgoing aircraft and ships. Most of the copies made available in Australia go to newspaper and broadcasting offices, literary institutes, local governing bodies, Commonwealth and State departments, and schools. Know Australia, a pithy, factual booklet, has run to its seventh edition, and a total distribution of approximately 1,000,000 copies. Like all these publications, it is in constant demand, particularly among prospective immigrants and tourists. Other publications are produced a9 occasion requires. With the concurrence of the State tourist authorities, tourist publicity on behalf of Australia in other countries has - been included in the responsibilities of the Department of Information. Shortage of shinning and accommodation, and the continuance of unsettled world conditions, have been a setback to hopes of earlv resumption of tourist traffic to Australia, although a boom is being experienced in Australia's domestic tourist trade. It is noteworthy, however, that Great Britain, despite its acute food shortage and housing problem, has established a national tourist authority and is taking very active and successful steps to attract tourists, particularly in relation to its dollar currency requirements. The British Travel Association reports that Britain's post-war tourist traffic is now its greatest single earner of dollars. The association looks forward to the British Isles reaping within a few years an annual return of £100,000,000 sterling from tourism. With this example in mind, the department is using the present lull in tourist traffic to Australia to plan ahead, and to explore all avenues for the necessary co-operation on a national basis pf ;aU concerned in the development of Australia's tourist attractions. Liaison is maintained by .the Department ,of Information with other .departments, both Commonwealth and State, and with instrumentalities in which the .Commonwealth, is concerned, in relation <to publicity matters. The - department .makes .available ithe full range -.pf its resources in joint endeavours related .to (special campaigns and .exhibitions. This .work is facilitated .by - offices of .the partment in Sydney and Melbourne, .which deal with matters witliin .their respective - spheres. They .also contribute substantially to the volume of publicity material despatched by the department's central secretariat in - Canberra. Information, .assistance and .advice is .given by .the department to international press correspondentSj film producers and others who visit - this icountry seeking to cater for the interest of the world at large in Australia, In - this, the department's State .offices provide convenient points of contact. Despite the world-wide range, :and the diversity of the activities of my department, its total expenditure in the year ended, the .30th June last, was £324,409 or £9,0.00 less than the .amount authorized by the Parliament. Expenditure for current year is estimated at £351,50.0. The increase in comparison with last year's estimate is due solely to cost-ofattention living .adjustments to salaries and wages, and represents the minimum amount necessary foi the department to maintain 1 its existing activities. Honourable bers may find it helpful, as a basis comparison, to know that the Underwhich Secretary of State for Commonwealth 2.6 Relations told the House of Commons in reads as follows :July last that total British Government expenditure on overseas information services in 1945-49 would, at then curhad rent rates, reach £11,622,000. means that thp Tjnited Kingdom spends Ibyn Waugh just under 5s. a head of its population on information services, while Ausone tralia spends only lid. a person. Our oflices, at home and overseas, are small witliinlivery, arjd modest compared even with those of two years certain tiny European and American countries, hut their efficiency and the results they have achieved have had them accepted on several occasions Mr Calwell. ,as ,the models for other nations which wished to .set ,up .national news and inform afion 'bureaux, or to improve their existing ones. The story of my department is, I am happy to say, one of steady achievement .and valuable contribution to Australia's interests. Results speak for themselves. Mr ADERM&IOff i(Maranoa) {'9. -40] I wish to deal with only - two aspects of the Estimates now .before us, one pertain-de- ing to the administration of the Depart(ment ipf Transport and the other to thai - of ithe Department of Post-war Recon.abruetion. Before I 4o so, however, I must say that, in view of the time taken Iby .the .Minister ior Information (Mr. Calwell,) to-night in his attempt to defend his department against any criticism that might ,be voiced in ithis .ehamher. I .am. ibeginning .to alter nry opinion of ithe .efficiency .of .the Depar*uienit of Information. As the Minister stone-walled .this debate by giving ns :a long .dissertation on the activities of his .d&par.fcmeiit, - one can only conclude that its administration must he rotten indeed. I fewe - discussed the subject of readmaking imacliinery in this .chamber on many occasions. Paint of the moneys made arailaible minder the Commonthe weaHA Aid Roads iand Works Act is to he iset aside for the purchase of road-making maehinery. I draw 4he of the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) to ithe serious plight of local governing .authorities dn Queensland because of their inability to procure roadmemmaking machinery. I have received a of letter from the Wondai Shire Council, is representative of most of the local authorities is my electorate. It In March, 19*8, when machinery was thought .to be available, and years after some been lost by the shire to impressment hy This the services, we were not successful in buying. November of that year orders were accepted and Josephson for supply of one No. 12 Caterpillar Grader, and by Tutt-Bryant for Allis Chalmers "" AD "" Grader. Waugh and Josephson would not indicate a date for debut Tutt-Bryant promised delivery six months. These orders of almost standing have not heen delivered, South making our position most serious. Not only have the orders not been delivered but when I approached the State authorities which recently took over the control of the distribution of these machines from the Department of Works and Housing, and intimated that it would follow the scheme of distribution previously adopted by that department, I was informed that I could be given no help in the matter. I asked if delivery could be expected within twelve months and was informed that they could not even promise that. Local governing authorities prefer tractors of the caterpillar type, the framework of which is manufactured in Australia. Last year the issue of licences for the importation of tractors of that type was suspended and this year only seven of those tractors are to be imported for the whole of Queensland. That indicates how serious the situation has become. Earlier, when I asked that the number of permits be at least doubled so that the most urgent and pressing requirements could he met, I was informed that the number of machines imported had reached the capacity of the Australian manufacturers in providing the requisite framework. I also asked what road making machinery was being exported from Australia and I was informed that no machinery was being exported, other than to New Guinea and other territories under the control of the Commonwealth. Mr George E . Bryant, of the Tutt-Bryant organization in Australia, is reported as follows in the Industrial News Service which, I presume, is a publication produced by the organization :Australian factories were producing more Queensland Government. construction .machinery than any otlier country statesin the world, except USA., claimed Mr George 13. Bryant, a loading Australian chartered helped engineer, upon his return from America. "" For example"", he said, "" Australia day able to export in addition to supplying her own needs. Recently some £50,000 worth of trcedpzers for clearing work associated with proved the British Food Council's ground nut project ment were exported to Tanganyika, South Africa, have in addition to several 150 h.p. high-speed inanother dustrial wheel tractors to Sweden, India, Malaya and other countries.",88
40,Mr CONEI,Unknown,"AN - Who is correct, the Minister or Mr Bryant? Mr ADERMANN "" - I should say that Mr Bryant, who is concerned with the manufacture of machinery of this kind, sponsible ought to know. I want the matter cleared up. The Government should make it possible to import more tractors so that local bodies in Queensland may keep roads in repair. If only double the number were imported, they would meet the most urgent requirements, and the number of dollars involved would not he great. The agents of machinery firms say they cannot promise delivery witliin five years, and a road grader is practically worn out after five years' use. The need for machinery of this kind is urgent, and I ask whether the Government is going to allow the export of such machinery as is made in Australia. The supply of tyres for road making machinery is another problem. Rubber is available, but it is hard to get the tyres made. On more than one occasion I have heard the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) eulogize the Government's land settlement programme for ex-servicemen. I have also heard him criticize the Victorian Government for its handling of this matter, but the Queensland Government has not done so well as the Victorian Government, although there is more suitable land available for settlement in Queensland than in Victoria. I have here a copy of the most recent issue of the Legionnaire, the official organ of the Australian Legion of Ex-service Men and Women, in which there appears an article headed, "" What about Soldiers' Land- Mr Eoley ? "" Mr . Foley is Minister for Lands in the The article Two thousand Queensland ex-servicemen who save Australia's 3,000,000 square miles from the Japanese, have now found they can't is to get an acre of land for themselves. This is the number of ex-servicemen apunder the War Service Land SettleScheme and still awaiting farms. They heen waiting for 3, 4 and 5 years. For all they know they might have to wait 10 years. They think, and ""Legionnaire"" think they have waited long enough. Jt's just about time that the State Minister for Lands (Mr Foley) tells them frankly exactly what the Queensland Government is doing for them. There have been plenty of vague .promises, plenty of nebulous plans, plenty of finesounding optimistic press statements by reMinisters during and since the war. But tliere have been very few farms. In March, 1946, two and a half years ago, the then Minister for Lands (Mr Jones) gave a glowing statenient to Legionnaire about the prospects for soldier settlement. These were some of the assurances Mr. Jones gave:Seven and a half million acres, spread over many parts of the State were involved in land settlement proposals; Inspection and subdivision of 5,700,000 acres of pastoral land throughout Queensland's sheep districts was progressing. Half of the land selected would be available for ex-servicemen. Agricultural and dairy farm land totalling ucarly 1,000,000 acres were under expert scrutiny for submission for approval and inclusion in the Commonwealth State Settlement Sclieme. In Canberra a few weeks ago, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) revealed how little had really been achieved. His statement exposed, beyond doubt, the abject failure of the Queensland Government to settle ex-servicemen on the land. Mr Dedman disclosed that, of 1,427 ex-servicemen given farms throughout Australia under the War Serviee Land Settlement Scheme only (54 had been helped hy the Queensland Government. How can the Government be satisfied with the progress of its land settlement 'schemes for ex-servicemen? Government supporters have criticized what was done for ex-servicemen after the first world war, but the record of this Government is an outstanding failure, in spite of the fact that, in Queensland at any rate, much suitable land is available, and a Labour government is in office in that State. I have not heard any Queensland Ministers in this Parliament eulogizing the land settlement scheme for ex-servicemen in Queensland. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction should take the matter up with the Queensland Government, instead of criticizing the governments in other States where a far better job has been done than the Government of Queensland has been able to do. I raise this question in the interests of ex-servicemen who are looking for land, and who have been waiting for two and a half years for the farms that were promised them. I want to hear what the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction intends to do about it .",93
41,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [9.55] - It is shown at page 81 of the Estimates that expenditure by the Department of Labour and National Service was £1,178,300 in 1947-4'S. whereas estimated expenditure for 1948-49 is £1,345,000, an increase of £166,444. This department was set up to find jobs.for those seeking them, yel the Government boasts every day that in Australia practically no one is oui of work, and that is true. The department has a pay-roll of more thaD £1,000,000. In the summary of expenditure shown at page 81 of the Estimates, salaries and payments in the nature of . salaries are estimated to amount to £1,123,900 for the present financial year. What do the officers employed in this - department do? For instance, there are 26 research officers, besides a chief research oflicer, and five senior officers. The salary of the chief research officer is more than £1,000 a year. There are also ten assistant research officers, nineteen ' psychologists and vocational guide officers, seventeen inspectors, twenty architects and 21 engineers. What are they doing in the department? In Victoria, alone, there are 40,000 jobs waiting to be filled, according to figures issued by the State Statistician. From the reply to a question which I asked some monthsago to ascertain how many jobs the department had filled, I learned that if the number of jobs was divided into the amount paid in salaries to officers of the department, it would be found that the filling of each joh cost the taxpayers between £2 and £3, even though some of the jobs lasted only for a day or two. In his reply to me, the Minister for Labour and National Service wrote many pages pointing out what a useful work the department did in advising employers. That may be so, but I have never heard of any employer going to the department for advice. Every suburb of every city is dotted with branch offices of the department, although many ex-servicemen are unable to obtain office accommodation. The department also employs survey officers, executive officers, senior clerks and a production illustrator. I do not want to disparage the work of these officers. If there was unemployment they could, no doubt, do useful work, but under present conditions I believe that the activities of the department could be centralized. If a man is looking for a job today he consults the classified advertisements in his newspaper. He does not t r a i l along to the Government employment office. I have ao - wish to see the officers employed by this department thrown out of work, but t am sure that many of them would be glad to go into productive employment if the opportunity to do so were offered to them. Therefore, I should like the Minister to make a short statement explaining what the officers are doing, and why, when manufacturers, importers and commercial houses urgently require employees, it should be necessary to retain the services of scoras of people in this department. They canaot have much work to do. They are occupying office space which could be better utilized for other purposes. They should be engaged in more productive nmployment.",94
42,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Serzations vice) [10.1] - Fro m time to time, honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) has asked many questions about the Department of Labour and National Service, and has received detailed replies about its activities. He has then selected Pinner. a section of an answer, and harped upon it month after month without telling the whole story. Many honourable members have asked, quite properly, for informadiminishes ? tion about the staffs engaged in the. Department of Labour and National Service and in other departments. More than a year ago, the Public Service at' the request of the Prime. Minister (Mr Chifley), appointed a special mittee to examine the staffs of all ments and to recommend retrenchments to a permanent peace-time basis. As result of that investigation, the nearly every department has been reduced by several hundred officers. For instance, the Department of Labour and National Service employs 300 fewer officers year than it employed last year, although its functions have increased. The Government did not desire to dispense with the services of people unnecessarily. The purpose of the inquiry was to retrench temporary employees, and to arrive at a maxiit. mum basis of staffs necessary to carry on administrative work, so officers could he placed on a permanent basis. Last year, the staff of the ment of Lahour and National Service reduced by 137 temporary employees and 130 permanent officers. The special committee is continuing its inquiries. My department, still employs a few temporary officers.",95
43,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"What does the Minister mean by a "" permanent peace-time basis""?",95
44,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"During the war Commonwealth departments had to expand their staffs. The Department of Labour and National. Service, for example, employed a considerable number of persons to administer the man-power regulations.",95
45,Mr SPENDEB,Unknown,The man-power organization has been carried over to peacetime.,95
46,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,It has not. It - was in order that such war-time organishould not be continued in peacethe time that the special committee was appointed to investigate the staffs of all departments. Members of that commit tee included Major-General Stevens and the Public Service Commissionerj Mr.,95
47,Mr BEALE,Unknown,What is the basis? Are not staffs reduced as the need for them,95
48,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,Yes .,95
49,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Why does' the Department of Labour and National Service reBoard, quire 42 research officers?",95
50,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The staff of that comdepartment has been reduced in accorddepartance with the recommendations of the special committee. The honourable memthe ber for Balaclava referred to the Comstaff of monwealth Employment Service. He ascertained the total number of persons who had been placed in positions by the Commonwealth Employment this Service, divided it . into the proposed vote for the whole depart ment, and then stated that the result represented the cost of finding em. ployment for each person. Although that calculation was childish and ridiculous, the honourable membei continues to repeat He should be ashamed of himself for doing so. The work of the Department of that Labour and National Service is not confined to the employment section. The DepartCommonwealth Employment Office ie was only a part of the department. The. Department of Labour and National Service, administers the Coinrn - onjweal.th reconstr.ue.tion scheme and defence training schemes. Honourable members may nothe aware that radio engineers andother technicians are. still being, trained for the Royal Australian Navy, the Army and the. Royal Australian Air Force. The number is not large. Uisabled persons, ex-servicemen and civilians are being trained so that, instead of being invalid' pensioners, they may do usdSuT work in the community. Persons are also heing trained in industry. Employers have agreed to train men on the job in an endeavour to overcome the shortage of experienced tradesmen. In addition, workers, who have been rendered redundant by technological) changes, are. being, retrained. That arrangement is described in the: White Paper on EulL Employment. Standards o£ industrial! training, are. being raised in conjunction with the Universities Comniission. Yesterday, the Acting Leader ofi the Opposition (Mr Harrison) said "" that the. Government had fallen down on the job of training ex-service personnel. But the factis that according to figures, compiled, last week in connection with the full-time vocational training sheme, 82,079 persons had been, accepted, 56,042 were in training and 38,612 had completed training: In connection with part-time classes and technical training at night, 167,000 had heen accepted, 149,000 were in training and 13,229 had completed their training.",95
51,Mr WHITE,Unknown,What has that information to do with the question that I asked f,96
52,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I am answering the criticism that the Department of Labour and National Service has fallen down on the job of training ex-service personnel. The welfare section of the department is rendering excellent service. The employers will admit that, and they are glad to co-operate in this work. Anybody who visits workshops and factories will see the great improvements that have been made in lighting, and ventilation.",96
53,Mr SPENUER,Unknown,Has the Minister ever visited a Commonwealth employment office?,96
54,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Yes . Mr ,So?E3!fnEE - I ka-vet been to. a few training ofi them, and 1 foundthat the. staffs, had nothing,- to do.",96
55,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I have been through as many workshops as any other honourable member has. On one occasion, a manager made a remark to me when he noticed: that an engineer was reading a newspaper in working hours. The. official said to me, "" Did you see the engineer reading the newspaper?""- I replied that I had. I added, "" If I were in your place, I should be happy to see him doing that. F notice that the whole of the work is proceeding in perfect rhythm. There is not a sign of any grating in the machinery. Everything is well oiled and in perfect order. If that officer had tokeep his. eye. on the thermometer to see that the machinery was working properly and had to watch constantly that the number of revolutions was kept uniform, he w o u ^ have worked, himself into a flurry o£ excitment. Instead o£ that, he is. calmly eeading the newspaper.. That is an, indication, that everything is alL right, and is. pizoofi that the men. are doing their job properly."" The Departmentof Labour and National Service^ is-also concerned with industrial conciliation and arbitration. Since the appointment of the new conciliation commissioners some time ago, between400 and 500 disputes ' have heen dealt with. That involves morework for the department. I emphasize that the industrial, sectionof the department has no relation to the employment section. The welfare section has almost revolutionized working conditions in factories. For example, in these days nearly every large factory has a modern cafeteria or dining-room, and amenities.",96
56,Mr WHITE,Unknown,Factorie s had those amenities long before the Department of Labour and National Service was established.,96
57,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Of course, the honourable member for Balaclava does not liketo see improvements occurring under the administration of a Labour government. I shall now deal with one of the worse statements that have been made about industrial conditions in this debate. If I do not explain the true position Australian industry will be placed in a bad light in the eyes of the people of other countries. That will be unfortunate at a time when we are trying to encourage overseas industrialists to - establish factories in this country. The Acting Leader of the Opposition read figures which were perfectly true, but he left the wrong, impression. I propose to explain exactly how the Commonwealth Statistician collects data in relation to industrial disputes, including time Lost as the result of industrial disputes. The Commonwealth Statistician states that the equivalent of ten working days lost has been adopted as' a minimum. That may mean one man idle for ten days or ten men idle for one day. The returns would include one-hour stop-work meetings if the attendances :at them, were lar.ge enough. That - explanation shows the detail into which the Commonwealth Statistician goes in compiling, information. Even when-only a few hours are lost at a stopwork meeting, they may be reckoned as days lost in an industrialdispute. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has sufficient knowledge of industrial problems not to place a wrong' interpretation on those figures, unless he desired purposely to create a wrong; impression'. Surely he did not want to do that.",96
58,Mr WHITE,Unknown,The Minister's remarks JW irrelevant.,97
59,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"They are not. ""One of the principal functions of the Department for Labour and National Service is the handling of industrial matters. The statement which, the Acting Leader of thei Opposition made was true as far as it went, but I desire to correct another wrong impression that may have been, created. The honourable .gentleman said,- in effect, that in. 1938 there were 375 industrial disputesrecorded, by the. Com-.monwealth Statistician, but that in 1947 there were 982 disputes recorded - The honourable gentleman stopped at that point. The impression which he left upon his listeners was that there - were nearly three times as many industrial disputes last year as there were in 1938. He selected the year 1938 because-he was then a.member of the ..Menzies Government. I have .selected the same years, and asked the Commonwealth Statistician for the true story, because I do not want the honourable gentleman to leave a wrong impression that might possibly ruin the economic reputation of this country. In 193S the total number of days lost through industrial disputes was 1,337,994. In 1947, when there were nearly three times as many disputes, the number of man-days lost was 1,33S,728. That works out at 0.5S5 of a day per capita per annum in 1938, and 0.511 of a da.y in 1947, or a fraction over half a day per capita per annum, or less than one minute a day. I am not saying that that is not too much time lost. I do not mean that, j agree that there are too many disputes and too many days lost. I should like workers not to lose even one shilling in wages through industrial disputes, and employers not to lose one fraction of production as the result of stoppages. I am trying to achieve that objective. However,' the Acting Leader of the Opposition' made' it appear that as three timesasmany industrial disputes occurred last year compared with 1938, three times as much productionwas lost last year comgared with 1938.",97
60,Mr HABRISO,Unknown,N -»The Minister does not suggest that men resume production immediately they finish' a stop-work meeting.,97
61,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I am stating that the speecn of the honourable gentleman could have created in other countries a wrong impression about the industrial situation in Australia. The position was not nearly three times as had in 1947 as it was in 1938. In fact, it had not grown worse. In 1947, there were 331,600 more people employed in factories and work1 shops than in 1938. The honourable gentlemandid not make that position clear. He stopped, short, and did not tell the whole story. It is impossible to say what is lost in production by merely quoting the number of disputes. That information does not give the real, picture. The only real way to find out whether more production is lost in one period compared with another as the result of industrial disputes is to take the number of manhours lost in one period .ant , compare it 1 with the relevant figures for another period.",97
62,Mr MCBRIDE,Unknown,Productio n is the for any comparison.,98
63,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"That would be better still. The only real test is to tain the number of hours or days bave been lost and the number of people who were employed in a certain period. Lf a calculation is made on that basis, it will be seen that the position better in 1947 than it was in 1938. There were approximately 300,000 more people in employment in 1947 than in 1938. If the number of people employed been the same in both years, the position in 1938 would have been slightly better than in 1947, but when the man hours that were lost in 1947 are spread over an extra 300,000 people the balance shifted in favour of 1947. If the matter is examined in that way, it will be that, although the honourable gentleman's figures are correct, a different state affairs is revealed. Mr White interjecting,",98
64,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,I am replying to a criticism that was made of my departpresented ment. The honourable member for clava (Mr White) is only a nuisance.,98
65,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I put forward a propoLabour sition, and when I asked the Minister to answer it he said that I was a nuisance. [ regard that remark as offensive, and ask that it be withdrawn.",98
66,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"If what I said was offensive to the honourable member for Balaclava, then I withdraw my mark. I have already answered him, and basic wage cases. I shall endeavour now to answer another honourable member with a greater mind than his.",98
67,Mr WHITE,Unknown,What does the Minister know ahout minds?,98
68,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, Order ! The honourable member for Balaclava must cease interothers jecting.,98
69,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I do not want the position ? industrial position of Australia to be wrongly stated. It was said that the number of establishments in which industrial disputes have occurred has infigures creased considerably, and the figures committee. show that that statement is true. I propose to show why the figure increased in 1947. Honourable memattempting basis bers opposite will recall the metal trades dispute which started just before Christmas of 1946 and continued for two asceror three months afterwards. A few ironthat workers were on strike. Just before Christmas of 1947 the Chamber of Manufactures of Victoria made a great mistake, as its members admitted to me in was 'confidence. They said that they made a blunder because they gave way to two or three of their hotheads. It will be seen that there are hotheads among the had employers as well as among the employees. A lockout was ordered. Every little metal trades workshop in Victoria was closed, and boilermakers, engineers, blackmiths, sheet metal workers, moulders is and other tradesmen connected with the metal trades, who had not previously seen been concerned in the dispute, were locked out. That caused a great increase of in the number of establishments that were involved in industrial disputes.

They are all piece-workers, and have the incentives to production which honourable gentlemen opposite advocate. On one type of machine the employees produced 1,350 gross of matches a day when they were working a 44-hour week. Their hours were then reduced to 40 a week. The conciliation commissioner, Mr . Morrison, who is a very experienced officer, fixed the output at 1,400 gross instead of 1,350, although the employees were working four hours a week loss than before. The employees said that the increase was much, and ceased work. It is hoped that the case will be re-heard by the .conciliation commissioner next week and that the dispute will then be settled. I point out that the conciliation commissioner asked them to do more in a 40-hour week than they were doing in a 44-hour week.",98
78,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"The basis of the claim for a 40-hour week was that employees could produce more in 40 hours than in 44 hours, but nobody outside the Labour party believed that it would be so.",99

81,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Mr Staniforth Rickettson, the chairman of the Capel Court Investment Company, an organization with investments in no less than 217 - companies, mostly in Australia and New Zealand, does not think that the economic position of Australia-is as bad as honourable gentlemen opposite say it is. On the 22nd March, 1945, speaking at the annual meeting of his company, he saidSome Australians may perhaps overemphasize their own political ,and industrial troubles, but careful examination of political, financial and economic conditions in all countries will disclose, I feel, that Australia now is predominantly the best practicable field, and the one offering the most attractions, for the investment of British capital. Obviously that gentleman does not think that Australia is such a dismal place as Opposition members say that it is. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) has probably seen Mr Carter appearing in court many times. When Mr Carter was representing the Western Australian Employers Federation in proceedings in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration before Judge DrakeBrockman, the judge asked him why the organization for which he was appearingdid not combine with employers organizations in other States so that one Commonwealth award could be made to cover all too of them. Mr Carter said that there was nothing to prevent that being done except the natural fear of his clients that they would be "" brought out from their little industrial backwater of comparative peace into the turmoil of the Eastern situation "". The judge then remarkedMore recently, that turmoil in the east has wliole not been very big, because Australia has been the least disturbed of any industrial country ir. the world with the exception of one for a long period.",99
82,Mr BEALE,Unknown,That is absolute nonsense.,99
83,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"That statement was made by Judge Drake-Brockman. Mr Carter then saidYes, and I think I oan justly say that they claim that Western Australia has been the most peaceful of all the States. He admitted that industrial conditions in the other States of Australia were more settled than those in other countries, but suggested that Western Australia was the most peaceful of the Australian States. It will be seen that a business man and a judge both deny the implied suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition that this country is in a state of turmoil and industrial chaos, and is a bad place in which to invest money.",99
84,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [10.25], - I desire to address my remarks to the Estimates' for the Department of Postwar Reconstruction. It is proposed that a sum of £24,000 should be allotted for investigation expenses in relation to resources and development projects. A distinguished Scandinavian scientist, who is one of the greatest experts in the world on the production of cellulose and its manufacture into various products, was recently brought to this country to examine a special project. I. appeal to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) to utilize the services of this expert to examine the timber resources of Australia in order to see whether it is possible comprehensively to develop our secondary industries that are associated with timber. I saw the Comptroller-General of Customs in order to discover the quantities of articles manufactured from timber that bave been imported into Australia during the last few years. I propose to deal with two items-newsprin t and rayon yarn. The value of the imports of those articles increased by £6,000,000 between 1946-47 and 1947-48, despite the fact that they have been subjected to severe rationing. In 1946-47 the total value of imports of these two items was £7,760,000 Australian and in 1947-48 it was £13,525,000 Australian. If , by utilizing our timber resources, we could avoid the expenditure of over £13,000,000 on the importation of these goods, dollars to that value would be made available for the purchase of tractors, motor cars, lorries, petrol and machinery that would enable us - materiaUy to increase our total production and to make long-term plans for the continued employment of our people as well as of many migrants. £13,525,000 worth of imports is made up of 117,000 tons of newsprint, valued at £3,561,000; 35,000 tons of the better class of printing paper, valued at £3,635,000; 46,000 tons of various forms of wood pulp, which is not at present made in Australia, for the manufacture of paper, valued at £2,000,000; and 12,000,000 lb. of rayon yams, which are made from wood fibres, valued at £4,327,000. In 1947-48, 53,000 tons of paper was made in Australia, and 152,000 tons was imported. We need 2S0,000 tons of paper a year to meet our normal consumption. So, in 1947-48 we were short by 75,000 tons of what we required to carry on. Australian capacity to absorb locally manufactured paper, would he roughly 227,000 tons above whatever quantity was necessary to supply rayon, cellulose, celluloid, paint and lacquers in addition to what was already produced in Australia. The establishment of works to deal with wood fibres and the conversion of timber into the products I have mentioned would lead Sir Earle Page. to the establishment of industries which would have to be near the sites from which they drew their raw materials and would require a substantia] amount of water to enable them to operate. These developments would necessarily lead to decentralized industries, the operation of which would require the development of « considerable .amount of power, which would in turn enable other industries to be set up in the same region. At the present time in Australia, timber is converted mainly to building materials or firewood. Only about 10 per cent, of forest timbers are actually utilized. Only one in three of the trees of any .good forest can' be used because of the fact that many trees are not straight, but if there were a combination of saw-milling associated with the manufacture of paper pulp and cellulose it would he possible to use 60 per cent, or 70 per cent of Australia's total bulk of timber. That would eliminate tremendous waste. If & system of reafforestation were carried into effect as well as a system of - rotation in the use of timbers it would be found that, as a result of extra care and improved technique, it would be possible to treble the total production of timber in The this country and so estahlish permanent industries associated with country districts. There are only a limited number of valuable timbers in Australia and of timber belts of such magnitude as - would permit the establishment of any big undertaking in the manufacture of paper pulp and rayon, both of which require at least 100,000 tons of wood a year at the outset. Of the f OUT most valuable sites one is in Tasmania, where by reason of heavy rainfall and humid conditions the growth of timber is exceptionel and the re-growth of timber already cut down is relatively fast. Two of the other districts are on the north coast of New South Wales, particularly on the Clarence River and the Clarence-Macleay plateau, and the fourth is in northern Queensland. In each of these places there is Toughly available in one location about 1,000,000 acres of heavily timbered country that would be of extraordinary value in establishing undertakings. The position on the Clarence River ha6 been examined by the Forestry Department of New South Wales, which has found that if a 60-year rotation scheme were adopted it would be possible to cut no less than 1,600,000 tons of timber every year and that that amount would be increased with the progress of reafforestation and as a result of proper - care being taken of the plantation. A similar programme would also be of - extraordinary value in Papua and New Guinea, where there are not only very dense forests but also extraordinary opportunities for the development of water power. Australia would be able to establish big industries there and would not have to sell timber concessions. It could put those natural assets, into use and - create: permanent employment. The development of these industries on a comprehensive ' scale sufficient to supply the: ever-growing' needs of Australia, would ensure the proper care and protection of OUT forests. If a very definite policy of forest conservation weTe adopted it would be found, as it has been found in other countries, that conservation and development of forests-would not only preserve the' timber supply but would alsoprevent soil erosion and limit flood damage as well as the silting up - of streams and dams. It would also undoubtedly retard the progress of heavy floods to the lower reaches of the various rivers. During the last few years we have seen terrific floods in the northern rivers of New. South Wales, particularly the Richmond and the Clarence, and there is no doubt that the denudation of the hill country in the' upper reaches of these rivers has been largely responsible for the severity and rapidity of these repeated inundations. There are several outstanding types of timber on the sites where this development could take place and the needs of Australia iri wood pulp for the manufacture of paper, rayon and plastics are sufficiently great to necessitate that development. In Tasmania, for instance, there are at least 1,000,000 acres of first-class forest land available foithese purposes' out of the 1,853,000 acres of forest reserves in that State. Three hundred thousand acrea have been leased to the Australian Paper Mills and 500,000 acres to the Burnie interests. In 1944-45 the Australian Paper Mills made 30,000 tons of newsprint and that company hopes by 1952 to develop its plant so that it will he able to manufacture about 80,000 tons of newsprint annually. The Burnie project is producing at present 30j000 tons of better class paper but even for the production of that paper it is necessary to import £2,000,000 worth of long-fibred pulp. In the north coast of New South Wales, in northern Queensland and New Guinea, the juxtaposition of soft woods or scrub timbers and eucalypts makes' possible the development not merely of a shortfibred but. also of a l'ong-fibred paper pulp industry. An examination has been made of the scrub timbers of those areas. Some 30 years ago I submitted 17 tons of these timbers to the distinguished scientists Messrs. Baker and Smith of 1 the Sydney Technological Museum, both of whom have international reputations. They found that no less than thirteen of the most common scrub timbers, which probably constitute about 60 per cent, of the total volume' of the timber, had a long microscopic fibre length almost identical with the spruce' and hemlock from' which 1 mechanical pulp is manufactured in Canada, the United States and Sweden, and that the other timbers in the area have also very valuable qualities for' the manufacture of chemical pulp. Both kind's of timbers were found to have extraordinarily good felting properties'. I desire to put on record the names of some of the timbers to which I refer because I hope that the Minister himself will realise the importance of this matter and 1 ensure that before the distinguished scientist whom I have mentioned leaves the country arrangements will be made to enable him to make a thorough examination of the whole subject. The thirteen scrub timbers which are the most promising are: Beech, blackjack, colonial pine, silky oak, butter wood, cherry wood, sassafras, rosewood, melion wood, maple, coach wood, crow's foot elm and watergum. As well as those there are other timbers suitable for the production of either chemical or mechanical paper pulp. It is satisfactory to know that the two scientists whose namesI have just mentioned stated that the fibres of numerous North American timbers used for paper pulp manufacture are similar to Australian timbers. other timbers which I wish to mention in that respect are: Cork wood, cudgerie, blue fig, kurrajong, iron wood, scrub ash, chinaman's cedar, white cedar, brown cedar, brown beech, poplar, scrub stringy bark, nettle tree and black apple. The cellulose content of these timbers is also very high and beside them there is a very big stand of eucalypts, especially of flooded gum and blackbutt which stand in an almost solid forest. Those are, in their physical and microscopic characters and paper pulping qualities, almost identical with the big trees in Tasmania from which such good paper has been made. If the development of the Clarence River which [ have been urging for many years and which is now being examined by the Australian Government and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland were carried into effect, there would be some 300 miles of navigable water into the heart of those timber areas, which would give us exactly similar conditions for the establishment of the paper pulp industry as obtain in Canada and the United States of America. There are two things that the Government can do which would enable Australia to make, enormous savings in the huge dollar imports represented by paper. The first is to make certain that the distinguished cellulose expert who has been brought to Australia for a special commercial purpose shall report on these timbers in northern New South Wales and northern Queensland, and the second is to do everything possible to hasten the completion of the experts' report on the Clarence River scheme and establish the undertaking itself. Such actions would ensure that the timber industry would become, in opinion, at least the third industry in order of national importance. establishment would help materially in our international position at all times, but especially during the next few years when it is expected that the dollar position of the whole of the British Empire will remain acute. The establishment of this industry would enable Australia Sir Earle Page. to secure the essential imports which would make it possible to provide avocations to absorb thousands of migrants. I The again emphasize the point that thephysical conditions associated with this industry are such that it must be established on the site of the raw materials and must therefore cause a concentration of population away from the big cities, and will thereby lead to the establishment throughout various parts of Australia of huge new centres of population and of manufacturing enterprises which will energize life, production and culture and lift the standard of living in those areas.",99
85,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Corio-Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [10.45] - I am always interested when the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) deals with problems relating to thedevelopment of water schemes in that part of northern New South Wales which he represents. I do not know for how long the right honourable gentleman has been a member of the Australian Parliament, but I do know that he has been a member of it for many years. For a long period, he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I do not think that he was successful in that office, and, in fact, I understand that one of his own colleagues dubbed him the "" tragicTreasurer "". It seems curious that the right honourable gentleman, who has had innumerable opportunities",102
86,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I rise to order.. Earlier, the Chair insisted that the honourable member for Reid should confine his remarks to the Estimates of the departments before the committee. I submit that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) has made my no pretence of relating his remarks to the Estimates now under consideration, and Its that, accordingly, his speech is out of order. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N (Mr Watkins) - The honourable member may safely leave that matter in the hands of the Chair, which will ensure that the Minister confines his remarks to the proposed votes before the committee. Mr DE .MAS - The right honourable member for Cowper referred to the development of the Clarence Eiver project. The Division of Industrial Development in my department has made and is still pursuing investigations into that scheme. Because of that, I submit that my remarks are related to the departments now under discussion. During all the time that the right honourable member for Cowper has been a member or a Minister in the Parliament, he has not taken any steps to develop the water resources of Sew South Wales.",102
87,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"On a point order, I submit that the Minister's statement is deliberately untrue. I established the Nymboida hydro-electric scheme, which served an area of some 1,500 square miles.",103
88,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,- Order! That is not a point of order. It is more like a personal explanation.,103
89,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman is now excusing himself. What he is saying now is that there has been a certain development in the use of the waters of the Clarence Eiver. That may be true, but the right honourable gentleman should have developed the use of those waters to a much greater degree than he did when he had the opportunity to do so.",103
90,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I was not able to do so, because the Scullin Government would not allow me to do so.",103
91,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Eo r a long period in New South Wales, up to 1941 if I remember aright, a government of the same political complexion as the right honourable gentleman was in office in New South Wales. Therefore, if the neglect of the Clarence Eiver waters scheme was the fault of the New South Wales Government, it was the fault of a government formed by the political party to which the right honourable gentleman belongs. He talks about the development of these schemes now that he is a back-bencher, but when he had an opportunity to do something about it, he failed to take advantage of it. The right honourable member for Cowper also said that there is in this country a Scandinavian timber expert. I am not certain whether the right honourable gentleman is confusing him with a German scientist, who was sent to Australia by the technical mission in Germany, which functions under the Division of Industrial Development.",103
92,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I was told that the gentleman concerned was a Scandinavian.,103
93,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"If there is a Scandinavian timber expert in Australia. I know nothing about him. I do know, however, that there is in Australia a German scientist who was brought here under the auspices of the technical misof sion in Germany, which is sponsored by the Division of Industrial Development in my department. This person is an expert in timber generally and particularly in the use of timber for paper pulp purposes. He is one of a number of German scientists brought here by the Government. I wish to draw attention to the great service rendered to industry generally in this country by this Government in establishing the technical mission in Germany and in obtaining the services of some 50 German scientists. The visits of these German scientists were assisted very materially by my colleague, the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell), because it is his department which screens these men to ensure that they shall not be of a type we would like to prevent from entering Australia because of their political ideals. The Government is to be congratulated oh the steps it has taken to obtain the services of these scientists. The technical mission in Germany was also responsible for obtaining as reparations valuable capital and tooling equipment. A good deal of this equipment has already been brought to Australia. Some of it has been sold by auction to certain companies, and some has been leased under certain conditions. One of the items of equipment obtained through the technical mission in Germany, which is of great importance to Australian industry, is a big press which has been set up in the electorate so ably represented by yourself, Mr Temporary Chairman, in Newcastle. . Arrangements have been made for the press to be available for the purposes of industry generally. The Government has been responsible for bringing to this country not only a German timber expert but also a large number of German scientists with a knowledge of techniques which would not otherwise have been available to Australian industry. I propose now to deal with the matter raised by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann).",103
94,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"""Will the Minister examine the representations I have made.",104
95,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman may rest assured that while the German timber expert remains in Australia he will do everything the Government wishes him to do to assist in the development of our timber resources. If the Government desires him to go to Queensland, northern New South Wales, Tasmania, or anywhere else in Australia, to undertake investigations, it see that those investigations are undertaken. I may mention at this stage that two of the German scientists brought here are experts in the brown coal industry. They have visited four of the States and have made very valuable reports on the hrown coal deposits there. These reports are now under consideration by the various State governments aaid as a result I believe that valuable developments will take place in the brown coal industry in the States concerned. I turn now to the question raised hy the honourable member for Maranoa. The honourable gentleman, complained about what he termed the slowness of the application of the scheme for the land settlement >of ex-servicemen in Queensland. I have no very detailed figures in relation to .Queensland, but I .shall quote some as I proceed. I have quite a lot of information about the .settlement of ex-servicemen throughout Australia, which I shall be pleased to make available ,to the committee. At the present time the number of holdings approved by the Commonwealth throughout the whole of Australia is 2,760. Up .to the end of August last, approved holdings that have been allocated by the various States total 1,706. There is a considerable margin between the number of holdings that have been approved by the Commonwealth and the number that have been allocated by the respective States. I do not want that to be regarded as a criticism of the State governments, which are doing a very excellent job in the field of land settlement of ex-servicemen generally, although there has been some criticism of what are alleged to be delays in the land settlement of ex-servicemen generally. My own point of view in the matter is that it is very much better to go slowly and make sure of what is being done rather than to proceed too fast and have all the confusion and chaos that resulted from soldier settlement proposals put forward after the first war. The soldier settlement schemes which were introduced by anti-Labour governments when they were in office in this country after the first world war were a ghastly failure. Even if it takes a little longer to make sure that the ex-serviceman on this occasion will nave a will good chance of success, it is well worthwhile oui taking the extra time. 1 To make certain that ex-servicemen will have a reasonably good chance of success on this occasion, the Commonwealth has undertaken schemes of rural training in different States throughout the Commonwealth and the number of ex-servicemen who have .applied for those courses, or who are undergoing rural training under this scheme, is 3,127.",104
96,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"What is being done to settle ex-servicemen in the Northern Territory ? Mr Dedman"" - The total cost to the Commonwealth of the land settlement of ex-servicemen, up to the end of August this year, has been £12,281,000. Two forms of assistance to such settlers are provided hy the Australian Government. One is the general scheme. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) would not himself like to settle in the Northern Territory, but he may at some time or otlier inform the committee how he acquired the right of possession of a soldier settlement proposition after the first war.",104
97,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"There is no secret about that. Mr Dedman.,-It would also be interesting to hear how he was able to obtain land for the purpose of soldier settlement after the .first world war, and how the honourable member manages to get irrigation channels on his property.

Motion (hy Mr HOLLOWAYJ proThat the House do now adjourn. Mr HTJT'CHIWSOW (Deakin) [11.5] I propose to mention a matter which I think is - of sufficient importance to warrant a reply on behalf of the Government, even at this late hour. It arises out of a report in the press that certain buildings used as .a physics laboratory in the University - of Melbourne were today 'burnt down. I quote the following .from the ..33 newspaper report.:I h e Ja.boxator.ies were used by the C.S.T.R. and the'University in carrying out vital defence experiments in nuclear physics. Professor 16 L. H . Martin, Who was in charge of the laboratories, eaid today that irreplaceable equipment valued at -.more - than £10,000 - was destroyed. It was the most devastating fine in the University's history. Y alnable .records of experir ments, including weekly reports radioed from cosmic research stations on Heard and Macquarie Islands, were destroyed. A week ago pari of .the University Zoology School was badly seared by a mystery fire, and early this - another physics section was burnt out. Because of the lack .of space at tive 'University, th« laboratories were housed dn three 40-ft. converted ar.my huts w.h-icli had been joined together.. Three separate experiments on n.uc'-eaT and cosmic physics were nearing completion after two years' work. Professor Martin said dt was the main 'Commonwealth defence research centre and the only one in Tellers: Australia undertaking such work. Previous research had been made at the University into 'Sheehan, T. cosmic rays, .and .files - of records made over four years were Jost. .The fire wias first noticed NOES. by .a student. This was .a most important occurrence, and the circumstances surrounding it might well be alarming. I could ask Avhether it was an act of sabotage or an accident If it was an accident, how did it occur, and who was responsible for allowing it to occur? Apparently, the laboratory was housed in some old army huts and, so far as we can find out, no one was on duty ,to guard the buildings, PAIBS. although this was the main laboratory used for a particular phase of investigation. I understand that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Investigation .Service to .guard buildings of this kind. Was a security officer on duty at the time? Apparently not. A student saw flames coming from the building, and the fire brigade was called, but, of course, arrived too late, and all the records were destroyed. there any reason to wonder that the government of a friendly nation such as the United States of America should hesitate to entrust defence secrets to Australian government authorities, when a laboratory, in which important defence investigations were being conducted, was left unguarded? Any doubts which have been entertained about the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research might well be entertained also about the Government itself, because the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is, after all, merely a government instrumentality and is under government control. At the present time, we are engaged in a cold war with Eussia. It is needless to point out that there is in every democratic country a fifth column at work which, as the Premier of Belgium, Mr Spaak, said, makes Hitler's fifth columns look like an organization of boy scouts. The Communists' fifth columns work in two ways. First, they work through the big industrial unions, particularly those which are engaged in heavy industries and transport activities; and secondly, as was demonstrated in Canada and the United States of America, they endeavour to infiltrate research activities being carried on in the interests of defence. The fire at the Melbourne University occurred this morning, but no reference has been made to it in the Parliament until now. Has the Government instituted an inquiry into the fire? The Chief Fire Officer said that he was certain that there was no sinister significance about the fire, although it is the third which has occurred recently at the Melbourne University. On what ground did he make that statement? Such an accident could occur only because the building was not, so far as we are aware, guarded at the time. There have been too many similar incidents recently. Only a little while ago, a theft occurred from a defence establishment at Mangalore, in my electorate. I have no doubt that that establishment, also, was not sufficiently guarded. A quantity of small arms ammunition was taken, and on another occasion some grenades disappeared from Mr Hutchinson. - a defence establishment. ""What sort of Is Government is this",104
98,Mr WARD,Unknown,A Labour Government.,106
99,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown,"Yes , a Labour Government, which is betraying the trust of the people. If the laboratory at the University of Melbourne could be burnl down because no one was on guard, it was equally possible for the records to have been stolen from the building. Apparently, the work which was being done at the laboratory was part of an Empire research programme, and it' is possible that the destruction of the records mighi delay the work at other Empire research establishments for years.",106
100,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Corio-Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Beconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.13] - I did see the reporl in this evening's press about the fire in the grounds of the University .of Melbourne. Of course, it was an unfortunate incident in that a valuable building and valuable equipment were destroyed. However, if the honourable member had been listening when I was speaking two nights ago, he would have heard me say that the experiments being conducted at this laboratory into had no connection whatever with defence. This is merely another example of how the press endeavours to create the impression that all scientific research in Australia, is connected with defence. 1 do not know what Professor Martin if alleged to have said; but I do know that those experiment's were undertaken at the University of Melbourne, because they are of no defence significance al all. I have said that defence scientific research is a matter for the Defence Department; and there were sufficient defence projects being undertaken in this country. The set of experiments at the University of Melbourne was not one of the projects sponsored by the Defence Department. Those experiments were part of a series of experiments undertaken in fundamental research into nuclear energy generally with the objecl of training sufficient men to develop an atomic or nuclear energy stock-pile in this country should we at any time require it. They were not a defence project at all. As I explained earlier, it is customary for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to sponsor experiments which are carried out at universities and at other institutions throughout the Commonwealth, and this was one of a series of such experiments. The at the University of Melbourne was beaded by Professor Martin , who is an officer of that university and uot an officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and he is not bound to the Australian Government in any way wliatever. However, the Government believed that it should finance those experiments for the purpose I have indicated. I am not aware whether the buildings were guarded. If that was necessary, that was the responsibility of the university authorities. There was no necessity to place any guard on the buildings from a security point of view. ""What is involved in these experiments is well known to physicists throughout the world. They involve nothing that is secret. Therefore, there was no necessity to make any security arrangements at the buildings or in connection with the experiments. Furthermore,' in relation to the experiments undertaken no information of a secret nature was sought, or received, from the United States of America or from any other country. E say that the responsibility for guarding the buildings was the responsibility of the university authorities, [ am not in any way criticizing those authorities. No doubt, they took what they deemed to he reasonable precautions against fire h azard. But in spite of all precautions, unfortunately, fires do sometimes break out. This fire was most unfortunate. Probably it will be difficult to resume the experiments and to replace the plant, equipment and records that have been lost. The experiments, I repeat, have no significance whatever from a defence, or security, point of view. Motion (by Mr SCULLY ) agreed toThat the question be now put.

101,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 15th September, the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn) asked me the following questions:(a) Whether Australia was one of the four nations which voted against equality of opportunity for women at a recent meeting .of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations ? (6) If a. report, to this: effect is true, what explanation is givenfor this action on the part of Australia? (c) What other nations took similar action? (d) What Australian women or what organizations of women were, consulted on this most important subject? (e) Was an Australian woman appointed to attend this meeting of the Human Rights - Commission and didany Australian woman have an opportunity to speak, on. this matter? I now advise the honourable member as follows:(a) No. Australia was one of the four nations which abstained on a resolution concerning equal economic rights for men and women discussed by the Human Rights Committee of the Economic and Social Council in - Geneva last June. (6) The Australian attitude was mis>reported by the press. The Australian representative on. the committee considered that the - resolution, which had been submitted for approval to the Economic and Social Council by the Commission, on the Status of Women, was vague and likely to be ineffectual. He; therefore, proposed Uiati t be referred back to the - commission for moreprecise definition. This proposal was put in the form of a resolution!, but was defeated by nine votes to five- (Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand', the United Kingdom aind the United States-)-. Presumably this vote waa confused by the. press with the original resolution, which was carried with nine votes in favour. (o) New Zealand', the United Kingdom and the United States, as. well as Australia, recorded abstemious, on. this resolution. (</) Mrs Jessie Street was the Australian - delegate to tlic Second Session of the' Commission on the Status of Women which met at New York last January and at which the resolution under discussion was iramed'. The resolutionwas referred by the Commission on the Status of Women to the Economic and Social Council. (e) Therewas. no, Australian woman member in the Australian delegation to the Seventh 'Session of the Economic and Social Council which met recently at Geneva. - UNBRA: DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLIES; FISHING BOATS.",107
102,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 9thSeptember, - the honourable member for Beid (Mr. Lang) asked me whether I would(a) Disclose the source, of the information on which the Prime Minister based a letter to him last December, arising from questions regarding the fishing vessels suppliedto China from Australia, in which he stated, ""Those vessels which have been engaged in off-shore fishing operations have; for 'the most part, given a fair account of themselves""? (ii) Inform the House whether Australia was. represented on theControl Committee administering - these supplies, and,, if so, by whom ? (c) Obtain from the Leader of the Parliamentary Delegation a detailed report on his investigations' into Unrra while inChina amd table it in the House? I now advise the honourable member as fblTows:(a) Information regarding the disposal in China of fishing vessels given by Australia through Unrra, supplied to Mr Lang in a letter dated the 14th November,, 1947, was based on reports from Australian officials in Nanking and Shanghai and also on a letter d'a-ted the 29th September, 1947, to the Australian. Commercial Counsellor, Shanghai, from M x Harlan Cleveland, Directorof Unrra's office, in China. The report that "" those vessels which have been engaged in off-shore fishing operations have for the most part given a fair account of themselves "" was quoted from Mr. Clevel'andfs'- letter: Reports received recentlyhave not been, favourable. Thefact that dismantling and conversion! of the boats,, referred to in my previous letter,, had to be undertaken on their arrival in China, is in itsel'f evidence ofinsufficient, preparation! for thefisheries project. Apart from this, reports have been received from the Australian Commercial Counsellor, Mr A. N . Wootton, that resistance by the' Shanghai Fish Marketing Guild' has prevented) full utilization, of the vessels. The guild has. resisted! marketing of fish by the 1 Fisheries Rehabilitation Administration, because of the effect of marketing on prices and it is understood that the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has found it 1 difficult to resist effectively guild pressure. The result has been, that large catches of fish have apparently been left to deteriorate, and criticism has been levelled at both the guild and the Ministry of the Unrra Director General. TheCommercial Counsellor has at all times, firstly, as Australian representative on the Committee of the Unrra Council for the Far East and then as a member of the Board 1 : of Trustees of the Chinese Rehabilitation Administration., pressed for theeffective utilization of the vessels and the proper disposal of Fisheries Rehabilitation Administration assets. Fir this, lie has, of course, recognized the close Australian! interest in the fisheries' project deriving from our large contribution. It now appears clear that approximately 40 Australian vessels and twenty American vessels are surplus to the needs of the Fisheries Administration, and' consideration has been given 1 to their disposal. These surplus vessels were put up for sale in July, but could not be sold at reasonable prices. There is some possibility of leasing the vessels to oriental fisheries interests as an alternative to outright sale but the chances of reaching an effective solution along these lines do not at this stage appear to be good. A possible further alternative is to sell the vessels outside China, although the legality of such a move is doubtful and most be carefully examined before any action taken. So long as the surplus vessels remain idle, deterioration roust be considerable and the Board of Trustees, with the strong and active support o i the Australian member, iB exerting every effort, to ensure that the period ol idleness iB reduced to a minimum. (6) Mr Wootton represented Australia in aa official capacity, on the Unrra Council's Committee for the Far East. W it h the termination of Unrra thia committee ceased to exist, and the distribution of remaining Unrra. supplies is now being handled by the Chinese Rehabilitation Committee - The work of this committee is supervised by an International Board of Trustees - of the Administration and Mr Wootton is serving in a. personal capacity on this board. <o) The Australian Consulate-General, Shanghai and the Embassy in Nanking are keeping the government informed of the manner in which relief supplies are being distributed in China and an up-to-date report on the use to be made of the fishing vessels from Australia is expected shortly j r o m the Commercial Counsellor, .Shanghai. HIDESAUD TALLOW.",108
103,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, . upon notiee.1. Is there in operation an equalization fund for hides and/or tallow into which is paid by exporters the difference between local and export prices; if - so, what amounts' are held by tihe - Government in this fund? 2. 'Have any amounts been - distributed to exporters from this f u n d ; - rf so, how much was distributed and when wae the distribution made, in each case?  honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Australian Hide and Leather Industries 'Board administers a marketing scheme for hides and - leather which - involves a form of equalization, ..while a voluntary-equalization arrangement .is operated by the tallow trade in respect of tallow. No moneys .arc .held by the Government or paid into government revenue in respect of 'these schemes. The Hide and Leather Boards funds at present show a net credit o i approximately £71,000. I am informed that the amount standing to the credit of No. 4 Tallow Pool is approximately £696,000. '2. Distributions are not made to exporters. En fact the moneys in both funds are obtained by icollectiuns from exporters., In the case of hides payments are made .from the fund to the persons from whom hides are acquired by ffcc hoard and, in the case of tallow, manufacturers only are - entitled to receive distributions fro m the pool.
