I will repeat them here action did the tax office take to enforce its on those schemes? Secondly, if it did crack being peddled? These are questions of great who do pay their fair share of tax. GST and the amendments moved by the member implementing the GST no doubt bears some NA 16010 responsibility for these taxation cheats which with the schemes they devised for the loss hypocritical in the extreme that the government which I believe will fail to ensure that tax cheats tax.

When the GST is introduced pay 10 per cent more for a lot of food items, milk and fruit flavoured drinks, pies, pasties prepared supermarket meals, potato chips, scones, MCDonald's, Sizzlers, Hungry Jacks, and chips, Chinese takeaway meals, ice-cream Asian foods.
