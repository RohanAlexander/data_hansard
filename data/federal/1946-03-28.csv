2,Mr CHTFLEY,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR," I regret to inform honourable members of the death vosterdav of the Honourable Sir Robert Wallace Best, K.O.M.G. SiT Robert Best's association with the public life of Australia dated from 18S9, when he was elected a member of the Victorian Parliament. In 1901, he resigned to enter the federal sphere. At the first general Commonwealth elections he was elected' a senator for Victoria and thus became a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament. He was Chairman of Committees during the years 1901 to 1903, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leudcr of the Senate from February, 3907, to November, 190S, and Minister for Trade and Customs during 1009-10. Subsequent to his defeat at the Senate elections held in 1D10, Sir Robert Best successfully contested a by-election in August of that year for the Division' of Kooyong in the House of Representatives, and held that scat until 1932. Sir Robert Best attained the ripe age of 91 years. A great portion of his life was devoted to the public service of this country. I am sure that honourable members of all parties will join me in extending our deepest sympathy to the members of his family. I moveTlint this House records its sinccru rcjrret at the dsn Mi of the Honourable Sir Robert Walluce Best, KCMG., former sunn tor for Victoria and member for the Division of Kooyong, places on record it* appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. l£r. MENZIES (Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) - I second the motion. The death of Sir Robert Best has brought to an end a career of great distinction and value. As one of his successors in the representation of Kooyong, it is difficult for rne to believe that almost a quarter of a century has passed since he ceased to take an active part in public or political life. He certainly did not cease to take an active interest in life, because, for the last quarter of a century, during which I have enjoyed a very close friendship with him, I have never ceased to marvel at his energy, enthusiasm, steadily maintained interest in various activities of the community, and constant practice of the law to a very advanced age. Sir Robert Best was a man of amazingly dynamic mental and physical energy. He was also, in my experience of him, a man of amazing generosity towards other people. He had the rare and admirable faculty in an older man of being interested in younger men. He helped me in many ways not only at the beginning of my legal carreer, but also at the beginning of my political life. He bad that faculty which we all so much admire, of being able to talk to very much younger men on terms of equality of mind and experience. I profoundly regret the news of his death. I convey sympathy to the members of his family, and express personal thankfulness for a splendid life of service to this country.",12
3,Mr MCEWEN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR," On behalf of the Australian Country party I support the motion expressing appreciation of the service rendered to this country by Sir Robert Best, and sympathy with his sorrowing relatives. Sir Robert Best was one of that dwindling group of men who played an important part during the very critical formative period of the Commonwealth of Australia. He was one of the leaders in the Victorian Parliament at a time when the legislatures of the colonies were deciding whether the people of this continent should become an Australian nation. It is well that we should not allow the years that have rolled by to prevent us from properly recognizing all that we owe to those who did so much for this country at that period.",13
4,Mr HOLT,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR," I wish to be permitted on personal grounds to add my own tribute to the memory of the late Sir Robert Best. After graduating at the University of Melbourne, I was privileged to serve my period of articles in the office of Sir Robert. I learnt there to respect him, and I developed an affection for him which lasted down through .the years. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has pointed out, despite his very advanced age he was a most active and dynamic man. If there is any truth in the saying that a man is as old as he feels, it is true of him. Almost up to the time of his death he had his regular game on the links of the Kew Golf Club. He actively pursued his' extensive practice of the law in the city of Melbourne. I join in the tribute paid to him for his public service, and add my own expression of sympathy with hi3 widow and family, to whom he was greatly devoted. Question resolved in the affirmative, .honourable members standing in their places. STEVEDORING INDUSTRY. REPORT BYJUDGE FOSTER.",13

"" They cannot be certified as a true and complete reflex of the Commission's business,"" he declares in a report tabled in Parliament today. In view of the fact that this is on the administration of the department, does the Prime Minister propose to susr pend the Minister concerned until the current inquiry is completed, and the report presented? Further, in view of the public interest aroused, will the Prime Minister make public the name of the refugee firm which has been so freis quently mentioned ?",14
9,Mr CHIFLEY,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR,"On e ""question I can answer quite definitely: I do not intend to suspend the Minister.

The matter was referred for inquiry,' under terms of reference of which the honourable member is well aware, to Mr AberShippingsay crombie, and he was directed also to inquire into certain allegations made by the Leader of the Country party. The inquiry is proceeding. I have not read all the details in connection with it, but the Minister showed me the report which the Auditor-General had made to him. There are certain suggestions in the report, and some very strong criticism, but there is no allegation of any dishonesty regarding the transactions of the commission, although there are suggesand tions of carelessness. I do not remember the name of the refugee firm.",14

If so, is it because although, motor car manufacturing provides more employment, the horseracing industry controls more votes?",14
15,Mr DEDMAN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR,"The honourable member is wellaware that the Commonwealth has no constitutional power over the production of goods or services within Australia. We asked the people for that was power at the last referendum, and the member was one of those whoworked very hard to-induce the people to in record a negative vote.

In view of the great demand for coal, is the Government prepared to allow that mine to close down due to the avarice of the company and despite wage-pegging regulations? ""Will the Minister direct the Coal Commissioner to instruct the Production Mansir ger to inspect the colliery forthwith, in order to keep the mine in full production and to maintain the conditions which have been laid down by regulation?",14

Mr Chifley - The Government is not directly concerned with speeches broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission over its network.",15
19,Mr MENZIES,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,This speech waa made by a Minister. ' Mr Chifley - The commission consider was set up 'by a previous govern the rmen.t and given a great deal of independence. I do not know. that the Government would be justified in cabling upon a body in which such powers have been vested to supply copies of the scripts used by broadcasters.,15
20,Mr HOLT,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,The right honourable gentleman could call upon his colleague ' to supply a copy of the script.,15
21,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,"I shall discuss with the Minister for Transport the suggestion that he should supply a copy of the text of his broadcast. Knowing him as I do, I think that he will not mind who reads his script.",15
22,Mr MENZIES,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,Does that mean that if the Minister does mind we' cannot have a copy of the script ?',15
23,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,The right honourable gentleman should direct that question to the Minister for Transport himself.,15
24,Mr MENZIES,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,There is no proper Cabinetat all.,15
25,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,"Le t me be perfectly clear.

27,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,The honourable memMinbre for New England (Mr Abbott) asked a question about that matter last Mr ABBOTT. - Onl y as to policy.,15
28,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,"It has not been the the practice to tell the Commonwealth Bank what it ought to do with its gold holdings, but I have, as Treasurer, discussed the matter with the Governor of the bank and' with the chairman of the former Commonwealth Bank Board on various occasions, I could state the precise amount of gold held by the bank, but I that I ought first to discuss with Governor whether it is desirable to make public statements . about the bank ? gold holdings, or any other kind 1 of holdings.. I do not see much objection to such a statement being made, but I think. I ought to discuss that matter with him;,, because,, as Treasurer, I have never tried to influence the Commonwealth Bank to publish information other than that which the Commonwealth Bank Act requires it to publish. It is not usual for banks to disclose their gold holdings. Indeed, when the Bank of England was a private bank it did not broadcast what it held.",15
29,Mr ABBOTT,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,It always did.,16
30,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,"The honourable member does not know all the details, because it is evident from something he said on Tuesday about gold in Australia that he is completely misinformed. I think the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) made some comment on the honourable member's lack of knowledge of the amount of gold in Australia.",16
31,Mr ABBOTT,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,Then where is the gold?,16
32,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,(Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - Order ! The Prime Minister is replying to a question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Country party.,16
33,Mr CHIFLEY,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,"We have been holding in Australia a great quantity of gold but it was not owned by the Commonwealth Bank. A large quantity was held, on behalf of the Bank of England, but the greater part of that has been shipped. We are also holding gold in Australia on behalf of certain other governments and foreign banks. We have added to our gold holdings, but not greatly, in the last twelve or eighteen months. When I have discussed. the matter with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I shall be able to say whether it is desirable in the public interest to make public details of the character asked for. I shall at least be prepared to tell honourable members, who have asked questions on this matter, privately what quantity of gold is held, even if I do not make a public statement.",16
34,Mr ABBOTT,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR,"I wish to make a personal explanation. When the Prime Minister was replying to a question asked by the honourable member for Indi with regard to gold holdings of the Commonwealth Bank, he challenged the accuracy of certain figures which I cited in a recent debate. I inform the Prime Minister that the figures which I used were supplied to me by the Commonwealth Statistician, Dr Roland Wilson. If the right honourable gentleman doubts their accuracy, he must doubt the accuracy of the Government Statistician. INTERIMAIR FORCE.",16
35,Mr DRAKEFORD,BROADCAST BY THE MINISTER FOR," by leave-As was announced by the Prime Minister recently, the interim air force will consist of personnel required for the force of occupation of Japan and for garrison duty and other commitments in the islands, as well as those required on the mainland for the maintenance, of those forces As honourable members will realise, it is imperative that on completion of hostilities action be taken by the Government in the interest of Commonwealth economy to effect demobilization as rapidly as possible, consistent, however, with the retention of an organization and strength of personnel adequate to cope with immediate post-war commitments and demobilization requirements. Demobilization of the Royal Australian Air Force is being effected in accordance with . the Government's plans, which provide for the establishment of an interim force and commitments, as I have already indicated. The interim force organisation necessary for those commitments has been prepared, and applications, which closed on the 28th February, have been called from all personnel who are still serving in the Royal Australian Air Force, and will volunteer to continue for a period of two years. Those applications are now being considered in conjunction with the personnel requirements provided in the interim force establishment, and recruitment from outside the service to make good the deficiencies will be initiated as soon as the additional numbers required under each of the various musterings are decided. Shortages of personnel do exist in some of the skilled trades, but it is hoped that early recruitment of former members in those musterings will fill - the gap, thus enabling a proper balance in the organisation and strength of the forces to be maintained. As regards the squadrons, adequate numbers of volunteers in all musterings have been provided for the maintenance and operation of our squadrons in Japan and the islands, whilst considerable numbers are available for similar purposes on the mainland, though as a temporary expedient the majority, of such personnel will be temporarily diverted to such work as the collection, storage, care and maintenance of the aircraft equipment, stores, <fec, required for the interim and postwar permanent forces, as well as for the disposal of surplus stocks, demobilisation duties,' and other temporary commitments. J. might add that early consideration will be given by the Government to the organisation of the forces on ' their ultimate post-war. basis, but at the same time, I would emphasise that the interim force will have proper relationship to foreseen commitments in the intervening period. I lay on the table the following paper:Interim A i r Force-Ministeria l Statement. and move That the paper be printed. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. NA MELBOURNE.",16
36,Mr LEMMON,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Has the M i r ' t e r for Commerce and Agriculture seen a statement reported to have been made by Mr. W. MCNamara, a Melbourne stock agent, that if the Government agreed to suspend the meat acquisition order for two weeks, agents would guarantee that Melbourne consumers would have a fairly good supply of fresh meat next week? Does the Minister agree that this indicates that stock agents are responsible for the meat hold-up at Newmarket? Did Mr MCNamara advocate the lifting of ceiling prices and quotas as a solution to the problem? If so, does the Minister know what actuated Mr MCNamara to give unsound advice to the Government, and later shift his ground?",17
37,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"A deputation which waited upon me in respect of this matter consisted of Mr MCNamara, Mr. MCLelland, Mr Field and Mr MCKenzie, and I.believe that they represented stock-owners and agents in Victoria. The deputation requested that the Government lift the ceiling prices and quotas, and said that if that were done they could guarantee future market supplies. In reply to the first part of the honourable member's question, I have received advice on several occasions during the last few days, including a telegram which I received last evening and to which I have not yet replied, to the effect that the acquisition order was mainly responsible for the withholding of supplies, and that the order should be withdrawn. That advice has been repeated in direct communications from the agents' representative in Melbourne. That indicates that the agents consider that they have some influence on the withholding of supplies to Melbourne. However, if the acquisition order is the obstacle, and the agents contend that normal supplies will be restored if the order be lifted, I again say definitely to the agents and to all other meat interests in Melbourne, that when they are able to inform me that normal supplies are available that order will be lifted.",17
38,Mr MCEWEN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture able to confirm an allegation made at. the meeting which offered suggestions in respect to the settlement of the meat dispute in Melbourne that, prior to the action taken by : the Government to issue the acquisition order and take certain other steps which resulted in that dispute, there was a consultation uponsuch projected action between the wholesale butchers and the meat control authorities? It js alleged that Mr Tonkin, the Meat Controller, made an admission to that effect. If the Minister is not able to confirm this allegation will he make inquiries into the matter ? As the principal wholesale butchers in Melbourne are Angliss and Company, which is Vesteys Limited, and the Deputy Meat .Controller - in Victoria was previously an employee of Angliss and Company, and as the authority of the Government to maintain its control of meat may suddenly disappear through a court decision and the Deputy Controller may thereupon resume - work for his former employers, does the Government consider it entirely proper that such ;a consultation should have taken place? I also ask whether the . Government considers it proper that prior to the taking of such action there should have been confidential consultations - between the wholesale bu tetters and the Meat Controller, and no consultations whatever between that GOT vernnient authority and the producers who, af ter all, are the persons principally cohcei'iied ?",17
39,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I shall have an investigation made, and shall supply answers to the principal points raised in the question. CIVILAVIATIO N. WESTERN JUNCTION AERODROME.",18
40,Mr GUY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Whil e attempting to land at Western Junction aerodrome on Tuesday, 'a fully loaded aircraft with 21 passengers aboard crashed into a building because the brakes failed to hold on the sodden surface of the aerodrome. A member of the crew was slightly injured, and the aircraft and the building were extensively damaged. In order to prevent a recurrence of this kind 'of accident, will the Minister for Civil A=vii.ation issue instructions for the construction, at the earliest possible date, of hardened runways at Western Junction and making the surface of the aerodrome more suitable for the landing of aircraft?",18
41,Mr DRAKEFORD,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"My attention has not yet been directed officially to the accident at Western Junction aerodrome on Tuesday. A very brief reference to it, appeared in the press ; . the report .stated that none of' the passengers was injured- Mr GBY - That is 'true.",18
42,Mr DRAKEFORD,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"To date, I have not been given any further particulars of the accident. The landing was one of hundreds of landings which have been made at Western Junction under similar conditions over the years. Whilst I d-o not desire to pass judgment on the crew of the aircraft, the 'fact that so many safe landings have Ibeen made over a long period indicates that it is perfectly safe to operate aircraft on the aerodrome in its present - condition. Nevertheless, I have indicated to the honourable member for Wilmot and other representatives of Tasmanian constituencies that the construction of hard-surfaced runways at Western Junction is now under consideration, and I shall be hapspy, to facilitate the work as .soon as it is possible to do so. FLOOD DAMAGE.",18
43,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"As the Prime Min- . ister is aware, there has been a succession of damaging floods in the northern districts of New South Wales and southern Queensland. The difficulties of the local governing bodies in repairing this damage are obvious, and shire engineers have advised me that, because of the lack of suitable machinery, it is impossible for them to restore many communications. Will the Prime Minister investigate the number of tractors and bulldozers at present in t'he possession of the services? I am informed that dozens of them are held at the Royal Australian Air Force park at Brisbane. Will the right honourable gentleman consult with service Ministers to see - whether this machinery can be made available through the 'Commonwealth Disposals Commission to shire-councils and other authorities which desperately require it? '",18
44,Mr CHIFLEY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Works, because the Director-General of Works supervises the release of earth-moving equipment. Inquiries will be made immediately to see whether tractors and bulldozers can be made .available to local governing bodies to en-able tthem ""to repair damage caused by floods. As the honourable member for Richmond no doubt is aware, this equipment is - in great demand throughout Australia. ' I treat. with reserve the assertion that considerable numbers - of 'these machines are standing idle in various places. Although numb-eais of - these machines are located in' paa-ks or are in .storage, they are lendlease ma-beria-l and the Commonwealth Government - is not yet in a .position to release them. Mi . ANTOIOITT -- I believe that - the .machinery to which I referred has .been .used. - ' ,",18
45,Mr CHIFLEY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"That may be so, but ithe machines may have been obtained - under the lend-lease agreement and used for war - purposes. There is a great deal of lend-lease machinery in Australia; some of it has been used and a small portionhas not been used. The Commonwealth cannot release that machinery until it reaches with the United States of America a final settlement regarding lend-lease. The. Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Eeane), who is now in America, is endeavouring to effect that settlement. I shall ask the Minister for Works immediately to investigate the honourable member's request.. STONY GROUND.",18
46,Mr MORGAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Has the attention of the Minister for the Army been to an article in the last issue of the Sydney Sunday . Sun in reference to a book entitled Stony Ground which has just been, published in London? The is said to be a high-ranking officer on the permanent staff of the Australian Army. He used the pseudonym of "" John Norwood"". In this book, the author* made a sweeping attack on the democratic institutions of Australia, and advocated the setting, up of a. virtual Fascist regime. He advocates the abolibeen tion of trade unions, sterilization unemployable, and other Fascist pracCommerce tices, and claims to be an admirer of British Fascist, Sir Oswald Mosley.",19
47,Mr SPEAKER,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Order ! I .think we have heard enough lurid details.,19
48,Mr MORGAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I agree, Mr Speaker. The book speaks for itself. In view the position that the writer claims on the Australian Army staff, I should like to know what steps the Minister has taken to ascertain his identity. Also, should the real name of the writer 'be revealed, will appropriate action be taken?",19
49,Mr FORDE,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I have read the report to which the honourable member refers, but I am unable to say whether or not the book was. in fact written by an tralian. Possibly, it was not. T have no. means of finding out.",19
50,Mr MORGAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"The British Governagainst ment, could find out. t",19

Mr FALSTEIN.;-Has the Minister for the Army received or read a letter from the Dutch authorities complaining of opium smuggling activities by an Australian Army officer-possibl y he has since been discharged-of field rank? If not will the Minister have inquiries made into this matter, and make a report upon directed it at an early date?",19
52,Mr FORDE,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I have not seen any such letter, but I shall have inquiries' made and furnish a reply to the honourable author member as soon as possible. COTTON GROWING.",19
53,Mr ADERMANN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"About twelve months ago an investigation was made by the Tariff Board into the cotton-growing industry in Queensland, and a report has furnished to the Minister for Trade of the and Customs.. Oan the Minister for and' Agriculture indicate the the Government's attitude to the industry as a result of that report, and will he state whether a bill will be introduced, or any. other action taken, to give security to the industry over a period of years ?",19
54,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,I shall have an inof vestigation made and supply the honorto hold able member with full details. ARMED FORCES. . OCCUPATION FORCE IN JAPAN.,19
55,Mr HARRISON,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Has the Minister for the Army read in the press reports that Australian troops in Japan are complaining of "" unbelievable bungling"" in occupation plans? Is it a fact, as reported, that 129 men are living in'.an Ausnnheated room measuring 120 feet by 140 feirt? Ts it also a fact that, the occupation forces have not been immunized typhus, which is prevalent in Japan? Will the Minister inform the dediHouse what, action has been taken to examine press reports of hardship amongst occupation troops, which persist despite official denials?",19
56,Mr FORDE,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"My attention has been drawn to a report in the press following a similar report of a few days ago. The second report added that ""angry officers blamed fumbling by politicians at Canberra for the state of affairs"" - I say very definitely that-1 doubt whether any officer made such a. statement, because it is absolutely absurd to suggest that any Minister at Canberra has been responsible for the internal arrangements made for Australian members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan. The statement to which the honourable gentleman refers is attributed to an unnamed Reuter's correspondent, who alleges that disillusioned Australian troops"" have complained that plans for British occupation of Japan have been "" unbelievably bungled "". - Such arrangements are obviously a matter primarily under the control of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, who is in turn responsible to the joint Chiefs of Staff, known as Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia, stationed at Melbourne,' who are representative of the United Kingdom,. New Zealand and Australia. Statements of a similar nature to that mentioned by the honourable member, alleging ""bungling "", recently appeared in a report published in sections of the press under the name of a correspondent, Massey Stanley. On that occasion the situation was thoroughly investigated by Lieutenant-Genera.] Northcott - Commander in Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, who, in a report to Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia, described the statements as "" misleading and inaccurate"". General Northcott reported'that the article gave a ""most distorted "" view of the actual situation. GenpraT Northcott carried out a personal inspection of the Australian troops in theirquarters, and, considering the short 'period"" that units had been ashore, he found everything most satisfactory and reported that the men were happy to be in Japan after months of waiting in the tropics. He added that officers and men of advanced units of British, New Zealand and Indian contingents had expressed satisfaction with and admiration of arrangements made for their accommodation and reception. In General Northcott's opinion, the movement into the area had been well organized and efficiently Carried out. There was evidence of damage to certain installations which had previously been occupied by American forces at Kure, but such damage was being repaired and improvements were being carried out. Investigation by General Northcott revealed that fresh meat and vegetables were on issue, and that fresh meat had been available in ample quantities since the arrival of the first troops. Limited quantities of fresh vegetables were available. Temporary heating of buildings had been installed until such time as oil heating stoves oonld be unloaded and tested before use. Sporting amenities were available to troops on arrival, and cinemas and canteens were in operation. The further criticism of the living conditions in the British occupation zone by the Rguter's correspondent has been brought under the notice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia, who in turn will take the matter up with Lieutenant General Northcott. On receipt of a further report from General Northcott the matter will again be considered by Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia. AUSTRALIAN TENNIS TEAM. , ISSUE OF PASSPORTS.",20
57,Mr CONELAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I ask the Minister for Immigration if any application has been made by the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia for passports for a team of four players who propose visiting the United Kingdom to participate in the ""Wimbledon tournament? If no such application has been made by the association, is this just another case of 'trying to put the Government in the wrong?",20
58,Mr CALWELL,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"No official application has been made by the Lawn Tennis Association of Atistralia for the issue of any passports, and consequently no such application has been refused; but that does not prevent the Sydney Morning Herald frommaking one of its usual mischievous and lying statements that passports have been, refused by me for V the Australian tennis team. The other newspapers, of course, published a different story, which proves that the Sydney Morning Herald is now edited and published from the deepest of Sydney's sewers. The facts are that Sir Norman Brookes, chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia, yesterday rang my private secretary and asked him to ascertain from me what the position would be if the association made an applicationfor passports for the Australian tennis team. He was informed that it was the desire of the Government that nothing should be permitted to interfere with the early transport to Australia from the United Kingdom of the wives and children of Australian servicemen, who had priority iri the allotment of steamer passages. My secretary added that as the association's proposal involved the provision, of passenger accommodation from Australia to Great Britain and, a. few months later, from Great Britain to Australia, it was not likely th:it the Government would receive any such application favourably. Sir Norman was also told that such an application would prove embarrassing to the Government and the association alike. My secretary asked if the team would travel by air 'both to and from the United Kingdom, stating that if such an assurance were given, particularly in respect of travel from the United Kingdom to Australia, passports would probably be issued. Sir Norman replied that air travel would be too costly, and that the association desired the team to travel by steamer. During a later conversation on the subject, an officer of the association was told that the issue of passports to the team raised difficulties because of the thousands of people who.had been waiting for a long time to go to London on legitimate business OTwho for compassionate reasons were entitled to priority of travel over members of the sporting fraternity. The Melbourne officials of the association were understanding, and said that already, on two occasions, the association itself had decided not to send a team to Wimbledon as it was aware of the difficulties that existed in regard to passenger accommodation on ships. The pressure for the despatch of the team to Wimbledon came from Sydney, and an attack has been made by certain Sydney officials of the association upon a decision which I did not give and which was not asked of me. I now refer to a conversation between my secretary and two pressmen, one representing the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the other the Sydney Morning. Herald. I do not blame the representative of the Sydney Morning Herald for that newspaper's published distortion of the facts, because what he was told does not appear in his newspaper, which carried a story concocted in Melbourne. These two pressmen were told what the position was, and also that the Government had done nothing to facilitate the passage to Australia of an English rugby team. That team is coming to Australia on a British aircraft carrier and apparently the members of it will serve as ratings en route. The Government.has not provided any facilities or made any arrangements for the displacement of any brides, children or fiancdes of Australian servicemen' by footballers who wish to visit Australia. I do not believe that any true lovers of sport, whether they be cricketers, tennis players or rugby footballers, will support the attempt that is being made by certain people to make political capital out of a decision which, I am sure, will commend itself to the hearts and minds of the great majority cf the Australian people. MEAT INDUSTRY. DISPUT EINTASMANIA .",20
59,Mr GUY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"In view of the fact that housewives in Tasmania were unable to purchase fresh meat recently owing to the dispute in the meat industry there, I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs whether he will make the necessary arrangements for meat coupons which expired while the butcher shops were closed to be made negotiable for the purchase'of fresh meat as and when it again becomes available?",21
60,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Such a course of action would be very unwise and I would not take it. Meat rationing applies to a commodity required for current consumption and, in my opinion, it would be utterly ridiculous to provide that when individual consumers had not been able to obtain supplies of, say, 2 lb. of meat 'a week for a fortnight when it was not available, they should be allowed t.o purchase 6 lb. in the third week. BUFFALO FLY. FOKMAL MOTJOK FOR ADJOURNMENT. Air. SPEAKER (Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - I have received from the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely- ' The serious situation developing in the dairybuffalo ing and cuttle-raising industries of Queensland and Xew South Wales by the southward advance of the buffalo fly. and the failure of the C.'owni'meiit to take steps to deal adequately with the problem.",21
61,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Richmond) [11.26] - It - I move That the House do now adjourn.,22
62,Mr SPEAKER,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Is the motion supported'? Five honourable members having risen in support of tli.e motion.,22
63,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Immediatel y the announcement was made of the nature of the discussion that I am initiating today there was considerable hilarity on the Government side of the House. I assure honourable members, especially those who have any knowledge of the stock industry, that if they were stock-owners in the districts i which the buffalo fly is at present ravaging stock, they would have no cause for mirth. Air. JAMES - The honourable gentleman has raised the matter so often.",22
64,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Exactly . I have - raised it .often indeed. The reason for - my submission of the motion for - adjournment today is that, despite the number of occasions on which I , the honourable member for Moreton (Mir. Francis), the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), the honourable member for Wide.Bay (Mr Corser) and others have directed the attention of the Government to this menace, nothing practical has been ;done. T'he buffalo fly, contrary to fbe'belief of many people, is not a 'huge insect of ""'the blowfly type, but is a very small'fly about one-half the size of the ordinary house fly. It settles in thousands on those parts - of the body of stock which cannot be reached by the tail, the horns or the head, and never leaves the unfortunate animal which, consequently, is tortured throughout the twenty-four hours of the day. I have a copy of a * B Buffalo Fly. letter written to me by Air. P. English, of Malanda, on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland. It was in consequence of the receipt of this and like letters that I proceeded to north Queensland about eighteen or 20 months ago, personally to acquaint myself with the problem. This is what Mr English wrote in May, 1944-i\o doubt you have heard a lot about the .fly. A calamity has befallen upon the c-fittle industry of this area. I am saying this after twelve'months' experience with them. It would make ;i. cattleman weep tears of blood to see his cattle maimed in the manner that this pest does. is quite common to .see raw meat sores six inches square ou a beast. It is difficult to assess actual financial loss. It varies from 15 to 50 pur cent. In my own hcMcl it is the latter. As many as 5,000 flies aittack ii beast and they are on the cattle nigJit and day, giving them no rest. The beasts are near mad. Very quiet cows have to 'be almost, lassoed to milk the in. Tliat indicates what happens when the fly is uncontrolled. If the stock-owner, because of inability to obtain DDT or wire gauze or - other material for traps, is unable effectively to control the depredations of the fly, not only are the unfortunate animals tortured, bait in addition .there is a terrific loss of butter, milk n and beef production, because the cattle do not fatten as - quickly as they otherwise would, or top off. The value of the hide also is depreciated enormously. As I have said, I visited northern Queensland about eighteen or twenty months ago.",22
65,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"That is'a. long time ago. Air.. .ANTHONY - It is a long time ago., as the AUnister says. Upon my - return .to .the south, I organized a deputation/of members to the Minister for Goinrmeiree and Agriculture and the Minister for Munitions .(A£r. Makin)-who , at that time, had the power to make materials available. I regret that .the =Governanen,t has done practically nothing - except make promises. Meanwhile, the fly has been moving southward without much hindrance from the authority responsible for checking its spread. In a letter to me dated the 6th June, 1944, the Alinister for Post-war Reconstruction said that he .considered it utterly out of the question to - establish a buffer area to prevent the southward advance of the fly, and that ""he also considered it impossible to prevent the ultimate spread of the fly to the limits of its climatic suitability.",22
66,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,The honourable gentleman will learn that that is true.,23
67,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"At this time,* I was doing my utmost to impress Ministers with the seriousness of the problem; and I have been continuing my endeavours ever since. On the 6th June, 1944, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, in a telegram to me, said that he was full y seized with the gravity of the problem, but did not favour the sending of a commission to northern Queensland to report on it . At that time, I was, and I have been since, urging that, because of the seriousness of the problem, a commission composed of veterinary experts and cattlemen should be sent to the affected areas to gain first-hand knowledge, and' report, to the Minister upon their investigations. The only satisfaction that I received from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was contained in a letter to him, from the East Barron dairymen's organization which he forwarded to me, asking for the retention of Mr Norris, an officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Ma land a. In that letter, the association saidMr Norris has done good work in the iind with the material he had to work on. On the 21st June, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture wrote to me in the following terms:I am satisfied that all necessary steps have hcen taken to deal with the spread of the fly. That illustrates his complacency. went on to sayOfficers of the Council for Scientific Industrial Ecsearch, in co-operation with State Government officials, have, as you know, giving the closest attention to the spread the buffalo fly in recent months, and under the circumstances I do not think it necessary production is seriously threatened. to arrange for a further investigation to he made by the Federal Tick Commission. Every effort by me and others to have the matter independently investigated has been frustrated. In a letter to the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) on the 11th July, 1944, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture saidIt is known that in parts of the country where the buffalo fly has existed for several effort to help themselves. vears, the cattle have accommodated themunable selves to the lly, and have' shown little signs of loss of condition, although at first they were badly affected when attacked by the flyApparently, that was regarded as good ground for complacency. The letter went on to sayTherefore, while the loss of production may be rather serious in the early stages, it is probable that the loss will decline considerably within a year or two. That was the answer of the Minister to requests for prompt action to avert a calamity. Before I left for northern Queensland in July, 1944, I was assured by the Minister that a research station had been established at Malanda andusing his words- "" everything possible was being done "". When I arrived at Malanda I found . the research station to be a small room in the local hotel building, and the only practical piece of equipment in it was a refrigerator in which to store samples of blood and other matter. The young scientist, whose name is Norris, was keenly anxious to serve, but he was handicapped in every .way by the laek of adequate help and equipment. He had one part-time assistant in the person of the local daily instructor. One would have expected that he would have been provided time with the labour for manual tasks, but he had to do even a substantial part of the fencing in order to erect the f ly trap, ; of which I have a photograph. In the last Estimates an amount of over £750,000 was expended by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I ask the Minister in charge of that institution, how He much of that money was used in the investigation of the buffalo fly problem? I aud challenge him to say that the expenditure, been in that direction exceeded even £5,000, of although millions of pounds is involved in the beef and dairying industries and food I shudder to think of the consequences to the cattle and dairying industries of northern New South Wales and southern .Queensland, if as little is done'to help the farmer as I found to be the case when I visited northern Queensland. The producers there were lef t practically to their own devices. They were using every kind of insecticide from flytox to sheep dip in a desperate They were to secure the necessary materials, such as wire gauze, to build the traps which the Council for Scientific and In dustrial Research said should be used, and which have proved to be effective so far as dairy-farms are concerned. On my returnto Canberra, as I mentioned earlier, I organized a deputation to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, as the result of which 625 coils of gauze wire, sufficient for 650 traps, were made available to the farmers of northern Queensland. I point out, however, that in the area which the fly is now approaching-the Burnett, Gympie, and Maryborough districts and the Moreton and South Coast districts of Queensland - ther e are about 30,000 dairy-farms. I have been informed by the New South . Wales Department of Agriculture that each cage trap-and one will be essential at every milking yard-require s 400 superficial feet of timber and 35 yards of gauze; or, if glass is used, it might require IS square yards of glass. I have not the exact figures with regard to glass. It is only a matter of simple arithmetic to determine that 30,000 dairy-farms will require 12,000,000 superficial feet of timber and 1,000,000 yards of gauze. If glass is used, over 500,000 square yards will be needed. The Minister has said that after the becomes established in a district, the cattle get used to it and no. very serious damage is done, but I have two letters, bearing on that point, one of which from Mr W. D. Davies, secretary North Queensland Coastal Cattle PatNovember, teners Association, Innisfail, who wrote to me on the Sth August last as follows :The fly.is still very bad in this district causing considerable damage to live-stock. From unofficial sources we have been formed that the fly is making rapid progress south., We cannot understand the attitude monwealth Ministers in apparently hedging oiat least not forcing the issue of DDT proper control if necessary to graziers, yet allowing mixtures to be put on the market containing DDT. That letter was written to me in response to representations which I had made the Minister, asking that DDT be made available to stock-owners. The delay providing it is inexcusable, because saw it being sprayed on beasts at TownsI ville eighteen months ago. Not until the 20th November last did the Council Mr Anthony. for Scientific and Industrial Research issue a circular approving of the use of this particular insecticide on stock. It took eighteen months even to get a formula* from the council enabling stock-owners to use it. The Lismore Chamber of Commerce was so concerned recently about the inaction that it wrote to the Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville Chambers of Commerce to ascertain the position in their districts. The Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce repliedApparently the Federal Government has done little or nothing, and the steps'taken by the Queensland Government to prevent the spread of the fly have proved ineffective. The Townsville chamber saidHaving regard to the great importance of the subject, it has not been treated with the urgency and serious attention it deserves. The answer from Mackay was as follows:Very little, if anything, has been done in a concerted way to chock the spread of the pest. When I was in Queensland the fly had become established in Nebo, in the Clermont district. I have a map before me which will show the Minister how seriously the fly has spread since then. In fly January, 1943, it had reached Malanda, in north Queensland, which is 900 miles from the New South Wales border. In July. 1944, eighteen months later, it had is advanced 360 miles, and was then 540 of the miles from New South Wales. In 1945, a letter from the Minister showed that the line of advance was from Spring-sure to Bororen, so that the and fly had advanced 160 miles in seventeen months, and was then only 3S0. miles from inNew South Wales. I am informed by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. of ComAdermann) that the fly is now in the districts of Taroom and Eidsvold, and under is now less than 180 miles from the New South Wales border'. Two years ago it was 900 miles away from the border and now it is only 180 miles away, yet the to Government says that everything possible has been done! The pest is now entering in a district through which it will be able I to spread like a fire through dry grass. t is entering the rich dairying districts of South Burnett, Gympie, Maryborough, and the electorate of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) where the dairy farms adjoin for many miles. There are in those two areas in South Queensland 16,000 dairy-farmers, but nothing has been done'to meet the situation that will exist when the fly eventually reaches there. All that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done is to issue a circular dated the 16th November telling farmers how they can mix an emulsion containing a DDT, and use spreaders of various kinds. Another circular issued about the 30th December gave details of the construction of a new kind of fly trap,- using glass instead of gauze. It was not until the 14th February last that the Minister gave any sign of recognizing the seriousness of the problem. On that date he held a conference with the Ministers of Agriculture of New South Wales and Queensland. [Extension of time granted.'] Afterwards, a statement was issued by the Ministers to the effect, that they realized the problem of the buffalo fly must be treated as a national one. They recognized the inroads which the fly was making into the production of milk in Queensland, and how it was having the effect of reducing the weight of beef cattle and damaging hides. It was further stated that an agreement had been reached to provide funds for research purposes. This was twenty months after honourable members bad stressed as emphatically as possible the danger threatening the cattle industry. The Minister for Commerce aud Agriculture promised that he would try to arrange for a supplementary grant to be made for investigation purposes. Now the fly has reached the northern edge of the south Burnett district, and also the districts of Maryborough' and Moreton. In those districts there are more than 640,000 dairying cattle which produce S3,000,000 lb. of butter a year. There are 864,000 beef cattle, and 16,000 dairy farmers. In northern New South Wales, where the fly may be expected to make its appearance at any time in the next twelve months, there are 1,776,000 cattle of which 976.000 are dairy cattle. Dr Nicholson, of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, has said that fly. once it enters New South ""Wales, will probably spread as far south as Newcastle and Sydney. Butter production in this threatened area amounts to 76,000,000 lb. a year, or 82 per cent, of the total butter production of New South Wales. The area produces 4,491,000 lb. of cheese, or 44 per cent, of the total State production. It also produces 523,000 pigSj or 51 per cent, of the total State production. The value of the butter produced in southern Queensland and New South Wales is £12,000,000. a year. Although food production in this area is so seriously threatened, a mere trifle has been expended up to date by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research on research work to control the menace, and only a handful of men have been made available for the work. In reply to the statement of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture about eighteen months' ago that cattle became inured to the fly after a year or two, and that, there was, therefore, no need to take active control measures, I quote the following telegram which I that - received the day before yesterday from Mr ""W. Davies, secretary of the stock-owners of Innisf ail:Buffalo fly is still severely attacking cattle coastal littoral. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research officials conducting experiments Innisfail district with DDT emulsions which protect cattle from fly for periods of about three weeks after each spraying but DDT very expensive.",23
68,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Did the honourable member first send a telegram to him ?,25
69,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Yes .,25
70,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,And .yet he would let us believe that this information was sent voluntarily by Mr Davies.,25
71,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I sent a telegram saying that I intended to take action in Parliament, and asking him to advise me about the position in his district at - the present time.",25
72,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,The honourable member would not have given that information if I had not asked for it.,25
73,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"It is obvious that he would have wired to me only in reply to a request for information. At any rate, Mr Davies's telegram furnishes the Minister in charge, of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research with evidence that his officials are conducting certain experiments, even if nothing else is being done. I havehere a-map which illustrates the rapid advance of the buffalo fly during the last few years. In 1941, it had reached a line beyond Douglas. B y 1942, it was down to Cardwell, in the In n is fail district. By 1943, it was as far south as Townsville, and in 1944 it had reached Nebo and Clermont. In November, 1945, it reached Springsure and Bororen, having advanced 160 miles in seventeen months. A f t e r the lapse of a further four and a half months, it.had travelled another ' 200 miles south of Springsure, and, is now in the Taroom and Eidsvold districts, where it is only .ISO miles fro m the New South ""Wales border. The rapidity of this advance requires immediate action by the Government. It has not been my purpose to embarrass the Government by advocating the establishment of buffer areas. I believe such schemes to be as impractici-ble as Ministers have described them. !- believed that it. was impracticable to establish such areas, and the Minister, after investigation, came to the same conclusion - It was suggested at one time that a buffer area 50 or 100' miles wide should be established on the Queensland, coast, and ""all cattle removed from it. I did not believe that it was possible to do that. However, I now .make a ""iiggestion that the following measures be applied:.1. The immediate appointment of a statutory body consisting, not only of government officials, but also stock. oAvners' representatives, armed with sufficient funds and powers to take immediate action, and able to give expert advice to the Minister on other phases of the problem requiring additional government aid. ' 2. A greatly increased research staff under the. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to advise on improved methods of control, and able to advise stock-owners of the best a.nd most economical means of attack on the pest. There is much difference of opinion as to the most economical kind of fly trap that can be constructed. Practical men have told me that they can make a fly-trap which costs only half as much as the one recommended by the Council Scientific and Industrial An investigation should be undertaken in onfpr to ensure that the utmost economy - Mr Anthony. will be exercised in connection with trapsOther suggested measures are3. The provision of materials, such as timber, gauze wire and glass, which will be urgently required in large quantities immediately, the fly descends on a district. 4. The strict control of stock movements, and, in certain instances, thetotal prohibition of movement, in order to arrest the advance of the flyas long as possible. 1 pay tribute to the work of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, which has done much to arrest the advance of this pest. The department has continued to use spraying materials, and has placed restrictions on themovements of stock, but despite its ' efforts, the Hy has-adjanced. 5. The construction of traps on a mass production basis for erection by farmers, in order to reduce the cost and make them available quickly and financial assistance to purchase traps where necessary. T have here a photograph of a trap constructed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at. Malanda. ' Anexamination of it will reveal that thetrap is a somewhat intricate arrangement. involving a series of gauze Aviref-Kgcs. ' Tho: large number of traps inquired justifies their manufacture on a mas.?, production basis. 6. The provision of adequatequantities of DDT for the effectivecontrol of the pest, and a sharing of the cost by the Commonwealth Government by way of a subsidy. The use of DDT sprays by dairy farmers and cattle-owners in NCAV South Wales and Queensland Avill involveheavy expenditure. It has already been estimated that the. traps required to combat the fly would cost about £1,000,000,. and as DDT is expensive, I suggest that the Government should devise a scheme under which it would bear some of the costs, as it does now in respect of"" fertilizers, tea, and other goods. I shall not say more on this subject as T knoAv fhat other - honourable members wish to speak. In view of the seriousness of thefor situation, the vapidity with which theResearch. fly is moving, and also the probable greatloss of production, I urge the Government to act promptly. As an illustration! of the loss of production caused by the buffalo fly, I point o'jt that when the fly strikes a dairying district, and is not combated, the production of some cows falls by as much as 50 per cent.; the average loss of production is from 20 per cent. to. 25 per cent. I do not charge the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture with being unsympathetic, but I do not say that he has neglected to do the things which ought to have been done, with the result that when the fly strikes southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, farmers there will be totally unprepared because of the lack of government assistance.",25
74,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.59] - It will lvobvious when I have concluded my speech that this motion has been moved solely for party political purposes. Consequently, the Government does not in tend that the debate shall continue after the suspension of the sitting for luncheon. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has used a number of extravagant phrases this morning. He has spoken of the complacency of the Government and its recognition of this belated problem, aud has gone so far as to charge it with neglect of duty. Let. us look at the problem in order to see who has been guilty of complacency, a belated recognition of the problem, and neglect of duty. The buffalo fly problem is not something new. The fly was recognized in the islands to the north of Australia, over one hundred years ago,and it, probably caine to the Australian mainland about that time. It was first officially recognized on the mainland of Australia in 1912, and in 1926 the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research began its investigations with a view to combating the pest. As - the honourable member has stated, this pesr is n. small fly. It is entirely different from the cattle tick, which can be dealt with by dipping the animals affected. The buffalo fly is transported on the bodies of cattle and it can fly on its own account. It is, therefore, a very much more difficult pest to control than is the cattle tick. The spread of this pest can belikened to the spread of a contagious disease. Should a case of influenza occur and the patient be completely isolated from contact with the outside community, the spread of that disease can be controlled. But it cannot be controlled so effectively once it has begun to spread through the community. Exactly the same thing happens in connection with the buffalo fly pest. It could have been controlled in the past, when governments with views similar to those held by honourable members opposite were in power, but today the pest has spread to such an extent that at this stage its further advance cannot be checked. That is the opinion of scientific experts, who have studied the problem. If the honourable member for Richmond thinks that he knows what is likely to happen better than they do. he is setting himself up as a. judge in matters of which he does not know much. As I have said, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research first began its investigations in 1926. A survey carried out in conjunction with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture showed that the fly bad spread as far east as the Robinson River. At that time it was confined to a fair l y narrow belt of favourable country south of the Gulf of Carpentaria. I admit that that was a long time ago, but at that stage-the advance of the fly could have been prevented. It is useless for the honourable member for Richmond to say that the present Government should stop 1 the advance of the buffalo fly. Hie charged the Council for - Scientific and Industrial Research with neglect, and asked how much money had been expended on attempting to eradicate the pest. As research into the buffalo fly pest has been in progress for twenty years, it is impossible for me to say at a moment's notice what expenditure has been incurred in that connection. It is not, however, a matter of the expenditure of money. If £1,000,000 were expended, and an army of scientists were engaged in research, the advance of the buffalo fly could not now be prevented. In 1929 two entomologists were sent to Java, to study the. buffalo fly pest there, and they continued their work in that region and in northern Australia for several years. The original object of the work in Java was to determine why the buffalo fly was not considered a .serious pest in that country. When the fly reached the mainland of Australia the conditions were entirely different, and it - became a pest, whereas it is not a pest in the country where it originated. By 1931, it had spread well into Queensland. Honourable members opposite supported governments that were in power from 1931 onwards but they did not do anything to stop the advance of the fly when it could have been checked by the provision of a buffer area. I agree with the honourable member for Richmond that that is not possible today.",27
75,Mr MCEWEN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,If it is not. possible now how could it have been possible then ?,28
76,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Larg e areas suitable for use as buffer areas existed. The advance of the fly could have been stopped then, but it cannot be stopped in that way today.",28
77,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"If it could have been stopped then by buffer areas, I believe it could be stopped now; but I do not think it could have been checked.",28
78,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"The honourable member said that it was impracticable, and I agree, but it was not impracticable then. Two methods of tackling this problem exist. Because it is as well that the opinion of those who have investigated the problem should be made perfectly clear, I propose to quote their report to me.",28
79,Mr ABBOTT,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Who are the scientists?,28
80,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,This statement was prepared by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I assume that it was written by the officer in charge of the investigation.,28
81,Mr ABBOTT,FAT STOCK SALES AT,What is his name?,28
82,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Mr Norris. The statement reads as follows:It is important to make clear a.t the outset member ? that it is quite out of the question to that it will be possible to prevent the of the buffalo fly into new areas. When becomes established in a new country, And it became established when governments supported by honourable gentlemen opposite were in powerit is impossible to prevent its spread ultimately to the limits to those parts of the country that avc suitable for its existence. The best that can be expected is to delay its spread and to evolve means of reducing the damage caused by the pest. It will be seen from the following brief outline of the work that has been carried out already that every effort has been made to delay the spread of the buffalo fly and to find satisfactory means of controlling it where it does occur. One reason why I believe that this motion was submitted for political purposes is that the mover, the honourable member for Richmond, spoke of having visited Malanda as far back as 1944. Honourable members will note that all the letters he read were dated in 1944. I went to Malanda at a much more recent date and made a thorough investigation of the incidence of the fly and its effect upon dairy cattle at Malanda and on the Atherton Tableland generally. The pest can be controlled on dairy farms and there is no reason to believe that it has caused. a 20 per cent, loss of dairy production. If dairy-farmers take adequate precautions",28
83,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"That is, if they can build traps?",28
84,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Yes . - Mr ANTHONY - That is the crux of my argivment.,28
85,Mr MCEWEN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Why , then, does the Minister say that nothing can be done?",28
86,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,I said that nothing could be done to prevent the spread of the fly to areas where climatic conditions allow it to thrive.,28
87,Mr ABBOTT,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Does the Minister say that that applies to all pests?,28
88,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"No . I am dealing with what the honourable member for Richmond said about conditions at Malanda in 1944. I was at Malanda in 1945, months after the honourable gentleman was there.",28
89,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,That was after an honourable member had obtained the gauze to enable tha dairy-farmers to build traps.,28
90,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"What "" honourable expect spread Mr ANTHONY - It was I . a pest Mr Dedman - The honourable member got it !",28
91,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Yes , as a result of a deputation to the Minister.",28
92,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"The honourable member has never produced anything useful, except bananas, in his life.",28
93,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,Onl y after that deputation was the gauze made available. Nothing was done until then.,29
94,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"My inspection of the area in 1945 proved that the fly could be controlled on dairy farms. I examined many farms where traps had been erected and saw that they are effective. The honourable member for Richmond referred to improving the traps. I do not know whether he meant traps of the type that lie saw in 1944 or that I saw in 1945. Improvements to the contrivance are possibly being made all the time, but the latest model trap, which is described in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research bulletin on the subject, is a great improvement on the American-type trap that was originally .suggested to the council as being possibly of soma use. If the honourable member can suggest to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or the Queensland Department of Agriculture further improvements, they will be considered, but I suggest that the honourable gentleman, .who is perhaps an expert on banana production, is not so expert as are the officials of the Queensland Department of A g r i culture on such devices as the buffalo fly trap. However, if he lets us have his plan, it will he considered. The honourable member said that the Government had taken some action in this matter after the harm had been done. He used the phrase "" A f t e r the horse got out of the stable but the. horse got out of the stable, when the government he. supported was in power, not while the Labour party was in office. The honourable gentleman made seven suggestions. I took a note of them as he. made them and T intend to deal with them seriatim. The first was that a statutory body should be appointed. A statutory body to deal with this matter would have to be appointed by the Queensland Parliament. Mr AnrtixE CAMERON - Where Labour is in powpr.",29
95,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"We l l , I claimed that this motion was moved for political purposes. The honourable member knows perfectly well that this Parliament has no power to set ,up a statutory body to deal with the problem in Queensland because it is a. State matter. That disposes of the honourable gentleman's first point. Hi s second suggestion was that the research staff engaged on investigation of the buffalo fly problem should be increased. I have already said that the staff is sufficient to handle the problem. Both the Minister for Agriculture in Queensland and I have had innumerable letters from dairy-farmers saying how much they have been helped by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in its research into the buffalo fly problem. I have already pointed out that, regardless of expenditure on research or the number of research workers employed, we cannot do more than is now being done to combat this pest. Money is not the obstacle to a solution of the problem. The honourable member's thir d point was that the Government should, provide the materials needed for the construction of these traps. He knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth Government has not the power to produce those materials, and that it has handed back to the States the controls it exercised in war-time. The State governments now entirely control the distribution of those materials. Therefore, it is sheer hypocrisy for the honourable member to suggest that the Commonwealth should provide those materials when, he knows that only the State governments can do so. The fourth point made by the honourable member was that the Commonwealth should restrict the movement of stock; but the Commonwealth has power to do that only in war-time. Only recently, honourable members opposite were complaining about the retention of controls, and raised a great, outcry when I suggested that the Government might find it necessary to acquire stock on the hoof. The. honourable member for Richmond knows that the only way the Commonwealth could control the movement of stock would be by regulation under the National Security Act. He knows that the State Government has power to restrict the movement, of stock if it wishes to do so. He suggested that the Commonwealth should do something which he knew it could not do. His fifth point was that the Government should enter into mass production of traps. Replying to a question this morning, I reminded honourable members opposite that at the last referendum the Commonwealth asked for power over production. The honourable member for Richmond wa.s among those who went throughout the country urging the people to refuse to .give the Commonwealth power over production of any kind whatsoever.' Now, he says that the Commonwealth should arrange the mass production of traps: He asks the Commonwealth to do something which he himself denied it the power to do through his advocacy in opposition to the Government's referendum proposals. The honourable member's sixth point was that the Government should provide extra money for this purpose. If the Government of Queensland requires financial aid from the Commonwealth in order to assist primary producers who have been involved in increased expense in combating the buffalo fly it can, like any other' State Government, apply for such assistance, so that the matter can be investigated and dealt with on a proper basis. Finally,- the honourable member said that the Commonwealth should take steps to ensure sufficient supplies of DDT.",29
96,Mr FRANCIS,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Hear , hear!",30
97,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) was also one of those who campaigned against the Government's, referendum proposals. He knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth has not the power to commandeer supplies of DDT or any-' thing else except for defence or other purposes prescribed under the Constitution.",30
98,Sir EAIUJO PAGE,FAT STOCK SALES AT,The Army has big supplies of DDT.,30
99,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"And the Army has used those supplies in order to control diseases in territories in which it was operating. As a medical man the right honourable member would have been the first to criticize the Government if the Army authorities had failed to obtain plies of D1)T for that purpose. [Extension of time granted.'] I - have dealt with the seven points made by the honourable member, for Richmond in moving the motion, and I have controverted each, of them. I have shown that they are matters which do not come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, or, if they do, the necessary steps have been taken by the Government. The honourable member made a - visit in 1944 to areas in Queensland infested by buffalo,fly. . Evidently, he is. completely out of touch with the present position, because he had much to say about the adverse effect of the fly on dairy herds, whereas the trap which has been evolved is completely effective in controlling the fly among dairy herds. However, the problem of combating the pest among cattle on the ranges must still be overcome. It has been suggested that traps erected at salt licks or drinking places might prove effective in dealing with the fly among such cattle. Whilst dairy cattle are yarded every day and can be passed through the trap without inconvenience to the farmer, it would appear that the only way of combating the pest among, cattle on the ranges would be ' by using ' disinfectants such as DDT. The Commonwealth Government cannot produce DDT, which is a patented preparation. The patents are owned by a very big chemical concern which has, in fact, a monopoly of them throughout the world. Again, I remind honourable members opposite that they campaigned against the Government's request to be given complete control over monopolies - Yet today they complain that the - price of DDT is too high. I have also heard complaints that some disinfectants which are being sold under different names and which purport to contain a percentage of DDT are, in fact, entirely useless. The Commonwealth Government has not the power to test preparations of that kind in order to see whether they conform. to label. In fact, the community can be exploited by the sale of these patent preparations just as much as it is exploited by the sale of patent medicines. But the Commonwealth has no power to deal with these things; it has no power to deal with any preparation which is a product of a big monopoly.. Honourable members opposite supare responsible more than any one else in the community for our lack of power in that respect. I repeat that the motion has been moved, purely for party political purposes. If any blame is attachable to any government for failure to recognize this problem earlier and to take adequate steps to deal with it that blame rests upon government which honourable members opposite supported. Those governments failed to prevent this pest from crossing from the Northern Territory into Queenslandand did not do anything to deal with it at that stage when it would have been - quite easy to do so. But, now, they criticize this Government for not doing - something when the position has practically got out of control.",30
100,Mr FRANCIS,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Moreton) [12.25] The remarks of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) have been the most pathetic that I have listened to in this chamber. They were not only unworthy of a Minister, but also stupid. What a hopeless outlook it is for the producers of Queensland and New South Wales when the Minister holds up his hands in righteous indignation and says that he lacks the power, under the Constitution, to establish an organization to combat the buffalo fly and assist primary producers to get gauze and glass and timber for their traps on sheds. The Minister states that because honourable members on this side of the chamber did not support the Government's referendum proposals, he is not now able to catch even a buffalo fly. What an appalling proposition! The Minister's reply is the weakest that I have ever heard in this House. The honourable gentleman should bow his head in shame. Hundreds of thousands of producers 'from north Queensland to New South Wales are ou the verge of losing the productivity of their live-stock at a time when the world urgently requires more fond. People are starving in the devastated areas of Europe, our kinsfolk in Great Britain are undernourished, - and India is experiencing a famine. Australia should be' the storehouse - of the world, capable of satisfying the needs of all those hungry people, but all that the Minister could say was, "" I cannot do anything unless the people endorse the Government's referendum proposals"". Words can hardly describe his attitude. . Never before have. I heard such stupidity in - defence of inactivity. Years ago, this Government was warned of the danger of the buffalo fly. I first raised this matter when the present Government, was in ' -.ffice on the 27th January, 1943, and Honor-1946.] Buffalo Fly. 725 able members opposite received my warnings with derision. On that occasion, the Minister said that he had not received any representations about the danger, and did not know anything about it. I then pointed out what had been done to bring the matter to his notice. Between January, 1943, and today the buffalo fly has moved 900 miles down the coast of Queensland, destroying valuable beef cattle and the productivity of dairy herds. The pest is responsible for the loss of 25 per cent, of the calves, through being born prematurely, a loss of weight in cattle as high as 25 per cent., a loss of at least 3s. a hide, and a decline of dairy production of 33 per cent. In 1943 I warned the Minister of those dangers, but he took no action. On the 19th July, 1944, a deputation, which included the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) and myself,, waited on the Minister. We pointed out the serious consequences of the spread of the buffalo fly, and appealed to the honourable gentleman forassistance to obtain supplies of gauze, timber, and DDT for emulsions for .spraying stock, in order to check it and for the provision of traps. What has happened ? To-day, the Minister declared that he cannot do anything because the Government has not the constitutional power to act, but that if we had supported the Government's referendum proposals last year the position might have been different. He implied also that if we did not support the forthcoming referendum he would never be able to catch a buffalo fly. Never in my life have I heard such foolishness. It staggers me. The ravages of the buffalo fly are also affecting the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. "" Because of the menace, hundreds of ex-servicemen are reluctant to engage in cattle-raising and dairy production. Two gentlemen who purchased large and valuable properties in my electorate, discussed the problem with me. They informed me that they had bought the properties for their sons, who had served this nation faithfully and helped to defend it during the war. Thoy desired to raise stud stock and stud dairy cattle, but because of the ravages of the buffalo fly, they would not attempt to do so. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has a "" dead hand "", he murders everything he touches. Through his neglect, food production is suffering. No person in this community is more dangerous than he is. The Re-establishment and Employment Bill, which he introduced, provides preference for ex-servicemen for a period of only seven years from the 15th August, 1945. The Minister reduced the period as far as he possibly could, and thereby reduced the value of the preference almost to vanishing point. To-day, hundreds of thousands of servicemen who have not yet, been demobilized will receive the benefit of the preference for a period substantially less than seven years. Whenever the Minister is allotted a task he fails dismally. I urge him to realise that his indifference to the ravages of the buffalo fly will cost Australia hundreds of millions of pounds. Because of his neglect, food is not being produced in the required quantities. In spite of his contention that he lacks the necessary authority, this problem could be properly tackled if the Commonwealth supplied the Government of Queensland with all the assistance that it needs. With that spirit of co-operation, the pest could have been successfully combated in 1943, when I first raised the matter. But instead of doing that, the Minister is happy to sit back, raise his bands in righteous indignation, and say that he cannot do anything. If the honourable gentleman met some of the cattlemen in my constituency, be would hang his head in shame. Ex-servicemen's organizations in Queensland invited him to visit them and discuss their problems with them, but instead of going north, he went as near to the South Pole as he could. I challenge him to make the utterly stupid speech, which he delivered this morning, to some of my constituents, or the electors of Maranoa and Wide Bay. If he did so, he would not leave their meeting without being severely handled. He would not deserve to. Our rural industries are being seriously affected by his indifference. Why does he not, do something? To-day, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) referred to the many attempts that had been made to Mr Frnncis. arrest the spread of the buffalo fly. But the only reply which the Minister made was that he had no power to act. Where there is a will there is a way. I am satisfied that if the Minister had the inclination, he could tackle the pr'oblem. Instead of doing so, he occupied the time at his disposal this morning in pointing out what he could not do. We are not asking for that information. We should like to know whether he proposes to do anything, because we are anxious to cooperate with him. He accused us of political motives in launching this motion. There can be no politics in the destruction of two of the principal industries of the Commonwealth, namely, the cattleraising industry and the dairying industry. They have been important factors in establishing Australia's favourable trade balance overseas so as to enable us to import, the raw materials that we require for our development. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has done as great a disservice to Australia in regard to these industries, as he has done in the handling of the problems of ex-servicemen.",31
101,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Gwydir-Minister - for Commerce and Agriculture) [12.36] - I have listened with, interest to this debate. At least, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) endeavoured to indicate some reasonable method whereby assistance could be given by the Commonwealth Government to counteract the depredations of the buffalo fly, and for that practical contribution to the debate we are grateful; but generally speaking, honourable members opposite have, by interjection, suggested utter impossibilities. The Government has no wish to minimize the seriousness of this pest which is menacing the beef cattle and dairying industries not only in certain parts of Australia, but also in other countries. Endeavours to halt the onward march of various species of the buffalo fly in the United States of America have Leen without success. As the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) said, the ultimate check is climatic conditions. It is true, as the honourable member for Richmond said, thai, some time ago a deputation waited on mu and that I promised to visit areas affected by the buffalo fly. Unfortunately, circumstances prevented, me from f u l f ling that promise. Tbere was no lack of will on my part to make the visit, but certain difficulties arose, and I found it impossible. However, I sent to tbose areas, a man who is more familiar with the history and movements of the buffalo fly than any one else in this country. I refer to the Director-General of Agriculture, Mr Bulcock, who for twelve years was Minister for Agriculture and Stock in Queensland. Recently in Brisbane, a conference was held of Commonwealth, Queensland and New South ""Wales Ministers and technical officers, including the most highly qualified technical men in those States. Delegates included myself, the Queensland Minister for Agriculture and Stock, the New South ""Wales Minister for Agriculture, Mr E . H . Graham, the Commonwealth Director-General of Agriculture, Mr F . W. Bulcock, Mr . A. H . ""Williams, Live-stock Officer, Department of Commerce and A g r i c u l ture, Mr Max Henry, Chief of the D i v i sion of Live-stock, and Dr Legge, Chief Veterinary Officer of Queensland. We went into the matter thoroughly. We had before us the history of the buffalo fly and could trace its movements over the years. All available information was supplied to us by scientific and veterinary officers. The conclusion reached was that the depredations of the fly could bei reduced only by some method of control, and that the only effective method of control seemed to be the setting of traps. The real difficulty with which cattle-owners have had to contend is that of securing adequate supplies of DDT . ""When I visited Queensland recently, I received deputations from stock-owners in the areas affected by the buffalo fly, and from the Graziers Association of Queensland: The chief complaint voiced by the spokesmen for these deputations was the inadequate supply of DDT and also its high cost. In addition, there was serious criticism of the quality of the DDT that had been supplied. A promise was given by Queensland and New South Wales Ministers, that immediate steps would be taken to have an analysis made of all supplies of DDT to ensure that it met specific requirements. . That seemed to satisfy most of the stock owners. To i l - every deputation that has waited upon me in regard' to this matter-ther e have been four or five-I have put the question, "" What do you suggest can be done to prevent the spread of the fly?"", and on not one occasion has anybody been able to offer a worthwhile suggestion. All that the deputations sought was the assistance of the Commonwealth and State Governments in ensuring the availability of materials necessary for the erection of traps and only in the dairying districts. They assured me that on the Atherton Tableland four or five hundred traps were operating. I have been informed also that the depredations of the fly are worse immediately upon its entry to a new district. A f t e r that, the stock seem to become more tolerant, and to some degree immune fro m attacks.",32
102,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,There is a difference between coastal stock and stock in the drier areas.,33
103,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"I gather that only in exceptional circumstances can the fly live in the drier areas. In very wet seasons it may spread so far inland as Tamworth, but as soon as dry conditions re-assert themselves, it returns to the moist coastal areas. Members of the Queensland Parliament and cattle owners in the subtropical coastal portions of Queensland have told me that in those regions, after a certain period, stock becomes immune to a certain degree from the buffalo fly. They do not suggest that it is not still a pest; but the general opinion is that its effect upon the stock is minimized. They informed me, also, that they do not think there is anything that can be done. We discussed at length the proposal of a buffer area, and came to the conclusion that it might be a possible solution. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The M in ister's time has expired.

Motion (by Mr Dedman ) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an net to approve an 'agreement made between PAIRS. His Majesty's Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and His Majesty's Government of the State of Queensland, and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",34
105,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES AT,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and' Industrial Research) [2.17] - by leave21 I move38 That the bill be now read a second time. The bill is to approve the sugar agreement made on the 17th December, 1945j between the Commonwealth Government ""and the Government of Queensland. The bill, which is in substantially the same AYES. terms as the Sugar Agreement Act of 1941-1946, is one of a series of agree-.ments dating back to 1915 made betweensuccessive governments of the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland'. T h irt y years of experience have demonstrated the special suitability of the sugaragreement as an effective means of protecting the industry and for giving ade? quate consideration to the reasonable1 - needs of growers, manufacturers, distributors and consumers. Commonwealth and Queensland governments of every political complexion have, since 1915, been parties to various renewals of the agreement. It has indeed become a non-party matter. The existing agreement is - due to expire on the 31st August, 1946, and the Commonwealth Government has accepted the invitation of the Government - of Queensland and. decided to renew the agreement before its expiration. It is aiecessary that the agreement be approved as soon as possible so that the industry will know the position which will exist after August. 1946, and be able to plan accordingly. The Australian sugar industry is to be congratulated on the very good production effort it made in the very difficult circumstances existing during the war. As in the previous war, Australian consumers and manufacturers were protected by the fixation of the home consumption price by the sugar agreement. No matter what fantastic heights the price of sugar reached on the world's markets, and irrespective of whether Australian seasons were good or poor, Australian consumers for very many years have had to pay only. 4d. per lb., which, as the following statement shows, is the lowest retail price in any capital city in the world at present. („oii n t ' r y . Aust. United Kingdom Canada 5.67 South Africa 4.38 New Zealand 4.00 India 5.90 USA. .. 4.99 Sweden 4.99 Italy . . 27.9 Spain . . 20.1 ""Consumers and manufacturers have been protected under the sugar agreement from the high prices prevailing in the world's .markets not only during the war but also during peace-time. The present retail price of sugar has stood for fourteen years. In this respect, it takes a unique place amongst important primary pro-ducts. Exporters of manufactured proof - ducts are protected by special conditions in the agreement which enable them to tralia. obtain their sugar at the Australian equivalent of the world parity price or £32 10s. 9d. a ton, whichever is the lower. Whilst accepting with gratification the stability and security which the agreement' affords, the industry has expressed some fear for the future. The limitation of prices to prevailing amounts was viewed with some misgivings and assurances were .sought that the Commonwealth would meet any further increases of production costs and reimburse the industry in the event of a fall of export, prices. It must be pointed out that the industry has been able to carry on at the present domestic price, despite increased costs of certain of its requirements, principally because of the remarkable improvement of its efficiency. The acreage yield in terms of raw sugar is now at least twice as great as it was in 1900, while the mills have also - greatly increased their efficiency during the last 30 years: Further, the Tariff Board in 1944 conducted an intensive investigation into the economics of the industry in respect of the 1943 crop, which was one of the worstseasons experienced, but found that the payment of a subsidy was not waiv ranted. The Commonwealth Government, however, while taking the stand that there could be no grounds for varying the existing terms of the agreement, recognized that future Australian cost levels were unpredictable, and accordPrice. pem: ingly gave an assurance to the Queensper lb. land Government that if, during the 5.0 currency of the agreement, cost levels in Australia increased substantially it would be prepared, on representations from the Queensland Government, to give consideration to instituting an investigation into the sugar industry's, position in relation thereto. The claim by Queensland that the Commonwealth should guarantee the price of export sugar could not be entertained. The Commonwealth could not recognize as an obligation that it should subsidize sugar exports, and this is specifically provided under clauses 9 and 10 of the agreement. Clause 9 statesThe Queensland Government shall on behalf the Australian cane-sugar industry accept responsibility for any loss arising from the exportation of surplus cane-sugar from AusClause 10 provides that the Queensland Government shall take the necessary action to control the production of raw sugar. Advice was received from the secretary of the Federation of Retail Grocers Associations that his executive had instructed him to state that, if any adjustment was to be made to the wholesale price of sugar, provision should also be made for an increased margin to the grocer. As the wholesale price remains unchanged under the new agreement, the .question of any alteration to the retailer's margin, therefore, does not arise. It must be pointed out that the Sugar Agreement is a document which relates mainly to peace-time conditions, and is based on the normal powers of the Commonwealth. The retail price of sugar is, therefore, not relevant to this bill. The Government has also received representations that the existing 2 per cent, wholesale discount be granted to what are termed "" genuine wholesalers "" only. The agreement provides that this 2 per cent, discount is allowable to any person, f i r m or corporation who or which ifL the opinion of the Queensland Sugar Board(i) provides reasonable credit facilities for retailers on a comprehensive range of groceries; (ii) keeps reasonable stocks of such groceries for resale to retailers; and (iii) buys not less tliau £1,500 worth per calendar month of sugar and other sugar products as aforesaid. The Government recognizes wholesale trade is an essential and portant factor in the distribution of sugar and other groceries, and both the Comunecessary monwealth Government and the Queensland Government gave careful tion to these representations reviewing the agreement. Both governments agreed, however, that it would undesirable to revert to the chaotic ditions which applied before 1940, when, under the agreement then existing, endeavour was made to restrict the trade in the manner now desired. It has been decided, therefore, that it would be the best interests of all concerned allow 'the conditions for wholesale disbelieving count to remain as prescribed in the 1941-46 agreement. The .agreement tinues to provide for the prohibition of imports of sugar into Australia, Mr Dedman. as to types of sugar which may be required for special manufacturing purposes and for scientific research. In consideration of this extended prohibition of imports, the Queensland Government accepts numerous obligations, the chief of which are(a) to accept full responsibility for any loss arising from the export of surplus cane sugar from Australia; (i>) to take such action as is necessary to control effectively the total production of raw cane sugar in Australia.; (c) to make sugar and other products available at not more than specified maximum prices at all State capital cities and at Darwin, Fremantle and Launceston. (d) to contribute £216,000 per annum to the F r u it Industry Sugar Concession Committee for disbursement by that committee in paying domestic and export sugar rebates and assisting processors of Australian f r u it s generally; and (?) to pay export sugar rebates in respect of other goods containing suffar so that the net cost of Australian sugar contained in such goods shall be no more than the Australian equivalent of the world sugar parity price; In conclusion, I point out that on that the previous occasions the economic value of imthis industry to Queensland has been stressed. On this occasion it is quite for me to mention at length the great national importance of this consideraindustry, which has supplied Australia when .and other countries with sugar throughbe out the waT period when sugar supplies conwere unobtainable from other sources. The agreement is essential to the an stability of the industry and to the security of the many people dependent upon it for their livelihood. I , therefore, in commend to the House this bill for the to approval of the new sugar agreement, that a ll honourable members will agree that it provides equitable treatment confor all sections of the community.

110,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [2.41] - The purpose of this bill is to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. Any such bill is of importance because of the tremendous implications of the taxation policy in operation in Australia at present, which affects every man and woman in the community. Before World ""War I . Commonwealth income tax was unknown to our people. It began its tremendous growth from thedays of that war and it has now reached proportions which at that time were undreamed of. A great widening of the ambit and severity of taxation has also occurred. Just prior to the outbreak of ""World War II . only 300,000 people in Australia were paying income tax. To-day, the number is more than 1.700,000. As our 600,000 odd sertime.' vice men and women obtain their discharges the. number of taxpayers in the community will again be greatly increased. By the time demobilization has been completed we may expect to havewell over 2,000,000 income', taxpayers in. Australia, and that will be a very substantial proportion of the total population. As might be expected the quantum of tax collection has been swollen greatly. The budget of 193S-39, introduced prior to the outbreak of the Avar, estimated that £76,000,000 would be collected in that financial year. The budget estimata for rhis financial year, which includes many months of peace, is £336,000,000. I have no doubt that when the final collections have been made for this year the amount will ba substantially in excess of the mate. Honourable members will no doubt he interested to note how the volume of taxation collected in Australia has grown during the last five years. In the latest issueof the booklet. Facts and Figures made available to us by the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) we are.furnished with the somewhat gloomy intelligence that from the middle of 1939 to September, 1945, the total amount of tax collected was £844,000,000. But that is not the complete story, for those figures refer only to income tax. As we all know, there are many other sources from which both direct and. indirect taxation is. obtained. As we move about from day to day we cannot avoid realizing how these taxes affect the family budget and the individual pocket. If you take what I regard as the truer figure of total tax collections, you will find that for the five years ended June 1945, the Government collected £1,651,000.000. When the present, year has concluded, that will have swollen to over £2,000,000,000-a n ' astronomic figure for this young country with a population of 7,000,000. We have become almost reconciled to the fact that, we are, and have been for some years, the heavies -1 taxed people in the world; but we experience more difficulty in reconciling ourselves to the probability that we shall be the last country in the world to experience a substantial reduction of the enormous tax burden that we are called upon to bear. In other parts of the English-speaking world, the position is very different. Already it has been found practicable in Britain, the United States of - America and Canada to make considerable reductions of taxes compared with war-time levels. The Treasurer of South Africa, introducing his budget recently, described the proposed tax remissions in that dominion as a veritable Pandora's Box of benefits for the taxpayers. Contrast the position in Australia. An insignificant reduction of taxation was announced in the budget last year. If. did not take effect until the 1st January of this year, and in respect of income tax it represented one-sixteenth of the amount to be collected from each individual. There were not, at that time, reestiductions of the enormous taxes of other kinds. The total tax collections in the present year will be very much greater than in the previous year, despite the so called remissions. All sections of the people of the Commonwealth were expecting a spectacularreduction of taxation at an early date, by reason of the termination of the war resulting in a reduction of expenditure on armaments and the discharge of hundreds of thousands of service personnel; but even as recently as the last few weeks, when speaking in the course of the Henty by-election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) damped whatever hopes we might have had when he said that he could not offer any prospect of a reduction of taxes in the near future. In the absence of a clearer statement of Government policy, that is the sorry position in which we find ourselves at the present time. Members of. the Opposition consider that that statement has placed an unnecessary obstruction against normal recovery of the Australian economy in the post-war period. We believe that substantial reductions of taxation are possible, and should be made. The Liberal party as a whole, not merely the parliamentary section of - it, has announced that, if returned to power, income tax reductions will be made, aggregating 40 per cent, during the next three years. In saying that, we. do not contemplate that there shall be a trifling reduction in the first year and probably a more substantial reduction later. What we envisage is a reduction in the first year which will give a real impetus to economic recovery in Australia. I shall be most disappointed if it is not possible to state that in the first year, should we resume, office, the reduction will be at leasf 25 per cent, on personal income tax rates. We consider that a .close examination of Government policy and accounts proves that to be practicable. Our views in that respect are supported by the dispassionate and very close examination of the problem which has been made by the economists attached to the Institute of Public Affairs in Victoria. They have gone to considerable pains to prove that the reduction I have mentioned should be practicable in the next three years. How tax reductions should be made is a matter of detail with which I am not required to deal on this occasion; but as this bill is aimed primarily at giving concessions which, though minor, are useful so far as they go, in order to encburage the conversion of war-time industries in' Australia to peace-time purposes, it may be interesting to consider for a moment the comparative usefulness of substantial reductions of company tax compared with substantial reductions of personal income tax. In recent years, studies of the tax position have been made by experts in the ""United States of America and Great Britain. Generally, their findings go to show that it would be preferable in those countries to grant material relief in respect of company tax before - dealing with the tax on personal incomes. They point out that the high taxes on industry have four main disadvantages: They reduce business reserves and thus the rate of capital development, detract from business incentive and the willingness to undertake risky forms of investment, and tend to hold up prices and to depress wages. The conclusion arrived at was that, when the contraction of war expenditure made possible a reduction of taxation the reduction in respect of the tax on profits should eventually be greater proportionately than that in respect of income of individuals. The problem in Australia is somewhat dissimilar, and leads to a different conclusion. Our rates of tax on personal incomes are very much higher than the rates in the United States of America. Associated with that, we have the principle of the double taxation of company profits, which results in profits being taxed not merely in the hands of the company but also in the hands of the individual distributed in the. form of dividends. Mr Holt. Consequently, the net return to the individual on his investment is very small indeed, particularly as the dividends are taxed at property rates. Although, as I hope to show, the reduction of the taxes on companies should be substantial, the first priority in Australia today, if we are to restore to the employer and employee the incentive, to speed up the sluggish response which Australian industry so far has manifested towards our peace-time demands, must be such a degree of relief from personal income tax as will, lead to that expansion of production which the national economy is demanding at the present time. Turning to the position of companies, a particularly strong case is to be made out for relief in that direction. I do not intend to spend much time in examining the main proposals in this amending bill. It is claimed that they provide some assistance to post-war industry to get back into production for the purposes of peace. If we' examine the principal provisions, we find that they relate to a special allowance in respect of research activities conducted by Australian industries. They allow specially favourable rates of depreciation to those organizations that install amenities for their employees. They provide a favourable rate of depreciation in respect of machinery installed after June, 1945. The Government has not gone so far as the British Parliament, which has provided specially favourable rates of depreciation in respect of buildings constructed for peace-time production. There is one important and significant concession, namely, an extension of the concessional period of six months, which previously obtained in respect of technicians a.nd experts brought from over - eas to aid Austhe tralian industry. That period has been extended to twelve months, and, in certain cases, where the Secondary Industries Commission gives a certificate that such a course would be desirable, the twelve months period may be extended to two years. These concessions are useful enough in themselves, but if it is claimed by the Government that that represents its policy for the encouragement of industry in Australia in the post-war years, when I say that Ministers have dealt with only a fraction of that problem, and that the mass of Australian employers and Australian industries will experience little practical benefit as the result of the action taken under this measure. One would imagine that any government which bothered to peer beneath the surface would be convinced of the necessity for giving every possible encouragement to, not only the big industries, but also the small ones. I have indicated something of the quantum of tax which governments have collected in past years from the Australian companies. It is estimated that for the financial year 1945-1946, the estimated collections from the taxation of profits will amount to £59,000,000. This sum is about £15,000,000 more than the total amount of tax collected by the Commonwealth from this source in any year prior to the war. That, of course, is only the beginning of the story. It, does not take into account the pay-roll tax, which makes a big contribution to Commonwealth revenues, and the sales tax, which is an enormous impost. Even then, we have not got anywhere near the bottom of the well. Every telephone call made by an Australian business firm, every cheque that is signed, every letter that is posted, and every gallon of petrol that is used in the course of business, carries its share of Commonwealth or State imposts, and contributes to the revenues of governments in Australia. Therefore, every business in this country, however big or small, however profitable or unprofitable, continues to be the provider of an incessant stream of dividends for governments in the Commonwealth. As each one of them represents a small gold-mine, the Government should take every possible action to see that they are kept in a healthy state, so that the payment of dividends may be maintained. It should not overlook the fact that the law of diminishing returns can apply where taxation rates are concerned no less than in other directions. I mentioned earlier that these concessions would mainly assist the larger industries in the Commonwealth. That is undoubtedly true. The big organizations are those that bring experts from overseas, are able to expend considerable sums on research, and will get the greatest benefits from, special allowances in respect of machinery. The smaller organizations have not, in the war years, been able to build up reserves to the same degree as their larger competitors. They are mainly family concerns. The individuals engaged in those businesses have to carry the highest rates of tax, and can put very little away in reserves for expansion. But the large undertakings, with their capital position established over a long period, and concerned with the payment of moderate dividends from time to time, can set aside large reserves for expansion purposes. During the war, we have witnessed the steady concentration of business in the hands of the larger organizations in Australia at the expense of the smaller ones. It has always amazed me that a government, which claims to represent especially the smaller man, has consistently pursued a. policy which has built up the - larger businesses at the expense of the smaller ones. Just how important small industries were in the Australian scheme of things immediately prior to the war is indicated by statistics contained in the Commonwealth Year Book, which show that at least 50 per cent, of industrial employment was given by organizations with fewer than 100 employees. Prior to that time the number employed in larger organizations was slightly fewer than in the smaller concerns, but during the war, with big war orders concentrated in the larger industrial establishments, the proportions changed. Last year fewer than 40 per cent, of the employees were engaged in organizations with fewer than 100 employees, whilst about 60 per cent, were employed in the bigger businesses. I believe that that trend is continuing and will be accentuated in the post-war period. There has never been a time in the history of Australia when it has been more difficult for a man with small capital reserves, but with an abundance of industry and enterprise, to establish himself. There are all the difficulties which war-time controls impose, and the further drawback that out of the balance left to him, after paying his personal taxes little remains for business expansion. That is an unhealthy trend in a young and growing country like Australia. As happened in the United States of America, small industries built, up on the basis' of the family group, or conducted by two or throe individuals of capacity, should gradually expand; but that is not the situation which has developed in Australia in recent years, and which the policy of the Government is maintaining. The solution of that problem is not to be found in a minor reduction of taxes. l.i requires a genuine and considerable reduction if the requisite encouragement is to - be given to the individual. - On this point honourable members ""will find considerable interest in a lecture by Colin Clark, who is, I think, known to most of them. The lecture, which was one of the John Fisher series, was delivered in Adelaide just before the war, the title being, ""Australian Economic Progress against a World Background "". So many cf us are apt to assume- I among them --that there is in man's affairs a steady development towards a higher economic level, that this lecture makes extraordinarily interesting reading. opening paragraph readsTo regard economic progress as the normal and natural condition of human affairs is to betray the limitation of one's mind in both time and space. Of the continents of the globe, northern Europe, America, Australasia, and Japan, have, during the last century, made genuine and striking economic progress. But in southern and eastern Europe the evidences of progress are much more dubious. The great bulk of Africa's population remains in an entirely primitive stage of economic development; while in Asia, other than Japan (in which continent over half of the world's population is to be found, there is evidence of actual economic retrogression during the period which we are pleased to call "" the century of progress"". Even within the favoured minority of countries where genuine economic progress has been made, the rate of this progress is often grossly exaggerated. Alleviating the colossal total of the world's poverty will take much longer than some people think. Australia, at the time the lecture was given, stood fourth on the list of the countries of the world as regards real income per person per year on the basis of a working week of 48 hours. The countries are listed in the following order:Country. Index New Zealand , .. . . 2,046 United States of America . . 1,948 Great Britain .. . . 1,402 Australia . . .. . . 1,303 Sweden .. .. Germany . . .. .. Italy .. ... 399 Japan .. .. .. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .. .. Mr Bolt. The lecturer emphasized the great economic spurt made by Australia between 1920 and 1926. He saidFrom 1920 to 1920-27 came a rate of economic progress which has never been equalled at any other time in Australia's history, or scarcely in the world. This spurt took place during the decade following the last war. Ear from that war having had any long-term depressing effect on Australian industry and production, it seemed to have the effect of stimulating Australian enterprise during the years that followed. To-day, we find ourselves in a comparable situation. We have just concluded a war which was conducted on an even greater scale than was the last, and there are certain factors of Australia's economywhich should, enable us to take a rosy view of the future. The country remains relatively unscathed: Industry, far from being The destroyed as in some other countries, has expanded. We have an industrial population - which is better trained than ever before. Before the last depression we had an unbalanced economy dependent too much on the seasons and on the wool-clip; today, we have a balanced economy with secondary industries able to cater for most of our needs, and it is reasonable to suppose that during the next ten years they will be in an even better position to do so than they are today. Together with this, there is the pent-up purchasing power of the people in the form of record savings deposits in the banks, and there is a greater demand for consumer goods than ever before. There is an unprecedented demand for houses, and this will stimulate allied trades such as the manufacture of furniture, crockery, &c. Thus, there are present all the factors required for a decade of prosperity greater than we have ever before experienced. Unfortunately, the results so far achieved are not proportionate to these prospects. Our economy is in a sluggish figure. state. It seems to have bogged down. There is a much slower response to consumer demands than the times would seem to indicate as proper. The reason for this 851 is, in part, high taxation. If persons are 848 not spurred on by a belief that extra 3C2 effort will obtain for them increased economic advantages, we shall remain in 345 the present state for a long time to come. If those with capital to invest believe that there is not a reasonable prospect of success, having regard to the hazards which the investment of capital inevitably carries, there will not be after, this war the economic spurt that was such a marked feature of our economy after the 1914-1S war. The trifling concessions contained in this measure only toy with the problem which confronts Australia. The Prime Minister does a. great disservice to his country when he says, as-he said in the Henty electorate recently, that he cannot offer any substantial reduction of taxation. The Institute of Public Affairs has shown that a. reduction can be made, and we on this side promise that, if returned at the next election, it will be made. If the Government cannot give the impetus to production which a reduction of taxes would provide, it should get out of office and make way for another government, which will do-so. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Glauses 1 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5 (Exemptions). Mr Archie CAMERON' (Barker) [3.16] - Para-prap h c of sub-clause 1 relates to benefits under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944. I have no objection to this paragraph if it means what it appears to mean, but I wish to know whether, during certain 'strikes which occurred recently, men who refused to work received benefits under that legislation. I cannot think of anything more immoral than that payments made under that legislation should be exempt from income tax - Before agreeing to this provision the Committee should have a statement from the Minister setting out the position. I shall reserve any further remarks until after the Minister has spoken.'",38
111,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [3.17] - The position is quite clear. An y person on strike, or who refuses to work when work is available, is.not classed as unemployed. But a person who, through no fault of his own, is thrown out of work [20.1 Mr Archie . CAMERON - That is another matter. .",43
112,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I take it that the honourable member is concerned only with strikers. The answer to his question is definitely that no person who is on strike, or refuses work when work is available, is eligible for unemployment relief. No such person has been paid under that"" act, so far as I know!",43
113,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [3.1S] - The last words of the Minister contain an important qualification. He says that "" No such person has been paid under that act, so far as I know "". During the last six or seven months certain employees, as for instance, miners, iron workers and transport men, particularly in the maritime industries, refused to do their work, thereby throwing thousands of others out of employment. I now ask whether the funds provided under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act have been used to make payments to those who through the action of their fellow unionists, were unemployed ?",43
114,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [3.20] - The social service legislation referring to this matter specifically provides that men who are on strike or who refuse work when it is available cannot receive unemployment relief.,43
115,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That does not answer my question. I want to know whether the funds have been drawn - on to make payments to persons who were out of work because other trade unionists, notably coal workers, iron workers and transport workers, refused to work.",43
116,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"S h o u l d any section of workers go on strike, thereby throwing men in other trades out of employment, those other workers, not being responsible for their employment, are entitled to unemployment relief. That is provided in the act.",43
117,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is all I want to know. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7 (Depreciation).,43
118,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [3.21] - This is an important provision. Paragraph c of section 54 of the principal act relates toPlumbing fixtures and fittings, including wall and flooring tiling, in premises acquired after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, or installed premises after that date, by a person carrying ou a business for the purpose of producing assessable income, where those fixtures and fittings are provided principally for the for personal purposes!, of persons employed by him in that business. I desire to know whether this provision is wide enough to apply to alterations, additions, fixtures and fittings in preto mises occupied by employees in agricullast tural and pastoral industries. As drafted, the provision appears to relate primarily to secondary industries, hut it may also cover primary industries. Many farmers, graziers, orchardists, dairymen' and others engaged in primary production, will have occasion to make alterations and additions to premises occupied their employees, and I wish to know whether this provision covers such work.",44
119,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"""Werriwa-Ministe for Works and Housing) [3.22] - I am assured that any expenditure of this character incurred by a primary producer in the earning of his income is an able deduction. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 (Basis of depreciation).",44
120,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) of [3.23] - The proposed new sub-section 2 seen. of section 55 provides that the depreciation which will be allowed in respect of certain alterations and additions shall be 33-?{ per cent. Last year there was long, and I believe useful, debate in chamber on the subject of depreciation. The rate of 33-J per cent is entirely ferent from what is allowed by the Taxain tion Department. Figures shown to prove that, in respect of certain fencing which had been erected, it was impossible for anything to be written off because that was obtained was a certain percentout age of what remained after previous I depreciation had been taken into account. Here we have brought in a principle under which 33^ per cent, depreciation shall be allowed on amenities provided for an employee. If a farmer erects the fencing which he must have if he is to employ men, the rate of depreciation is only 3 per cent, on a diminishing return. If he builds a dam the rate is only 1 per cent, on a diminishing return. If he buys the machinery which he must have to keep men in a job, the rate, formerly 10 in per cent., has been reduced, owing to the exigencies of war, to 5 per cent, on a diminishing return. This rate of 33-jjf use, per cent, it out of keeping with income tax practice in Australia. It is time that this committee had a look at things in a true perspective instead of in this squint-eyed way. I invite the committee take into consideration what was done year when we had a ""sea horse"" drawn across the map of Australia. I did my best to have the New South Wales Taxpayers' Association challenge its constitutionality in the High Court; but, although it is not at all backward in telling the Commonwealth Parliament that it is wrong, it is remarkably slow by in trying to prove it wrong in court. That, action was one of the most unconstitutional things ever done in this country; but it, ha.s never been fought in the High r Court. I do not say that this provision could be challenged; but the rate of depreciation provided is entirely out of keeping with the former practice of the allowTaxation Department. The Ministry should examine it. I do not expect it to do so, because, on matters of this description, it is not public policy that dictates its actions but party considerations, and that this is the worse example we have",44
121,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yarra) [3.27] - I was chairman of a conference on taxation a that was held at the request of the this Associated Chambers of Manufactures. The nrimary producers were brought into difit. Several of the provisions contained this bill were decided on at that con-' me ference. Consideration in respect of the encouragement of research and the provision of amenities in industry all was requested. A strong case was made for both. The request was agreed to. t was asked that the rate of depreciation on fixtures and property providing for amenities or research should be 33-1f per cent, per annum so that the amount should be written off in three years. That docs not mean that any more depreciation is allowed, because once a thing has been written off, depreciation may no longer be claimed. At the rate of 10 per cent, per annum property is written off in ten years, and, at the rate of 33-Jper cent., it is written off in three years. A fte r that no further depreciation is allowed. In order to encourage manufacturers and primary producers to go in for research, depreciation of the articles required for it is to be at the rate of 33^- per cent., and the articles will be written off in three"" years. The same principle is to be extended to amenities provided for employees. Employers submitted that to help them carry on industry amenities for employees were needed. Many employers have, already provided them, and it was urged that other employers should bo encouraged by this means to do likewise. If the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) will go around some of the cities and towns of Australia and see what the employers are doing in the provision of canteens, dining' rooms, wash rooms and lockers for their employees so that they shall be treated as civilized humans, he will appreciate the worth of that. The providers of those amenities want to write them, off in three years. The honourable gentleman objects to that.",44
122,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [3.29 | - If the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) listened to what I said instead of putting up a purely political argument he would realise that what I said was that, nothing like this 33-?. per cent, depreciation is provided for in our income tax law today.",45
123,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No , it is a new cession.",45
124,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"A clause that we have not, reached provides that in the event of certain machinery being acquired the depreciation rate is to be 20 per cent., which is another innovation. Hitherto, the highest depreciation rate that one could get on anything has been 10 per cent.",45
125,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,-No .,45
126,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I invite the right honourable member for Yarra, who is an expert on income"" tax law. tjo tell us whether at the rate of 33-^ per cent, the property or fixtures on which that depreciation is to be allowed will be written off in three years. If that is true, it is another departure in the income tax law. A depreciation rate of 5 per cent, is not a constant 5 per cent, on the original cost, but on the remaining amount standing in the books of the taxpayer. If the right honourable gentleman's contention is right, the Taxation Department, for the first time, is recognizing the justice of introducing into the law a principle that it has never hitherto applied. I should be interested to know authoritatively whether that is correct, because I have argued in favour of that principle in this committee and in income tax offices, in South Australia as well as Canberra. This is a matter on which the committee should be clear. The sane and honest practice is to allow that if an article costs £100 and the rate of depreciation is 5 per cent., it should be 5 per cent, for twenty years, but, as the law stands or is being administered, it is 5 per cent, on £100 for the first year, 5 per cent, on. £95 for the second year, and so on. Under that system, it is mathematically impossible for the article to be written off. If the 33-J per cent, depreciation rate applies, as the right honourable gentleman claims it does-and I admit his excellent knowledge of such matters- 1 should be glad of that assurance. Then, having got it , I should want to know why that principle cannot be applied to every item on which depreciation is allowed under the taxation law.",45
127,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [3.31] - The statement of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) that 10 con- per cent, is the highest rate of depreciation allowed by the Taxation Department, is inaccurate, because rates of 15 and 20 per cent, and even higher have been allowed.' Under the law, a man entitled to depreciation at 5 per cent, per annum can elect to write off the property on which the depreciation is allowed in twenty years. He is given latitude,.",45
128,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"He is not. . Mr Lazzarini - The honourable member knows more than the Taxation Department, does.",45
129,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"What we want is the fact. The fact is that a lawyer is allowed only 2 i per cent, per annum on the residual value of his law library.",45
130,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That i _ all right.,46
131,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,On . that principle he loses money every year.,46
132,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,He gets his money so easily that he can afford to.,46
133,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Tal k sense!,46
134,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is all I rose to say. The taxation officers tell me that 10 per cent, is not the maximum rate of depreciation and that often the rate is more than 20 per cent.",46
135,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yarra) [3.35] - What I said is absolutely correct. For years, under the taxation law, taxpayers have had the opportunity of electing to have their depreciation on the prime cost.",46
136,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am glad to hear that, but it is the first time that I have ever heard it.",46
137,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is my experience. ' Mr Scullin - That has been the law since 1926 or 1927. They can elect to do one or the other.,46
138,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They are never allowed any choice.,46
139,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes . If the honourable member produces a' case where it has not been allowed, I shall have the case examined.",46
140,Mr SPENDER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"A lawyer, in respect of his library, is not allowed any choice; he is allowed depreciation solely at the rate of 2$ per cent.",46
141,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I do not know about libraries; but the basis of prime cost is always available, and under this measure a man who provides amenities for his employees or expends money on research facilities is allowed to write off the cost in three years. The nature of the machinery must also be considered. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) says that a subsequent clause provides for depreciation at the rate of 20 per cent. That clause deals with an entirely different matter. If the honourable member studies the bill more closely he will realise that the objective of the clause to which he refers is to expedite the establishment and rehabilitation of industry in this country. That is now being done in Great Britain, New Zealand and Canada, where purchasers of machinery at the present very high prices are allowed immediately to write off 20 per cent, for s taxation purposes; and, in addition, they are allowed the ordinary rate of depreciation. Under this measure 20 per cent, immediate depreciation is allowed in. addition to the annual rate of 10 per cent. That does not mean that in the long run they are allowed more depreciation than any one else. This provision is designed to encourage people to install the latest machinery in. order to speed up industry. That policy is being adopted the world' over. Great Britain is striving hard to get into industry before the United States of America, and the United States of America is doing likewise. So also are New. Zealand, Canada and other countries. Everywhere, industry is being encouraged in this way by easing the present high initial cost of machinery. not Mr Ryan - Is special and ordinary depreciation allowed on the basis of prime cost?",46
142,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , but prime cost is calculated after the special allowance. The allegation made by the honourable member for Barker that this is a party provision is unfounded; the concession has been adopted as the result of representations made in writing on behalf of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia by Mr Queale, the president of that body. The chamber sent its experts to Canberra to discuss the matter, and the Treasurer asked me to preside at the conference. This provision represents only a part of their requests. I invite the honourable member to read the explanation given by Mr Queale in the AdelaideAdvertiser of the proceedings and decisions of that conference. He will find that Mr Queale eulogized the conference for its work. Clause agreed to. Clause 9 (Special depreciation of property acquired within five years after 30th June, 1945).",46
143,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [3.40] - In my speech on the second reading I pointed out that, whilst the purchase of machinery has been facilitated, special depreciation is not provided in respect of new buildings for industry. My recollection is that in Great Britain very substantial encouragement is being given in respect of the construction of new buildings for industrial purposes. I do not know whether the failure of the Government follow that example is dictated - by need to concentrate upon the construction of homes as a first priority. That would appear to be the case; but I should i-ome some explanation from the Minister representing the Treasurer as to why provision is made for special depreciaing tion on new building construction.",46
144,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) preciation [3.41] - The clause provides for special depreciation of 20'per cent, on purchases. In making this provision the Governeconomic ment is'thirteen years behind Hitler, introduced it in Germany in practically similar terms in 1933, with the exception that when machinery was installed to take the place of other machinery the owner was allowed to write off 25 per cent, annually, being thus enabled to liquidate (he full cost within four years. This bill allows special depreciation at the rate of 20 per cent, for the first year in addiment. tion to the ordinary rate. Last year had occasion to raise certain income tax matters on behalf of taxpayers in the Northern Territory and South Australia. At the Commonwealth office for the Northern Territory and Commonwealth office for South Australia, both of which are situated in Adelaide, I asked for the depreciation lists. I was shown them, and I say definitely that on those lists no depreciation under any heading whatof ever is shown at a rate above 10 per cent, per annum. In view of what the right honourable membei' for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has said, I ask that a complete statement of depreciation rates allowed by the Taxation' Department be tabled in this House ;- because, if the right orable gentleman's statement be correct, I was misled last year in . my interviews with officers at both Commonwealth offices in Adelaide. Mr Hoivi"" - The lists are available the Parliamentary Library.",47
145,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"In my interviews at the Commonwealth offices in Adelaide I was given the impression that this was information which the department did not give out'to the public. The officers adopted the attitude that would show it to me as a favour; and am not unused to dealing - with vernment officers. It is high time to public declaration was made of the rates the of depreciation. On another occasion I had a personal argument with the Taxation Department. In respect of one's own welaffairs one can get down to tin-tacks. Por years the rate of depreciation on no farm engines was 10 per cent.; but durthe war it was 'reduced to 5 per cent. Even if a farmer purchased a second-hand . engine fourteen years old the rate of dewas Still 5 per cent, on a residual basis. That is ridiculous, and would not be tolerated outside an kindergarten. I should like who the Minister to say frankly what are the rates of depreciation on buildings, fences, dams, tanks, engines and the hundred and one items in respect of which the farmer is obliged to incur expenditure! My constituents will certainly be interested to know what those rates are. I was given to understand that the rates shown to me were purely an office arrangeI f a copy of the rates is available I in the Library I should like the Minister to explain the secretiveness of the Commonwealth officers whom I interviewed in Adelaide last year on this matter.",47
146,Mr RYAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [3.44] - I should like to deal with the non-provision of special depreciation in respect of new buildings from the point of view of the primary producer. The large majority farms in Australia will probably be mechanized as soon as possible. Mechanization will decrease the cost of production, but we cannot have mechanization of farms without providing the buildings to house the necessary plants. The price of all machinery rose considerably honduring the war. In addition, the cost of erecting a building today exceeds by 100 per cent, the pre-war cost. The proposed concessions should be extended in order to cover buildings used for housing machinery, .whether they be situated on in farms or at factories. I should like the Minister (Mr Lazzarini) to explain why that concession has not been granted.",47
147,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [3.461-The right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) presided at a conference which they considered the matters that have I been raised by the honourable memGober for Fawkner (Mr Holt) and that a the honourable member for Flinderr (Mr Ryan). The Government examined the proposals, but was obliged to reject them. Perhaps they will be reconsidered when the next budget is being compiled. One of the reasons for rejection was the - desperate need to obtain building materials of all descriptions for housing. The Commissioner for Taxation has advised me that there is no reason why the list which the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) requested, should not be published. I do not know whether the honourable member was correct when he said that the information was available in the Parliamentary Library, but I shall give a copy to him as soon as possible. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 to 17 agreed to. Clause IS (Rebate of tax payable by visiting industrial experts).",47
148,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [3.48] - This clause deals with the rebate of tax payable by visiting industrial experts. As I mentioned earlier, the practice in the past was to allow a rebate of tax in respect of the first six months that a visiting expert stayed in the Commonwealth. That period is to be extended to twelve months, and if the Secondary Industries Commission so recommended, the period may be further extended by twelve months. In that way, an inducement is offered to technicians and experts to 'come to Australia from other countries. One of the serious taxation difficulties, to which no reference has been made in this measure, is the double taxation of the investments in Australia of persons residing in other countries and, I assume, the income earned in Australia by persons who normally reside abroad. I am not clear regarding the difficulties of the individual, but double taxation acts as a deterrent to overseas companies establish- it either. ing themselves in Australia. The reason is that taxation must be paid first in Australia on income earned here, and secondly, paid on the net income when it - is remitted to the country in which the company is based. The Commissioner for Taxation went 'abroad in an attempt to resolve this difficulty, but I gather from references in the press that his mission was not so successful as he had hoped. One of the unhappy consequences of the continuance of this difficulty is that the United States Treasury is not so severe on an American organization earning income abroad as the British Treasury is on a. British organization earning income abroad. Possibly, the United States Treasury imposes lower rates of tax and allows some special concession on income earned abroad. """,48
149,Mr BTJKKE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The United States of America allows as a rebate the amount of tax paid abroad.,48
150,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) for that information. I do not claim to know all the details, but representatives in Australia, of overseas organizations have informed me that it is one of the important factors which influence them when they are considering whether they shall establish industries here. 1 should like the Government to take the opportunity presented by the discussion of this clause to say whether it can offer any hope that this difficulty will be resolved. It would be most unfortunate if industries now based in Great Britain were placed at a serious disadvantage compared with industries in foreign countries when they attempted to establish branches in Australia. The Government may be able to indicate what progress has been made to resolve the difficulty.",48
151,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [3.52] - Pro posed new section 160AB deals only with the rebate of tax payable by visiting industrial experts. The wider field which the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) 'discussed is not covered by this provision.,48
152,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The act does not deal with,48

155,Mr SHEEHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Boothby) [3.57] This bill seeks to embody four important and desirable amendments in the principal act. First, it raises the l i m it on war service homes from £950 to £1,250. This increase w i ll give to purchasers a wider choice of designs, and will be of special benefit to. ex-servicemen who have family responsibilities and require fair l y large homes. In most cases, deferred pay is absorbed in the purchase of furniture and cannot be applied to the construction of a larger dwelling. The increase will also offset to some degree the increased cost of home construction. At a later stage I shall show honourable members how building costs have increased in South Australia, and indicate methods by which, in my opinion, the cost of war' service homes can be reduced to some degree without reducing their size. Stress has been laid on the fact that the shortage of building materials has greatly retarded the construction of war service homes. That is indisputable. However, I understand that State building authorities have a right to 50 per cent, of available building materials, and ex-servicemen have suggested to me that if the necessity to obtain a permit to secure the release of building materials were obviated, more war service homes could be built. What can be done in that sphere I am unable to say. In relation to the war service homes programme in South Australia, I wish to pay a tribute to the Deputy Commissioner for War Service Horne3 in that State, who has worked untiringly for the commission, and has done his best to assist ex-servicemen. Speaking on this measure, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . White) criticized the extension of war service homes benefits to merchant seamen. Apparently, the honourable member would not recognize the fact that merchant seamen played a' vital and dangerous role in the war. I disagree entirely with the honourable member's view. Although I admit that he proved himself a. worthy son of Australia in the war of 1914-1S, and in the last war. I remind him that an all-in conflict such as that from which we have just emerged is hardly a healthy matter for men work-, ing below the water line in ships on the high seas. Their employment, in fact, is very hazardous, and I consider that they have every right to the benefit of our war service homes legislation.. They have taken great risks to carry vital materials of war and troops. My mind goes back to. the time when the news came through that S.S. Hereford had been mined off Kangaroo Island, which, of course, is not very far from the shores of South Australia. I had an opportunity to inspect that vessel, and found that a hole 40 feet by 60 feet had been blown in ' its side. Another vessel struck a mine off Port Lincoln. I have before me a map of the coast of New South Wales showing the names of the ships that were sunk or damaged by enemy action during the war. Altogether, 29 ships were either sunk or damaged off that coast alone. The last war was quite unlike the war of 1914-18, when the Allies had the assistance of the Japanese navy and the It a l i a n navy, both of which were our enemies in the conflict just ended. In this war men lost their lives even in Sydney Harbour. For those reasons, I support the claims of merchant seamen who served the Commonwealth and the Empire during the war, for inclusion in the War Service Homes Act. I r; k leave of the House to have the map which I have mentioned incorporated in Hansard.",49
156,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The question of serting maps in Hansard was discussed some time ago, and it was found that this was a difficult matter. I suggest that honourable member seek the permission the House to insert in Hansard a list of the vessels sunk or damaged on the coast of New South ""Wales. I believe it would be ill-advised to have a map incorporated.",50
157,Mr SHEEHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wit h the consent of honourable members. I incorporate in yard Hansard the following list:Kowarra, sunk, 25th Apri.l, 1943.

It was aii "" all-in "" war, and the chant seamen had a large share in bringreport ing victory to our side. Much has been said about the cost house construction at the present time. The latest available report of the ""War Service Homes Commission, that for 1944-45, shows that the average construcA tion cost of war service homes is £912 13s. 5d. The average cost of a house and the land on which it is built is £1,032 Is. 3d. I see nothing to quibble about in those figures. In South Ausall tralia today, good five-roomed brick homes can be built for £900, a fact which may be of interest to honourable members from the eastern States. An examination inof the comparative costs of building materials now and before the war may be of value in considering this matter. the During the war of 1914-1S, the cost of of iron increased to £80 a ton. However, the present price of iron is a""bout £30 a ton, the price pegging regulations having held it down almost to the pre-war level. Before the war, the inside plastering of a home in South Australia cost Is. 9d. a and today the cost is 2s. 3d. a yard, representing about £7 for the house. The cost of ceilings before the war was 4s. 6d. a yard, and today it is 5s. 9d. a yard, which represents about £5 for the house. 12th After studying costs and considering various means of economizing without 1943. affecting the durability of houses, I have come to the conclusion that the cost of 22 a house estimated to be worth £1,200. today can be reduced by £60 or £7.0. 1942. This saving can be achieved by having the bricks of inside walls laid on their edges and set with cement mortar. I 1941. have had extensive experience of home-building, and I know that this January, method can be employed with satisfactory results. It requires fewer bricks and offers an admirable way of reducing housing costs. I am anxious that everybody should be properly housed, 1942. and I should like every man to have the chance of owning his own home. I have said before, and I reiterate now, that interest charges on capital outlay for - home-building should be reduced as low as possible so that ex-servicemen and others may be able to own their homes within their lifetimes. The ideal rate of interest would be one merely sufficient merto cover administrative expenses. The of the War Service Homes Commission states that delay is caused by the of necessity for architectural work - The Commission has about 500 designs for homes. It should adopt the system used by the State Bank of South Australia. contractor for the erection-of a house under the bank's scheme is provided with specifications, and with a ground plan of theprojected building on which the roof is indicated by dotted lines. That is that any contractor should need to build a home. If the War Service Homes Commission adopted that method, and employed inspectors to examine houses in course of erection, its building programme could be speeded up considerably. Under the present system, tenders are called by advertisement for the construction of homes. Then, contractors have to be supplied with the architects' plans. Then there is a further delay, until estimates are submitted by the contractors, before work can be undertaken. Under the bank's system, the contractor has specifications and the ""plan for the type of building chosen by the prospective owner, and no delay is necessary. There is not much work in the construction of a cottage which would require any departure from the ordinary specifications, r make this suggestion to the Minister in the hope that he will give serious coiiside.rution to it. It is a good way of speeding up construction of war service homes. I now raise another' matter which affects ""diggers"" of the 1.914-18 war. .1 do so because, on a previous pecasiou in this House, I stressed the difficulties experienced by some ex-soldiers of the 1914-18 war during the economic depression. I cited particular cases. Since then I have had to wait some time for an opportunity to reply on this subject to statements made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony).",50
158,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - Order ! The honourable member would not be in order in referring to that subject during consideration of the bill now before the House.,51
159,Mr SHEEHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker. I hope that something will be clone to implement the suggestions which I have made, particularly with reference to the plans and specifications of war service homes, with a view to speeding up the programme, and also with reference to the reduction of interest rates so as to enable ex-servicemen to acquire complete ownership of their homes as early as possible.",51
160,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Moreton) [4.15] This short measure contains four important specific provisions. The first is designed to increase, from £950 to £1,250, the maximum amount that may be advanced for war' service homes. The second provision relates to the value of land on which war service homes may be erected. The War Service Homes Commission has held some blocks since the depression, and their value has now increased to such a high level as to make it impossible for a soldier purchaser to. pay their present value. The Government has wisely decided that the land on which a war service home is to be erected shall be assessed at its fair value or its actual capital value, whichever is the less. I commend the Government for this proposal which will confer a distinct advantage on the prospective borroAver. The third provision enables the War Service Homes Commission to grant loans on the. security of Crowri lands leased in perpetuity from a State. This is an innovation which I have advocated in this House on many occasions, as has also the honourable member for ""Wide Bay (Mr. Corser). At some of the seaside resorts on the south coast of Queensland only leasehold land - can be obtained. This provision will - extend to those entitled to the benefits - of the legislation a privilege which they have not hitherto enjoyed and will be particularly welcomed by many' ex-servicemen living in mining areas and coastal towns of Queensland.. The fourth provision extends, to all members of the mercantile marine working on the Australian coast the benefits of the war service homes legislation. I am opposed to this proposal. Under the original act eligibility for its benefits was restricted to members of the fighting forces who entered a theatre of war, and to a limited number of munition workers who went to the United Kingdom during the war of 1914-1S to assist in the manufacture of the munitions there-probabl y their number would not exceed 100-and members of the mercantile marine who risked their lives to keep the sea lanes free of a marauding enemy. Under the amendment proposed by this bill, 'however, a seaman who sails across the entrance to Port Phillip Bay, from say Point Nepean to Geelong, or whose ship is engaged in trading between the headlands of .Spencer's Gulf, will in future become entitled to apply for a war service home. That is not only unreasonable but also distinctly unfair to those who have risked their lives-in the defence of this country or to keep safe from enemy activity the trade routes of the world. It is especially so when we consider the large numbers"" of servicemen who today are awaiting war service homes and who probably will have to wait another twenty years before material and labour are available in sufficient quantities to permit free building. This watering down of the conditions of eligibility is reminiscent of the. Government's attempt to water down conditions of eligibility under the rehabilitation legislation. Seamen foremen employed on the Australian coast receive £10 14s. 6d. a week including special war risk payment, but those who fought on the battlefields of the world received nothing but their service pay. Very many members of this House and organizations of returned servicemen throughout the country have pressed for two j'ears for an increase of the maximum amount Of the loan. The only comment I make upon the Government's proposal in this connection is that it has been too long delayed. Money alone will not build war service homes; adequate supplies of building materials, furnishings, fittings, and equipment of all descriptions, together with skilled and semi-skilled labour must be provided. With the inflated costs of labour and materials, it. is obvious that the maximum amount of loan would have to be increased. On the 7th August, 1945, Mr F. E. O'Connell, manager of the Timber Merchants Association, of Melbourne, said this regarding the cost of building labourTliecost of labour is the biggest single item in the cost of building, and this bo reduced appreciably if workers could be induced hy their union officials to do day's work for a fair day's pay. For the three or four weeks, however, certain union officials have been"" prepared to adopt slow""' tactics on works being carried out under the Government.",51
161,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! The honorpressing able member is not entitled to deal with general building costs during the debate on this bill.,52
162,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I was about to show that the maximum amount of loan is not sufficient because' of high. costs in the building industry. Mr O'Connell continuedOn one important work the workers are going so slow that they have almost stopped. These go-slow tactics are the union's attempt to get even with employers because Judge Kelly cancelled the Defence Workers' award. According to a survey made by the Building Section of the Department of War Organization of Industry in March, 1945, a house which cOst £913 to build in 1939, would cost in March last, no less than £1,267,. an increase of 38 per cent. It will be'seen, therefore, that the Government has not been unduly generous in raising the maximum amount of the loan.",52
163,Mr HADLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Does the rise mentioned by the honourable member apply only to labour costs?,52
164,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Department of War Organization of Industry found that, of the additional amount, £106 was represented by.labour costs, of which £30 was attributable to increased wages and £76 to the reduction of the output of those engaged in the building and allied trades. Rising costs in one industry always bring serious repercussions in others. Speaking at Port Pirie some time ""ago, the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) said that he was alarmed to find that ships constructed in Australia were costing £76 a ton compared with £40 a ton on the Clyde and £44 a ton in - Canada. . Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! Shipbuilding costs have nothing to do with war service homes.",52
165,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am endeavouring to show that costs are rising generally and that this is avital factor in the cost of war service homes. The position is accentuated by industrial troubles which could have been prevalent throughout the a fair country during the regime of this Golast vernment. The recent unfortunate experience in the iron and steel industry "" gocaused the Government to' seek from outside Australia. 20,000 tons of galvanized iron to meet Australia's most requirements of that commodity, and imnorted iron is much more costly than that manufactured in Australia. The raising of the maximum loan will increase the amount, paid weekly by the soldier purchaser and greatly increase his total interest bill. It will probably mean that many unfortunate soldiers will be paying off their homes during the whole of their lives. I suggest that, in order to offset soaring costs, there should be some adjustment of interest charges along the lines adopted in New Zealand, where the owner of a war service home is for some period . freed of interest charges. The Minister might very well consider making such a provision' in the War Service Homes Act. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act No. 44 of 1945 provided that any excessive cost of homes due to the inflated price of labour a.nd matei-ials was to be divided equally between the Commonwealth and the State concerned, and not passed on to the occupier of the home. In other words, if a house which should have cost £1,500 cost £2,000, the tenant would be expected to pay only on the basis of £1,500, and the Commonwealth and State Governments would meet any obligations in respect of the remaining £500. I ask the Government to consider applying that principle to war service homes. Individuals who are successful in ballots for the - few homes that are becoming available should be required to' pay only on the economic value of the property. They should not have to meet excessive charges on account of the present inflated costs of labonr and materials. It seems to me that houses which should be built for £1.250 will be loaded with heavy additional'charges. After the'last war heavy demands were made oh our bouse construction resources and costs became much higher than they should have been. The result, ultimately, was that the war service homes that were built in that period were re-valued, and tens of thousands of pounds was written off the original cost. The prospect of applicants obtaining war service homes in the near future is most gloomy. On the 14th March I asked the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) for some information about the number of war service homes that had been built in tain years. On the 20th March I received from him the following particulars:1940-41 I <M I -42 .. 7 l!)'12-4:t .. .. 194344 .. N i l 194445 .. ' .. In those five years only 23 homes were built. In the period from, the 1st July, 1945, to the 2Sth February, 1946, 61 homes had been erected. These figures indicate clearly that a long and weary wait stretches before service men and women, who have applied for homes. I also asked what number 'of applications for war service homes received in each State of the Commonwealth and in the Australian Capital Territory up to the 28th February last had not yet been finalized. The total was given as 11,955. If that number of applications lodged by the 28th February last be still unsatisfied, what prospects have applicants since then of obtaining homes within any reasonable date? I am quite certain that if it were not for the general knowledge of people that inordinate delays were inevitable in satisfying applicants for war service homes, the number of applications would be very much greater than it is; but people know that it is futile even to apply for homes under present conditions. At least 300,000 persons are still, awaiting demobilization from the various services. Very many of them will need homes. During recent years the Government has done practically nothing to help people to obtain homes. The War Service Homes Commission has done what it could do to provide homes for eligible applicants. The officers of the commission are efficient, sympathetic, and anxious to do a good job, but this Government has put them in an impossible position. It should at least make sure that materials are available for the commission to use. During and after the last war 21,379 homes were built by the commission.",52
166,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They were built after the last war.,53
167,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"They were built during and after the war. We have had a great deal of experience in building war service homes, and it is regrettable (hat so little use has been made of it, particularly as we shall need to procervide for about three times as many service personnel from this war as had to be provided for after the last war. . . 2 Mr SPEAKER - Order ! The hon. . 6 orable member must confine his remarks to the bill. He began his speech by refer8 ring to the provisions of the bill, but now lie is discussing what happened after the last war.",53
168,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I was replying to an interjection.,54
169,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The interjection was as disorderly as is the honourable member's speech at the moment.,54
170,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Mr Colin Clark, Director.of the Bureau of Industry, in Queensland, and an authority on homebuilding, stated recently that all of the homes that had been applied for in Queensland could not be built, under existing conditions, until I960. Undoubtedly construction of war service homes in Australia is lagging far behind such work in New Zealand. Up to the 31st January this year, 2,239 homes have been built for ex-servicemen in New Zealand at a cost of £3,076,226. In Australia between the 1st July, 1944, and the 28th February, 1946, nearly 12.000 ex-soldiers had applied for war service homes, but only 69 homes were erected. Homes cannot be built without material. On this point I remind the Minister (Mr. Lazzarini) that on the ISth July last he announced that, subject to anticipated releases from the services, sufficient supplies of - materials and fittings would be available in every State to meet each quarter's requirements.",54
171,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That was what was anticipated.,54
172,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable gentleman did not say anything about that. No doubt he had made inquiries from his officials and he gave the assurance that sufficient materials and fittings would be available. Seeing that he gave that assurance I am entitled to ask him where the materials and fittings for the war service homes are to be found? The Minister is as silent as a tomb. On behalf of the ex-soldiers of this country, who were assured by one honourable gentleman opposite who now holds Cabinet rank that the sky would be the limit in providing money to meet the needs of ex-service personnel, I again ask where the materials for house construction are to be found ? I want to know why ex-servicemen cannot have homes provided for them. Possibly the reason is that the Government d'oes not believe in building them. I remind the House of what the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) said on the 2nd October. Mr SPEAKER,-What the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction said about war service homes has nothing to do with the bill.",54
173,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,He said that he did not desire to make small capitalists.,54
174,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! The honourable gentleman must not make observations that are out of order.,54
175,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The lack of policy' in respect of the building of war service homes has caused a serious injustice to be done to ex-servicemen, who, with their wives and families, are living under deplorable conditions. It is imperative to speed up this building programme. An almost parallel ease is that of the settlement of ex-servicemen oh the land. Although the applications from ex-servicemen total 28,500, not one block of land has been made available for this purpose to date. In Soldier Superb, Allan Dawes stressed that relatives and friends of servicemen might help to keep up their-morale by emphasizing in letters to the troops, the bright prospects they would have upon their return of settling down with their wives and families in war service homes. At page 94, he saidAilcl you - want to know about things more. Maybe, Dad., you might send him that piece in the papers about post-war housing plans. You see, when he takes his job back after the-war, he'll be drawing down good money, and it's about time he and Jess and the kid-mayb e kids-settle d into a place of their own. It's all right Jess living with, the family while lie's away, but it won't be fair to go on that way. They've lives of their own to live and they'll have to bring up the kids in their own yvny. You realise that. What a sad disillusionment, what a tragic blow it will be to the men who return only to find that they are unable to obtain a war service home! I appeal to the Minister to make every effort to en-sure that the necessary materials will be supplied. That can be done only in cooperation with the States. I urged the Minister many times last year to release from the services every man who could swing an axe with skill, for the felling of trees in the mountains and scrub, as well as all those who could work in 1 timber mills, who could make bricks and tiles, and who could produce pipes and galvanized iron. I said that hundreds of thousands of skilled workers would be available as soon as the war was over for the building of war service homes and homes for civilians. The Minister then replied that all the materials required were available, and the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Frost) said that in regard to money "" the sky was the l i m it "" - I now ask that ex-servicemen be given the homes which for too long they have been denied.",54
176,Mr DALY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"M a r t in ) [4.41] - The War Service Homes Bill is a very important measure. Before making observations on the amendments to the act that are proposed in the bill, I shall reply briefly to some of the statements of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr . Francis). I am not greatly influenced by the "" crocodile tears "" which he shed in regard to war service homes and the general set-up of the organization that is responsible for them. In the first place, the honourable gentleman stated that he was emphatically opposed to members of the mercantile marine receiving any consideration under the act. He cited the case of a man who will be entitled to a war service home even though his service during the war consisted only of his having sailed from Point Nepean to Geelong. In citing that case, he rather exaggerated the position. The circumstances of such a man would not differ very greatly from those of a man who, having enlisted for overseas service, would be entitled to a war service home even though, through no fault of his own, he ' had not left Bankstown during the period of the war. The men who oran the risk of sailing in dangerous waters are as much entitled to a war service home as is any other person for whom the act makes provision. The honourable gentleman also referred to building costs. I regret that it has been found necessary to increase from £950 to £1,250, the maximum amount to be provided, mainly because of higher building costs. No matter what, party» we may belong to, all of us should endeavour to ensure that building costs will be kept down to the absolute minimum., so that the average wage-earner or ex-serviceman may be able to obtain a home which he will have a reasonable chance of paying for. Unfortunately, building costs have risen.. Many factors are responsible for that. Unlike the honourable member for Moreton, I do not "" pass the buck"" to the workers. It is all very well to assert flippantly that the men will not work, and that there are industrial troubles which cause costs to rise. Not many years ago, State governments composed of men of the same political i l k as honourable members opposite, sold the State brick works'in New South Wales, which would have been largely instrumental in keeping, building costs at a reasonable level.",55
177,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! 1I have already ruled that the cause of the rise of building costs cannot be debated extensively.,55
178,Mr DALY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I bow to your ruling, sir. I considered it necessary to say that honourable members opposite are hardly fair when they "" pass the buck "" to men who are not in any appreciable measure responsible for the rise .of building costs that has taken place. Honourable mein bers opposite are remarkable in that they are disposed at all times to boost the magnificent Labour Government that is in.office in New Zealand. One of the reasons why Australia is somewhat backward at present in regard to the provision of war service homes and other things, is that it did not have a Labour Government as early as did New Zealand. It is all very well to acclaim what New Zealand""is doing in regard to housing, and to cast aspersions on efforts to the same end in Australia. The figures cited by the honourable member for Moreton in regard to the New Zealand situation' were misleading, and must be refuted. The Commonwealth Government is faced with the same circumstances as the Government of any other country, in regard to building construction. It is not short of money, but is handicapped by lack of man-power and materials, ami there is a definite l i in i : to the resources available for home building. The Government considers that the ideal approach to the matter is for the various State governments, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, to build a number of houses, a proportion of which - shall be available to ex-service personnel. An agreement between the Commonwealth and the States with regard to the matter was reached at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and of the houses 11 ow being erected in the various States not less than 50 per cent, are being made available to ex-servicemen. With the permission of the House I shall incorporate in Hansard the following table showing the number of homes allocated to ex-servicemen under the Commonwealth and State housing agreement up to the 31st December, 1945 :- . allocated. servicemen. allocated. New South Wales 1,203 631 Victoria 1,067 704 Queensland 209 153 South Australia 374 257 Western Australia. 155 Tasmania 90 Total 3,188 1,879 It will be seen that of 3,1S8 houses cated throughout the Commonwealth, 1,839, or 59 per cent., have been allocated as required by section 9 of the Commonbefore wealth and States housing agreement. It is interesting to note that in one small part of my electorate about ISO houses are being erected. That is more than total number built by the anti-Labour governments which have been in power in this country during the last 20 or years. Those who paint a gloomy picture with regard to war service homes should member that the position is not so bad as it may appear. If the Commonwealth Government built a greater number war service homes than at present, as suggested by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), it would merely cause fewer homes to be built under various State schemes, because it would world war. correspondingly reduce the limited supply of building materials now available to the States. We cannot fight a war and send overseas many thousands of our able-bodied men overseas, thus taking them out of essential industries, and at the same have houses built at as high a rate as normal times. I shall not be happy Mr Daiy. every ex-serviceman and every civilian who needs a home can obtain one at a reasonable rent, or' at a fair purchase price. I commend the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) upon the desirable alteration for which the bill provides of the conditions under which war service homes are to be built. The provision in clause 4, which will increase the maximum permissible expenditure on a war service home from £950.to £1,250 is long overdue. I hope that all land available for the building of war service homes will be utilized 'at an early Tot.nl Allocated Percentage date. The bill has my cordial support, as t,0 it provides for changes which will confer on ex-service personnel benefits to which they and their families are justly 52 entitled. 66 Mr HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.51]. 51 69 - This bill contains matters of moment 92 60 to ex-service men and women and others 42 47 who will ultimately obtain war service 59 homes, but we should not lose sight of the precedent established after World War I . when war service homes were proallovided as a special recognition of the sacrifices made by members of the fighting services. The bill now us is designed to extend the enjoyment of a privilege formerly confined. to ex-service personnel. It follows a precedent established by the prethe sent Government with regard to measures formerly designed for the benefit of members of the fighting services, so that per30 sons whom the Government selects may receive the benefit of this legislation. We saw that policy adopted in the Re-estabrelishment and Employment Act, and we now find it repeated in connection with the War Service Homes Act. The honourable of member for. Martin (Mr Daly) rightly said that this bill is designed, not only to give merchant seamen an advantage, but also to grant a benefit to men who did the not leave Australia during the recent",55
179,Mr CHAMBERS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Some of them wished to go overseas but were not able to do so.,56
180,Mr HARRISON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Thos e who fought are worthy of added recognition. These members of the services who did not leave Australia, possibly for reasons time beyond their control, had the. advanin tage of living in safe bases practically until under' peace-time conditions. Why should the base "" wallahs"" be granted the same benefits as those who made blood sacrifices overseas? I believe that the merchant seamen should not be included in a measure of this kind. In view of the fact that the War Service Homes Act was designed to recognize the services of our fighting men it should be used exclusively for that purpose. A .measure is already on the statute-book relating to merchant seamen and recognizing their war services. That gives them the advantage of a war loading in respect of their pay. Our fighting men received no extra payment for going into the firing line and doing battle to save the people of Australia and preserve their standards of living. They fought for a rate of pay which was a mere bagatelle, whereas the merchant seamen received a war loading which gave him a handsome wage, i u comparison with the payment made to our fighting men. I do not desire to detract from the bravery of the merchant seamen who carried oui troops through danger 1 zones and into the fighting arenas. I have the utmost regard for them, but if they have not received sufficient recogni:ion of their services, ,the Government should be prepared to submit a separate measure for that purpose. If the Government desires to give special recognition to the seamen who have risked life and-limb, let it do so; but this bill w produce fantastic anomalies. Seamen who have travelled from port to port in Australia, and have never experienced danger greater than that involved in making a trip from Circular Quay to Manly, are-to receive recognition similar to that to be given to men who fought on the Kokoda Trail, or who suffered the loss of limbs or eyesight. This bill has been designed to cut across an important principle that has been established in respect of measures such as the War Service Homes Act. Men who have never smelt danger should not be placed on the same footing as those who have made blood sacrifices. I do not wish it to be said that I blame the men who wished to fight overseas but were not permitted to do so. Yet that is no reason why merchant seamen should receive the same consideration as others who made blood sacrifices. Whilst commending certain features of the bill, which I regard as of great value to ex-members of the fighting services, I consider that the Government is largely destroying the value of the measure by including among the beneficiaries men who have no valid right to be included. If the merchant seamen are worthy of special recognition-and many of them did go into the danger zones and are worthy of consideration-the y received it in ihe form of awar loading. Fantastic wages were received in some instances. Not only did seamen get f/om 14s. to 16s. a day, as compared with the 6s. 6d. paid to our fighting men, but. also seamen who took a dredge around the Australian coast were paid up to £78 a month. The first cook employed on the dredge received £S6 10s. a month and the second cook, £65 10s. If the Government wishes to recognize the services of merchant seamen, let it bring down a measure to deal with the matter, and I shall give it the support to which I think it is entitled, but I do not wish a bill designed to benefit ex-servicemen to be cluttered up with the extraneous matters which this measure contains.",56
181,Mr RYAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [5.3] - This bill embodies several amendments of the War Service Homes Act, and one of them provides for an increase of the maximum advance which may be made in respect ill of a war service home from £950 to £1,250. If £950 was considered a. reasonable l i m it in 1935, how can £1,250 be regarded as reasonable now, seeing that costs have risen enormously in the meantime? The Minister ought to know more about housing costs than I do, but my personal experience is that prices have risen by from 80 per cent, to 100 per cent, since the beginning of the war. The increase of the maximum amount allowable for war service homes is out of proportion to the actual rise of costs, and therefore I ask the Government to consider raising the l i m it by another £300. We do not want to put men who served Australia well into indifferent houses. As an instance of the greatly increased cost of building, I mention that in 1939 I had a cottage built for one of my employees. It was constructed of fibrocement, and although it did not have all modern conveniences, it had proper sanitation, and water and electricity were laid on. That cottage cost £600, exclusive of the land on which it was built. I now wish to build a house for another employee, and have consulted the same architects, who say that a similar house would now cost £1,200. Even at that cost, the house woiild not be suitable for a returned serviceman with a wife and family; it would not be big enough nor would it be sufficiently well constructed. I urge the Government to increase the amount which may be granted for the construction of homes foi ex-servicemen. It is, however, useless to increase the permissible' amount if houses are not to be built. ""We have been told that the Housing Commission in Victoria has built very few homes during the last five years. The number of houses now under construction! is small compared with the houses being erected in other parts of Australia for civilian use. Figures supplied to me in this connection avc striking. They show that whereas 1915 applications for homes were received in 1944 only nine houses were built. In the following year, eight homes were completed, notwithstandingthat applications for homes totalled 3,500. In the present year 65 homes were completed to the 28th January. It has been said by some honourable members, includinsr the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly), that the comparison made hy the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) between the number of houses constructed in Australia and in New Zealand is wrong. The honourable member for Moreton said that in New Zealand 2,239 homes were built for ex-servicemen to the 31st January, 1946, whereas in Australia only 69 homes were built, in the same period. The honourable member for Martin explained that the homes built in New Zealand comprised all the houses allotted to soldiers, whereas '-f the houses built by the Australian States for soldiers, 1879 have been handed over to ex-servicemen. I point out. first, that the conditions under which homes are built by the States and then handed nvf! to ex-servicemen are not the same p< under the War Service Homes Act. If the States can build houses and hand them over to ex-seryicemcn. I want to know why the War Service Homes Comini=sion cannot do so. The statistics do not reflect credit on the com' Mr Hj/nii. mission. Considering the support that it should have - received from the Commonwealth Government, the commission ought to have constructed more than 69 homes during the war. This is a matter which the War Service Homes Commission and the Minister for Housing should investigate. If the act is to be of any benefit to ex-servicemen, a much larger number of. homes should be oon.stru.cted. Many hundreds of applications for homes are already in hand, 1 and others are coming in daily. I know that honourable members generally regard the situation in regard to - war service homes as unsatisfactory, and are anxiously looking, for an early improvement. Mr TURNBULL ""(Wimmera) [5.11]. - Ex-serviceme n throughout the country will appreciate the increase of the maximum advance for homes which is contained in this bill, because they have found that, the greatly increased cost of x building has made it impossible to get suitable homes constructed within the limit previously permitted. If the Government intends to include merchant seamen whose only service was in Australian waters in this legislation, I Fuggest that some priority should be given to those persons who are now eligible for homes. It is generally agreed that the service rendered by the men who arc now to be included was not attended by so many dangers as was that of the men who are now eligible.  bilities also should, be taken into account.",57
182,Mr TURNBULL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The War Service Homes Act provides a means of giving some recompense to the men who served their country well. For the most part members of the fighting services received low rates of pay during the war, whereas men who served in the merchant navy were paid for war risks; some of them earned large sums of money. I emphasize the desirability of granting some measure of priority to those who are now eligible. If others come into the scheme; the difficulty of providing homes for ihose who are now eligible for them will be increased. Much has been said as to the necessity for speeding up the-building of homes. Ex-servicemen generally are dissatisfied with the progress that has been made; they believe that more could have been done during the war. If the electors believe that Government bungling is the ca use of the present chaos, they will deal with the matter in the near future.",58
183,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [5.14] - Like many other bills introduced by this Government, the short measure before us is eloquent in what it does not say. The first proposal contained in the measure relates to merchant seamen, and, personally, I have not much to say against it. In my opinion, a man who served in a coastal vessel during the greater part of the period when we were at Avar against Japan took a greater risk than did the men who sat in Victoria Barracks. That applies also to a number of places outside Victoria Barracks. The important thing is that a departure is made from the usual. On that point, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Sheehy) misunderstood the remarks last week of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), whose attitude was not to make derogatory references to men who serve on the coastal ships, but to maintain that ihe act should not be altered to increase the number entitled to benefit and thus lengthen the wait for homes of those whose claims are already established. The second, and I think, for - several reasons, the most important point, is the provision increasing the maximum advance for the construction of a house from £950 to £1,250. That is about 31-} per cent. It is most eloquent, though silent, testimony as to what the Government considers is the economic future of Australia - It means that everybody requiring a house, whether constructed by the War Services Homes Commission, by any other body, or privately, will henceforth have to pay at least 31-1per cent, more for it than hitherto. That is a significant admission, in the opinion of the Government, rents will be one-third greater than they were.  correct ratio to the increased payments to men in the armed forces in this war compared with the rates paid in 1914-18. It provides a home of a better standard.",59
184,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is not the point. The point is that the Government considers that henceforth people will have to pay about one-third more rent than before. It is not possible to argue that the increase from £950 to £1,250 could otherwise be justified, or that it applies only to the construction of homes under the War Service Homes Act, and that people not provided for by the% act will still be able to have homes constructed' at the old price. The nule applies to all or none. I raise that because I believe that the hitherto unspoken intention of the Government i.? increased rents and costs generally, which will involve increased wages. The kernel of the Government's financial policy is a closer approximation between the debts incurred in the war and the income in paper money from which they will be met. I do not intend to go deeper into that now.",59
185,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member would be wise - not to do so.,59
186,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I simply state that as the Government's objective about which it has been discreetly silent up till now. I think the House is entitled to examine the ability of men to build homes for £1,250. I have a letter prepared by members of the Glenelg Sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League. Glenelg is in my electorate aud, as it is a suburban area, naturally the 1,200 or 1,300 members of the sub-branch have an idea of bujlding costs. The letter is somewhat caustic about the treatment received by 'members who went to the War Service Homes Commission for information about these matters. The statement readsWhen yon receive notice to attend the office and discuss plans and specifications you find that for £950 you can build three rooms aud a kitchenette, bathroom and laundry of very small dimensions, minus fencing, ibath heater, stove, tank, copper outhouses &c, which after adding such things as jarrah flooring, extra height for ceilings, which by the way are only specified as 9 f t . , transfer, survey, architects fees &a., you are up for £1,250. The above is only for the married couple without a family. The family man needing a five-roomed house is not in the race nndei£1.4.00 plus cost of building block. Their view is that the cost of a building block in the area is about £150. They, are working on the basis of a 50 ft. frontage at £3 a foot. The building will cost £1,130, architects' foes £33, transfer fees, title search,- survey, valuation, &c, £10 10s. bringing the total to £1,323 10s. It may be argued that this was ment mentioned by the honourable member for Boothby, that brick houses are availciple able in South Australia at a. much lower figure, but I think they are available only thrgugh certain State institutions, and doubt their availability to ex-servicemen with the War Service Homes Act operatspective, ing. If they are I shall be happy. But effect be made. we must look at the figure admitted, careful consideration, by the Government as the amount required to enable a man to set himself up in what it regards as decent house. In committee I propose move an amendment, because it is Government supporters were tested on Government. one or two things. What attitudes does the Government intend to adopt towards men returned from this war who have built homes but have been lent only £950 and had to draw on other resources, probably other loans, for the difference tween the £950 lent to them under the War Services Homes Act and the £1,250 provided for in this bill. That is somereason thing that the Government should face.",59
187,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It will.,60
188,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But it for does not do so in this bill.,60
189,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No .,60
190,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It would be only fair to amend clause 7 to gaging provide "" This act shall apply \o all homes built under this act for men who have, returned from this war"".",60
191,Mr SHEEHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is fair enough.,60
192,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I see. nothing wrong with it. It would be a good thing if the Government undertook to accept that amendment.,60
193,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,We will look at cases on their merits. They are few ,60
194,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I direct the Minister's attention to the fact clause 2 providesThis act shall come into operation on day on which it receives the Royal Assent.,60
195,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is true.,60
196,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"So the Minister cannot make this legislation retrospective, unless a clause providing for retrospectivity is inserted.",60
197,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable ber will be surprised.,60
198,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I should not be surprised at anything the Governtried, to do, but good legislation and sound, administration carries the printhat the law shall state what, the Government has the power to do; and if this bill cannot come into operation until I it receives the Royal Assent, obviously the Government cannot make it retrounless an amendment to that Therefore,- in the after interests of those concerned, it is only fair that the Government should give serious consideration, before we go a into committee, to the acceptance of the to amendment I have suggested. I do not time want to force anything on the",60
199,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member would not be allowed to do so.,60
200,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"But I behave been known to insist on the bells being rung for a division, and I will do so if the Minister is not able to see between now and when clause 7 is reached in committee. Those are the important points. It is useless for the Government to talk about housing schemes the soldier, or anybody else, until it attends to the first essential, the production of"" adequate materials. Unless that be done the Government, instead of enin comforting talk as it has up to the present, must say to the soldiers, "" Until certain men are prepared to work, especially in New South Wales, you boys will have to do the best you can. You can go and live with' mother "".",60
201,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [5.26] - in reply- 1I have no desire to engender all heat in the debate. The constructive' criticism, offered by honourable members opposite will be carefully that considered, and any amendment of this legislation deemed to be necessary in the the light of experienue will be made. I admit that up to the present only a. limited number of war service homes has been constructed. However, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis), and the honourable member for memBalaclava (Mr White) sianply endea, voured to make a political football of the soldiers' needs. Other honourable members opposite did not attempt to do so; their criticism will be carefully considered by the Government. Honourable ,members opposite who believe that under the conditions that have operated during the last few years it was possible for the Government to embark on an extensive scheme of building war service homes in accordance with the traditional policy of the War Service Homes Commission are just hoping for the impossible. But I hope that as the result of this measure and of departmental action which will be taken in co-operation with housing commissions in each of the States, which now control supplies of building materials, we , shall obtain a greater flow of materials and shall be enabled to launch a reasonable programme of construction within the near future. The honourable member for Wentworth spoke only on behalf of the man who served outside Australia, the man who sacrificed Ii is blood. That is a new argument for honourable members opposite, because the original War Service Homes Act which \va.= introduced after World War I . by a _ government which they supported provided that every man who volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force, whether he left Australia or not, should be eligible home. This bill does not that provision. In that respect it follows the policy embodied in the original act. 'The honourable member for Wentworth, apparently, can be speaking for only himself in {hat regard. 1 doubt whether he really gave serious thought to this matter when he was a member of a previous government. He may have voiced in Cabinet the views he has just expressed, but he has certainly not done so elsewhere. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Kyan) said that if other housing commissions could build homes throughout Australia the War Service Homes Commission should be able to do likewise. The War Service Homes Commission does not propose to build homes under the same conditions as will be observed by State housing, authorities,' because it seeks to give to the soldier and his wife a home to their liking. Applicants are permitted to make a choice from hundreds of plans. If none of those plans satisfies them the com- . mission will accept plans prepared by their own architect provided all relevantconditions under the act are observed. In that respect the commission observes a policy that was laid down long before the present Government took office. That policy will enable the commission to obviate jerry-building. The commission does not build great groups of homes to a common pattern, but aims to give to the soldier and his wife the right enjoyed by every other citizen who can afford to buy or build a house to obtain the kind of home which they desire. When the housing agreement was. made with the States, the Commonwealth, realizing that that was the policy of the commission, in sisted that at least 50 per cent, of the homes constructed by State authorities must be rented to returned soldiers until such time as it was possible for the commission to build homes to their own liking. The fact is that in practically every State 60 per cent, of homes so far constructed by State authorities have been let to returned soldiers. The honourable member for Balaclava urged that the maximum advance of £1,250 should be increased. The Government stands firmly by that l i m it . However, this legislation is not unalterable, like the for a laws of the Medes and Persians. Twelve alter months hence, when this Government will still be in office, the legislation will be reviewed in the light of experience; and should it be necessary that l i m it will be increased. However, we hope that the flow of building materials will be increased as the result of action now being taken by the States :<> mechanize brick kilns and to improve organization, and that building costs will decrease. If that hope is realized the advance of £1,250 will be sufficient. I repeat that if it be found to be notsufficient, the Government will not hesitate to ask Parliament to raise the limit . Most opposition has been expressed to the extension of the benefits of this legislation to merchant seamen who served during the war off the Australian coast. I have here a copy of last week's Sunday Sun, in which appears a map showing the number of ships sunk off the Australian ea3t coast, and the locations of sinkings during the war. It shows that 29 Australian ships were sunk and eleven damaged as the result of enemy action. The provision to which honourable members opposite object was inserted in the original act after World War I . Admittedly, it applied only to merchant seamen who had served on ships overseas, but fortunately, no hostile submarine operated off the Australian coast in 1914-1S. Consequently, merchant seamen serving in ships in Australian waters took no risk in World War I . In 1941, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), as Minister for Labour and National Service, introduced a bill to amend the War Service Homes Act. Why did not honourable members opposite insist then that ha should not commit the Government to give serious consideration to the proposal that, merchant seamen who had served in ships off the Australian coast after the outbreak of war in 1939 should be eligible for the benefits of the War Service Homes Act. Replying to representations by honoraible members on this side of the House, he said1 appreciate that some hazards in Australian waters are just as great as those which are experienced by seamen in service abroad. . . . I assure honourable members that this point will receive full and sympathetic consideration by the Government. .Normally I would suggest .that we defer this measure the Government has had an opportunity to consider the submissions of honourable members; but, in view of the fact that the Parliament will bo in recess for some weeks, and any deferment of .the bill might hold up aid which otherwise could be given to men or dependants, I suggest that the bill be passed as it is now drawn. If that be done, I shall bring under the notice of the Minister for War Service Homes the representations made by honourable members during this debate and ask him to consider them during the recess. The honourable member was not speaking irresponsibly, as the honourable member for Barker does in this chamber. He spoke as a responsible Minister in charge of a bill, and made that definite and considered statement. If this principle is so wrong, why was not the honourable member for Fawkner compelled to abandon it in 1941? Yet he promised that the government of the day would .'consider it carefully and sympathetically. The Government has decided that members of' the mercantile marine who served in ships off the Australian coast Mr Lazzarini. after the commencement of World War II . have taken serious risks. The bones of some of them are now lying at the bottom of the sea off the Australian coast. Merchant seamen took the risk which soldiers and sailors took. In reply to the objection raised by the honourable m-tmber for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), I point out that merchant seamen will not be able to apply for war service homes until this bill becomes law. Thousands of applications have already been lodged with the War Service Homes Commisrion, which deals with them in the order in which they are received, and for that reason, any applications which may be lodged in future by merchant seamen will be low on the list. Mr TuiiNBULL - The ' applications which have already been lodged by servicemen will have priority over any applications that may be lodged by merchant seamen ?",60
202,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Certainly ! I now desire to deal briefly with the charge that this Government has erected only a small number of war service homes. I have already informed the House that this Government considered that 50 per cent, of the homes which are e.rected by the housing commissions of the States should until be allotted to ex-servicemen. They are entitled to that privilege. The honourable member for Moreton. (Mr Francis) declared that during the war of 1914-18, the government of the day built war sertheir vice homes. I am not impressed by that statement, because the original act was not passed until 191S. Therefore, few, if any, war service homes could have been built during World War I . Apart from . that, let us examine the ability of Australia to build war service homes during the two world wars. If this Government had been able to build three houses for every one thousand that, were built in 1914-18, it would have done an excellent job. In the war of 1914-18, Australia was not threatened with invasion, as it was in the last war. After Japan entered the war, we were compelled to divert 'to the armed services materials which normally would have been used for building. However, I shall not. weary the House with a repetition of facts which are known to every - one. Honourable members opposite in - criticizing this bill, are again playing the game of politics. They will play politics with any subject, and even with servicemen. The truth is that after - Japan entered the war, it was physically impossible for the Government to build war service homes.",62
203,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"A few days ago, the Minister contended that the - Government had. built war service homes - during the war.",63
204,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Nothin g of the sort! From 1939 to 1941, very few persons were eligible for war service homes. .Before a serviceman may apply for a war service home, he must be discharged from the forces. That provision was inserted in the act by a. non-Labour .government. Applications for homes increased as the war progressed. In 1941-42, 160 applications were received in New 'South Wales, 47 in Victoria, 9 in 'Queensland, 45 in South Australia, 24 in Western Australia and 10 in. Tasmania. In 1942-43 applications were: New South Wales 191, Victoria 95, - Queensland 25, South Australia 61, Western Australia - 33 and Tasmania '23. In 1943-44. when numbers - of men were being discharged, applications for war service homes increased appreciably; they were: New South Wales -66S, Victoria 511, Queensland 126, South Australia. 190, Western Australia 172, - and Tasmania S4. For the first eight months of 1945-46, the number of appli- cations totalled 7,8S2. The War Service Homes Commission has advised me that many of the applicants do not desire to build at the present time. They are waiting until this amending legislation becomes law, so that they may derive the benefit of the increase of the statutory limit from £950 to £1,250. During the regime of the Labour Government, the War Service Homes Commission has implemented a portion of the act which was never given effect while honor- able members opposite occupied the treasury bench. I refer to the provision which permits an ex-serviceman to build his own home privately, if he is able, to do so, and to have plans prepared privately. An applicant may go to the office of the War -""Service Homes Commission in any State and select one of 400 or 500 plans available to him. This service is provided free of charge. If he cannot find a plan to suit his requirements, he may employ his own architect and have a special plan prepared. He may also have a home constructed on his own land if he sodesires, provided certain standards are adhered to. The War Service Homes Commission owns housing blocks in every State, and an applicant may select a block and have his home built by a private builder, either to a plan provided by the commission or to a plan of his own. We are hopeful that with the passing of this measure, and' the appointment of liaison officers between the commission and the housing authorities in the various States, .a larger share of available building mate : rials will be given to the commission. I can assure honourable members that there will be no repetition of the jerry-building which was a feature of war service home.? construction after the last war. On that occasion some homes were so poorly constructed that bricks could be pulled out of the walls with the bare hands. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were wasted on houses which practically fell down on the occupants. The Government has introduced this amending legislation to facilitate the erection of war service homes. The new provision enabling homes to be built on leasehold will be a big advantage in Queensland, where, because of land tenure conditions, the activities of the commission have hitherto been restricted. I commend this bill to honourable members and hope that it will have a speedy passage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Tn committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (Definitions).",63
205,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [5.50] - This clause provides for the inclusion of merchant seamen in the list of persons eligible for benefits under the War Service Homes Act. As the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) has introduced my name into the discussion and has referred to certain comments made by me some time ago, I take this opportunity to say something in relation to the object of this clause. It was interesting to be reminded of certain events which, quite frankly, I had forgotten during the intervening years. However, I do not rise now to retract anything that I said at that time. I merely wish to draw the attention of the committee to two developments in regard to merchant seamen which have occurred since my earlier remarks were made. The first of these is that, in view of the hazards to which merchant seamen were subjected during. the war, a carefully graduated scale of bonus payments bearing direct relation to the risk involved was worked out. The position of merchant seamen, therefore, was different from that of servicemen who were undergoing risks, in some cases, perhaps, not greater than those of merchant seamen, but in other instances very much greater. The servicemen had a standard rate of pay irrespective of the risks they were undergoing, whereas merchant seamen received bonus payments to compensate them for the hazards of their employment. Another important difference between the two groups was that merchant seamen were pursuing their normal calling, and therefore had opportunity for advancement in that calling, whereas servicemen, except the relatively few professional soldiers, were engaged on a task very far removed from their peacetime avocations. The theme running through the whole of the rehabilitation legislation of the Government is the obligation which rests upon the community to restore to their peace-time opportunities and occupations persons whose civil careers had been interrupted by their services to their country. I believe that that, in the first place, constitutes an important distinction between servicemen and men of the merchant navy. Secondly, we should not allow this fact to slip from our minds: Whilst there may have been very good reason for Us to view sympathetically the claims of merchant seamen during the war, I do not think any of us will commend the attitude that these men have adopted since the end of hostilities, so far as war risk payments are concerned. It is almost incredible that seven months after the end of hostilities in the Pacific, merchant seamen should still be receiving their high war-risk bonuses. The current order of the Maritime Industries Commission prescribes a 25 per cent, bonus Mr Holt. on interstate and intra-state ships trading south of Townsville and Port Hedland, 15 per cent, for St. Vincent's Gulf, 33^ per cent, for interstate and intra-state ships north of those points, and 50 per - cent, for overseas ships going north of Townsville and Port Hedland, from their last Australian port on the outward voyage to their first Australian port on the homeward voyage. So, we have carried into this peace-time period, very substantial bonuses which have no relation to the hazard that the seamen are called upon to accept. My final comment on this clause I make on the assumption that all members in this chamber have as their prime objective the construction of homes, not merely for ex-servicemen or merchant seamen, but also for the community as a whole. I believe, however, that the Government is trying,, in some respects, to devolve responsibility for the construction of these homes on to State instrumentalities and State governments. The consequence of that, a3 I have already observed in Victoria ' THE CHAIRMAN . (Mr Riordan) Order 1 I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the clause now under discussion.",63
206,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I was endeavouring to save the time of the committee. The remarks that I was about to make are relevant to clause 4, and in view of your ruling, Mr Chairman, I shall reserve further comment until that clause is before the. committee. The Commonwealth Government, has passed over to the State governments many controls which it exercised during the war. Its justification for this policy is the necessity for restricting building activity to home construction only. On paper that appears to be very desirable, but in practice it does not work out very well. If the Minister wants homes to be constructed as rapidly as possible, he will not achieve his end by restricting industry for the benefit of one special section. In order to prove my point, I refer to what happened in the last year of the Menzies Government's administration. In that year, a record number of homes was built in Victoria. In the same period a. record general construction programme was carried out in that State. The one helped the other. Artisans passed from one job to another, and, as the building industries were expanded to meet the demand for one kind of construction, they were able to handle other kinds as well. That sort of expansion will not be achieved by confining building operations to one particular group. If the Minister wants the building industry to expand, he should remove, as far as possible, the restrictions now in force. If he fails to do so, he may find that the policies adopted by State governments, from the best of motives, will nullify the development which he seeks to encourage.",64
207,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Moreton) [5.57] - I draw attention to sub-clause 3 (d), which readsSection four of the Principal amended(</) by omitting, from paragraph (/) of that definition the words "" p other than "" and inserting in their stead the words "" other port, including "" ; It appears to-be very innocuous at first glance, but it proposes to grant to merchant seamen who travelled between ports wifhin a State during the war the special benefit.' of the war service homes legislation, which was designed primarily to assist members of the fighting forces to obtain homes at reduced costs. The war service homes scheme, in its present form, provides one of the easiest means of purchasing a home ever offered. This bill introduces an entirely new principle into the scheme. As I said in my second reading speech, although the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) probably did not appreciate iny point, the original act was designed specifically to assist members of the fighting forces, persons who went to Great. Britain to make munitions, and merchant seamen who travelled Overseas into theatres of war. I definitely oppose the inclusion of men who were engaged in the merchant naval service between certain Australian ports only. If the Government wishes to grant some measure of assistance to those seamen, it should introduce legislation for that special purpose. Thousands of ex-servicemen are today awaiting a chance to build war-service homes, .and it is possible that many hundreds of thousands who have not yet applied will eventually do so. There is already a serious holdup in the war service homes programme.",65
208,Unknown,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Sitting suspended from 6 to. 8 p.m.,65
209,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I regard the war service homes legislation as being, in the main, a gesture of appreciation by the nation of the splendid services renr dered by the members of the fighting services. The proposal to bring within its ambit members of the-Australian mercantile marine who served in ships plying along our coasts is not in keeping with the spirit that prompted the introduction of the original act, namely, to extend its benefits to those who had gone overseas into the theatres of war. The members of Act is the Australian mercantile marine not only get very substantial rates of pay, but also good quarters and food, and, in addition, a war-risk bonus. The current order of o r t the Maritime Industries Commission provides that the war-risk bonus shall be at the rate of 25 per cent, in respect of interstate and intra-state ships trading south of Townsville and Port Hedland, 15 per cent, for ships trading in Spencer's Gulf, and 33^ per cent, for interstate and intra-state ships trading north of the ports mentioned. For overseas ships going north of Townsville and Port Hedland, a bonus of 50 per cent, is paid from the last Australian port of call on the outward voyage to the first port of call on the homeward voyage. A soldier on active service received a payment of 6s 6d. a day plus 2s. a day deferred pay. He had to withstand the privations of desert warfare in the Middle East, of snow-clad mountains in Greece and Syria, and of jungle and infeqted swamps in the South-west Pacific Area. All of this for a total of 6s. 6d. a day! Yet the soldier is asked to share the limited number of homes that can be built by the commission with members of the mercantile marine working in Australian waters who, throughout the war, have enjoyed a relatively comfortable existence. The extension of the benefits of this legislation in the manner proposed will have a disastrous effect upon ex-servicemen who have been waiting years for a war service home. If the Government wishes to build homes for members of the mercantile marine it should bring down a special bill for that purpose which could be discussed on its merits. In time of battle a soldier lives largely on biscuits and bully beef; hismore fortunate compatriot in the mercantile marine is amply catered for all the time by the generous scale of nations laid down by Iris awards. Let me refresh the Minister's mind by a recital of the terms of the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the Seamen's Union in respect of the voyage of the dredge Matthew Flinders from Melbourne to Fremantle. ' The terms of the agreement were as follows:1. Iu respect of the voyage from Melbourne to Fremantle, each employee shall be paid a minimum of three months' wages inclusive of war risk, bonuses and all other conditions provided in awards and agreements. 2. Upon the termination of the voyage, i.e., midnight on day of arrival at Fremantle, each employee shall ""have the right of repatriation to Melbourne at the expense of the Commonwealth by the first available train. 3. Victualling allowance provided in award shall be paid while awaiting commencement of return voyage. 4. Wages are to be paid from the time of termination of voyage to Fremantle up to and including the day of arrival in Melbourne The following table shows the award rates that should have been paid and the amounts that were actually paid by the Commonwealth Government under the agreement:Classification. month plus due Deck Department- . £ s. d.

No Minister can. honestly defend a proposal such as we now have before us. I am not unmindful of the services rendered by members of the mercantile marine. I pay a tribute to their work ; but I do not agree that they should be placed on a n equal footing with members of the fighting forces and be enabled to compete with ex-servicemen for the few homes that the War Service Homes Commission can build each year. If this clause is passed in its present for m it' will cause grave disappointment to many thousands of ex-servicemen, mostly young men with families, who have been waiting for years for a home. Instead of adopting a policy which will result in s t ill further delaying the provision of homes-for ex-servicemen, the Government should be taking every possible step to expeditetheir construction. I paid tribute earlierto the Commissioner and his staff, many of whom I know personally. They aremost estimable men, who are anxious torender the best service they can to their.ex-servicemen comrades. If , in addition: to dealing with their present difficultproblems, they are to be obliged to makeprovision for another group of men out of the limited building and man-power resources that are available, an entirely new organization should be established! and should operate under separate legislation. I ask the Minister to withdraw Amount llato ot pay excluding this provision. in the overtime, awards per for the voyage Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [8.11] 33£ per cent, Melbourne to war risk. Fremantle. Seldom do I disturb the pleasant atmosphere of the committee by intervening: £ s. d, in a debate; but as one who represents a 186 4 0 waterside electorate which embraces many126 4 0 114 4 0 men who went down to the sea in ships,. 107 0 0 I consider that I ought to say 'something86 10 0 on this clause. I am not seeking for those82 0 0 men great, gifts, rewards or honours, be78 0 0 48 0 0 cause such are not bestowed by this legislation, but I do seek on their behalf recog184 4 0 nition of the services that they rendered' 132 4 0 during the war period - They were, in 115 4 0 101 6 0 effect, the life-line between the battle lines90 0 0 and as indispensable to the war effort as 86 0 0 the men in the trenches. There should be86 0 0 some tangible recognition of what they 78 0 0 did. I have said that I am not seeking94 10 0 for them gifts, rewards or honours. In 68 10 0 plain fact, a war service home'is neither86 10 0 a g if t nor an honour, and the right to 65 10 0 possess one is merely a recognition of."" service. My reason for saying that, is that the purchaser of a war service home is in no 'better position than individual who contracts to build a home for himself. For instance, he does not get any concession in regard to price. - costs as much, perhaps more, to build war service home as to build by private - contract. The purchaser of a war service home gets very little concession in regard to the interest charge, .because today 'the ex-serviceman is charged an interest rate of 3-J per cent, which is exactly same as the private bank rate on building - operations. The penalty for failure maintain payments does not advantage the purchaser of a war service home in - comparison with the man who buys home privately. It has been proved in thousands of instances since the last that the purchaser of a war service who fails to keep up his paymentsfaces eviction and the loss of his equity in property, as does any private individual who contracts to purchase a home. Added to that, the man who takes on a contract to purchase a war service home accepts a life obligation, under which he gambles against the fate of industry, assuming that until he is able to complete his ments, possibly in 30 years' time, he will remain in employment and will not dewar, fault. So those who are given the priviwhich lege of jHirchasing a war service home have bestowed on (hem not a gift or honour, but merely a recognition of the - service they have rendered to their counrecent try. It is true that, as the result amendments subsequently embodied in the act, a concession is given to the widow - of the purchaser of a war service If a man dies before discharging comthat pletely the obligations imposed on him under his contract, his widow may take over the contract to complete the paysible ments, and if unable to do that may occupy the home at a nominal rent ing her lifetime. That is no greater confronted - cession than many building societies give to those Who build homes under their - control. Under a system of insurance, the jmrchaser of a. home under many private contracts is protected - in that - connection. If he dies, the home mediately becomes the property of his widow. Therefore, if this concession wore given to the men who went down to the sea in. ships, it would be neither a gift nor an honour, but merely a recognition the private of their - services. What is the history of the war service homes legislation?, It was enacted early It in 1918; not in the heat, fervour find a enthusiasm of war, but when this Parliament had an opportunity to survey the whole - field-bot h recognition of members of the armed forces and the possibility of housing them. Despite all contradiction, there was no war service homes the legislation in force during the war of 19.14-18. I have said that a war service to home is neither a gift nor an honour. I go further and say that those who purchased such homes in 1919 placed a milla stone round their necks. One of the greatest scandals, in building construction war in this country was the building of home war service homes by jerry-builders. Reviewing the history of this legisthe lation, we can be assured that those originally responsible for it legislated in a calm atmosphere. In that atmosphere, they decided to include men of the merchant marine who had served overseas. Let us consider the present position. The concession was given to men with overseas payservice because World War I . was fought overseas. But in the spread of the recent there was not an area on the globe was safe for the men of the merchant marine. I cannot recollect any ship an having been sunk or damaged in Australian - waters in World War I . In the war, however, more than 30 ships of were sunk or damaged on the New South Wales coast alone, and the total number on the whole of the Australian coastline home. was 33 sunk and thirteen damaged. Therefore, honourable members will see the whole spread of the most recent war was different from that of 1914-18. What is there to show that those responfor the original Avar service homes legislation, had they been faced with durthe problems with which we were conin the recent war, would not have omitted from that legislation the qualification that men of the merchant marine must have served overseas? Comparisons in such matters are odious. I remind honourable members that service in any imarmed force is an absolute lottery. Because cf the disposition of the units to which they were attached, many men who served tliroughout the recent war did not hear a shot fired, yet they are as much entitled to a war service home as is the man who went through the thick of it and was severely injured. As the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) has said-viewing the matter in the worse light, what is the difference between giving a war service home to a member of the merchant marine and giving one to the "" Base Wallah "" who did not go beyond Victoria Barracks? That is the position we are up against. Even though comparisons are odious, I remind the committee that there was no more nerve-racking job in the whole war than that performed by the men of the merchant marine. Very often they were ill-protected, and did not sail in convoy, yet they faced the same risks from bombs and torpedoes aud mines as did the best equipi)ed ship in the British Navy. Even if their ships did not meet with disaster-and a great many ships did-the fact that for over five years they were subject to such nerve racking experiences should entitle them to special consideration. They performed their duties with heroism. There is no brighter page in the history of Australia's war effort than that which records the deeds of the men of the merchant navy, whether they sailed in convoy or not - In 90 per cent, of the cases they were over-matched in that they lacked a sufficiency of defence weapons, and had no protection against mines. Therefore, the matter of pay or bonuses should not enter into it. Does the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) believe that high pay or a bonus could compensate a man for the loss of his blife ? Does he believe that a wife would be prepared to sacrifice her husband for the sake of benefiting by high pay or a. bonus? If pay is to be a consideration, we should compare the rates of pay received by various ranks in the Army. Would the honourable member deny a general the right to a war service home because he received more pay than a private? Not only does the honourable member throw into the scale against the merchant seaman his pay and bonus, but he also throws in the menu. ""While he charitably remarks that he is not opposed to seamen getting good food, he nevertheMr Rosevear. less mentions the good food as a reason why seamen should not be entitled to war service homes. The fact remains that the merchant seamen were engaged on the Australian coast in an extremely risky service. Would the honourable member for Moreton have taken on the job at their pay?",65
210,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I never had an opportunity.,68
211,Mr ROSEVEAR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No , and the honourable member would not have taken it if he had. I am not asking for gifts or honors for these men who, in wartime, went down to the sea in ships. It is not in our power to provide them with such things, but it is in our power to do what ""the Parliament did in 1918 : that is, to give to merchant seamen who served in war theatres the right to war service homes. During this war our merchant seamen serving on the Australian coast were exposed to all the hazards of war, and the Parliament should suitably recognize their service.",68
212,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) , [8.22] - Wheneve r I hear the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) take part in a debate, I realise that this Parliament is the poorer because of his elevation to the exalted position of Speaker. He' is one of the incisive debaters in the House, and for that reason I welcome his participation in the debate. This evening, he said that 33 ships had been sunk off the Australian coast during the war. I am not an authority on the subject, but I heard a Minister of the Crown say that the number was 29, and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Sheehy) mentioned the same figure this afternoon.",68
213,Mr ROSEVEAR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Darwin sinkings were not included in that number.,68
214,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Then I think it will be necessary to revise the figures, because there are many masts and funnels poking up out of the water at Darwin.",68
215,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Mr Riordan) The honourable member must discuss the clause.,68
216,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I was about to remark that the honourable member for Dalley made a very good second reading speech on the clause. It is interesting to note that he shoifld be four ships out, in his account of the sinkings. Such - a matter should be the subject of accurate knowledge. The honourable member drew a gloomy picture of the economic future of persons who take war service homes. He did not use the word "" liability"" although I tried to put the word into his speech, for him.. However, everything he said indicated that the ex-serviceman who takes up a war service home accepts a liability for 30 years, and he referred to the inconvenience of such a liability in the event of the occupant being evicted or losing his equity in the home. While the Labour party was in opposition I was lead to believe from the speeches of Labour supporters that when Labour got into power every one would be immensely well off, and that, indeed, no one would have to work at all. There would be no such things as loss of income or poverty or evictions. There would be a state of universal well-being guaranteed by the Government. Now, the honourable member for Dalley, in a speech lasting only ten minutes, has completely wrecked my faith in the Australian Labour party. He should take the opportunity to assure .me that he was speaking without the Australian Labour party policy before 'him ; that on this occasion he was looking at life and at the facts of the situation as they am, and. not as they are represented in the Australian Labour party policy.",68
217,Mr BRYSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Bourke) [8.30] - I agree with the comments of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) who, in contra-distinction to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) explained clearly the position in regard to merchant seamen. The honourable member for Moreton ran true to form, and mouthed the usual platitudes about what ought to be clone for e'x-servicemen. He has been doing the same thing for the last 25 years. For part of that time he was a Minister of the Crown, and for twenty .years out of the 25 he was a supporter of the government in office. He has had many golden opportunities to do for' ex-servicemen what he now says that this Government ought to do, but the fact that it is necessary for him to keep on making the same requests indicate that he is not anxious to do anything in particular for ex-servicemen, but wishes only to use them for his own political ends. By now, I think the ex-servicemen have reached a proper understanding of the honourable member and his friends, who are now demanding that the Labour Government should do the things which they declined to do when they had the opportunity, and which they are secretly hoping that the Labour Government will not do, either. I am tired of that sort of thing. I do not like, hypocrisy. I believe that politicians and statesmen should speak their minds.; that they should not speak in one way and act in another. As for the clause under discussion, I believe that the proposal of the Government is a sound one. Seamen who took ships to sea during the war ran grave risks, graver risks than some members of the services, and I believe that they should have the same right to war service homes. Indeed, I believe that the Government should have gone a - good deal further. It is provided that any person who volunteered, and was accepted for overseas service, and those who actually served overseas, shall be entitled to a war service home. Yet it is a fact that many men who volunteered and were accepted never left their own. States, or even the capital cities. Nevertheless, they are. entitled to war service homes. There were in the armed services many men who were called up, and did not have a choice as to their place of service. They were drafted into the service, put into uniform and sent to Western Australia, Queensland or the Northern Territory, where they served for over four years. They should receive the same consideration as other ex-servicemen. If this cannot be provided in the bill now, the Government should amend the legislation as soon as possible so as to provide for it. While houses are so urgently needed, and while the powers of the Commonwealth Government are restricted in regard to the provision of homes, the Government should use the War Service Homes Act as a method to provide homes for as many persons as possible. In this way, it should be possible to provide homes for a great many more people than in any other way. The Government should - seize the opportunity to build twice as many homes for the people as is possible under the act as it now stands.",69
218,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [8.35]. - Many merchant seamen who sailed the seas during this war faced dangers and suffered hardships as great as did any of those who sailed with the Royal Navy or the Royal Australian Navy. I do not think that any experience could be more horrible than that of'a stoker working in the bowels of a ship running the blockade to Malta during the height of the blitz against that island; and what could be worse than the experience of seamen on ships carrying supplies on the northern route to Russia? I remember once travelling to Tasmania on the Zealandia, which now lies wrecked in Darwin harbour. I went down into the engine room, and along the propeller shaft as far as the thrust blocks. I went down to the stokehold, and in the engine room inspected the triple expansion engines. There, I talked to the second engineer, and it struck me what a harrowing experience it would be to be working down there in a ship that was going through seas where there existed danger from mines or torpedoes. Actually, the engineer had been in a ship that was torpedoed during the last war. I can speak as a neutral on this matter, because no submarines ever went up the New England rivers, nor were any mines laid in them, but my honest opinion is that merchant seamen ought to be. entitled to the benefits of this measure.",70
219,Mr JAMES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hunter) [8.40] - The remarks of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) should have the c-ndorsement of every honourable member. As the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) has indicated his intention to support the bill there cannot be much wrong with it, because generally the honourable member, for political purposes, does his best to find flaws in protime posals submitted by the Government. During the war enemy submarines frequently lay off the coast of New South Wales, particularly in the vicinity of Newcastle. It may not be generally known that many vessels were sunk off the Australian coast. I have had some sad experiences following disasters caused to merchant shipping by enemy action. On one occasion I represented the Government at a funeral of nine merchant seamen belonging to the Arawa, which was torpedoed by the enemy. Luckily,, the bulkhead held, although the propeller was missing and the aft part of the ship was. badly damaged. Oxy-welders had to be engaged to extricate the body of at. least one seaman which was encased in steel. The devastation was indescribable. I said then that if any men were deserving of honour for the part they played in the war, no one was more entitled to it than were the merchant seamen who risked their lives in enemyinfested waters. When the present Government first came into office it had to rely a good deal on the support of two independent members. In 1942 a bill to amend the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act was returned from the Senate with an amendment providing for preference to ex-servicemen. The then Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, agreed to accept the Senate's amendment, provided that merchant seamen were included. Later, the Senate, to its eternal disgrace, refused to accept his suggestion, and as the Government could not rely'on the support of the two independent members in this House, it was not able to give effect to its intention. At that time the Opposition in this chamber was larger than it is now. Honourable members will recall that its ranks were thinned at the last election. That"" process will be carried further when the next appeal is made to the electors.",70
220,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Mr Riordan) I ask the honourable member to discuss the clause before the committee.,70
221,Mr JAMES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Althoug h the seaplane base at Rathmines Bay afforded some protection to shipping, enemy torpedo boats frequently lay off the coast near to Newcastle. That was natural, because from to time ships carrying iron and steel to the rest of Australia sailed from New- castle. There were many sinkings of vessels in that vicinity. I know something of the seamen from that locality,, and I sincerely support this clause which will give to them the right to a war service home.",70
222,Mr SHEEHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Boothby) [8.43] - The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) said that there was .some discrepancy between figures cited by honourable members in giving the number of ships sunk off the Australian coast. I rise to make it clear that the figures cited by ine related only to sinkings off the coast of New South Wales, and did not include naval vessels. In this clause the Government is endeavouring to give effect to its general poiicy of meting out justice to every one. Some twelve months ago I attended a dinner of ex-naval men at which Commander Symonds, of South Australia, paid a great tribute to the members of the merchant navy. He referred particularly to those who had sailed in vessels which traded along the Australian coast, and stated that it was not an uncommon thing for them to suffer from extreme cold and that other risks awaited them beyond the 3-mile limit. I regard Commander Symonds as sufficient authority for saying that these men endured many hardships. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4 to 6 agreed to. Clause 7 (Maximum advance).",71
223,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) | 8.44] - Earlier today I inquired of the Minister whether the increase of the maximum advance to £1,250 would apply to all war service homes constructed for ex-servicemen returning from service in the war which has just ended, and the Minister said that he hoped to be able to let me have a reply later. I now invite him to make a statement on the subject.",71
224,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [8.45] - I indicated earlier to the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) that I thought that the increased maximum would apply to all war service homes erected for men who served in the recent war if they desired it. I have since spoken to the War Service Homes Commissioner, and he assures me that he will have power to make available additional loans up to the extra £300 to servicemen who apply for them.

Debate resumed from the 14th March (vide page 316), on motion by Mr. CALWELLThat the bill be now read a second time.",71
225,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [8.48] - I do not propose to detain the House long in discussing this bill. As the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) explained in his second-reading speech, what is being done in this measure represents, in effect, a tentative arrangement, pending the possibility of. giving effect throughout the British Empire to the general rule of fully independent nationality for husband and wife. It is perhaps of some interest to realise that although the Parliament of Great Britain has been dealing with the problem of nationality as between husband and wife and child for something over a century, we are now aiming in the direction of the state of affairs which existed before Parliament took any action in the matter at all. The common law position before statute law came into operation was, as the Minister pointed out, that marriage had no effect on the nationality of a woman. That is to say, in the event of a British man marrying a German woman, the woman retained her German nationality and the man his British nationality. Then, no doubt, .problems arose as to the nationality of children, and some attention was directed to it with a view to securing something like harmony of nationality within the' boundaries of a family, and the result was that various steps were taken from time to time. Por example, in Australia, the Nationality Act 1920-1930, which honourable members will find in the consolidated volumes, provided, in section 18, that the wife of an alien should be deemed to be an alien. That is, if an Australian woman married a foreigner, she assumed the nationality of her husband. He, being an alien, she became an alien. After that, there were V various discussions, and, in particular, the Hague Convention of 1930, arising from a conference at the Hague on this very important and complex matter, was adopted in Australia by our act of 1936, and, without having any desire to repeat what the Minister said, perhaps I ought to remind honourable gentlemen of the effect of that. For this purpose. I am emitting irrelevant matters. Where a British woman under the act of 1936, marries an alien, she does not cease to be British, unless, by reason of her marriage, she acquires the nationality of her husband. That is the first step. The wife then, assuming she became an alien because of marriage to a foreigner, in the circumstances in which she acquired his nationality, was, so to speak, able to contract out of that state of affairs by making a declaration that she desired to retain while in Australia or in Australian territory, the rights of a British subject. So, the law, as it stands-apart this proposed amendment-in amounts to this, to bring it right home: An Australian marrying an alien in circumstances that would normally make her an alien can make a declaration, and, having made that declaration under the act, retains, while in Australia and Australian territory all the rights of a British citizen and is subject, I may say, to the liabilities of a British citizen. That does not mean, that she remains in fact a British subject; it means that she retains the rights and liabilities of one. Her status as an alien continues, but mitted, by exception from that status, to exercise certain rights and become subject to certain liabilities as if she was a British citizen in Australia. Now, the present bill operates on that state of affairs, and provides, as honourable gentlemen will see, that an Australian woman-and again I am 'taking the example of an Australian woman who at the time of her marriage to an alien was resident in Australia and was a British subject-shall, while in Australia or any Australian territory, be a British subject, or continue to be a British subject, unless she makes a declaration that she desires to retain or acquire the nationality of her husband. Again, I have omitted the words that are not material to the discussion. So what this bill does is to reverse the process. Under Mr Menzies. the existing law, she becomes an alien, unless by making a declaration she reserves to herself certain rights as a British subject while in Australia and Australian territory.",71
226,Dame ENID LYONS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,What is the date of the earlier amendment?,72
227,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"1936 . The act of 1936 was made consequentially upon the Hague Convention of 1930. This bill reverses the process, because it provides, by force of the act itself, that she shall, while in Australia or Australian territory, be a British subject, not merely exercise the rights and be subject to the liabilities of one, unless she declares out. She originally declared in, under the 1936 legislation. She made a declaration as the result of which she retained certaiu Australian rights and obligations. Under this legislation, she retains not only Australian rights but full British citizenship, from unless she declares out-unles s she takes effect, the necessary steps to say, "" I am adopting the nationality of my husband"".",72
228,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,What happens when she goes out of Australia.,72
229,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"This legislation does not affect her position. If , by proper application of the law of Great Britain, or the law of whatever country she goes to, she is taken to be an alien, she will be one; but, while in Australia, or Australian territory, and only then, by force of this legislation, she will be a British she is per- subject for all purposes.",72
230,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"And when she returns from overseas to Australia, she becomes a British subject again? Mr .MENZIES - Yes . Mr CALWBT.L - Unde r existing legislation in the various British dominions, she would be an alien in fact when she left Australia or any Australian territory.",72
231,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes . That is what I was saying. While she is in Australia, now or in the future, she has the full benefit of this legislation unless she contracts out. When she is in another British dominion, the law of that dominion applies. Our law will not change ber status. It will be determined by the general rule that applies. I mention that because it is a few days since the Minister's second-reading speech was made,- and it is perhaps necessary to refresh the minds of honourable gentlemen ou this matter. X. have no quarrel with this proposal. It is a proposal of a kind that I could imagine might be well put forward in auy British dominion. I agree that it is most desirable, when dealing with British nationality, that we should have a nationality law that is the same all over the British Emrpire, because all sorts of intolerable anomalies will otherwise arise. For instance "" AB "" is deemed to be British in one part of the Empire, and foreign in another part. The ultimate objective of the Government is that we should develop all over the British E m p i r e - I understand it to agree with the desirability of uniform law- a system under which we shall not have separate nationalities for husband and wife. know that that is a matter that has attracted a good deal of attention, particularly among women, women's societies and representatives of women. All I want to say for myself is this: there is one word of warning to be offered about it. It is a very simple matter to say that the husband and wife of a marriage shall retain the nationality they had before the marriage. The real problem arises in relation to the children. Under our existing law-and I refer to the .'Nationality Act 1920-1936, section 6the child is British if born in a British country, or on a British ship, and the child is British if born abroad if the father i i British, either by birth or by naturalization, and then, of course, the commonest case of all, the child is British if born of British parents, or if born in British territory. But let me take the case of a child born abroad,, if the father is British and the mother, by reason of some operative law, is not. Under our existing law, that child born abroad of British father, either by birth or by nuturalization. is a British subject.. It may be said, then, that this illustrates some inequality of the .sexes. I feel difficulty in knowing how we are to fix British nationality in the case of a child, if we pay regard to the independent nationality of both parents. Suppose the father is British and the mother French, aie we then to say that the child's nationality depends upon some selection by him at some stage. Under our present law we. say to that child, "" Your father is B r it is h ; you are a British subject. If you do not want to be a British subject you can move off and get nationality in some other country.""",72
232,Dame ENID LYONS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Is it not correct that only the converse could be true, that in all cases at present the woman assumes the nationality of her husband ?",73
233,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Not in all cases, but in a great number of cases; and what I am saying is that if we are to look forward to what is the ideal in this matter we will make a common rule all over the world. Then we have the problem as to how to determine the nationality of a child in the circumstances I have mentioned. A boy, if he inherits the nationI ality of his father, as' he does under existing law, may be said to be B r it is h ; but if his mother's nationality is equal in all respects he may be presented with a completely free choice as to nationality, and some machinery would need to he brought into existence to enable him to make a declaration in that respect. I am not raising this matter because I think that it can be solved in a few minutes' discussion, but in order to suggest that this problem of nationality is not merely a domestic problem. It is in the highest sense an international problem. It may be governed by the rules of all sorts of legal systems.",73
234,Dame ENID LYONS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Is it true that at present under Dutch law a child born outside Dutch territory may at the age of 21 years choose his, or her, nationality?",73
235,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I cannot undertake to answer that question with certainty., but in a number of continental systems there is a provision of that kind.",73
236,Mr CALWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is provided under American law.,73
237,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"And it did exist, a few years ago in the case of various continental countries, but I would not be dogmatic insofar as Dutch law is con1 cerned. What I suggest to the Government is'that this is a matter which cannot be ultimately dealt with by one country. It is a. matter which must ultimately be solved in some - fashion by international consultation. We have had international conferences before. There was the Hague conference to which reference was made; and the Australian representative at sueh a conference is, all too frequently, in the position of being uninstructed as to what, the real Australian view is on the matter. That is no one's fault; conferences arise and some one, a lawyer, represents us at them. This problem is full of technicalities; it is infinitely difficult. I suggest to the Government that with a view to the final clearing up of this matter it would be better to appoint an expert committee representative of all interests including women, because they have a proper interest in this problem, and that that committee should in quite an informal fashion investigate the technicalities so that when the next international conference arises in respect of this matter the view of this country could be put clearly. I am not opposing the bill. I have spoken partly to offer my comments on the problem as 1 understand it and partly to suggest to the Government, because this is not a party matter, that a committee of the kind I have mentioned would do very useful work and we would be enabled to make a really valuable contribution at an international conference at the Hague, or elsewhere, if that suggestion were adopted.",73
238,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [9.5]. - This bill raises an extraordinary problem. Under the measure the proposition is put forward that if a British woman marries an alien she continues to be a British subject, unless she contracts out of bar British nationality, as long as she stays in Australia; but, apparently, the moment she goes outside the 3-mile limit' on a foreign ship she loses her British nationality. Then, when she comes back to Australia from the country where her husband is living she again acquires British nationality. Let us suppose that she possesses property in Australia which she holds under the married women's property legislation as a separate estate and that war breaks out between Australia and the country of which her husband is a national. If she is out of Australia at the time, her property would be seized as the property of an enemy alien. But if that woman escapes and comes back to Australia she is then a British subject and is entitled to hold property in the Commonwealth. Numerous anomalies arise in this matter. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has said, I cannot understand why the Government cannot give British status to such a woman so far as Australia is concerned whether she is outside, or inside, Australia. I cannot understand why she cannot retain her British status even when she is outside Australia. Mr CAIWELL, - That, would raise another problem. So far as Australia is concerned she could hold property as a British subject, but in her husband's Country she would be regarded as an alien.",74
239,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is another problem, although in many foreign countries married women were not permittedto hold separate estates. This matter bristles with difficulties. I repeat that I cannot, see why a woman in the circumstances I have indicated, should not retain her British nationality, whether she is outside or within Australia.",74
240,Mr JAMES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hunter) [9.7] - I did not have the opportunity to hear the second-reading speech of the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell), but I am greatly impressed by the case advanced by the Leader of the Opposition ' (Mr. Menzies). The bill is a step in the right direction. I recall the debate which took place in connection with the amending legislation introduced in 1936. T participated in that debate. Prior ,to that, time a woman automatically assumed the nationality of her husband, and some tragic cases arising under that law came to my notice. I recall the case of an Australian-born woman who, because her husband was an alien, was obliged to take out naturalization papers in order to qualify for a widow's pension. It seemed ridiculous that a woman born in Newcastle, New South Wales, had to apply for naturalization aa a British subject. That is what happened prior to 1936. I am impressed by the case presented by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the nationality of children in the circumstances he mentioned. Again, where an application is made for a transfer, or transmission, of property after death the beneficiaries are obliged to sign a declaration that they are of British origin; otherwise, the property is not transferable to them. Then the - point arises respect to clause 3 which amends section ISA of the act by inserting the following section:18B - (l . ) Notwithstanding anything tained in this Act, every woman who at the time of her marriage to. an alien, whether before or after the commencement of this section, was resident in Australia and a Britisli subject shall, by force of this while in Australia or any Territory(a) if the marriage was celebrated the commencement of this sectionbe a British subject: or - {b) if the marriage is celebrated after the commencement of this sectioncontinue to be a British subject, unless she makes a declaration that she desires to retain or acquire the nationality of husband. She would be deemed to be a British subject unless she declared that she wished Hitler regime. to acquire the nationality of her alien husband. That provision contains elements of danger. The law which applies to the registration of aliens under property acts may be circumvented by people returning to Australia in order people. to claim property under this provision, cause proposed new section 18B contains the vital words "" whether before or after the commencement of this section "". Some of my fears may be unfounded, because I did not hear the Minister's explanation of the bill, but I hope that consideration perience. will be given to my_ suggestions. In past, conferences have examined the tration df aliens, - and I believe that in which operates today. future, conferences should consider subject of nationality, because people move from one country to another, and, as I stated earlier, those who have been debarred from acquiring or disposing of property may, under this provision, be able to dispose of it.",74
241,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Indi) [9.12] - Neithe the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell) nor any honourable member will claim that this small bill represents the attainment of the objective at which .is aimed. It does no more than place on a. fairer basis the rights and status of certain women who, under the existing legislation, have had no opportunity retain their British ' rights while they have been within the Australian jurisdiction. [27]",75
242,Mr CALWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They are not able to with divest themselves of alienage.,75
243,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Exactly ! I administered the nationality laws of the Commonwealth for two years immediately after conthe existing act became operative, and 1 know from experience the anomalies, dif-. Acuities and hardships which have beset was many women because of these big probsection, lems. They do not confront most of us, but those who. are brought face to face before with them know that they can occur in - a most unexpected form and cause acute hardship. There are in the world today countless thousands of people who ' - are regarded as stateless, and who, voluntarily or perforce, have been obliged to her leave their country which subsequently lost entirely or in part its own autonomy. Some people left Austria before it was incorporated in Germany under the They left Austria with an Austrian nationality. They the did 'not acquire nationality when the amalgamation of Austria and Germany'took place, and for purposes of nationality they are regarded as stateless That is the experience of bethousands of people who left the continent of Europe to live in other countries, and they are beset with extraordinary personal and legal difficulties in the country in which they are living. Many women in^ Australia have had that exThe Lyons Government the grappled with the problem in 1936, and regisintroduced the ameliorative proposal The present the Government proposes to go one step further by formalizing the status of these people. The whole purpose, of course, is to help the people concerned in regard to their rights of citizenship, but it occurs to me that citizenship involves obligations as well as rights. The obligations of citizenship under such a condition of r affairs as this are not so easily dealt with- I admit also that the rights are not easily dealt - with-becaus e there will be a class of people whose nationality will it alter as they move from country - to country. The primary obligation which accompanies the rights of nationality is the obligation of loyalty to one's to nationality, and how any government can fairly and equitably interpret loyalties in respect of the obligation of a man who changes his nationality nearly as often rabbits .pop in and out of a burrow, one can ever explain.or understand.

On such occathe sions, how the obligations of loyalty of - such a man who changes his nationality today and resumes his original nationposition. ality next month I do not pretend to understand.",75
244,Mr MULCAHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Alie n women should be more careful in the selection of husbands.,76
245,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I leave it for honourable member for Lang (Mr. Mulcahy) to propound that doctrine. do not oppose the bill, '.because i designed to take another step to help certain class of people of our own nationality who, almost without excepcall tion, were born in this country. But associate myself with the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) that this bill should be regarded as no more than a patchwork, and an endeavour should be made to regularize the whole business. It appears to me the United Nations, through the Ecofurther nomic and Social Council, provides best venue for discussing such a difficult problem. It can be resolved only when a great degree of unanimity, is achieved between the nations as to the manner which this matter should be treated. it would be unsatisfactory and almost ludicrous for one member of. the British Empire to invoke the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations deal with the problem if British munities themselves have not been able to reach an agreement upon it. The vernment should take an early opportunity to confer with other members the British Commonwealth of Nations with a view to seeing whether they can agree among themselves on some formula to achieve unanimity. . When that has been done, they can approach the nomic and Social Council to see whether the matter can be carried to its ultimate objective - of Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [9.18]. - I warmly support the bill. I realise the difficulties that are inherent in measure of this description, but I conto as gratulate the Minister for Immigration no (Mr Calwell) upon having adopted the t rather feminine attitude of looking across the difficulties at the possibilities. Having on had the experience of the act which is now in operation, we know enough of difficulties to he able for the moment . to set them aside, and make this beginning towards a further clarification of the I entirely agree with the honourable member for Indi and the Leader of tile Opposition (Mr Menzies) that these difficulties should be thoroughly weighed, their and judgment passed upon them so that when we do go into conference with other the nations, particularly members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we I shall have something really constructive t is and feasible to put before them. This a matter of course has been raised on many occasions at Imperial Conferences. I rethat it was a subject for discussion at I the 1935 Imperial Conference, but little progress was made. However, on this occasion I believe that the Minister for Immigration has done a distinct service to the cause of'preserving to women the rights of nationality, and I hope that that through consultations and conferences progress will be sponsored from the this part of the world.",76
246,Mr CALWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for'Information) [9.21] - in reply- I thank the in House for the reception it has given to But this measure. At least the bill proves that the age of chivalry has not yet passed, ft proves too, that honourable members in the Parliament are prepared to conto cede to the women of Australia some of comthat equality of rights about which we talk quite a lot, but at times do very little. GoAs the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has said, this subof ject has been discussed at a number of Imperial Conferences. It was not possible at any of those conferences to secure complete unanimity of opinion, and the best that could be done with the proposal Ecothat women should not surrender their British nationality upon marriage to an alien inside the British Commonwealth Nations was the compromise to which the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) has referred, giving to each a Dominion that elected to do so, the right pass legislation conferring the rights and privileges and also .imposing the obligations of British citizenship upon women who, after having married aliens, made application to the appropriate authority in the dominions for the retention of those rights. It was of course provided, necessarily, that the exercise of any such rights and the acceptance of any such obligations could only exist while the person concerned remained a citizen of the dominions that passed the legislation. The Dominion.of South Africa has not yet passed the legislation which the honourable member for Indi said this Parliament passed whilst he was Minister for the Interior. Speaking from memory, only New Zealand and Australia have passed the legislation. We have dealt with the problem in two ways. First there is the international aspect which is covered by the Hague Convention, and then there is the practice obtaining within the British Commonwealth of Nations which, is determined from time to time by agreement at Imperial conferences. South Africa holds the view' which has obtained from about 1870 onwards in the British statutes followingthe abandonment of common law practices, that a woman loses her nationality on marriage. This Government believes that it is important that we should go much further than has so far been attempted within the British Commonwealth, and I confess that what is proposed in this measure has not been a' matter of agreement at any Imperial Conference. We propose to pass this legislation and to bring it into operation by proclamation. We shall then say to the British Dominions that we think that they should pass the same or similar legislation, and should not offer any objection to this particular piece of legislation. However, the subject-matter of this bill and other questions of nationality are likely to come before an Imperial Conference at an early date. In October last year, the Canadian Parliament introduced legislation which goes even farther than thatwhich we .are now discussing. It propoees to establish Canadian citizenship which will be the paramount consideration for persons residing in Canada. No person can be a Canadian citizen unless he or she is a British national, but under the Canadian legislation the emphasis will be placed on citizenship within the Dominion of Canada. That far-reaching measure has evoked a request from the Dominions Office in Great Britain that the whole subject be referred to an Imperial Conference at an early date. According to a cablegram that arrived from the British Dominions Office on the 26th March, that conference will be held at Paris in June, at the conclusion of the Peace Conference. 1 believe that at that conference a much more liberal view- I do not mean in the party sense but in the true and proper sense of the word-wil l be taken of this question of nationality than has heretofore prevailed. It is true, as the honourable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) has said, that many problems are associated with this question. If we leave - the question alone we shall leave many problems unsettled; if we pass this legislation we shall. create a few more problems; but I believe that the general opinion will be that if we pass this measure we shall be dealing with women much more fairly than in the past.",76
247,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,And we hope to deal with them better still.,77
248,Mr CALWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Precisely , and I trust that after the Imperial Conference takes place we shall have further amending legislation introduced into this Parliament which will give not only to women who reside in Australia, but also to Australian women who go abroad, the right to retain British citizenship upon marriage to aliens. Their right to British nationality because of their birth within the British Commonwealth of Nations should be inalienable. That is the basis of this Government's views. Australian wives of Americans who go to the United States do so as British citizens, and remain British citizens unless, by their own overt act, they decide to become American citizens. The United States of America has faced up to the problem mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition of' the nationality of children born of an American father and a non-American mother in a realistic fashion. A child born ofAmerican parents, outside, the United States of America can only be an American citizen if , at the age of 21, - he or she opts to become an American, and a child of an American father and a non-American mother has the same right to opt to he an American citizen, has the child of two American parents."" A child of an American father and a non-American mother born in the United States of America is a citizen of United States of America. Other counthe tries, too, have adopted a policy similar to that of the United States of America. Inside the British Commonwealth of Nations, Eire has passed legislation to give effect to that policy. In Soviet Russia, and in a number of South debate; report adopted. American countries, the same rule obtains. Eventually, I suppose, at a convention at the Hague or elsewhere., the principle will win universal acceptance, as I believe it should. In the concluding passages of his speech, the Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Government should give conleave- I movesideration to his proposal that an expert committee be appointed to discuss with discharged:the Government the problems dealt with by this legislation. I accept the suggestion, and as I have no doubt there are people interested in this legislation the officers of my department will meet their representatives and ascertain their views on it. I am sure their views will be freely given and that they will also be of great value. When the report comes back from the Imperial Conference we might find that this legislation can be extended as *- No. honourable members would desire, it to be » extended, and that other dominions will be found to be willing to recognize, in their territories, the British citizenship which we confer on Australian women by this bill. There is little more that I can add except to draw attention to the fact that divided sovereignty in Australia cf itself creates 'difficulties. Some State laws permit an unnaturalized subject to hold land while others forbid it. Before 1937, when legislation was passed following upon the Imperial Conference of 1935 which gave the limited right we now propose to extend to women, it was possible for an Australian-born woman, because she was the wife of an alien, to have no right to hold property in Queensland but to be able to hold property in her own right in Victoria. The act of 1937 did, to some Mr Cahoell. degree, correct that absurd and grotesque anomaly. I have no doubt that this bill as will have a speedy passage through this House and through the Senate. After its passage through both Houses of the Parliament the. Government will take action the on the proposal of the Leader of Opposition for the convening of a conference of those interested so that we may obtain the benefit of their views. - Question resolved in the affirmative.

250,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer move That the House do now adjourn. En view of the excellent progress made in the consideration .of legislation placed before this chamber during the past week, it is not proposed, after we adjourn tomorrow, to call the House together again until Wednesday of next week, Circular when the Constitution bills will be discussed.

251,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [9.35]. sentative - I desire to bring before the House a matter which gravely reflects upon the given administration of .the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. From the Flour) evidence which I shall bring before of honourable members it appears that the chicks. Minister has given preference to the manufacturers of dog biscuits, primarily used to feed racing greyhounds, over the needs of the people of Great Britain and Europe and the starving millions in the India. As I shall show, this preference has been given, not only to the detriment of our export obligations, but also at the expense of the Australian poultry farmer cerned and bacon producer and at a price which in sacrifices the interests of the wheat farmer. The unfortunate position of the people of Great Britain , and of India where famine stalks the land, is only too well known to honourable members. remind them,"" however, particularly those representing dairying' and poultry farming districts, of the acute shortage mill offals, for feeding poultry for acute is-this shortage that many production of eggs and pig products. So men have had to go out of production and pig fatteners have ceased operations. In the New England electorate, particularly in the Tamworth area, which pro-, d-uces one-twelfth of the total egg production of New South Wales, poultry farmers have had to slaughter their flocks because of the shortage of mill offals for feed. Yet, at this very time, the Minister chooses to cut down their already restricted, feed supplies, thus further INDUSTRY: reducing production. In support of these very grave charges, I produce a circular dated the 11th February,- 1946, which was addressed by the New South Wales State Superintendent of the Australian [9.34] - I Wheat Board to millers, wheat distributors and others concerned. The circular reads as follows:AUSTRALIAN WHEAT BOARD. Bank of N.S.W. Chambers, 16-18 O'Connell Street, Sydney. 11th February, 1940. to Millers, MA./40 Wheat Distributors and Others Concerned. Dear Sir/s: NA LIVESTOCK'.. For some months past, acting on the advice of the Wheat Allocation Committee, repreof Federal and State Department of Agriculture, instructions have beenclearly to all concerned that Wheat and Wheat products (other than bran and pollard manufactured from the gristing of Wheat into may only be supplied to the priority livestock, pigs and laying hens and pullet The fact that these' instructions must be taken literally and that Flour or Wheat and Wheatmeals must not be supplied for feeding any stock other than that specified and underlined above, has been 'emphasized on all occasions, but nevertheless reports have reached Board that some Millers and others have been supplying Wheat products for other stock including ithe manufacture of dog biscuits. This advice is therefore given to all conthat a serious view will be taken of any future departure from the instructions this regard and that offenders will be liable to have supplies of Wheat discontinued. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) G-. A. H. HOLBOROW, State Superintendent. 1 I direct particular attention to the first paragraph of the. circular, which readsFor some month* past, acting on the advice of of the Wheat Aliocation Committee, reprethe sentative of Federal and State Departments of Agriculture, instructions have been clearly poultry given to all concerned . . . The State Superintendent, acting on the advice of his technical officers, issued a very stern warning to everybody who had been using wheat for the purpose of making dog biscuits, that if they continued this practice it was likely that their supplies of wheat would be cut off. In a time of acute shortage like the present, it was a practice which the State Superintendent refused to countenance. Doubtless he had the support of the Australian Wheat Board. Those orders should be enforced, and not be subject to external interference. I want the House to note particularly tihe date of the circularthe. 11th February, 1946. The order was enforced, and no wheat was supplied to dog. biscuit manufacturers for the purpose of making dog biscuits, up to the 4th March, 1946. In the interval, something must have happened. Very strong representations must have been made to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to induce him to act as he did. Had the Minister been in the chamber, I would have put it to him that during that period he must have met representatives of the dog biscuit manufacturers, 'and' that the outcome of the meeting was a circular issued by the same State Superintendent, Colonel G. A. H. Holborow, to millers, which readAUSTRALIA N WHEA T BOARD. CIRCULAR TO MILLERS NO . H.8/46. DOG BISCUITS. Dear Sirs, W i th reference to Circular H.4/46 we have now to advise that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has made available 50,000 bushels of wheat for the manufacture of dog biscuits from 1st March to the end of the present ration period. The price of the wheat will be 4s. l i d . per bushel Sydney bulk basis and is not to be confused with the allocations made for feeding priority livestock. The wheat will be allotted on a .percentage basis of the quantity used by millers for dog biscuit-meal between 1st March and 30th November, 1944. If you. are interested in this trade, please fill in replies to questions hereunder and return by first mail. As the allocations must be made as quickly as possible replies must reach this office by Friday 8th inst.. otherwise they must be excluded. Yours faithfully , (Sgd.) G. A. H . HOLBOROW, Mr Abbott. Honourable members should contrast that circular with the first circular, which stated that wheat supplies would be cut off from millers if they used wheat for the purpose of making dog biscuits-which , I understand, are largely used for the feeding of racing greyhounds. In his circular of. the 11th February, the State Superintendent saidActing on the advice of the Wheat Allocation Committee, representative of Federal and State Departments of Agriculture, instructions have been clearly given . . . Only three weeks later, he had to issue another circular, in which he saidWe have now to advise that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has made available 50,000 bushels of wheat for the manufacture of dog biscuits from 1st March to the end of the present ration period. No mention was made in that circular of the Wheat Allocation Committee which is representative of the State and Commonwealth Departments of Agriculture. Apparently, the Minister had completely overriden his technical advisers in having made this quantity of wheat available for the purpose of making biscuits for racing greyhounds. Unless he had unimpeachable justification for doing so, the Minister should not have overriden the Australian Wheat Board, which had the support of its - technical advisers. Had he been here, I would have asked him what justification 16-18 O'Oonnell-atreei, he had for overriding his tenhnical adSydney, 4th March, 1946. visers. I point out to honourable members that 50,000 bushels is not a mere bagatelle, but is equivalent to 1,000 tons of flour and 300 tons of pollard and bran. This latter, if fed to poultry, would result' in the production of many thousand dozen eggs, which could be used to feed starving people overseas; and the 1,000 tons of flour, if placed on the Indian market, would have a very good effect. I also direct attention to the price at which this generous Minister graciously offered the farmers' wheat to the owners of racing greyhounds. The circular statedThe price of the wheat will be 4a. l i d . per bushel, Sydney bulk basis. On the 27th M a r c h , I asked this question, upon notice What price or prices are at present being charged by the Australian Wheat Board f.o.b. for wheat for export, or for the manufacture State Superintendent. of flour for export, bagged basis? ' The reply of this generous Minister was that the export price was 10s. 4£d. a bushel, trucks port basis. This means that the wheat-farmer, through the generosity of the Minister, has made a compulsory gift to the dog biscuit manufacturers of approximately £12,500. What representations were - made to the Minister which caused him to divert this quantity of wheat? By whom, were they made? What claims did the dog biscuit manufacturers advance which could be considered superior to those that I have mentioned, namely, those of the hungry people of Great Britain and the starving millions of India ? These 'charges are so grave that they demand the fullest reply from the Minister. It is essential that he shall reply on the facts as I have stated them. No other course is open to me than to charge him with having placed racing greyhounds before the starving humans of Great Britain and Europe. If this is the sort of administration for which the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is responsible, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) should investigate the matter.",79
252,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"Barker) [9.49] - I am somewhat intrigued by information that I have received fromSouth Australia in regard to the petrol position in that State. It appears that some action has been taken by the Garage' . Owners Association to approach the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley), who is not in this chamber or this city; therefore, I would appreciate it very much if, before the adjournment tomorrow afternoon, the Minister representing that honourable gentleman in this chamber can assure me as to whether there are any grounds for the belief that is held at Mount Gambier and - other places that there is likely to be a shortage of petrol, or, alternatively, whether the Liquid Fuel Control Board in South Australia is likely to embark shortly on a new petrol policy, the possibility of which is causing a certain degree of confusion, and, at the very least} concern, in country districts. The matter could be cleared up by the Government in 24 hours.",81
253,Mr CHIFLEY,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,May the Minister concerned have the information now?,81
254,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"Yes . I have no details in writing, but I can convey the information to him verbally. For some time a request has been made by means of correspondence and interviews for certain action to be taken at Buck's Bay, in my electorate, in the interests of fishermen. This bay has a beautiful natural breakwater, and the local fishermen are engaged in the sharkfishing industry, which has developed to a considerable degree on the South Australian coast. They need improved harbour facilities for their craft, and these could be provided by blasting a hole in - the reef at Buck's Bay. The Minister concerned knows that this matter is of interest to a large number of ex-service- ' men, but his last communication to me was that they had better get in touch ' with the Navy or Army authorities, with a view to obtaining explosives with 'which to do the job themselves. Although men may have served in the defence forces, they are not necessarily qualified to use a large quantity of explosives in order to blast a hole in a reef. The Government should take up the matter as a post-war work. It could not safely be left to local residents. The government departments concerned could complete the job at an early date. I have letters from Melbourne firms which are prepared to purchase certain products of the sharkfishing industry. The matter should be regarded more as one of Government policy than a question whether one department or another has explosives to spare.",81
255,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"Indi) [9.54] - The honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) has raised a matter which is not to be mistaken as a mere criticism of one of the many acts of government administration which will call for comment, but as one of first-class consequence. I feel sure that it will not be regarded by the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) nor the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully), as one which can be disregarded, but will be recognized as one of serious import, upon which some explanation is called for, if, indeed, a satisfactory one can be devised. We all know that Australia has not sufficient wheat at present to meet the demands for human .requirements. The strongest representations have 'been made to it from the headbe quarters of Unrra, and from various governments overseas, that we should exercise, to the most extreme degree, in allocating wheat for stock feed, and to the limit in making every'bushel can possibly spare available for export abroad for human consumption. For many months past we have read in the daily press that in the next year or two the most critical food shortage modern times will be experienced. reads daily in the newspapers authoriwould tative statements to the effect that millions of people are condemned to starvation within a measurable period of time. In that atmosphere, and in those circumstances, these appeals have been made to the Government to restrict, far as possible, the use of wheat for stock feed and other purposes, and to make it available for human consumption. The Minister for - Commerce and Agriculture himself in the last couple of weeks has explained the position to the House, and has capped his remarks by saying what we recognize with some pride, that, upon a close examination of the position, as a result of these desperate appeals from overseas, another 5,000,000 bushels of wheat have been subtracted from quantity previously set aside for feed in Australia, and will be exported human use. I have not the slightest doubt that that was the cause of warning circular sent out by the State Superintendent of the Australian Wheat Board in Sydney, pointing out' to to millers that they were not perthe mitted to supply wheat intended ' to be used for dog' biscuits. The warnexport. ing was .given that if it were covered that wheat was allocated by for this purpose their whole . supplies might be cut of f . But three weeks another circular was addressed to the millers by the Australian Wheat Board. The honourable member for New England read its exact terms. It stated clearly, on the authority of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, that millers were now advised that 50,000 bushels of wheat were to be set aside for the manudogs, facture of dog biscuits. That meant that 50,000 bushels of wheat which had been hypothecated for human consumption was, on the direction of the Minister, to Mr MCEwen. .withdrawn and used for the manufacture of dog biscuits. Surely this is not something that can be lightly brushed care aside. An explanation is demanded. The go - matter raises some interesting points. we The honourable member for New England put his finger on one when he said that wheat which had been allotted for export at 10s. 4fd. a bushel would now, by direction of the Minister for Commerce and in Agriculture, be fed to dogs in the One form of biscuits and the growers be paid only 4s. l i d . a bushel for it. This, on the quantity involved, die of would represent a loss of £12,500. For many years, the wheat-growers, who have had as bad a time as any other section, have been agitating for control of 'as the' product of their labour. Governments with which I was associated were charged by the Labour party with setting up boards which were not controlled by the growers, and the Labour party gained so many thousands of votes by promising that if it were returned to power it would establish boards on which growers' representatives would be in a majority. There and is, in fact, now an Australian Wheat Board upon which the growers representatives are in a majority, but the that board is no .longer permitted stock to decide how the wheat shall be for disposed of. It is the. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture who decides the how much shall be exported and how much held in Australia. The board cannot say how much wheat shall be allotted power alcohol distilleries, or whether wheat is to be sold at a low price for use in Australia or at a high price for The Australian Wheat Board is disno more than a ghost institution. them. It has an office but it has no authority. The Labour party honoured later its promise by appointing to the same board a majority of growers'- representatives, but it destroyed the value of this concession by taking away from the board all effective authority. The board cannot determine whether wheat shall be sent to the .starving people abroad, or whether it shall be used to feed probably racing dogs. I am a man who earns his living with the valuable aid of sheep"" clogs, but I have never seen a working clog fed with dog biscuits. These biscuits are fed to poodles, lap dogs' and racing dogs. This matter must be dos<.y examined, and an explanation : given to the people and to the Parliament.",81
256,Mr ADERMANN,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"Maranoa) [10.5]. - During the last eighteen months, I have repeatedly stressed the need for Go\ eminent assistance to the tobacco-growing industry in Australia if the industry is to he saved. To-day, the industry needs Government help, or it will go out of existence. Por some time past the Government has been conducting an inquiry through the Director-General of Agriculture, Mr Bulcock, into conditions in the industry, as a result of which the Government paid a 10 per cent, subsidy en. realization in order to assist the growers. Since the Government has had control of marketing and the system of Season. produced 1939-40 4,911,630 1940-41 1941-42 1942-43 3,948,141 1943-44 3,759,675 ZONE 2 - SOUTH-WES T 1939-40 1940-41 1 9 + l ^ t2 1,938,946 . 1942-43 88S,955 1943-44 810,191 As I have said, the Government granted a 10 per cent, subsidy in addition to the 45 per cent, increase, and that is the only addition which has resulted in an actual increase of income to the grower, because that did not come into conflict with the interests of the tobacco combine. ""When the first increase of 25 per cent, was given, the grading list was revised and some of the lower grades were eliminated. Thus, the growers had less tobacco to send, and actually received less money, while the combine benefited by getting tobacco of a better quality at the same average price. Each year, as the increase was made by the Government, so the grading became stricter. The combine declares that the quality of Australian grown tobacco has deteriorated. Tobacco [28] appraisals has been in operation, the percentage increases have-been liberal, and I have no quarrel on that point. In 1941-42, the Government increased payments by 10 per cent., and in the following year by another 10 per cent. It had previously increased payments by 25 per cent., so that the total increase represented 45 per cent. The point is, however,' that although prices were increased by 45 per cent., growers did not obtain any financial benefit as a result. That is my quarrel with the system, and in this the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) agrees with me. The following table illustrates how the system has worked out so far as the growers are concerned:Percentage Quantity increase Price hart full Price Percentage allowed by increase been received. decrease in lb. Federal received. in price. Government. lb. 0/ d. d. 0/ Nloi l 24.6 /o 4,610,416 6,753,354 25 30.75 29.06 i'.2 10* 33.82 29.9 11.0 10* 36.89 30.86 16.3 Nil 36.89 28.87 21.87 QUEENSLAND AND NORTHEBN NEW SOUTH WALES. l b. °/ la d. d. 0/ /o t 1,192,500 Nil 25 29! 53 23.03 28.6 3.15 10* 32.48 2 9 . 4- 9.48 10* 35.43 30.03 15.24 Nil 35.43 "" 29.56 16.56 * On 1040-41. t No llgurc available. is grown in Australia in four zonesnorthern Queensland, southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. Would any honourable member suggest that, over a period of years, the grade would automatically decline in each of those four zones, so that the average payment would remain the same? Is it suggested that, after twelve or fifteen years' experience, the growers have not learned something about tobacGO-growing, and that their product would not improve in quality, rather than deteriorate? I was told that the tobacco combine said that it would not buy . Australian tobacco unless it was graded by the.combine's own appraisers. In theory the grading is done by a representative of the combine, a' representative of the growers, and a representative of the department, but in practice the combine's representative gives his verdict, which generally prevails. The stage has been reached when the Government must act. The question to be decided is whether the combine or the Government is to control the industry. If the present conditions are maintained the industry will be driven out of existence. If it be contended that the combine is justified in having its own appraiser I retort that the growers have an equal right to say that they will not sell their product unless they have their own appraiser. That would cause a strike. Commonwealth graders appraise wool and butter, and the producers of those commodities do not object. They realise that that is the only fair system. In the first year of appraisement the quantity of tobacco grown in Australia totalled 0,900,000 lb. In 1944-45 it fell to 2,500,000 lb., and the estimate for this year is about the same. ""When I visited the Texas district about 2 years ago I found that tobacco was being grown on nearly every farm along the river road. Recently I visited the same district again, and I saw tobacco growing on only two of those 'blocks. I saw costly barns .and treating plants lying idle. The Government must decide whether or not Australia intends to retain this industry. When that question was put to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, he replied strongly in the affirmative, and I believe every honourable member would echo his reply, because Australia needs all the industries that can be established here. The subsidy paid to the combine amounts to £750,000 annually: the profits made by the combine amount to £960,000. It pays dividends every Last year, £753,000 was paid by way of subsidy, and the profits of the combine remained about the same as before and the dividends were continued. The combine is protected against rising and falling prices. I admit that it was necessary to regulate prices in war-time, but the combine has had a fair deal, whereas growers' costs have increased immeasurably during recent years and yet they have had no offset in price. Many growers have been driven off the land. Mr Adermann. The table of limits means nothing to the tobacco combine, because the appraisement systematically declines as the table of limits is revised. By the courtesy of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I was able to attend a tobacco conference recently in Sydney. I was unable to remain to the end of the conference because of my parliamentary duties here, but I learned that the conference broke down because the growers stood out for an average price of 3s. per lb. I endorse that demand. The Minister admitted to me that that was a fair request. The solution of this trouble is for the Government to appoint independent appraisers"" so that the growers may know that when a table of limits is decided on it will be faithfully .observed. I see no other way cf saving the industry.",83
257,Mr CHIFLEY,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.8] - in reply-The . matters raised by the honourable member for . Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) will be given attention. I understand that the honourable member will furnish some information regarding the petrol position in South Australia to the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping, who will look into the, matter. His remarks invrelation to Buck's Bay also will be given careful consideration. The honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) charged - the Government with having permitted 50,000 bushels of wheat to be made into dog biscuits, despite the fact that three weeks previously millers were warned not to use wheat for that purpose. It is contended that wheat was sold at 4s. l i d . a. bushel instead of at a higher price. I do not know the facts of the case but quarter. I shall arrange to have the matter examined. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) is absent today attending a wheat conference. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) has again referred to the tobacco industry. I recollect that this matter was raised by him when he introduced a deputation to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture some time ago. I understand that his charge is that because appraisers have adopted a certain practice, the substantially increased subsidy by the Government does not benefit the growers. That subsidy had been a matter of contention for many years. The subsidy was paid because otherwise the cost of tobacco to the consumer would have been substantially increased, as during the war the price of imported tobacco almost trebled. The subsidy was based on the lower dividend as . compared with the dividend paid before the war. I understand that the honourable gentleman requests the appointment of government appraisers so that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Limited and other tobacco companies, but particularly the former, because it processes the bulk of tobacco sold on the Australian market, shall be required to pay for Australian leaf prices determined } by a government appraiser, f shall certainly discuss that with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. There certainly seems to be some reason for the honourable gentleman's request, if, as he says, that principle' has been applied to other industries. Question resolved in the affirmative.

SUITING MATERIAL S : EXPORT.",85
261,Mr ABBOTT,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"the Act in g Minister for T r a d e and Customs, upon not i c e 1. Is there a shortage of suiting materials, particularly with regard to the requirements of ex-soldiers? 2. Is it a fact that all supplies of worsteds in New South Wales fro m the Yarra Falls Company Limited have been cut off from the local market? 3. Is it a fact that the Yarra Falls Cohipany Limited is controlled by what is known as the "" Collins House Group"" ? 4. Is it a fact that this powerful company is being given preferential treatment in the issue of export licences by the Minister? 5. Is it a fact that by selling in the export market this company obtains an extra profit of at least 2s. 6d. a square yard over the home market?",86
262,Mr DEDMAN,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"The . answers to the honourable member's questions follows:1. There is a shortage of suiting materials of the worsted variety which is the type mainly preferred by Australian men. The supply position in regard to tweeds and woollens is much better and in excess of local demand. Such shortages as exist of worsted suitings is due almost solely to the inability of textile mills to attract female labour. The requirements of ex-soldiefs arc catered for by an arrangement made between the Government and the Federal Retailers Association, whereby the latter body agreed to give preference to discharged personnel for one suit, two fashion shirts, one pair of shoes and one hat. If this agreement is f a it h f u l ly applied, then servicemen should have no difficulty in obtaining a suit within a reasonable period of their discharge. 2. Although Yarra Falls Company Limited have recently transferred their agency from Hooper and Harrison to other Sydney distributors, New South Wales is still receiving the same percentage of the factory's total output which is allocated to the Australian market. Whilst the Commonwealth has no control over distribution, steps have been taken which should enable the previous recipients of Yarra Falls cloth through Hooper and Harrison to secure their previous quota through the present distributors. 3. Yarra Falls Company is a limited liabilitycompany. Details of the persons holding shares in it are available from the RegistrarGeneral's Office, Melbourne. I have no information as to how the company is controlled. 4. I have not given any instructions on the lines suggested nor have my responsible officers any knowledge of any such preference having been given. If , however, information be supplied to substantiate the suggestion contained in the question, the matter will be full y investigated 5. No. FOODSHIPS FOR INDONESIA .",86

W i ll he, after reading this item, suggest to all organizations of ex-servicemen that copies should be printed for distribution to all their members? are as Mr CHIKLKV - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1.

RE-ESTABLISHMENT : MALARIAL EX - SERVICEM EN .",86
264,Mr CHIFLEY,WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS FOR FEEDING,"Yes t e r d a y the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) asked the following question :Wil] the Prime Minister state, whether ex-servicemen who contracted' malaria are prohibited from obtaining positions in the Public Service? Is it a fact that malaria cases are not accepted as pensionable by the Repatriation Commission? If so, wil l the right honourable gentleman explain why ex-servicemen who contracted malaria in the execution of their duty are penalized by being prevented from obtaining positions in the Public Service? The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : No. The fact of having contracted malaria does not itself prohibit appointmeiyt to the Commonwealth Public Service. AU appointees must pass a medical examination, but there is provision in the Public Service Act for the admission of servicemen who do not reach the health standard required of other entrants. War pensions are granted in respect of incapacity arising from malaria in the same manner as incapacity arising from any other disability.",86
