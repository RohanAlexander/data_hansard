1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wide Bay!, who is the deputy leader of low:the Labour Party, is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday to the have stated, at a meeting held at Hurst245 ville on Saturday, thatThe people should have the right to veto laws that might be challenged by a large maruary. jority. In view of that statement, can the Prime intended Minister see his way to postpone sideration of the trade union label provisions of the Trade Marks B i ll until after the general election?",12
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have not seen the report, and do not know whether it rectly lepresents what the honourable member said; but, when I see it, shall pay the same careful regard to it that the able member has given. [196]- 2 PRIVA TE MAIL BAGS.",12
3,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,Can the Postmaster-General see his way to reduce the cost of delivering private mail bags throughout the Commonwealth?,12
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"-The question is now engaging the attention of the Department, and I hope to have some definite information on the subject in the course of two or three weeks. BUREAUX TELEPHONES.",12
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I understand that there are at least two kinds of telephone used in thu public bureaux, and that in using one kind 3d. must be placed in the slot before the bell is rung; while, if that is done in using the other kind, another 3d. must be paid after the exchange has been called, so that the public is frequently victimized. Will the Postmaster-General cause an inquiry to be instituted as to the practicability of making the system uniform?",12
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I shall be very pleased to do so. The. Department has no desire to make any person pay twice. IMPORTATIO N OF HARVESTERS .,12
7,Mr RONALD,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that there are shipments of harvesters on the sea which will supply the Australian market for years? 2. If so, are we not in imminent danger of in the hands of ah importers' monopoly so soon as the local machine has disappeared? 3. What action does he propose to take to deal with this matter?",12
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. No. reliable information is available as to quantities of harvesters coming forward, but harvesters are now being landed in Melbourne. Records of the last two years show that the heaviest importations are in the months any of November, December, January, and Feb2 and 3. Several proposals are being examined to meet such dangers. The decision of the Government upon them will be made public the conas soon as possible. TRADE MARKS BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed corfrom 14th November, vide page 5115): Clause 3- This Act is divided as follows :- . . . . honorFait VII - Trad e Union Marks. Amendment (by Mr ISAACS) again proposed - That the words ""Trade Union Marks"" be l e ft out.",12
9,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," I think that it would be more convenient, and might conthere duce to expedition, to postpone this clause, and have the general debate on the trade union label provisions, either in connection with the definition clause, or later on.",13
10,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I suggested that course of at an early stage of the debate, but some looks to him for guidance. honourable members would not agree to it. Amendment agreed to.",13
11,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - The clause having been amended, canever, not now be postponed; but I do not intend to ask the Committee to insert at this stage any words in place of those which have been left out. I .desire that the clause may be agreed to as it stands, with a view to its recommittal later on. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 4In this Act, except where tended"" The Court"" means the High Court Supreme Court of the State in which the Trade Marks Office is situate a Justice or Judge thereof. "" The Law Officer"" means the Attorney-General or Crown Solicitor of the monwealth. Person "" and ""Applicant"" include corporate and firm. "" The Register "" means the Register of Trade Marks under this Act. "" The Registrar"" means the Registrar Trade Marks. -"" State Trade Marks Act "" means Act relating to the Registration of Trade Marks. -"" This Act "" includes all regulations thereunder.",13
12,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," There are two - or three matters to which I should like draw attention in connection with this clause. In the first place, I would point out that the word ""court"" is defined to meanThe High Court or the Supreme Court of the State in which the Trade Marks Office is situate. That definition confines appeals to the High Court and to the Supreme Court of the State in which the Trade Marks Office is, which is the State where the Seat vernment is. Therefore, an appeal from a decision of the Registrar in Western Australia would have to be made either to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of Victoria.",13
13,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I think that the definition had better remain as it is.,13
14,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I shall not move any amendment in that part of the definition at the present time - I think, however, that should be inserted in this clause a definition, which, for a reason which has not been explained, has been omitted. The Minister in charge of a Bill should be perfectly candid as regards the scope the measure. The Committee If a definition which appears in the English legislation, upon which this Bill is professedly based, has been left out, we should be told why it has been left out. I find, howthat a definition which appeared in Mr, Moulton's Bill of 1904, which was largely drawn upon by the draftsman of this measure, and has been enacted in the Act which comes into operation on the ist April, 1906, does not appear in the Bill. If that definition had been adopted by the draftsman, the trade union label provisions could not come within the scope of the measure, so that it appears to me that the omission was otherwise clearly indeliberate. Mt. ISAACS - Was the definition in the or the Bill introduced by the Watson Adminisor tration? That Bill did not contain the trade union label provisions.",13
15,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I do not say that the AtComtorney-General is responsible for the omisa body sion. He was not the draftsman of the measure.,13
16,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"As there was then no inof tention to insert the trade union label provisions, the omission could not have been any State made for the .purpose suggested.",13
17,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am merely pointing out made that the draftsman has deliberately omitted a definition which appears in the English legislation, and I assume that, being a man to of ability, he knew what he was doing. As the Bill professedly .follows the English legislation on the subject, the significance of the definition to which I refer must have been known. It is somewhat curious, therefore, seeing That it would have involved a' limitation of the scope of the measure, which would have excluded the trade union label provisions, that it has been left out. I do not say who is to blame. I merely mention the fact and leave honourable memof Gobers to draw their own conclusions. ?",13
18,Mr MOCAY,Unknown,The attention of the Committee has not been drawn to the omission.,13
19,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not remember that the Attorney-General mentionecT this omission from the Bill. Perhaps it would! be as well to remind honourable members of the real object of trade marks, because that question will affect the constitutionality of this Bill, if it ever becomes law. I do not wish to repeat my former arguments at any length, but I should like to direct attention to the fact that, according to judicial decisions, the object of trade marks is to indicate that the registered proprietor of a trade mark is such by virtue of manufacture, selection, certification, dealing with or offering for sale. Sebastian says that a trade mark isboth a sign of the qualify of the article, and an assurance to the public that it is the genuine product of his manufacture. So that by virtue of the fact that it is the registered proprietor's trade mark, the public may assume that the goods are of a certain quality and finish. No such assumption could be based on a trade union label. I do not say that the work turned out by union workmen may not be of a very excellent character. The fact that they are paid higher wages should insure better work, because, as a rule, the better the wages, the more satisfactory the product of the workmen. The union label would not necessarily indicate anything so far as quality or finish are concerned, whereas the object of the trade mark is to afford these guarantees to the public.",13
20,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The trade mark does not always indicate ""the quality or finish of the goods.",14
21,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The quality cannot be indicated on the trade mark itself, but its object is to show that the goods are the product of a particular manufacturer or trader whose business standing as one who has always turned out goods of first class finish and quality gives some assurance to the public that they are getting value for their money. No such guarantee can be given by a union label. All that is conve)'ed is that the goods are made by workmen who are members of the trade union. The employer could have no right to a trade mark, except for the purposes I have indicated.",14
22,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Trad e marks can be obtained without inquiring as. to the use to which they are to be put.,14
23,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Thai t would be possible under the Bill - I move,14
24,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They can be obtained as I suggest at present under State legislation.,14
25,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I beg the honourable member's pardon. He must know more than I do upon that point if his statement be correct.,14
26,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I desire to move an amendment prior to that which the honourable and learned member has indicated his intention) of submitting.,14
27,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I alio have one or two amendments to propose.,14
28,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Then I shall defer moving my amendment for the present.,14
29,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne). - I wish to direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the terminology of the clause, which' may prove offensive to the Judges of the States Supreme Courts. The insertion of ""the words ""or Judge"" in the first paragraph of the clause, makes a distinction between Justices of the High Court and Judges of the Supreme Courts. . The Attorney-General knows that the Supreme Court Justices are so termed, and I should be satisfied if the words "" or Judge"" were left out. There was no intention on the part of this Parliament, when creating the High Court, to deprive the Supreme Court Justices of any of their titles. I know that their Honours appreciate the use of the word '^'Justice"" instead of ""Judge."" The Attorney-General is not to blame in this matter, because the same wording was adopted when the Bill was submitted to Parliament last year. I move That the words "" or Judge,"" line 6; be omitted.",14
30,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I am thoroughly in accord with the intention of the honourable and learned member, and I think that some such amendment should be made. I would point out, however, that the language follows that' adopted in the Judiciary and other Acts of this Parliament.",14
31,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Not in all of them, because in several cases the word "" Judge"" was struck out at mv instance.",14
32,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I do not know whether the meaning of the word "" thereof "" would be perfectly clear, if the clause were amended as proposed, but apparently it would. I am prepared to agree to the amendment at present, with a view to considering the matter afterwards. Amendment agreed to.",14
33,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . That the words ""and 'Applicant' include a Body corporate and firm,"" lines 10 and n , be left out, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the words "" includes a body corporate and a firm.""",14
34,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Does not the Acts Interpretation Act provide for that?,15
35,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yes , but over and over again we have included definitions in Acts in order to prevent trouble. It is necessary to adopt the amended definition I propose, beca.use under the Acts. Interpretation Act whilst "" person "" would include a body corporate it would not include a firm. If a particular firm wished to register a trade mark the mere use of the word ""person "" would not give them that right. Amendment agreed to.",15
36,Mr GLYNN,Unknown, I now desire to move the amendment which I have indicated my intention of submitting.,15
37,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable and learned member wishes to insert a definition of ""trade mark.""",15
38,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Yes .,15
39,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Would it not be better to insert the definition in its proper alphabeti0 cal order in the clause ?,15
40,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think not. I think we ought to define trade mark before we define the clasps of trade mark with which we are proposing to deal. That is what is done in English legislation. When I found that the draftsman had adopted another method I did not at first propose to interfere with it, but I have since recognised the importance of moving my amendment out of its alphabetical order. I have already quoted one or two definitions, of "" trade mark,"" in order to show what objects, such' marks are intended to achieve. I now wish to refer to the judgment of Lord Esher in the case of Richards v. Butcher, 1891, II . Chancery Div., page 543You use the thing as a trade mark if you use it in business, or, as it is often said, in ket, as a mark to denote your goods, and to distinguish them from the goods of any one else. Is it to be supposed that the union label would effect this purpose? I understand that the measure is not intended to shift property, but to indicate where the property really is. According to Lord Esher the primary object of a trade mark is to indicate certain articles as the goods of the owner of the trade mark. Then Kerly says The protection afforded to trade marks has for its object the protection of trade only. That is significant In Batt and. Co. v. Dunnett, Lord Halsbury, in the course of the argument, observed : The Trade Marks Acts are not for copyright in marks; they are to protect trade marks. If you have no goods you are claiming copyright only, you are not claiming for the purpose of protecting your trade. When you begin to dissociate the ownership of the goods in the sense Used from the ownership of the mark you are merely claiming copyright. Thus, if the union label provisions mean anything they will amount to a claim of copyright as against: other persons.",15
41,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Does the honourable and learned member argue that provision for union labels should be made in the Copy-, right Bill?",15
42,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They would be objected, to anywhere; if they were provided for in that Bill they would still be objected to!",15
43,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think that it would be very proper to question the constitutionality of making any such provision in that Bill. But in England, where the question of constitutionality could not arise, Lord Halsbury's dictum to the effect that a label is not necessarily a trade mark cannot be questioned. But what is claimed in this case is virtually a copyright. Under the Imperial Trade Marks Act of 1905, if a person be an expert examiner of goods, he can register his trade mark. That is the 1 only exception made by recent English legislation.",15
44,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Why not omit from this Bill the union label provisions?,15
45,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to bring the Bill into harmony with the latest English legislation. The earlier English' Acts dealing with this subject contained no definitions. It is true that there was a definition in one Act which was incorporated with the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, only for the purposes of that Act, the marbut there was no definition in what are known as the Registration Acts, and the' measure under consideration is, in essence, a Registration. Bill. The English Bill of 1904, However, did include a well-drawn definition, wh'ich is embodied in the Act of 1905. That definition, I think, was suggested after an examination of the Bill by experts. I believe that a Committee of the House of Commons inquired into this matter in 1904-5, so that the amendments made by recent legislation were made with great deliberation",15
46,Mr CONROY,Unknown,And as the result of the best legal thought on the matter.,15
47,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no doubt of that. I have examined the evidence which was taken by that Committee, and I can see that the amendments which have been/ made in the earlier English legislation have been deliberately made with the object of bringing the trade marks legislation of the - old country right up to date. Honourable members, I think, will recognise the effect of omitting from this Bill the definition which I propose to insert, and which readsA "" trade mark"" shall mean a mark used or proposed to be used upon or in connection with goods for the purpose of indicating that Ihey are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark, by virtue of manufacture, selection, and certification dealing with or offering for sale. I say that the effect of inserting that definition will be to confine-the Bill to its proper scope, so that it shall deal only with trade marks which are truly such, in that they indicate, as I have already mentioned, ownership of goods, in the sense defined, or expert examination of goods. The omission of this definition may have been accidental. when one looks at other portions of a Bill., and finds that a similar accident has led to a like result there, one is naturally inclined to be a little suspicious of the object which the draftsman had in view. For instance, clause 16, which deals with the essential particulars of trade marks, providesThe essentialparticulars of a registrable mark shall be one or more of the following particulars :(c) A distinctive device, mark, brand, heading, label, or ticket. Now, the words "" mark, brand, heading, label, or ticket,"" are not to be found in the latest English legislationi. though undoubtedly they are contained in section 64 of the English Act of 1888. Consequently I - am at least entitled to say that this Bill is not up to date. Some people would be inclined to surmise that these words have been inserted-ignorin g the later English legislation-in order to fit in with the union label clause.",15
48,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member suggest that?,16
49,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I said that some people might surmise that. These words-whic h have been left out of the English Act have been inserted, but to compensate for the words that have been inserted the - draftsman has omitted a definition of -""distinctive"" marks.",16
50,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Does the honourable and .learned member say that the words "" label "" and "" ticket "" are left out of the latest English Act? . Mr Glynn - Yes ; I think I can show the honourable and learned gentleman that.",16
51,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Will the honourable and learned member look at the interpretation section of the English Act?,16
52,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If the Attorney-General will allow me, I have already given one definition from that section.",16
53,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member's statement is quite wrong,.",16
54,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Perhaps it is ; and if so, it is the duty of the Attorney-General to set me right. However, I intend to deal with the points as they present themselves to me. I am referring now to the essential particulars of trade marks, and the Attorney-General is alluding to the definition of "" mark,"" in the interpretation section of the English Act. I say that the word "" distinctive "" is not included in that Act as a special definition of distinctive But mark.",16
55,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member stated that the words "" label "" and "" ticket "" had been: left out of the English Act.",16
56,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The word "" distinctive,"" as it is used in the English Act, accomplishes practically the same result as does the definition of trade mark in this Bill . It trade indicates that the proprietor of a distinctive mark is also the proprietor of the goods. The definition is not inserted in the English Act amongst the general definitions, but it is specially included in section 9 which deals with the essential particulars of trade marks, and which readsFor the purposes of this section "" distinctive "" shall mean adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark from those of other persons. My argument is that in the union label clauses this special distinction is omitted for the benefit of a particular section.",16
57,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is no reason why it should be designed to exclude a particular section.,16
58,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In clause 23, the draftsman has adopted the provision which is contained in the English Act. That clause readsA trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods or classes of goods as prescribed. The Attorney-General, however, proposes to substitute "" may "" for "" must."" I should like to know the reason for this alteration.",16
59,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I do not think there is any difference between the two .words.,16
60,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"When we find that all these amendments conduce to the same end, and practically render unnecessary the union label provisions of the Bill-becaus e the measure, as drafted, will attain the end in view without them-w e are naturally suspicious of the object of the draftsman in modifying the Bill, so that it does not accord with the latest English legislation upon the subject.",17
61,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Is there any reason why we should slavishly follow Englishmade legislation?,17
62,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No , except that we have been assured that it is quite up to date. I say that in this Bill we shall practically legalize the union label without the special clauses to be subsequently moved. The measure, in the 'form in which it has been modified by the draftsman, covers a wider scope than should be covered by a Trades Marks Bill. I wish to confine the measure to its proper scope, and to make its provisions constitutional.",17
63,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member wishes to make its provisions operate to the exclusion of a special class.,17
64,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That sort of ad captandum argument goes for naught. This Bill will not confer, upon the employer any special privilege.",17
65,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It will confer a special privilege on the emploj er under the protection of the State.,17
66,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The right to register a trade mark will be made reciprocal by the amendments. If they are defeated, the employer will be in no better a position than the employ^.",17
67,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Does the honourable arid learned member say that his amendment would make the union label clauses of the Bill constitutional?,17
68,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No . At the same time, I think that by adopting it we shall prevent the Bill being challenged upon the ground of its unconstitutionality. Even if the amendments; of which notice has been given, are not carried, the Bill will still give effect to the union label.",17
69,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I do not agree with the honourable and learned member.,17
70,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Upon that point, the Attorney-General has not been quite as candid as he should have been.",17
71,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable and learned member is not justified in saying that.,17
72,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am not making anv ungenerous representation. However, I have no desire to elaborate that point. I fail to understand why honourable members should be, so anxious to give a legal status to union labels-to legalize them in the sense of affording protection against the infringement of their copyright.",17
73,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"There is nothing in pirating a union label, I suppose?",17
74,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no necessity for the introduction of these labels into Australia, such as may be said to exist in America. Wherever arbitration Acts are in force in Australia, unions have acquired such a status that Mhey do not require this principle to be inserted in the Bill. The old unions might disappear, and as long as they remained organizations under the Arbitration Act labour would not be any the worse off.",17
75,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That does not affect the principle at issue.,17
76,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We are not here like philosophers, to deal with matters quite apart from the facts. I should be very sorry to insert in a Bill a provision as to principle which was divorced altogether from the question of expediency or some concrete result.",17
77,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,What would be the position of unions where there was no State arbitration Act in force ? ,17
78,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In all the States the r position of unions, where protected by such laws, is so high, as compared with the status of unions in England and the United States, that they do not require these adventitious aids.",17
79,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that we shall not make any progress unless we confine our attention to the clauses immediately under consideration. I understand that the honourable and learned member is going to propose an amendment in this clause, and whilst I do not like to object to his referring to another clause by way of illustration, I feel that he is now roaming all over the Bill, and is discussing in advance something that we have yet to consider.",17
80,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"At the very outset, I suggested, with a view to avoiding a duplication of debate, that upon the definition clause we might have a general debate on the union label clauses.",17
81,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Not upon this definition, but when we come to the clauses relating to workers' trade marks.",17
82,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am willing to adopt, that suggestion. My idea is that a general - discussion at this stage would expedite debate; but if it will suit the purpose the Government to have a separate debate on the union label provisions, I shall offer no objection. At the same time, I feel I am perfectly in order in making a ral reference to other clauses. When I that the status of unions in Australia is exit out. ceptionally high, I do not mean to suggest that I should not like to see a further provement, if they were capable of provement ; but they have mutual rights against one another which are not enjoyed by unions in England. In the United States, fierce disputes between capital labour have been brought about chiefly by an attempt-whic h has been declared by the Supreme Court of America to be condition stitutional-o n the part of employers frame agreements excluding non-unionists from employment.",17
83,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable and learned member is order, Mr. going to move an amendment of which has given notice, to insert certain words in clause 4.",18
84,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,That is so. ',18
85,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member has not stated his ment, but is discussing the relations between employers and employ6s on a clause argument ? which, so far as I can see, provides no such subject for discussion. I would point is. out that we are discussing the definition, and that the Bill up to the stage which have reached, does not contain any ence to union marks. Indeed, to "" trade union marks"" has been struck out of a preceding clause. If the honorshorten able and learned member wishes to deal with' trade union marks, it will be sary for him"" to move a substantive to cause the re-insertion of that reference, if he desires to deal with them at this stage:",18
86,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have read the with definition, which I desire to insert, and my point is that if ithat amenddiscussed ment be made, the trade union clauses are before us. will be inconsistent with the Bill. Hence the question of whether they or ought not to be inserted, has now be dealt with. If the Attorney-General wishes to have another debate upon question, I shall offer no objection; I thought that after last week's proceedthis: ings, the Government were anxious to on with the consideration of the Bill. the you think, Mr Chairman, that I cannot of refer generally to the question",18
87,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I fail to see the connection between the amendment and the that remarks which the honourable and learned genemember was making when I interrupted say him.' I should be glad if he would point,18
88,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I shall endeavour to do imso. If the definition be inserted, it will imbe inconsistent with the proposed clauses dealing with union labels, of which the Attorney-General has given notice. The CHAIRMAN,- I would point out and to the honourable and learndd member that in moving the insertion of certain words, he would not be entitled to say what the adof those words would 'not effect. to He would certainly be at liberty to show what they would effect, but not to anticipate amendments that were not' before the Committee.",18
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On the point of Chairman, the honourable and he learned member for Angas was pointing out that if the definition which he proposes were accepted, it would exclude tha present trade union clauses from the Bill, and also prevent the insertion of the amendamending clauses relating to that matter.",18
90,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Is not that a premature,18
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think it) I submit that the honourable and learned member is in order in giving reawe sons why this olause should not cover what referhe describes as so foreign a matter as a reference trade union labels.,18
92,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I think that it will the debate, if' I point out that the definition clause does not provide for anynecesthing regarding trade union labels, and motion that the fact that the amendment which the honourable and learned member desires to insert would, in his opinion, cause the union label provisions to be inconsistent the Bill, need not be dealt with at this stage. That question can be more properly when the provisions in question",18
93,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"On the point of-order,, ought Mr Chairman, I desire that there shall to be only one debate upon the question of the union label clauses, but, as I underthis stand the position taken up by the honorbut able and learned member for Angas, it is He wishes to insert in the measure push a definition of "" trade mark"" which, in If his opinion, will limit the scope of the Bill ; and it seems to me inevitable that he is bound in fairness to the Committee to point out what would be the effect of the insertion of the proposed definition.",18
94,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Bu the cannot deal with that matter in detail.,19
95,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I submit that he can. Surely the honourable and learned member is not only entitled, but bound, in fairness to the Committee, to give his reasons for proposing the insertion of a definition which will have the limiting effect that he has pointed out. I think that it will considerably facilitate debate if the honourable and learned member is allowed to give the reasons why he believes the definition that he proposes to insert will exclude certain classes of' marks. That is absolutely germane to the amendment. I submit! that he is entitled to reffer to the effects of leaving in the Bill the provisions relating to those marks, as contradistinguished from a proposal to omit them.",19
96,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"In relation to the question which the honourable and learned member is arguing, there is one point which to my mind is fatal. Even if we inserted the definition which the honourable and learned member for Angas proposes, providing in effect that "" trade mark"" shall not include trade union marks, it would not carry us any further, because we find at the beginning of clause 4, the words, "" except where otherwise clearly intended."" Therefore, the amendment would not apply to another part of the Bill where the clear intention was to the contrary. It is useless, to contend that reasons may be given why the definition in this clause will or will not include anything else, because it would be perfectly opein to us, under the interpretation clause, to insert anything else that we .please, unless it is otherwise clearly intended. Those words govern the whole matter. My next point is, that whilst the honourable and learned member might be at liberty to show what the amendment would include, and what it would not, he has really been roaming all over the Bill.",19
97,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I had not the remotest intention of expatiating on the measure at length. Sometimes an interjection will develop a thesis which one never intended to discuss. In conclusion, I will quote from the report of«the Industrial Commission for 1901, vol. 17, page 627-8, which shows that trade' unioni labels are considered not to be true trade marks.",19
98,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Is that the report of ar» American Commission ?,19

100,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The newspapers say that the trade union label is unknown outside the United States.,19
101,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I ask honourable members to allow the honourable and learned' member to proceed without interruption. In Committee honourable members are allowed to speak as often as they please on any particular clause, so that they have ample opportunity to express their views.",19
102,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The passage which I wish to quote is as follows: The union label has during the past ten or fifteen years become an increasingly common device among labour organizations to influence consumers to buy union made goods, and thus to induce employers to use exclusively union labour. Nearly all of the States have adopted statutes allowing the registration of .union labels and trade marks, and providing for the punishment of persons using these labels without authority. Statutes of this sort, of course, differ from the ordinary laws regarding trade marks, since the union working man is not the owner of the article to which he affixes the label, but simply contributes his labour towards its manufacture. According to the report of the Commission, trade union labels are not considered trade marks, and consequently Congress has not legislated in respect to them, because its power of legislation extends only to trade marks. The Statutes passed in the United States authorizing the use of the trade union labels are State Statutes. The States have not power to deal with trade marks, but Congress has.",19
103,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The States have power to deal with trade marks within their own areas. - Mr Glynn - The Commonwealth and the States have both power to deal with trade marks,, but once a Commonwealth"" Act is passed! overriding the concurrent State legislation, the latter goes to the wall.",19
104,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"In the United States of America the States have an exclusive, not a concurrent, power in regard to their own areas.",19
105,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The American legislation respecting trade union labels is State, not Federal, legislation. Acts have been passed by the Legislatures of the States, not merely legalizing the use of trade uniort labels, but even rendering it compulsory to brand Government goods, as having been made by union labour; though upon that branch of the subject. I shall not say anything more at present, in deference to your ruling, Mr Chairman. I ask honourable members to accept the definition which I wish to insert. If it limits the scope of the measure by neutralizing the trade union label provisions, it will accomplish the object which I have in view. The omission of this definition is, in my opinion, a blot on the perfection of the measure. I move That the following words be added :- "" A 'trade mark' shall mean a mark used or proposed to be used upon or in connection with goods for the purpose of indicating that they are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark by virtue of manufacture, selection, and certification dealing with or offering for sale.""",19
106,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne) I should like to explain to the honourable and learned member for Angas that the Bill was drafted about fifteen months ago, before the English definition to which he has referred existed. Therefore it is hardly fair to blame the Attorney-General for its omission, especially as he had nothing to do with the drafting' of the measure. understand that the honourable and Learned member wishea to insert the definition trade mark which is embodied in the lish Trade Marks Act, passed on the August of this year. It is true that there is not a definition of a trade mark in Bill, but there is a definition of the tials of a registrable trade mark, so that what is needed is achieved, I think, as here as in the English Act. Therefore, my opinion, the Attorney-General is in not agreeing to amend the Bill, since it has already passed through the Senate, and we wish to reduce the points of ence between the two Chambers to ai minimum. As the Attorney-General has pointed out. the English definition applies only , ""unless the context otherwise requires,"" our definition applies only "" except where otherwise clearly intended."" The English Act contains a provision, to which the orable and learned member for Angas not refer, recognising the full principle the trade union label.",20
107,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I referred to it. I that it has nothing to do with the trade union label, tfibugh some people think it has.",20
108,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The full principle admitted in section 62. as well as in. sections 63 and 64, which' provide that may own a trade mark, although he not own the goods to which it is applied. The position of the honourable and learned means. member was that, in order to own a trade mark, one must own the goods to which it is applied.",20
109,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I said that section 62 dealt with the case of expert examination. It has nothing to do with the trade union label.,20
110,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Sectio n 62 provides for special trade marks, its marginal note being ""Standardization, &c , trade marks."" It readsWhere any association or person undertakes the examination of any goods in respect of origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristic, and certifies the result of such examination by mark used upon or in connection with such goods, the Board of Trade may, if they shall judge it to be to the public advantage, permit such association or person to register such mark as a trade mark in respect of such goods, whether or not such association or person be a trading association or trader, or possessed of a goodwill in connection with such examination and certifying. When so registered, such trade mark shall be deemed in all respects to be a registered trade mark, and such association or person to be the proprietor thereof. I So that an association may own a trade mark, although it does not own or make of a the goods to which it is applied. That is Engthe whole principle at issue. It is like n t h the system of giving hall-mark by search. The manufacturers of Sheffield are the interested in keeping up the standard of essenSheffield goods, and for two or three centuries past have adopted a system of search. well Searchers go through the goods, and ascerin tain whether they are worthy of having the wise hall-mark attached to them. The union fabel would be similar to a hall-mark, to the extent to which it would afford a guardifferantee as to the standard of the goods.",20
111,Mr CONROY,Unknown,We have made no provision for that in the Bill.,20
112,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"We shall do that preand sently. In section 63 provision is made similar to that adopted in regard to the Sheffield marks; and in section 64 provision honis made similar to that which applies to did cotton marks in Manchester and other of places. If we adopt the definition pro posed by the honourable and learned member for Angas, we shall only lead to consaid fusion, and I think we should be well advised if we disposed of the formal clauses that as quickly as possible, and dealt with the question of union labels, as it will arise is under Part VII . of the Bill.",20
113,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I think that nne it would be advisable to take the sense of may the Committee now, because there can be no objection to defining what "" trade mark""",20
114,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The ' honourable and learned member for Angas has not told us what the effect of his amendment will be.,21
115,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It will define exactly what we mean by ""trade mark.""",21
116,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"What would be the legal interpretation, of "" trade mark "" then ?",21
117,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Angas has adopted the usual interpretation of trade marks, and I do not think that the Attorney-General could quote any instance to the contraryt, except, possibly, from the decisions given by elected Judges in the United States, which are not worth considering.",21
118,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,What meaning would the amendment have?,21
119,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"We should define what the Committee means by ""trade mark."" We cannot, by refusing to define "" trade mark,"" widen the scope of its meaning. If we were to adopt the definition proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas, it would be competent for us to deal in this measure with all those matters which would come within the meaning of "" trade marks"" under the Constitution. The definition has been framed so as to give the widest possible scope to the meaning of "" trade mark."" It is very wide, but very clear and distinct. It seems to me that an attempt is being made to usurp jurisdiction that we do not possess under the Constitution. Our only power of legislation in regard to trade marks is conferred under section 51 of the Constitution, and if the provisions relating to union labels cannot be brought within the definition of ""trade marks,"" as fKat term is used in the Constitution, any legislation that we may pass on the subject will be absolutely useless.",21
120,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Then the honourable and learned member might just as well let Act. the provisions go.,21
121,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The honourable member can see that we have no right to introduce two different principles in the one Bill. The object of the measure is declared to be, in the first' instance, to grant certain rights to marks put on goods which belong to the owner or proprietor of the marks. But it is also sought to empower bodies of men who are not the owners of goods to is affix to them a particular label or mark.",21
122,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The principle is the same. It is proposed to protect the emposed ploye"" as well as the employer.",21
123,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"If members of the unions like to associate themselves as co-operative bodies for manufacturing purposes, they will be perfectly entitled to register a trade mark and apply it to the goods they produce, as is now done by some of the larger co-operative societies. It isa mistake to suppose that the trade marks provisions pure and simple are intended for the protection of employers only. The employees will have the same privilege that will attach to employers, so long as they can claim the ownership of the goods to which the trade mark is to be applied. The Bill proposes, however, to adopt a principle which will conflictwith the rights of the owners, of the goods. It is proposed to give to a body of men the power to affix a label to certain goods, because they have been at one stage or another engaged in their production. Itmight be possible to affix thirty labels to some classes of goods. We should define the meaning of "" trade mark,"" firstly, in order that we may know where we stand, and, secondly, with a view to avoiding litigation. I would urge the Attorney-General to accept the amendment, because the definition would be wide' enough to embrace every provision that could possibly be said to relate to trade marks. Any omission of a definition will not enable us to include within the scope of the Bill provisions for union: laibels, if they cannot be said to come under the head of trade marks. The inclusion of union label provisions in a measure of this. kind might be attended with some disadvantage if the matter came up for argument before the High Court. If it were held that union labels, did not come within the definition of trade marks, it would not becompetent for those who were representing, the unions to argue that they might bebrought within the scope of the Copyright. If , however, union labels were provided for in a distinct Bill, counsel might 0 argue that they could be registered under the Copyright Act. If the Attorney General had desired to secretly defeat the union label clauses, he could not haveadopted any more effective method than that he has followed. A lot of co-operativebodies today are using distinctive trademarks. Consequently, to describe the proposal under discussion as legislation which: .solely in the interests of the employersis to confess an absolute misunderstanding of the purpose of the Bill. If the prodefinition be accepted, Ave shall knowexactly where we are.",21
124,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,If it is not accepted together we shall know that.,21
125,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I am sure that the honourable member is wrong. The Attorneyopinions General himself is unable to say what is the scope of some of the subsequent clauses, and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne occupies a similar position in respect of otlielr provisions. I venture to say that. if we not adopt' the proposal under consideraAmerica-lik tion, within, a few years, we shall the funds of the unions absorbed in law suits. The Attorney-General is well aware that any litigation in connection with trade marks usually involves an expendithat' ture of from ^500 to ^2,000. If by cussion. our legislation we foster such litigation, within a comparatively brief period the whole of the funds of the unions will be ment. dissipated in that way. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We must have cheap law.",22

Is it not wise that we should make our meaning in legislative enactments so clear that he who runs may can be obtained. read? By declining to accept this definition, we shall increase litigation, that should be the last desire of honorwords able members. I specially appeal Labour corner in connection with this matter. If they are really anxious legislation dealing with the question of the union label, realizing the difficulty that may arise in regard to its constitutionality, they should be especially careful to see that its application is not limited scope of the particular Bill in which' it is embodied.",22

128,Mr CONROY,Unknown,There the honourable anything member is _ making a mistake. This deembodied finition is so wide that it will embrace every known case that has come under any Trade Marks Act in the world. There is no known case in which legislation respect of the union label has been inlabels. eluded in a Trade Marks Act.,22
129,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,There are plenty of such oases in America.,22
130,Mr CONROY,Unknown,But the cases which have arisen under that legislation have only come before certain States Courts. Nobody pays any attention to the decisions given Bill. by elective Judges in the States of America. I know none of them whose are quoted with respect.,22
131,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member is not right. I do not think that he ought to make that remark in regard to the great States of America, Mr ""CONROY - What I have stated is do so much a fact that the great States of e the State of New Yorkfind have abandoned the system of elective Judges, and have appointed fixed Judges,",22

135,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I cannot discuss that to pass matter at the present moment,",22
136,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Is the definition so vague and uncertain! that the honourable and learned member does not know its meaning?,22
137,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I do not admit that if by the is vague or uncertain,",22
138,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"What does the honourable and learned member understand by the words "" goods of the proprietor of such",22
139,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Thos e words go beyond that is contained in the definitions in our States Acts which deal with trade marks. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said that if we accept a definition such as that in which is proposed we may exclude union,22
140,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member himself said that we shall do so.,22
141,Mr CONROY,Unknown,We shall exclude them if this definition covers everything that can come within the scope of a Trade Marks In mv opinion it does cover everything. My point is that legislation in 86J: Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] respect of the union label is outside the scope of such a measure.,22
142,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member mean to say that we have not power to insert in this Bill anything that we choose by wav of definition ? - Mr CONROY - I do. In dealing with the matter we must recollect that this is a Federal Legislature. We can only exercise certain powers which have been conferred upon us in respect of trade marks.,23
143,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We have full power to legislate upon that matter.,23
144,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"We have to study the definitions of the term "" trade marks,"" which are embodied in various States Acts, in order to appreciate what was meant when those words were inserted in our Federal Constitution.",23
145,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The Constitution gives us supreme power to deal with this matter.,23
146,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order 1 I do not think that the definition which is under consideration has anything to do with our powers under the Constitution.,23
147,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"If we accept this definition some of the clauses will clearly be outside the order of leave. It may be open to Mr Speaker to say, "" I cannot rule this or that out of order, and therefore it may be inserted;"" but the High Court will confine itself to the consideration of the power which we possess to deal with these matters. If the High Court held the union label clauses to be outside the Constitution, nothing that we might do would help us. That is one of the difficulties with which the Attorney-General has been confronted in taking up those clauses, and I think that he has made a mistake. It would be wise for the Committee to accept the amendment, as it would render litigation to determine the effect of our legislation in this respect wholly unnecessary. Unless we have a cleaT definition of "" trade mark,"" it will be impossible to say whether manv of the subsequent clauses relate to trade marks or union labels. The Committee, however, does not appear to be prepared to give any consideration to this point, and two or three years hence I shall be able once more to show that another blunder has been committed by the Parliament. We are entering upon an evil course in refusing to define what we mean. If the question be left for the determination of the High Court, thousands of pounds of the workers' Marks Bill. funds will be expended in litigation necessary to obtain an interpretation of the law, and the Court will doubtless declare that the Parliament was evidently unable to make up its mind on the point, inasmuch as it refused to give a clear definition of its intention.",23
148,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I shouldjike to make one or two observations regarding the amendment. I take it that it is our duty when, as a Federal Parliament, we seek to cover the whole ground relating to trade marks-so that there shall be no collision between State and Federal legislation on the subjectto see that we do cover the whole ground. It is for this reason that we use the words "" trade marks."" When we simply use those words, we cover whatever ground the Constitution gives us in this regard, and do not leave any room for doubt as to there being only a portion of the field touched by 'the CommonwealthLegislature, and another portion occupied by the States. I take it' that the object Of the framers of the Constitution in giving us this power, was to enable us, if we legislated at all in regard to the question, to so legislate as to cover the whole field and secure uniformity. It is for this reason that we have not given any definition. We cannot extend the meaning of the words ""trade marks"" as used in the Constitution, and we certainly do not wish to limit it. A definition is an excellent thing when the Parliament has power to cover as wide a field as it pleases, or to limit the scope of its law to whatever extent it chooses; but whatever may be the meaning of the words "" trade marks "" as used in the Constitution, we cannot go beyond it, and we have, therefore, refrained from inserting in this Bill an interpretation of those words. When I use the word "" we/."" I have no desire to claim credit for myself; credit is due really to the draftsman. The Bill was framed, not by the late Government, but by their predecessors, and there seem to have been very good reasons for refraining from giving a definition of these words. Another point is that uniform language is not employed in the trade mark legislation of the various States. In the New South Wales Act it is set forth that "" trade mark "" includes so and so; in the Trade Marks Act of another State no definition of the words is given, whilst in the legislation of still another State it is provided that ''trade mark"" means a trade mark registered under this Act. If we gave a limited definition of the word we should not be sure of the extent to which we were covering or superseding the ground occupied by the various States laws, and therefore the only safe course is to stand by the words "" trade marks "" used in the Constitution. I think that these are fair and valid reasons for the position taken up by the Government. But there is something else to be said. quite appreciate the view expressed by the honourable and learned member for Angas that we should endeavour to secure some certainty in our laws. But I hold that if we keep to the constitutional words we shall achieve that end.",23
149,Mr CONROY,Unknown,But only after litigation.,24
150,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Without litigation we can never be absolutely certain of anything under our Constitution.,24
151,Mr CONROY,Unknown,We wish to avoid litigation.,24
152,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"True ; but I am pointing out that we are more likely to secure certainty by adopting the words used in the Constitution. In adopting the English interpretation of "" trade mark,"" in which we find the words "" that they are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark,"" does the honourable and learned member for Angas mean to sav that the meaning is that the same person is to be the owner of the goods and the owner of the trade ""mark ? Is he able to say that his proposed definition is so clear that that is its meaning?",24
153,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am sure that, having regard to the qualifying words relating to proprietorship which appear at the end of the clause, that is its meaning.",24
154,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I shall show why it is clear that there is a great deal of doubt upon the point. The promoter of the English measure was Mr Fletcher Moulton, KC., a member of the House of Commons, and one of the highest authorities on trade marks law.",24
155,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I read the evi'dence he gave before the Committee.,24
156,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"He was a member of the Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons to deal with the Trade Marks Bill, and offered himself as a witness. In the course of his examination this very question was put to him by Sir Charles Renshaw, and in reply he saidMay I explain to Sir Charles why I have used the words "" They are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark."" What I want to guard against is appearing to mean that they are the property of that man; they are his goods,, not in the sense of their being his property; in fact a 8 6 man might put. his trade mark on goods worth thousands of pounds, without having a penny of interest in them."" Does not my honourable and learned friend see that the author of the English Bill clearly shows that the proposed definition has not the meaning which he wishes to attribute to it, and that is evidence that we cannot secure certainty by"" adopting it . 1 Does he not see that if his definition is to tie up the ownership of the trade mark with the ownership of the goods that is the very thing which the promoter of the Eng lish Act wished not to do. Therefore I point out .",24
157,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"He could not do that, because section 62 is inconsistent with it.",24
158,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"But the honourable and learned member has used the words "" selection and certification."" The same observations will therefore apply. If my honourable and learned friend recognises that, according to the interpretation placed upon these words by Mr Fletcher Moulton, we should nut, by using them, necessarily have the ownership of the good's running with the ownership of the trade mark, how can he say that his amendment would exclude such a thing as a union label ? As I pointed out before, even if that were the meaning of the words, it would not exclude",24
159,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Would the honourable and learned gentleman say that the registered owner of a union label was the proprietor of the goods within the meaning of this part of the definition clause?,24
160,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Not necessarily.,24
161,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,That is die point.,24
162,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I merelv wish to point out that my honourable and learned friend, by using the words which he proposes, would not secure the definition he desires.",24
163,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I admit that.,24
164,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"In addition to that, the definition might throw the whole of the States into confusion, because when we are taking over their Trade Marks Actsand we know that their own definitions of trade marks, so 'far as there are: definitions, differ-w e may be slicing up, so to speak, portions of their Acts, and allowing other parts to remain ; Ave mav be leaving some States Acts untouched, and taking in the Avhole of others",24
165,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,But the Constitution is an Imperial Act.,24
166,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member knows that the various States have shown exacllv hoAv - far they have legislatecl on this subiect. If Ave 86 4 Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] say that we shall legislate to only a certain extent in regard to this question, our Act may not fit in with' the States Acts. While it may more than cover some of them, it may not cover others, and cover still others'only in parts. That being so, my view is that we should keep to the words used in the Constitution. We wish to cover the whole of the ground included by the use! of the words ""trade marks"" in the Constitution, but we could not, even if we desired, go beyond that. If we cover all trade marks, we cover all States Acts dealing with trade marks. altogether from the difficulties I have pointed out, there is one other very important consideration. I am sure that the honourable and learned member for Angas does not wish to act unfairly; but according to his. own showing the acceptance of his amendment would determine the question of the insertion of provisions relating to workers' trade marks. It would not be fair to have that question decided until it had been properly discussed, and I hold that it cannot be so discussed at this stage. I , for one, could not properly deal with it on this clause. It is not my intention to discuss it until I can do so effectively, so that I shall bef able to put clearly before the country the views of the Government. It would not be fair to the Committee or to the country to have on this clause, so to speak, a snatch vote upon that question. In any event, it would not, in my opinion, decide the matter, and, therefore, the honourable and learned member's object would not be achieved. Apart from that question, however, it would be a mistake to insert an interpretation which could not widen, but might, on the other hand, shorten, the application of the Bill. If we do not simply adheres to the use of the words ""trade marks,"" we may possibly fall short of the power given us by the Constitution, and thereby throw the States into confusion. I trust that that will not be done, but that we shall follow the course adopted by the last two Governments, both of which, for what I think are< practical reasons, refrained from inserting in the Bill a definition of the words.",24
167,Mr KNOX,Unknown," It is very difas ficult for a layman to follow the devious arguments of lawyers on a subject like tutes a trade mark. this. I can speak on the amendment of ""the honourable and learned member for Angas only from the stand-point of an ordinary business man, and it seems to me Marks Bill. the measure should contain a distinct definition of a trade mark. The Attorney General takes up the position that any definition will reduce the possible applicability of the Bill to the conditions which may obtain in the various States, but that does not seem a satisfying reason why we should make no effort to determine what is henceforth to be understood by the term "" trade mark."" The honourable and learned gentleman 'told us that, when the Committee came to deal with the union label provisions, he would take us into his confiApart dence, and explain the whole position, and I hope that when he has made that explanation, he will give us an opportunity, in the event of the amendment not being carried, to come back to this clause, and insert in it a definition of a trade mark. I know that it is idle for any one who does not possess a legally-trained mind to go into the devious paths of trade marks legislation, but I hope that, in the interests of the commercial and trading community, the Committee will make the provisions of the Bill so clear that it will not be necessary to resort to the Courts for an interpretation of their meaning. Therefore I feel that we are justified in asking the Attorney General to determine wha't constitutes a trade mark. I think that the honourable and learned member for Angas has done well in asking the Committee to adopt the English definition, to which the Attorney-General objects on the ground that it may limit the scope of the measure. What we desire is, not to pass the Bill merely to give effect to the trade union clauses which have caused so much obstruction, but to place on the statute-book a measure which will be of benefit to the whole community. Surely the Attorney-General, whose intellectual ability is unquestioned, will help us in doing 'that, and will place us in possession of the information which he can obtain from the capable officers of his Department. Many of us think that the honourable and learned gentleman would not urge the metaphysical objections to the amendment which we have heard if he had not ahead of him the troublesome trade union label provisions, and we think that, for the guidance of the general public, as well as of manufacturers and merchants, he should, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, assisfj us to indicate clearly what consti",25
168,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown," As I underthat stand the honourable and learned member for Angas, the object of the amendment is to exclude the provisions of Part VII . from the scope of the Bill , but, having listened attentively to the speeches of the honourable and learned members for Northern Melbourne, Indi, and Werriwa, I have come to the conclusion that that object would not be achieved if the amendment were carried. The honourable and learned member for Angas interjected when the Attorney-General was speaking that section 62 of the English Act separates ownership of goods from ownership of a trade mark. It is proposed to practically embody that section in the Bill. I did not, however, follow the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in his statement that section 62, and subsequent sections, give power to register union labels.",25
169,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,The principle union label is recognised in section 62.,26
170,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"It may be; but I do not think that that section has a union label tinge upon it , which confirms me in the view that the object of the honourable and learned member for Angas would not be achieved, even if the amendment were carried. In any case, I think that this is not the proper place to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to the trade union label provisions. I agree with the Attorney-General that, in view of present conditions, it would not be wise to define a trade mark here, seeing that, for some considerable time, we must carry on the Trade Marks Acts of the States. Clause 16, however, defines the essential particulars of a registrable trade mark, and if an effort is to be made to test the propriety of defining a trade mark, I think it should be made on that clause.",26
171,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,No ; because it is provided that the provisions of Part III . shall not apply to the workers' trade mark provisions.,26
172,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"I like straight-out votes on clear-cut issues, and I do not think that such a vote would be obtained on the union trade marks provisions by dividing on the amendment. The proper time to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to those provisions will be when we come to Part VII . , whose consideration I am prepared to approach with an open mind. suggest the withdrawal of the amendment.",26
173,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think that the proposed definition should be inserted, whether the union trade label provisions are or are not agreed to. Trade [28 NOVEMBER, 1905.] Marks Bill . 5865",26
174,Mr KELLY,Unknown," The honourable member for Moira based his opposition to the amendment on the ground that an object in view, which he assumes is the whole object-the rendering invalid of the trade union label provisions-woul d not be achieved if it were agreed to ; but the interjection of the honourable and learned member for Angas, I think, removes that objection. The honourable member thinks that this is not the stage at which to discuss the merits of the trade union label provisions, in which I agree with him, because, as the Attorney-General has pointed out, we cannot by definition limit any subsequent provisions of the Bill unless we delete the words "" except where otherwise clearly intended."" I do not suppose honourable members wish to delete those words, and of. the cause the Bill , perhaps, to be re-drafted; but if they are ""permitted to stand, no definition of a trade mark which we mightinsert would necessarily affect the trade union label provisions. At the present time we are concerned only with whether we should or should not seek to define a term which governs the whole measure. The measure is called a Trade Marks Bill, but there is nothing in it to indicate what a trade mark is. The Constitution gives us unlimited powers over trade marks, and the Attorney-General argues that we should, therefore, not attempt to limit those powers, but should exercise them to the full . I do not agree with the Attorney-General in his view that it is expedient to omit a definition of the trade marks with that end in view. When powers aTe conferred upon us, we do not necessarily receive an injunction to use them to the fullest extent. We should exercise them just so far as we may consider it is expedient to do so.",26
175,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,But the honourable member does not propose to leave some trade marks untouched.,26
176,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No .,26
177,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"We cannot widen the definition, but we may narrow it.",26
178,Mr KELLY,Unknown,We could narrow the definition without affecting the ordinary users of the trade marks.,26
179,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Where is the necessity for narrowing it? I Mr KELLY - At present we know the uses to which trade marks can be put, and it is very easy for us to adopt a definition which would bring all the present users of trade marks within the scope of the Bill . .The Attorney-General told us, 866 Trade earlier in the debate, that each State had its own Trade Marks Act, and that the usages which have prevailed hitherto in the various States would be seriously interfered with if we limited our very wide powers over trade marks generally. I agree with him in his axiom, but not in his deduction. He assumes that we should interfere as little as possible with the trade mark users in the States, but surely we could make the definition wide enough to cover all the different usages in the States, and no more. If we adopt that plan, the holders of trade marks will know exactly where they stand, but if we omit to define trade marks, we shall lead to endless l it i gation. Surely we should not render it necessary for persons to go before the Courts, in order to ascertain their true positions. The Attorney-General told us that any interpretation of the Constitution would necessarily involve immense litigation.",26
180,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I said that we should never reach any certainty in regard to many of these matters without some reference to the Courts. _,27
181,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It should be our object as far as possible to prevent appeals to the Courts.,27
182,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I agree with that.,27
183,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The best way in which we can do that is by adopting a definition of the term ""trade mark,"" wide enough in itself to embrace all the existing usages in the Commonwealth, and yet not so wide as to leave room for doubt as to our meaning. I do not see why the Attorney-General should object to that course being adopted. I can understand the fear of the honourable members of the Labour Party that any limitation of our powers might prove fatal to the inclusion of the union label proposals; but no such result could accrue from the adoption of the amendment. All we should have to do would be to adopt some wider definition of ""trade union label."" I hope that the Attorney-General will see his way to accept the amendment, because it is our duty to make our meaning plain, and to avoid giving rise to complaints that owing to the want of definiteness in our legislation, the public are put to considerable expense in bringing actions at law.",27
184,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," I should like to say a few words in reference to the remarks of the Attorney-General. He has argued that we should leave the Constitution to operate to the fullest extent of the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. powers given to us under it , and that if we adopted a definition, those powers might be limited. That argument would also apply to the .definition adopted in the English legislation. The Constitution Act is an Imperial Statute, and the words "" trade marks"" contained therein will be interpreted according to the signification attached to them in England at the time the Act was passed. In 1901, when the Constitution Act came into force, we had various States laws, all based upon English common law, with statutory modifications ; and if I remember aright, the New South Wales Act would exclude union labels, because trade marks could not be registered by any class, but must be registered by a "" person,"" which would include a company. Surely we ought to define what we mean, and not perpetuate the state of ambiguity which existed prior to the passing of the Trade Marks Act in England in 1905. It was in order to get rid of these ambiguities, and the somewhat conflicting decisions, that that Act was passed, and we should commit a great mistake if we failed to accept a definition which is a digest of the best of the English decisions. The draftsman .of the B i ll before us may have omitted a definition of "" trade mark,"" because the Bill was first drafted in 1903, up to which time there was no English Registration Act that contained a definition of ""trade mark."" We shouM certainly take advantage of the very deliberate judgment of experts as to what is a trade mark. If we include the proposed definition, the Bill will embrace everything covered by the English definition, and if union labels come within the scope of that definition, they will be trade marks. If union labels can be registered as trade marks by virtue of proprietorship, which mav exist in regard to certain classes of goods, we shall not require express clauses to bring them within the provisions of this Bill ; because, if they are true trade marks, they will come within the scope of the measure in any Case. If they are not true trade marks, we cannot include them within the scope of the measure by means of the provisions in Part VII . Apparently the object of these provisions is to give a bias by legislation to the definition of trade marks, and to express our opinion that when the Constitution Act came into force, the definition of trade marks covered union labels. My contention is that if under the law of 1901, union labels were not trade marks, our legislation cannot make them such. Not one clause in the 'Bill would legalize the use of union labels, unless they were true trade marks. I would remind the Committee that when I asked the Attorney-General whether this definiton was perfectly consistent with the union label clauses he hesitated to say that it was. My original point was that it would be inconsistent with those provisions. I am aware that in England very conflicting decisions have been given as to what is the real meaning of "" proprietorship "" and ""ownership "" in goods. But that some provision is necessary is as clear as daylight. That is evidenced by the fact that clause 22A, as framed by the Attorney-General, is practically a copy of section 62 of the Imperial Act of 1905, which) was introduced to meet the case of an expert who had been held to have no right of proprietorship in the case of certain goods. Owing to a doubt having arisen as to whether an expert who examined goods and certified as to their origin, mode of manufacture, and so forth-that is to say, whether they were hand-made or machine-made-ha d a right to a trade mark in respect of those goods, the law was declared in section 62 of the Imperial Act of 1905.",27
185,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Was it held that he had a right to a trade mark?,28
186,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Under some decisions, it was.",28
187,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,To what is the honourable and learned member referring?,28
188,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"To the "" m a r k "" of an expert examiner of goods. A declaratory section was introduced into the English Act, providing that an expert's relationship to such goods justifies the use of a trade mark.",28
189,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is not the honourable and learned member's amendment inconsistent with the trade mark proposals?,28
190,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think it is inconsistent with the union label provisions of the Bill, but it is perfectly consistent with trade marks minus those conditions, Kerly saysIn some cases it is difficult to decide what the precise meaning of a trade mark is; for instance, wheTe A has selected and imported goods made by B for many years, and has sold them under a particular trade mark. If A has been the sole importer, does the reputation of the mark refer to his selection and importation, or to B's facture? Such a question arose in Hirsch v. Jonas. There the plaintiff bought cigars of a foreign maker, who, at his request, placed a label bearing the words Gloria de Znglaterra Havannah, which had been designed and registered as his copyright by the plaintiff, upon the boxes. Subsequently the maker began to supply to the defendants for sale in the market similar cigars, not purchased by the plaintiff, but bearing the same label, and this the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought to restrain. The name of the plaintiff did not appear on the boxes, but that of the maker did. "" The trade mark of manufactured goods,"" said Jessel, M.R., ""means, I suppose, that the goods are manufactured by the person whose trade mark it purports to be. I can understand a man saying, ' I am not the actual manufacturer of goods, but the selector of goods, and my reputation for cleverness and selection is so great, that goods marked with a mark to show that they have been selected and approved of by me will fetch a higher price in the market.'"" The point at issue was : ' Was such a man, 1 seeing that he had not a direct ownership in the goods, entitled to register his mark under the Imperial Trade Marks Acts of 1883 and 1888 "" ? It was held that he was entitled to register. But to set the matter beyond all doubt a section was introduced which, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says, covers the question of the union label.",28
191,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,What he said was that it covered the principle.,28
192,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Probably . I have heard that even members of the Ministry held that the principle of the union label clauses is affirmed by section 62 of the Imperial Act, I say that that provision has nothing to do with that principle. If there were any doubt upon the point, why was it embodied in a separate part of the Act? The English provision is practically identical with clause 22 of this Bill. The object of section 62 of the Imperial Act was to cover the case thus put by Sebastian, third edition, page s :Again, a trade mark may be so composed as to indicate that the goods have been examined ""and selected by a person of known ability, so that they have attributed to them such value as his approval can give, and his reputation depends on their corresponding to their alleged quality. That covers exactly the case which section 62 of the English Act is designed to meet. I contend that this definition is inconsistent with the union label clauses of this Bill. But, apart from that consideration, it is a definition which ought to be inserted. It declares, exactly what we mean by a trade mark, and its insertion will save an immense amount of litigation. The Attorney-General says manu- that we must not attempt to cure defects of the law arising from ambiguity for fear that we may exceed' our legislative powers as defined by the Constitution. I contend 868 Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] that we ought to know exactly where we are, and it is for that reason that I ask the Committee to agree to the amendment.",28
193,Mr WILSON,Unknown," As . a layman I have every sympathy with the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas, and unless the Attorney General has something up his sleeve, I cannot see any reason why he should refuse to accept it. In all our legislation we should aim at simplicity. By so doing we shall save an enormous amount of litigation.",29
194,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That sounds like heresy.,29
195,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"No doubt it is heresy to the legal profession, but we have to consider not the legal profession, but the interests of the general public. I should like to read to the Committee the definition of "" trade mark,"" which is. contained in Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy. It is as follows :The term "" trade mark"" denotes a distinctive mark or device, showing that the article to which it is affixed is manufactured or sold by a certain house or firm. By recent statutes a trade mark must consist of or contain at least one of the lowing essential particularsIt then repeats practically the provisions of clause 16 of the Bill under consideration. To my mind, no harm can result from the adoption of the amendment. I would further point out that this Bill is not intended to benefit any particular section of the community. Its provisions can be availed of by everybody. No matter how poor a man may be, he is at liberty to register a trade mark, so long as this Bill is confined to the true purposes of such a measure; but the moment we introduce the union label clauses it becomes a Bill which is intended to benefit' unionists only. _ Therefore, I trust that the amendment will be adopted.",29
196,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown," I think that the honourable and learned member for Angas. has made out a very strong case in favour of tfie""-adopfion of this defintion. As the"" Bill will be very largelyused by laymen, I think we should be acting wisely by making our intentions as clear as possible. I was surprised to hear 'the honourable and learned member for Angas admit that his definition was inconsistent with the union label clauses of the Bill. Possibly the Attorney-General is of the same opinion, and if so, I can understand his opposition to it. If we do not clearly define our intentions in this measure, we shall foster litigation, which is always an undesirable thing. I hope that Marks Bill. the Attorney-General will accept the definition, especially as he disagrees with the view of the honourable and learned member for Angas that it would exclude the union label clauses of the Bill. I do not mean to suggest that I approve of those clauses, but taking the Attorney-General's own statement, I think that he ought to accept the amendment.",29
197,Mr MCCAY,Unknown, I understand that the Attorney-General has not yet agreed to accept the amendment.,29
198,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable and learned member was not present when I gave my reasons for refusing to accept it.,29
199,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Thei r effect has been conveyed to me, but I do not know why the honourable and learned gentleman should hesitate to accept the amendment. It is far more desirable to have certainty in regard to our laws, than to make sure that we are going to the limits of our powers. I think that the definition is inconsistent with the union label clauses, and would f o l - probably exclude them; but the Attorney General has pointed out that it would apply only "" except where otherwise clearly intended."" The honourable and learned gentleman has said that if we pass clauses authorizing the registration of union labels, we shall thereby show that it was otherwise clearly intended, and that consequently this definition will not prevent their inclusion in the Bill. Therefore, if his own argument be correct, he can have no fear in that regard. I presume that he cannot complain of being judged in this respect on his own words. The insertion of this amendment would furnish a reason for not introducing in the Bill what I regard as matters foreign to it. This definition appears in the English Act.",29
200,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That is not the first English Act in which it has appeared.,29
201,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,No . There was a definition in an earlier Act.,29
202,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,In the Merchandise Act.,29
203,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not believe that we should slavishly follow English precedent, merely because it is English precedent; but when it is proposed in relation to commer.cial measures to depart from the'provisions of English Acts, notwithstanding that British experience is infinitely wider and more varied than the Australian experience in this regard can be. the burden of proving the desirableness of making that departure rests upon those who propose it.",29
204,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member think that the definition appeared in an earlier English Trade Marks Act?,30
205,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"My impression is that I have seen it in one of the earlier Acts. That, however, may not be so. After many years' experience, the Imperial Parliament, after dropping it for a time, has deliberately adopted a definition of "" trade mark."" The purpose is to define as clearly as possible the object at which a measure is being directed. It seems to me that the desirableness of leaving out a definition which would have the great advantage of showing to some extent the boundary lines within which the Bill is to operate, should be justified by argument. The burden of proof does not rest upon those who wish to follow the English precedent, and if the Attorney-General's contentions have been correctly reported to me, it would appear that he has not correctly established that proof. On the one hand, if he says that this definition will not exclude the union label clauses, he can have no objection to it on that score. I assume that he is correct in his contention that it will not interfere with the union label clauses, which he has so much at heart, and which, at intervals, he has presented to us in a new dress, made in each case out of the old material. But, apart from that, it is desirable that we should follow the example set us by those who have had more experience than we have had. I do not suggest that they are better able than we are to form a judgment on the same material, but that they have more material than .we have upon which to come to a conclusion. I therefore regret to find the Attorney-General taking up an attitude of unwillingness",30
206,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I do not think that the honourable and learned memberis fully seized of the reasons I gave for opposing the amendment.,30
207,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The Attorney-General thinks that the Bill will be better without this definition.,30
208,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I say, first of all, that there are a number of States Acts whose definitions vary considerably; secondly, that there must be great uncertainty as to the meaning of this definition.",30
209,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,There is less uncertainty as to the meaning of the definition than there would be ' if no definition were inserted as to the scope of the Bill. I understood that Federation was established to secure uniformity in these matters; but the Attorney-General' wishes to continue the old divergences.,30
210,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"No ; I wish to provide for trade marks, whatever they are.",30
211,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"So that ""trade mark"" in one State will have a certain meaning, and in another State a different one.",30
212,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,No ; the words will have the same meaning all through.,30
213,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"This Bill is to become the Australian law relating to trade marks, subject to the adoption of the common law of England in that regard.",30
214,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I do not wish to leave one part of a State Act in existence, quite indefinitely, and, so to speak, to take away, the rest of it.",30
215,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I think that that will be the result of our failure to pass this definition. The Attorney-General is proposing to allow the usages of the various States to continue to operate. The logical result of that will be that the High Court will have to decide in one way regarding a trade mark case coming from one State, and to give a different decision in regard to a trade mark case arising in another State.",30
216,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"If we insert this definition, we shall have to argue that it affects every definition in every State Act dealing with this auestion.",30
217,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I repeat, that the Attorney-General apparently desires to continue the differences between the various definitions of ""trade mark"" in the States Acts. It may be contended before the High Court that a certain device is a trade mark, according to the practice in one State; and the decision in that case will be imposed upon the rest of Australia. The question of whether a trade device is or is not a trade mark for Australia will thus _ depend updri what used to be the law in the State in which the case arose. The Attorney-General, by refraining from inserting this definition, is insuring, a continuance of the divergences. In any case, rights under the Trade Marks Acts ' are preserved. and, Mr ISAACS - Not if we limit the definition of ""trade mark.""",30
218,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Anything which has been lawfully registered as a trade mark in a State wilf continue to be a trade mark. If the Attorney-General's view is to prevail, we shall never secure uniformity in regard to trade marks so long as they continue to be renewed. The different views which have prevailed in the different States must continue.",30
219,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,No ; because those rerenewals must stop after a certain time.,31
220,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"When .the time expires, they will have to be renewed under this measure ?",31
221,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Yes .,31
222,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,And when the renewal takes place it should be under a uniform system.,31
223,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That is what I am endeavouring to secure.,31
224,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"No . I hold that, unless we have a uniform view of what a trade mark is, we shall not secure uniformity in connection with the registration of trade marks. If the Attorney-General's view is to prevail, the result will be that, because »device was a trade mark, say, in New South Wales, it must continue to be a trade mark in the Commonwealth, because, owing to a piece of good fortune, it happened to be registered in that State. But if it were not a trade mark according to the Western Australian view, the unfortunate man in that State would not secure that which was given to his brother in New South Wales. It is essential that we should have a definition, in order to show what devices are to be registrable. I know, however, that when the Attorney-General has made up his mind, after full consideration",31
225,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Tw o Governments took the same view as I do. I am not making any departure from what they did.,31
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But did the late Government, as a Government, deal with this matter ?",31
227,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,No .,31
228,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I shall be able to show that they did.,31
229,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I beg the honourable and learned gentleman's pardon.,31
230,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I may be wrong, but shall give reasons for my belief.",31
231,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"It was not dealt with at any Cabinet meeting which I attended. Even if the late Government had considered this question, I am sure that it would have been prepared to listen to reason, and I trust that the present Administration, in the person of the Attorney-General, will take up the same position. I venture to sav, with every respect, that the Attornev-General's own reasons in opposition to the amendment are among the most substantial that could be given in support of it, and I hope that, in spite of his previous refusal, he will at the last moment accept if.",31
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) The honourable and learned member for Angas, I understand, proposes to insert in the Bill a provision which has received the approval of the Imperial Parliament within this very year, and, while I agree with the honourable and learned member for Corinella that we should not slavishly follow the opinions and conduct of any Legislature, I think that we could not do better than follow the Imperial Parliament in a matter such as/ this, because it will be conceded that they have had a great deal more experience of trade and commercial affairs than we can have, seeing that their trad'e is many times as large as ours. The a feature of this definition is proprietorship or ownership.",31
233,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Of what?,31
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of goods. Mr ISAACS,- Mr Fletcher Moulton says that that is what it does not mean.",31
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is the way in which I read it. He may have had something more in his mind.,31
236,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"""Certification "" does not mean ownership.",31
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am talking of the ownership of goods.,31
238,Mr WATSON,Unknown,-The definition goes beyond ownership.,31
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is speaking of some of the elements which enter into proprietorship.,31
240,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,All that Mr Fletcher Moukon says is that proprietorship does not mean ownership. A man who buys to consume cannot have a trade mark.,31
241,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I was inclined to take that view until I turned to the evidence taken before the Select Committee on the Trade Marks Bill. Mr Fletcher Moulton, who I was a member of that Committee, offered himself as a witness, in order that he might give evidence on the subject, and explained that he used the words "" they are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark "" to guard against appearing to mean that they were the property of that man. He said that they were his goods, not in the sense of being his property, because a man might put his trade mark on goods worth thousands of pounds without having a penny of interest in them.",31
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The distinction is a subtle, though, in my opinion, a real one. But I do not think that the explanation interferes - with my argument. definition is intended to provide that the goods to which a trade mark is applied shall be the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark.",32
243,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Mr Fletcher Moulton says that they need not be.,32
244,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The word ""certification "" goes further than that.",32
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The definition, on the face of it, deals with ownership in nexion with manufacture. The effect of the ramifications of business transactions on that ownership is another and a distinct matter. I think the definition covers, and is intended to indicate, ownership in its broadest sense, whether ownership in the way of manufacture, or of purchase, or of dealing with or offering for sale. At some point there.must be ownership and proprietorship of the goods to which the trade mark applies. Therefore, I think that the union label provisions, which are quite foreign to the purpose of a Trade Marks Bill, should be dealt with in a separate measure. Moreover, since we are anxious to fall into line with the rest of the Empire in connection with trade matters, and as it is part of the policy of this Government to assimilate our trade and commerce more and more with that of the rest of the Empire, to the exclusion of trade outside it, the nearer we can. assimilate our laws governing trade to the English laws, the better it will be. The broad point which I make is that the definition proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas was adopted by the Imperial Parliament within the last six months. It must not be forgotten that they have very strong trade organizations in the old country. We were told the other night by the honourable member for Yarra that the union label is in use in Great Britain, and has had this and that good result, or, in other words, that it is operative. Yet there is no mention of it in the English' Trade Marks Act, nor was any opportunity given for dealing with it when the Bill was passing through the House of Commons. I have not heard that the subject was raised then, although there is a good contingent of Labour members there who would have been likely to insist upon the matter being dealt with if they thought it proper to deal with it in such a measure. The fact that the subject was not raised is the clearest proof that they regard it as a matter which should not be dealt with in a Trade Marks The Bill, but, if necessary, in a separate and distinct measure. I think that we cannot do better than follow Imperial precedent. The Attorney-General, in reply to the honourable and learned member for Corinella, said that if the definition were inserted it would be contended that it applied to the provisions of each of the Trade Marks Acts of the States. That might, perhaps., be so, if the definition clause did not comcon- mence with the words, "" except where otherwise clearly intended.""",32
246,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,There would be no other place where it would be clearly intended to the contrary.,32
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I take it that it might be clearly intended to the contrary in any other part of the Bill. Personally I do not see that the adoption of the amendment would exclude the trade union provisions from the scope of the Bill, unless it can be argued that the words, "" except where otherwise clearly intended,"" imply a limitation, and cover only matters germane to the Bill, and relating to trade marks pure and simple. Looking at them broadly, they might cover anything that might be put into the Bill. Indeed, I am at a loss to understand why these words are used in every definition clause. I take it that it is not good drafting to use such a provision, though I admit that some very eminent draftsmen have used it. They do not, however, seem to use such words in the English legislation, where the definnitions are very precise, as all definitions should be.",32
248,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They seem to give plenty of work to the lawyers in England as we do here?,32
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The lawyers make their own work. If a number of lawyers are let loose on the simplest matter, they soon make it appear difficult and occult. There is this clear distinction, between English Statutes and ours-that in 'the English Acts the definitions are clear and definite. One of the unfortunate results of making our definition clauses so loose and vague is that anything mav be introduced into a Bill. In my opinion, however, an Act of Parliament should be very precise, not only in its definitions, but also in its text. One measure should not re-enact the provisions of another. In this Bill, however, there are a number of the provisions of the Commerce Bill . It does not seem fo me to be a very splendid thing to be continually re-enacting the same provisions. idea is that we ought to adopt a very clear definition of trade mark.",32
250,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,If we do not define the Courts will have to do so.,33
251,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If we attempt fine it, the Courts will still have to do so.",33
252,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"To a ten times greater the mark. extent, if we adopt the proposed definition.",33
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"At any rate, in the old country, where they have some able legislators, and some very good lawyers, they have deemed it advisable to adopt a very strict definition of "" trade mark"" in the measure they have passed this year. And since we profess to believe in the advisableness of assimilating our commercial laws and usages to those of the old country, we ought to rfollow the lead of the Imperial Legislature to the extent of defining ' ' trade m a r k ' ' as applying to the commercial concerns of the Empire.",33
254,Mr WATSON,Unknown," The honourable member for Parramatta apparently aspoint. sumed that English legislation had confined the use of trade marks to those who owned the goods to which the mark was to be applied. If the honourable member read the English Act, he would have noticed that it went a great deal further than that. The use of the words "" selecamendment, tion "" and "" certification "" in the amendment indicate that the English legislation goes much further than the honourable ber would have us believe. special section in the English law which me at all. permits trade marks to be applied to goods which are not the property of the owner of the trade mark, that is marks which t if y to the quality or the standard goods to which they are applied. are several kinds of marks specially menGoldsmiths tioned in the English' law which are beexample, yond the ordinary definition of - if we are to accept the definition of the ownership of goods to which the mark in the goods at all. is to be applied. If the honourable ber will look at the English law, he will see that it goes a long wav beyond the contention now put forward. Therefore, there does not seem to be any necessity to make the amendment.",33
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not ""define "" proprietorship"" as relating fo ing up or production of the goods. I mean ownership. My Mr WATSON - But does not the honourable member see that a hall-mark which is intended to show the quality of jewellery it, is applied by the Goldsmiths and Silversmiths' Association, who are not the to deowners of the goods?",33
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But they produce the quality, which is the very essence of",33
257,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No , they do not. They merely certify to its existence.",33
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They apply the standard of quality to the goods.,33
259,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No ; they merely cert if y that such a standard of quality exists. They merely say : "" This watchohain, or this finger-ring, which has been submitted to us by Mr Brown, or Mr Jones, is of 18-carat gold, and we have put our legally-protected trade mark upon the jewellery, although we do not own it .

(6) The registration of the trade mark under a State Trade Marks Act shallcease upon its registration under this Act.",35
285,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I think that this clause is deserving of a good deal of attention at the hands of honourable members. Let us assume that a man in Queensland has registered a similar trade mark to that registered by an individual in South Australia, or another State. The clause readsWhere the same trade mark, or a nearly identical trade mark, is owned or registered by another proprietor- ",35
286,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I ' propose fo insert the words, "" in any part of the Commonwealth"" at that point.",35
287,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The clause provides that under such circumstances the trade mark may be registered, subiect to such conditions as the Registrar, Law Officer, or Court thinks fit to imcose to preserve the rights of each proprietor. Let us assume that certain trade marks have been registered in one of the' smaller States, and that a registration in respect of the same mark has taken place in one of the larger States. When the Commonwealth is called upon to decide as between these persons, it appears to me that the individual who has registered the trade mark in the larger State migrit be given priority. .But if we are guided by considerations of equity, it is impossible to say which individual should register.",35
288,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,No difficulty will arise in respect of registrations in the same State.,35
289,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Of course, a trade mark is capable of registration year in and year out. Sooner or later we have to if ace this difficulty, "" Which trade mark shall prevail""? The word ""Court"" as it is used in sub-clause 3 means the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State. To my mind that is a very large definition. It seiems to me that cases such as I have alluded to ought to be decided only by the Supreme Court.",35
290,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That would be very expensive.,35
291,Mr CONROY,Unknown,It is one of the difficulties that we have to meet.,35
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) Assuming that two men in different States register a similar trade mark under States laws, I takei it that this Bill will .give one of those individuals a right to apply for the registration of his trade mark throughout Australia?",35
293,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,^It will not empower him to oust the manwho had registered in another State. It preserves existing rights.,36
294,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does it preserve the individual's right to use his trade mark in his own State?,36
295,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yes , we desire to make the law uniform' as far as possible, without disturbing existing rights.",36
296,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"If it means anything, it means that the existing law is conserved.",36
297,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It may extend a trade mark to other States than that in which registration has been effected.,36
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should have thought that the way out of the difficulty was to allow an individual a certain period within which to register his trade mark over the other States at a nominal cost. If he failed to do so, then another individual should have the right to register it.",36
299,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," This clause, I take it, means that any State-registered prietor of a trade mark may seek to come under this Bill, and so extend his registra tion over the whole of the Commonwealth, but if a similar registration has been made by another individual in another State His extension shall except the area covered by that registration. But what will happen if the Trade Marks Office is not aware of the other man's mark-if , for instance, B, in Western Australia, has not brought it under the notice of that office? In that case, A might get his trade mark registered for the whole of Australia, although B really has the registered right in Western Australia for a considerable number of years to come.",36
300,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,It would have to be advertised.,36
301,Mr MCCJSY,Unknown,"But is there any power to secure a rectification of the register? I think that the Attorney-General ought to make provision for allowing the register to be rectified, especially in cases such as that to which I have alluded.",36
302,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I intend to move an amendment which, I think, will meet the case. It provides for the insertion in the register of anv exception or limitation affecting the registration of a. trade mark which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be covered.

305,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I am not sure that it does cover the case in question. This section purports to cover it, but I am not sure that when it specifically does so, a subsequent general clause may be invoked. I submit this point to the Attorney-General as a matter of immediate importance, and suggest to him that he will be able to recommit the clause if he thinks it necessary, to do so. At present, I think that it is desirable to insert either something showing that ""the general rectification provisions shall apply to the correcting of an error of the kind I have mentioned, or some special provision. It is a matter which will reouire much attention in connection with the administration of the Act if trouble is to be avoided. The subclause provides thatThe trade mark may be registered subject to such conditions and limitations as to mode or place of user or otherwise. . . . pro- Does the Attorney-General think that that would cover a condition being imposed by the Registrar that the registered proprietor - supposin g that he had registered for the Commonwealth from Victoria, and that there was a Western Australian registration which he was not allowed to override-shoul d add some words showing that the trade mark did not prevail in Western Australia? Let me give an illustration of what I have in mind: Supposing that there was a trade mark, consisting of the letters "" XY Z,"" registered in Victoria, in respect of knitting-needles, and that the same letters had been reeistered in Western Australia as a trade mark in respect of the same goods. Let us suppose, further, that the proprietor of the trade mark registered in Victoria got his mark extended oyer the Commonwealth, but that in the registration a limitation was made so that it should not apply to Western Australia. I take it that that would mean that the Victorian proprietor must not sell his goods under that mark in Western Australia. Does the Attorney-General think it desirable that in such a case the proprietor should be called upon to add to the fetters "" XYZ "" such words as ""Not for Western Australia"" ?",36
306,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I think that that comes within sub-clause 4. 8 6 7 Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] Mr MoCAY - Would the effect of such a limitation be that the Victorian proprietor would not be able to sell his goods bearing the letters "" XYZ "" in Western Australia ?",36
307,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I should think so.,37
308,Mr CONROY,Unknown," To begin with; we find that under sub-clause 4 the Registrar, the Law Officer, or the Court may decide this matter as it stands.",37
309,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,No ; the Registrar will first decide. This will afford a cheap means of dealing with such matters.,37
310,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The question for consideration is, who is to secure the first right to extend his trade mark in one State to all the other States? Say that A has registered a trade mark in Victoria, and that B, who has registered a similar trade mark in Queensland, applies first for Commonwealth registratiani.",37
311,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Shoul d they not both have rights in respect of the neutral States ? Mr ISAACS.;-Supposin g there were halfa-dozen such trade marks-on e in each State-grea t confusion would arise.,37
312,Mr CONROY,Unknown,My point is : Who is to secure the rit'ht in respect of the Commonwealth ?,37
313,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I should say the first man to apply.,37
314,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Is the Committee going to say who-shall have the first right, or are we to leave it to be determined by Judge-made law ?",37
315,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"If the Attorney-General's suggestion were carried out it would be rather hard on a man in Western Australia, who would be far away from the central office.",37
316,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,There will be an office in each State.,37
317,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I am not suggesting that this is the fault"" of the draftsman. It is clear that we could not provide, in the circumstances I have named, that the man who first attempted to register such a mark in respect of the whole Commonwealth should have a prior right. I think a time limit should be imposed within which it would be assumed that all applications had been made. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to determine that the man who had registered first, in point of time, under the State law, should be entitled to priority of registration in respect of the other States. That would be a rough and ready way of determining, the matter, but certainly not Marks Bill. more so than is the present system. I think that in the general run of affairs, practical justice will be meted out by allowing the man who has first registered under any State Act priority in other States.",37
318,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Wheneve r he may chose to apply ?,37
319,Mr CONROY,Unknown,We should have to impose a limit.,37
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If all other things were equal, would it be right to give priority to a man. who happened to register his mark, say, a minute before another applicant to register the same mark had come forward? Why should we not allow them to ballot, just as applicants for the one block of land have^to do, under the Land Acts of the States?",37
321,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"We must endeavour to arrive at some finality in regard to this question. We are dealing now with cases in which two trade marks, both identical, have been registered under States Acts.",37
322,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I think that such cases would be very rare.,37
323,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,I know of several such cases in connection with the industry in which I am engaged.,37
324,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I have been told of half-a-dozen instances in which exactly similar trade marks are owned by different persons.,37
325,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"There may be some such cases where businesses in different States have been sold to different proprietors. But, apart from such circumstances, I think that cases of the kind to which the honourable and learned member has alluded would be very rare.",37
326,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Such cases would be found niore numerous than many of us imagine. Cases have been brought under my notice in which a trade mark registered by one person in one State has been registered by another person m a different State; but"" we have not yet attempted to deal with that phase of the question.",37
327,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I should like to put a supposititious case to the Committee. Let us suppose that A has registered a star as a trade mark for particular goods in one State, and that B has an identical mark registered in another State, in respect of the same goods. If those men were both trading in the other States of the Commonwealth, I do not think that either would have an exclusive right to the use of that mark.",37
328,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Probably because of common use.',38
329,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Quite so. them had the exclusive use of the mark, in all probability he would have registered.",38
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What does the honourable and learned gentleman mean by common use?,38
331,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"That neither could stop the other from using the mark. clause s, as we propose to amend it, will provide for cas.es of that kind. suppose that one man in New South Wales and another in Victoria had registered a star as a trade mark, and that both were trading over the rest of the Commonwealth. In that case, neither could oust the other, so far as the use of that mark was concerned from the other States, because its use would be common to both. But if one of them were trading alone in the other States, he would be the person who could secure registration.",38
332,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Supposin g that he had not registered ?,38
333,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I think the chances are that he would have registered. not, I suppose that the man who had got the user there would be the one.",38
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He would be registered after a given time had elapsed ?,38
335,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yes . I think that is the way in which the matter would work - out. I have made a note of the honourable member's suggestion, and shall have no - objection to recommit the clause, if necessary. I think, so far as I can judge, that we have adopted the best way of dealing with the matter, but if a better way can be suggested, I shall be glad to recommit the clause.",38
336,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown," Clause 8 allows the registered proprietor of a trade mark properly registered under the Trade Marks Act of a State to apply for registration under the Bill ; but a difficulty is created by the fact that in many cases the same trade mark has been registered by different persons in different States. The Attorney-General has taken some pains to protect the rights of such persons, though he seems to think that such cases are not common. My own experience tells me-and I have probably had as much experience in this matter as any member of the Committee-that they are common. happen to know that a star-to take the illustration of which he made use-ha s been registered as a trade mark in several of 8 the States. The question therefore arises, how are the rights of manufacturers in If one of different States who have registered the same trade mark to be determined when application is made for a Commonwealth trade mark? Let me take a set of facts which are within my own knowledge. A was manufacturing in four States under several trade marks, all of which were regisSub- tered in each of those States. His business was disposed of separately, B buying the Let us New South Wales business, C the Victorian business, D the South Australian business, and E the Tasmanian business. The purchasers in two at least of the four States are trading with the remaining two States, Queensland and Western Australia, and have a common user of the trade marks in those States. It seems to me that it will be difficult to determine their rights when they apply for a Commonwealth registration. The Bill appears to protect their rights so far as the States in which' they are manufacturing, and in which their trade marks are now registered, are concerned. But suppose they apply for a If be had Federal registration to cover the States of Queensland and Western Australia, what will their position be?",38
337,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Neithe r could be given an exclusive right in the case of Queensland or Western Australia.,38
338,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,If they both trade in those States?,38
339,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Yes . Their position will be the same as it is now.,38
340,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"What protection will they have against other persons in those States ? Will they be open to competition, so far as their trade marks are concerned, in the States in which they are not now registered?",38
341,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Thei r position will be just the same as it is'now. . Mr GB EDWARDS - No doubt all who are the proprietors of trade marks will 1 endeavour to obtain a Commonwealth registration, but if the parties to whom I have referred apply for such registration, how will their rights be determined? Will other persons be allowed to compete with them in the States in which they are not registered, because neither can obtain registration in those States?",38
342,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Can other persons compete I with them now?,38
343,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"No , because other persons cannot manufacture now under, their trade marks in the States in which they are registered and send to Western Austraand lia.",38
344,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,It will be the Commonwealth law.,39
345,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"If the Attortered ney-General could show us that, although such registered proprietors of trade marks will not be able to obtain registration States in which they are not now registered, theirs. other parties will not be allowed to infringe their present rights, my opposition to the clause will vanish. - Mr ISAACS (Indi-Attorney-General) . theirs. - I do not appreciate the difficulty. seems tx> me that registered proprietors under States Acts will have the same protecpersons tion under the Bill as they have now. Each will have an exclusive right to the use trade mark in the State in which tered, and where, as at the present time, they are trading on common ground in provides another State, they will be able to prevent any one else from fraudulently imitating their trade mark, and passing off his goods as goods of their manufacture. present time any one else would be pregranted, vented by the Courts from doing so. The honourable member must not confuse inSouth fringement of a trade mark with passing goods as another's manufacture. If A B are registered in New South Wales and Victoria respectively, and are trading in Western Australia, they cannot now, and could not under the Bill , register their mark in Western Australia; but after the Bill is passed they will continue to enjoy their present rights, no more and no less. The whole difficulty lies in determining shall have the right to register in a State in which no one has yet been trading; but vested rights. such cases will be very rare.",39
346,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The Registrar will decide that point.,39
347,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Yes . It will be a question of fact.,39
348,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown," it. Suppose that a star has been registered as a trade mark by two persons, one in New South Wales and the other in Victoria, and that a main is manufacturing in Western Australia under a star.",39

350,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,He could register in Western Australia,39
351,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"He could not register unless he were exclusively using the trade mark there. If other people were using it, it would be common to the trade, he could not monopolise it. The position under the Bill will be the same as the the same under present position.",39
352,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I think that regisproprietors of trade marks should be protected, and that, in such a case as I have put, no trade mark should be regisfor tered in Western Australia to compete with",39
353,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The Courts will always protect registered proprietors of trade marks from persons who try to pass off goods as It Mr LONSDALE - I hope that we shall be able to keep clear of the Courts.

If one of them applied for a Commonwealth registration, the other, knowing nothing of the application', would trade he be given the exclusive right to use the trade mark throughout Australia, preventing the other from using it , first, in the State in which he was originally registered, who and, secondly, in. the remaining States?",39

357,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"No . Anv man possessing; an exclusive right in one State would retain Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Svdnev).' - The point I raised seems to be blindly provided for, but it is not clear how the clause will operate. Sub-clause 3 provides thatThe trade mark may be registered even if it does not contain the essential particulars required 1 by this Act, but subject, in lhat case, to such conditions and limitations as to mode or place or period of user as the Registrar, La-w Officer, or there Court thinks fit to impose. That may mean a great deal, or it may also me'an very little How will the Registrar deal with the claims of two persons having a registered trade mark in Victoria and New South Wales respectively, as to States in which they may have a common right of user? How will their claims to the use of the trade mark be protected against outsiders? If the Registrar had power to say that A and B having registered trade marks in Victoria and New South Wales respectively, .should have exclusive rights in those two States, but only rights in common in other cases, they would be protected against outsiders, but if there is to be a mere scramble for the right to register, some of those who have been using certain trade marks in common will suffer wrong. The - Attorney-General says that they will occupy the same position as at present, but that is not satisfactory. Unless those who have registered trade marks in, say, Victoria and New South Wales, are allowed to acquire rights in common in other States, it will be open to any merchant to deprive a Victorian manufacturer of the right to use a certain trade mark beyond that State.",39
358,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,There will be no tion of the rights at present enjoyed.,40
359,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"But will any provision be made for the protection those who have rights in common in certain States? I admit that such persons have no legal status at present, but as a mark. matter of fact a number of manufacturers have common rights of user in regard to certajn trade marks in States outside those in which they are the registered propriecase. tors of such marks. I should think it would be possible to provide that, say, and B could become the joint proprietors of a certain trade mark in States in which they had exercised certain rights of user. land. I think we should lay down some definite principle at law, in order to prevent l it gation as much as possible.",40
360,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I would point out to the honourable and learned member that we are merely transCommonwealth."" ferring to Federal jurisdiction the rights existing under the States jurisdictions. It is intended to preserve intact every right that is now possessed under the States laws. The man who registers say, in New South Wales, as a trade mark, is to keep it exclusively, and a man has made a similar registration in Vica toria is also to have the exclusive its use in that State. If there be any other State in which the trade not been used, the person who has registered it in one State will have the right to extend his registration, but if other persons have been using it he is not to have the exclusive right to it . The Registrar will first of all determine on the facts whether or not any one else has been using the trade mark. If it has been used in common, no exclusive right can be granted.",40
361,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,But how about the protection of common users against outsiders ?,40
362,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The v will be protected if they are protected now. If the mark is common to the trade, any one can use it.",40
363,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Yes ; but suppose that it has been in use by only two manufacturers ?,40
364,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I should say that if a manufacturer had not the right to register as exclusive owner of the trade mark, the Court would take good care to protect him from the unfair intrusion of others.",40
365,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,But should not we diminumake provision in that direction ?,40

We will suppose a case in which the same trade mark is held by, say, A, in New South Wales, and B, in Victoria. A's right may expire within a year, whilst B's may have ten years to come. A applies to the Registrar, who, without knowledge as to B's registration under the State Act, may give him rights for the whole Commonwealth-. Would the Registrar have full power under clause 67 to correct the register?",41

381,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I trust that the regulations will be drawn up in such a way as to fix a time for registration, and also for the lodging of appeals against applications. I think that the regulations should be very liberal in that respect. Any person who has registered a trade mark under a State Act, and who does not seek to extend that registration to the Commonwealth, because the period covered by the State registration has not expired, ought to be liberally treated.",41

383,Mr CONROY,Unknown," Does not the Attorney-General think that we should insert some definition of the term "" registered proprietor "" which would cover a registered proprietor under a State Act, as well as under the Commonwealth Act ?",41

385,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That provision readsSubject to this Act, the Court, on the application of any person aggrieved, or of the registrar, may order the rectification of the register. . . . What is the meaning of "" any person aggrieved "" ?",41
386,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The Court would give the very widest interpretation to these words. They mean any person engaged in a business who desires to sell certain goods.,41
387,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I think that the clause means exactly what it says, and that provision has not been made for a registered proprietor under a State Act.",41

394,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yes , we can deal with it when we reach clause 67.",41
395,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown," I think that the difficulty to which reference has been made could be better met in the interpretation clause The Attorney General might fairly promise to consider the particular points alluded to by re-committing that clause, with a view to laying down a definition of "" registered proprietor."" Under this Bill rights are given to registered proprietors to make application to the Registrar to get the registration of a trade mark altered. The term "" registered conproprietor "" may have two meanings. The regissimplest meaning that could be attached to it would be that of a registered proprietor under this Bill. He would not be the individual who would most probably figure as= an objector to a registration under this measure. I think that the Attorney-General, if"" he sees good ground for so doing, should, after we have discussed subsequent clauses, recommit the interpretation clause, with a view to inserting a definition of ""registered' proprietor,"" which would include not only a registered proprietor under this Bill, but 9 r also a registered proprietor under a State Act.",41
396,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I have taken a note of that point.,42
397,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown," I think that something should be done to protect the rights of those who have registered under State Acfs. Honourable members will notice that as soon as a person registers under this Bill the registration of his trade mark under a State Act ceases. It seems to me that we should protect existing rights. In the interests of those who have registered under Staite Acts, it appears to me that an office should be provided in each State, at which they can register under this Bill.",42

400,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," Does the torney-General think that this clause necesssary ? It seems to me that it introto duces unnecessary complications. First of all, is there anything to prevent an unrewhich, gistered proprietor of a trade mark in any State from applying, for registration under the Bill without the authority which' ferred by this clause? I presume that opponent could not set up the applicant's own user against him.",42

403,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable and learned member will see that under this Bill he would have to comply with certain conditions.,42
404,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I am coming to that. Let us assume that there is an unregistered proprietor in a State.

A man must the not lead the public to believe, by the use excluof a mark, whether registered or 'unregisproprietered, that his goods are those produced by the resome one else. But the point is that we are going to allow unregistered marks to be t registered, although they do not comply is rewith the provisions of this measure-w e are going to allow them to be regisword tered merely because they have been used. . I suggest to the Attorney-General that Atthose who have been content with their user is and have not registered! should be allowed rely on their user. They should not be permitted to register under this Bill a mark but for their user, they would not be allowed to register. Let them register now, if they wish to, but hereafter let the is conCommonwealth law .apply, so faT as any the unregistered mark is concerned. I fail to 882 Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] see what special consideration with respect to registration the unregistered proprietor of a mark is entitled to receive.",42
410,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It is proposed to save the right of registration which he would have had under the States law.,43
411,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I doubt whether his right to register ought to be saved. It is very well to give every protection to regisin tered marks, and to provide for transfer from the State register to the Federal gister with such limitations as may be necessary. But why should the Federal register be loaded up with marks which, ""from the point of view of the Federal do not contain the necessary essentials? do not propose to move an amendment, but point out that in sub-clause 4 we have limithe tations as to mode, place, or period user. Why, I do not know, seeing that the question of a mark being in use in States does not arise under that provision.",43
412,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Some one else might the proprietor of a mark which was unamendment, registered, and be using it in other",43

As as he is protected by his user in his State, that is all that he should expect. he wishes to register under this law he ought to so adapt his trade mark as to make it registrable. Amendment agreed to. '",43
416,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I take it that the point that we should keep in mind is that we take away rights which now exist, and that we do not intend to have new registrations placed on the States registers. If bine both those considerations, we shall cognise that we must adopt such a clause this. A man may be carrying on business in, say, Tasmania, and be using a mark that he has not troubled to register. tration is only a matter of evidence and of record. It does not give the registrar of the mark a right; it only evidences the Marks Bill. possession of a right. If a man has a mark which he has not registered up to the time of the passing of this law, although it is a device which be uses in his business, he must be given a right tu register somewhere. As we are going to prevent State registration, we say, "" Let him register all under this Bill."" Then we go on to say, effect, that if there be some one else using that mark in another part of the reCommonwealth, the man who has registered by virtue of this clause is not to oust his competitors. The rights of the other man have to be preserved in like manner. And law, so we provide, as we did in a preceding I clause,. with regard to the registered proprietor of a mark under a State Act, that proprietor of an unregistered mark shall of haye the' 'same right under the Commonwealth law practically as he would have other had under the States Acts. I have circulated a further amendment, which provides be for a case that has been omitted. This which is to be inserted as subStates. clause 4.A, provides thatWhere the same trade mark or a nearly identical mark is owned or registered by another proprietor in any part of the Commonwealth in respect of the same goods, the trade mark may be registered, subject to such conditions and limitaas to mode or place of user or otherwise as the Registrar, Law Officer, or Court thinks fit to impose to preserve the rights of each proprietor. is This will carry out the same principle with regisregard to unregistered marks as we have. just observed with regard to registered t marks - If we struck out this clause, the to owner of an unregistered mark would have power to secure its registration. As the long States Acts would be inoperative, he would own be in the unfortunate position of having a If trade mark which he could mot register. Then, again, he might not be able to register under this Bill, because his mark might not answer to the description of a trade mark registrable under it.",43
417,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,He would be in the same position as a man. who wished to register a are not going to new trade mark.,43
418,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"He might be in a worse position. A man proposing to register, a we comnew mark would be able to make a selecretion which would comply with the Act; but as the owner of an unregistered mark might not desire to alter it. lest his doing so would interfere with his business. Our object is Registo preserve existing business rights.",43

447,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Do not trade marks concern trade?,45
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ver y remotely. I think that if the measure must be administered by some particular Minister, it should be placed under the Attorney-General ; but it would be still better to put it into the hands of the Crown Solicitor.",45

452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Crown Solicitor could administer the measure if he were empowered to do so; but if a responsible Minister is deemed* necessary, I do not think that the task should be given to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has already almost more work to do than any of his colleagues. Besides, the administration of this measure would raise highly technical questions, very different from those which are raised in connection with the ordinary business of the Department of Trade and Customs, and,, therefore, the measure, if it must be allotted to anyi one Minister, should be given to the Attorney-General. I think, however, that it would be better to leave it to each Administration to say what Minister should administer the measure. I see",45
453,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Would the honourable member hand over the Patents Office to the Attorney-General ?,45
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think that the Patents Office would be better administered by the Attorney-General than by the Minister of Trade and Customs, because of the highly technical questions involved the in its administration-question s very different from those arising in connection with the importation or exportation of goods. It is. however, common in many of the States to allow Administrations to determine what Ministers shall administer particular Acts, and I would leave this measure to be dealt with in that way. Why should a layman like the present Minister of Trade and Customs be preferred for the administration of this measure to lawyers like the Attorney-General or the Minister of Home A f fairs ?",45
455,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"He will always be able to get the advice of the Attorney General. Mr JOSEP H "" COOK - That merely draws out the red-tape procedure, and makes it more difficult to do justice.",45
456,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Every Department has to seek advice from the Attorney-General.,45
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Certainly ; but in the administration of this measure the questions arising will be - almost exclusively such as could be dealt with only by the law officers of the Crown. It is onJy in an emergency that the Ministers of other Departments consult the Jaw officers of the Crown; but in the administration of this measure constant advice would be required on matters of a purely technical and legal nature. Therefore, I would leave it to each Administration to determine which Minister would most satisfactorily-becaus e most efficiently and with most knowledge-ad minister the measure.",45
458,Mr WILSON,Unknown," I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that this Bil l and the Patents 'Act should come under the immediate control of the law officers of the Crown. I do not desire to reflect on the present Minister of Trade and Customs, but I think that no occupant of that office, unless he be a legal man, would be able to satisfactorily administer these measures. Therefore I moveThai the words "" Minister of Trade Customs, or other the Minister for the time administering the Department of Trade Customs"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Attorney-General.""",45
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,-The Attorney-General is recognised in the definition clause.,46
460,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I think that the measure should be administered by him. When we come to deal with clause 11, I shall move, to provide that some one other than the Commissioner of Patents shall be Registrar of Trade Marks, because, as those who have gone thoroughly into the matter are aware, any number of technical and legal points will have to be settled, with which it will be very difficult for a layman to deal. ,",46
461,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown," It seems to me that this measure, if any, should be administered by a man of legal training; and in Victoria it has been thought advisable not only to leave the administration of the Trade Marks and Patents Acts to the Attorney-General, but to appoint as the permanent head of the Department an officer who has received a legal training. When the Federal Patent Office was established, a number of Patent Attorneys urged that the Commissioner should possess legal qualifications, because the questions that would come before him would require the application of a skilled legal mind. That course was not followed; and, although the present Commissioner is a capable and obliging officer, his want of technical legal knowledge is a great drawback. The Registrar of Trade Marks should certainly be a highly qualified lawyer. It is not sufficient that difficult points should be referred to the Attorney-General. The natural tendency of officials is not to refer any but the most - difficult matters to the law adviser of the - Government, and it becomes the practice of individuals possessing no legal training to settle technical matters for themselves, and very frequently provoke litigation. We should follow in the footsteps of Victoria, and place the Trade Marks Office under the administrative guidance of the Attorney-General. I make no reflections upon the present Minister of Trade and Customs, or his predecessors; but I contend that the Trade Marks Bill should be administered by the Attorney General, because many questions of an exceedingly technical character will have to be decided. This matter may seem of very small importance to laymen, and but those who have any dealings with the being office will find that it is in the highest and degree desirable to have a lawyer at the head of affairs.",46
462,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Would the honourable and learned member separate the Trade Marks branch from the Patents Office?,46
463,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,I should prefer to see the Patents Office placed under the administration of the Attorney-General.,46
464,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"And the Customs Department, too?",46
465,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"No* ; that would be unreasonable. The cases arising in the Patents and Trade Marks Offices will, for the most part, involve questions of law; whereas any man of reasonable intelligence, and of an inquiring mind, could settle for himself most of the matters of fact which have to be dealt with in the administration of the Customs Department.",46
466,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Is the honourable and learned member's suggestion worth considering, unless we alter the present arrangement with regard to the Patents Office?",46
467,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,It would be an easy matter to pass a short Bill providing that the Patents Office should also be placed under the control of the Attorney-General.,46
468,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Does not the honourable and learned member think that the permanent head of the Trade Marks branch should be independent of the Patents Office?,46
469,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I would place both offices under the control of the Attorney General. I am sure that all those who have dealings with the Patents Office would be extremely pleased if it were placed under the administration of the Attorney-General. I hope that this suggestion, which is made in no' hostile spirit, will receive a sympathetic reception at the. hands of the Minister.",46
470,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Indi-Attorney-General) . - There are several reasons why the suggestion of the honourable and learned member should not be adopted. One which will strike honourable members at once is this: The law officer of the Crown will have to sit as a Court of appeal' from the Registrar of Trade Marks.,46
471,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,That .is the Victoria.,47
472,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Speakin g from recollection, I cannot say that I remember any trade mark case that came to me during the several years that I was Attorney-General of Victoria.",47
473,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,But references were very common in the case of patents.,47
474,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yes . Very many cases of that kind have to be dealt with ; but I think it would be very improper for the Attorney-General, knowing that there might be an appeal to him, to interfere in the administration before the appeal was made. If the Registrar happened to come to him for any directions he would refuse to give therti. It would be improper to first give directions to the Registrar, who ought to decide matters for himself, and to afterwards Hear an appeal from his decision. Therefore, I do not think that anything would be gained by placing the Trade Marks Office under the administration of the Attorney-General.",47
475,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned gentleman think that the appeal to the law officer is a good device?,47
476,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"It has its good, as well as it's bad points. Amongst other things, it offers a cheap and ready means of appeaL At present, patent attorneys can appear before the Attorney-General and represent their clients in appeal cases at much less cost than if"" they had to employ solicitors and counsel to plead before the High Court or the Supreme Court. Although the present system may involve a duplication of appeals in cases where parties are not satisfied with the decision of the law officer, there are many advantages to be urged in its favour.",47
477,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"If , under special regulations, patent attorneys were permitted to appear on appeals before a single Judge, expense might be saved and convenience served.",47
478,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I have looked into the matter, and so fa r as I can iud^e. the balments ance of convenience lies in the direction allowing an intermediate appeal, and if intermediate appeal lies, it will be wrong to introduce the Attornev-General ?s Dart adm-'nistrator in cases which, he would, wards have to decide on appeaL Clause 7.8s. which provides Against the importathe tion into Australia O'f coods with false trade marks; clause 78T, which relates to aiding and abetting offences; and vice. case in clause. 78U, which prohibits the importation of fraudulently marked goods, will have to be administered by Customs officials; and it would be impossible for the Attorney-General to carry out the purposes of the Bill unless he had such officers under his control. In view of the fact that the Patents Office is already administered by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and that the Trade Marks branch would be properly conjoined to it , I see no reason for departing from the scheme laid down in the Bill . It is all very well to say that we might pass a short Act, authorizing the transfer of the Patents Office to the Attor|ney-General's Department,: but I should like to ascertain the views of the Patents officials before I acquiesced in a proposal of that kind. Certainly, unless the Patents Office were transferred to the Attorney-General's Department, double expense would be i ncurred by placing the Trade Marks branch under his administration. The Attorney General is always available to advise the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has his own officers to look after matters of detail. It would not be right for the Registrar to ask the Attorney-General how he should decide in a particular case; and if that were not done there would be no need for the Attorney-General, or any other Minister, to pay attention to the affairs of the office, so long as the Minister of Trade and Customs was willing to exercise his supervision.",47
479,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown," The last statement of the Attorney-General appears to rrie to contradict his assertion to the effect that the Registrar should not come to the Attorney-General for advice. He says that the Attorney-General is always available to advise the Minister-or , in other words, that the Registrar may go to the Minister, and that the Minister may then seek the advice of the Attorney-General.",47
480,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Certainl y not.,47
481,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the whole of the Trade Marks Departof the States will have to be taken oyer of and new legislation applied to the existing an conditions, a number of difficult legal questions are bound to crop up, and it is desirable that the advice of the Attorney-Genaftereral should be available in connection with the administration of the Act. According to Attornev-General. instead of coming directly to him, the Registrar will have to seek a roundabout way of obtaining his ad",47
482,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"No . There are many cases which the Minister would attend""to without any reference to the Attorney-General.",48
483,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,It appears to me that some form of appeal should be provided in this Bill.,48
484,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"In that case we should have to send the parties to Court in every case, and! that would be a very expensive proceeding.",48
485,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I do not think so In my opinion the proper person to administer this Act is the Attorney-General. Under all the circumstances, however, it would probably be better to omit the whole clause, and to allow Ministers to decide the matter amongst themselves.",48
486,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown," Further debate upon this question could be avoided if the Attorney-General would agree to adopt the form of wording which is employed in section 9 of the Patents Act, which readsThe Minister for the time being administering the Department of Patents shall be charged with the administration of this Act. If similar language were employed in this Bill it would be within the power of the Government of the day-withou t any special Act of Parliament-to so rearrange business that the Attorney-General should administer this Act. Mr ISAACS.There was no objection to that form of wording when the Patents Act was passed, but since then it has been determined to place the administration of that measure under the Minister of Trade and Customs. He will be charged with the administration of this Bill, as a natural consequence.",48
487,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,That is no answer to my suggestion. Ib is quite possible that some other Minister may come into office who may think it desirable to follow the ordinary State practice under which the Attorney-General would administer the Trade Marks Act.,48
488,Mr CONROY,Unknown," It seems to me that section 9 of the Patents Act affords us, a very good example, and one which we ought to follow.",48
489,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Why not follow the English precedent?,48
490,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Because in Australia a .great deal is left to the Minister for the time being, whereas in England a totally different system has grown up- a system under which the Under-Secretaries, practically exercise full control over everything - relating to their Departments. At present the Minister of Trade and Customs has sufficient time at his disposal to enable hitai to deal, not only with patents, but with trade marks. But, as the years pass, he may not have time to attend to those matters Moreover, the creation of fresh Departments may render the appointment of additional Ministers, necessary, and therefore, it is very desirable that the Attorney-General should - have power to deal with this matter without the necessity of passing a special Act of Parliament. If we look ahead half-adozen years, the suggestion which has been made must be regarded as a wise one. My point is that we should not take away from the Executive for the time being, the power to say to which of their members they shall delegate the administration of certain Acts.",48
491,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member wish to set up a new Department of trade marks?,48
492,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"No . As matters stand it will be merely a sub-Department. I desire to give the Executive for the time being the power to absolutely delegate the administration of this, Department to any Minister that they may please.",48
493,Mr FISHER,Unknown," I would point out to the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that, before another Ministerial office can be created, a special Act of Parliament must be passed. When a proposal to that effect is submitted, it will be time enough to deal with this question. My own opinion is that for many years the permanent head of .the Customs Department mus.t Gontinue to be the best person to whom the Commissioner can appeal for information upon any matter affecting either trade marks or patents. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa must know that there are many reasons why officers in the various States are frequently removed from the control of one Minister to that of another. I do not know that the system is a good one",48
494,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is a matter which must be determined by experience. We have not that experience, and yet we propose to act in opposition to the experience of some of the States.",48
495,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Upon intricate legal questions the Crown Law Officers can always be appealed to. In my opinion air these matters should reach the Minister through the permanent head of the Department of Trade and Customs.,48
496,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I would point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that the experience of New South General, Wales and Victoria is quite contrary to the. contention which he has put forward. Those States, have refused fo hand over the a ministration of their Trade Marks Acts the Minister whom he thinks is most fitted to take charge of them.",49
497,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does not the-honourable learned member know that in some of the States the Department of Trade and Cusestablishment toms was under the control of the TreaTurning surer ?,49
498,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Yes, in States where, there are only three or four Ministers. Office is situate. Judging by the experience of the two most populous States, we are not selecting the most suitable Minister to administer this Act. My contention is that we should not lay down a hard-and-fast rule the administration of the Bil l in the hands of one Minister when experience may show that it is more desirable to place it under the direction of another.",49
499,Mr WILSON,Unknown," I recoghas nise the force of the Attorney-General's contention that clauses 78s, forth, indicate the desirableness of placing the administration of the Bil l under the Department of Trade and Customs, rather than that of the Attorney-General; but think that the honourable and learned ber for Wannon has shown that it would be well to so amend the clause as to bring it into conformity with section 9 of Patents Act.

500,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That question should be raised on clause 11. The honourable member has agreed that the provisions quent clauses show that the Act ought to be administered by the Minister of Trade and Customs.,49

I will see that something of the kind is done, although I make that promise subject to what the Minister of Trade and Customs may say. I see no objection, but must take the opinion of my honourable colleague, who is absent, with regard to it.",49
508,Mr WILSON,Unknown," The Attorney-General promised, when we reached ""this clause, to consider the desirableness of placing the administration of this measure ""in the hands of a lawyer, instead of the Commissioner of Patents, who is not a member of the legal profession.",50

512,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Wannon has been showing that, in the opinion of those having business to transact with the Department, the Commissioner of Patents ought to be a legally:qualified man. It is almost impossible for a gentleman having no legal training to deal .with patents and trade marks.",50

I trust that the Attorneynexion General will give the matter very serious men. consideration before he agrees to such a duplication.",50
517,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"There is no intention to provide for such a duplication. I have simply spoken of having an office in each State, where applications might be received.",50
518,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It would be very easy to arrange for the lodging of applications at one of the Commonwealth offices already in existence.,50
519,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That is all I asked.,50
520,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Corangamite seems to consider that we should have a separate Department of Trade Marks in each State.,50
521,Mr WILSON,Unknown,No . My chief contention is that a trained legal man should be appointed as Registrar of Trade Marks.,50
522,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"As a representative of the economical State of New South Wales, I must protest against these extravagant notions on the part of the representatives of Victoria-notions , which, if carried out, would tend to the detriment of the Commonwealth.",50

526,Mr WATSON,Unknown,No two legal men ever,50
527,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is where the conmeastruction of an Act is faulty. But where some the provisions of a measure are clear, a man of common sense can interpret them. Lawyers are trained to read sense into prothe visions which often, as they stand, are mere To nonsense. If a legal man were put at the of this office, he would not give many also apopportunities for appeal.",50

541,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi - Attorney-General), Legis- - The bookkeeping system to which the to honourable member refers is not the bookkeeping system provided for in the Constitution. The expense of collecting these fees will practically be nothing. The provision is similar to that in the Patents Act.

Those Acts will have force for a period not exceeding - fourteen years, in order tp preserve existing be rerights. There may be fees payable in rethe spect of pending proceedings, or to give effect to existing rights, though I do not . suppose that they will amount to much, and in the Commonwealth will collect them for the States.

Clause 16The essential particulars of a registrable trade mark shall be one or more of the following particulars :(a) A name of a person printed, impressed, or woven Hn some particular and distinctive manner; or (4) A written signature or copy of a written signature of the person applying for registration thereof or his predecessor in business as a trade mark; or {c) A distinctive device, mark, brand, heading, label, or ticket; or {d) An invented word or invented words; or {e) A word or words having no reference to the character or quality of the goods and not being a geographical name used or likely to be understood in a geographical sense.

542,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," The English Act uses the words "" or some predecessor in his business "" where the Bill contains the words "" or his predecessor in business,"" the reason doubtless being to make it clear that - any predecessor is meant, because there may have been more than one devolution of a business. I therefore move That the words "" his predecessor in,"" paragraph i , be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" some predecessor in his."" Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr ISAACS) agreed toThat the words "" as a trade mark,"" paragraph t , be left out.",52
543,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," Paragrap h e, although its object is similar, differs in verbiage from the English Act. The Bill reads : "" A word or words having no reference to the character or quality of the goods""; .whereas the English Act says: "" having no direct reference.""",52
544,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I do not understand the word "" direct."" There is no explanation given with regard to it.",52
545,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I was puzzled to know what "" direct reference "" meant. Then the clause reads, "" and not being a geographical name used, or likely to be understood in a geographical sense,"" whereas the English Act says, "" not being, according to its ordir - nary signification, a geographical name."" I should like to know what is a geographical ijame used in a non-geographical sense?",52
546,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Suppos e that a shoe not tnade on the Danube were called a ""Danube "" shoe, the name would not be used in its geographical sense.",52
547,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"-1I have always understood that the idea was to prevent the registration of geographical names. If you were permitted to call a shoe a "" Danube "" shoe because no shoes were manufactured there, you would have to discontinue that description as soon as shoes were made there. I prefer the simple and direct prohibition provided for in the English Act. Mr ISAACS. (Indi-Attorney.General) . - There is a prohibition in existence against the use of a geographical name as a trade mark, for the reason that no one has the right to appropriate a name or word that belongs to what one learned Judge called "" the great common of the English language."" It would not be fair, for example, to grant an exclusive proprietary right to the use of the word "" Melbourne,"" as applied to soap made in that city. Some words that are geographical names may be used in certain collocations, because they do not convey a geographical signification. I think it was Lord Justice Fry who said that "" Monkey soap "" was a good term for a trade mark, because although there was such a place as Monkey Island, there could be no confusion between the trade article and the geographical name. In another case, a certain whisky was branded "" Magnolia,"" and as there was a town of that name in the United States, it was actually argued that that name could not be used. I must say that I prefer the language in the Bill, because I think it is more easily understood than that adoDted in the English Act. It is very difficult to say what is the ordinary signification pf a geographical name. I think that the true test is whether a name used in connection with goods is likely to be understood in a geographical sense.",52
548,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," I had made .1 note of the words referred to; but I think the clause, as it stands, is certainlv as clear as the wording of the English Act. The words now embodied in the English Act did not occur in the Bill of 1904, but they have apparently been adooted on the recommendation of experts. I have an amendment to suggest which will bring the clausp more into line with English legislation. I prooose to define the word ""distinctive"" as follows:For the purposes of this section "" distinctive "" shall mean adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark from those of other persons. After providing for the particulars essential to an application to register a trade mark, the English section ends up by referring to ""any other distinctive mark."" That is an indication that the earlier marks - which are specifically mentioned are also distinctive marks. The word ""distinctive"" is defined in the English Act in the terms I have adopted, which indicate that the mark must be connected with the proprietorship of the goods-as I contended when we were dealing with the definition, of ""trade mark."" I suggest that the words proposed be inserted, because they will certainly assist to keep our legislation in accord with that of Great Britain. this clause is not applicable to union labels, it appears to me that there can be no objection to inserting the words proposed.",52
549,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Not on that ground.,53
550,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no necessity to vary the language of the clauses which do not apply to union labels. If the Attorney General will accept the amendment, I shall move it ; but otherwise I do not want to prolong the debate.",53
551,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - This is a very difficult question, and I am not prepared to accept the proposed definition at this stage. I would not like to say that it is wrong, but there are so many decisions as to the real meaning of ""distinctive"" that I am not prepared to agree to the amendment without full consideration. The honourable and learned member knows that there record of the reasons which tuated the House of Commons in making some of these amendments, apparently at the very last moment. I do not know how far the proposed definition would alter the meaning of the word under our law, and I desire to keep as closely as I can to the decisions of our Courts, in which the word ""distinctive"" is clearly understood. Mri GLYNN - Kerly , the text writer, makes a statement which practically covers this definition.",53
552,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Notwithstandin g that, I think Aye can leave the word ""distinctive"" as it is. I have looked very carefully through the English Act, which contains many alterations which mav or may not be departures from the ordinary law. honourable and learned member proposes that the word ""distinctive"" shall mean ""adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark."" Moulton did not think that that implied the proprietorship of the goods.",53
553,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," The English Act clearly limits the definition to the proprietorship of goods. There is no doubt that the clause as drafted widens the scope of the Bill . As the Bill is drafted, it might possibly include trade union labels, but if the definition were embodied in the measure, trade union labels could not be included in its scope. The Attorney-General has referred to the distinction between proprietorship and ownership. The effect of Mr Moulton's remarks was that a man might be a proAs prietor so far as proprietorship is understood in connection with ownership of the trade mark without being the actual owner of the goods. In the sense of the trade marks law the proprietor of any goods by virtue of their manufacture-althoug h he might have parted with their actual ownership by selling to a retailer-woul d still retain the trade mark. However, I do not wish to press the amendment if it is not acceptable to the Attornev-General.",53
554,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown, ! think that the definition suggested should be inserted. In the interests of laymen it is advisable that this Bill should be drawn as clearly as possible. I do hope that the Attorney-General will .see his way to accept the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Angas.,53
555,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I wish to draw is no attent?on to a fact in connection with one or ac- two subsequent clauses, which, at first sight, appears to evidence some inconsistency in drafting. Although the word "" distinctive "" is used only twice in clause 16, in clauses 21 and 22, which are taken from the 1904 Bill of Mr Fletcher Moulton, the word ""distinctive-"" is used in a.much more general way. I venture to say that in those provisions the use of that word is not intended to be limited to the two cases mentioned in paragraphs a and c of clause J 6, but is intended to be used in connection with a trade mark containing any of the essential particulars which are there enumerated. To mv mind, it evidences an omission in draftsmanship that, while clause 16 has been altered so that the word "" distinctive"" does not cover the whole proThe vision as it does in the English Act, clauses 21 and 22 imply that that is intended.",53
556,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"If the honourable and learned member will look at the English Mr Act he will observe that sub-sections 1, 2, ?, and 4 do not contain the word "" distinctive.""",53
557,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"But sub-section 5 contains the words "" any other distinctive mark,"" which imply that sub-sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 also relate to distinctive marks. under thi's Bill it appears to me that, whereas possibly, paragraph a-and certainly paragraph c-of this clause would be governed by considerations of what is distinctive as set forth in clauses 21 and 22, those clauses would not govern paragraphs b, d, or e. That fact-- evidences that departures from the English law have been made in clause 16, without corresponding alteratrons being effected in clauses 21 and 22.",54
558,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I think that the clause is all right.,54
559,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I contend that the words, ""any other distinctive mark,"" which are contained in sub-section 5 of the English Act, necessarily imply that sub-sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are also "" distinctive."" Clauses 21 and 22 of this Bill do not control the determination of anything in clause 16, except, perhaps, paragraph a, and certainly paragraph c, whereas they ought to control them all. A trade mark which is not distinctive ought not to be registered as such. I am not prepared to suggest the exact verbiage of an amendment, at the present moment, but I think there is reaspn for first giving a meaning to the word "" distinctive,"" in clause 16, and then for inserting some words which will make it apply to all the subsequent paragraphs of that provision. Under the Bill in its present form, clauses 21 and 22 would apply to some trade marks and not to others- a curious distinction which does not exist in the English Act, and which does not arise specifically under some of the States Acts. Will the Attorney-General explain what is the meaning of the word ""other"" in subsection s of the English Act.",54
560,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - The honourable member is aware that the English Act is a new one, and that it is a little presumptuous on my part, therefore, to interpret its meaning. But it strikes me that the name of a company, individual, or firm represented in a particular manner must necessarily be distinctive. So with' subsections 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are necessarily distinctive. The Act then provides for ""any other distinctive mark,"" with certain exceptions. It makes provision for old marks if they, are special or distinctive. The meaning of the word "" distinctive "" is defined. The same mode of argument is applicable to this Bill. Paragraphs a, b, d, and e are necessarily distinctive. Then we may devise as essential particulars of a But registrable trade mark a device, mark, brandi, heading; label or ticket, so long as it is distinctive. I think that the provision works out in the same way as does that of the English Act. - Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 17 agreed to. Clause 18Except in the case of a trade mark properly registered in any State under a State Trade Marks Act, a registrable trade mark must not contain(a) the words "" Trade Mark,"" "" Registered,"" "" Registered Design,"" "" Copyright,"" ""Entered at Stationers' H all , "" "" To counterfeit this is Forgery,"" or words to the like effect; or (4) a representation of the King, the Queen, or any member of the Royal Family.",54
561,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has drawn my attention to the words ""entered at Stationers' Hall,"" which appear in this clause, and which, in his opinion, have no significance in Australia, and are, therefore, unnecessary. I do not know whether they are likely to be usedl under any Trade Marks Act. If they are not, I shall be willing to strike them out. I shall be glad to have the assistance of honourable members on this point. If they think that such words might be registered",54
562,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Canno t an English manufacturer register here?,54
563,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,He can.,54
564,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"That being so, it seems to me that the words should be allowed to remain.",54
565,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Ver y well. I move That the following words be added : ""or of the Royal crown."" I propose this amendment for the reason that the honourable member for North' Sydney stated a few evenings ago that he was under the impression that in several States a representation of the Royal crown is registered as a trade mark. I do not think that such a representation' ought to be taken as a trade mark, except in the case of a trade mark properly registrable in any State under a State Trade Marks Act.",54
566,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Lassetter , of Sydney, uses such a trade mark.",54
567,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"If that be so, I think we ought to preserve existing rights. It is 8 Trade for that reason that I propose to transfer these words from clause 19 to clause 18.",54
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," In section 68 of the English Act'there provisoProvided that nothing in this section shall construed as affecting the right, if prietor of a trade mark, containing any such arms, device, emblem, or title to continue to use such trade mark. The Attorney-General, however, would limit the protection.of such trade marks to those properly registered in any Sjtate under a State Trade Marks Act.",55
569,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,We conserve their rights if they are registered under a State Trade IVIarks Act.,55
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But what if they are not registered?,55
571,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,In that case I would not l e ft out. allow such a mark to be registered. No one has a right to appropriate a representation of the Royal crown for any particular goods.,55
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But some persons might have been using such a mark for fifty years.,55
573,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Unde r this Bill they will be able to continue to do so. This will only prevent their obtaining an exclusive right to its use. Amendment agreed to.,55
574,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I move That the following new sub-clause be added - "" {c) A representation of - any living person without his written consent."" I do not think that some of the caricaunicorn, tures that are used for the purposes of adwhy vertisement should be permitted, unless with the express authority of the persons concerned. It was only the other day that the Premier of Victoria made strong repreperson sentations in regard to a caricature of public man which appeared on the hoardings sign. of this city, and I know that many people shared his objections to it. Many caricatures are in the highest degree ridiculous marks). and absurd, and I do not think that advantage should be taken of our public men in such a way without their express conWe sent.",55
575,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The caricature to which the honourable member refers was an adverBill. tisement. It was not a trade mark.,55
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But what is to prevent a man from appropriating as a provision trade mark a particularly funny caricature of an individual. I therefore trust that'the Committee will accept this amendment. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill.,55
577,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I would suggest to the honourable member the desirableness of moving his amendment in the next clause. He would is this then secure a total prohibition.,55
578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I thank the honbe orable and learned gentleman, for his sugany, of the progestion ; I shall adopt it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 19A registrable trade mark must not contain(4) a representation of the Royal Arms, or of the Royal crown, or of the national flag of Great Britain or of the flag of the Commonwealth or of the national arms of Great Britain or of the arms of the Commonwealth or any State. Amendments (by Mr ISAACS ) agreed to That the words "" or of the Royal crown "" be That the words "" Great Britain,"" line 4 and line 6, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" the United Kingdom."" That after the word "" arms,"" line 6, the words "" or seal"" be inserted. Amendmen t (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) agreed to That the following new sub-clause be added :(c) a representation of any living person without his written consent.",55
579,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I should like' to learn from the Attorney-General whether it would be right to invalidate a trade mark when it contained something : else beside the devices prohibited by this clause. Suppose, for instance, that a trade mark had for its centre-piece the lion and the or the arms of the Commonwealth, should it not be possible for the applicant to omit those parts of the design, and to secure registration of the remainder? - Mr ISAACS - That may be done. The concerned will be able to take out a such parts and register the rest of the deClause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 20 (Scandalous and improper "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) have in this clause a very proper prohibition of any offence against' morality- a prohibition which should, and no doubt does, find a place in every Trade Marks But I wish to know why this prohibition is not to applv to all labels and marks dealt with in the Bill. For instance, this is not. to apply to the union label clauses. That, I""presume, is an oversight.",55
580,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I have no objection to an amendment.,55
581,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will the honorhave able and learned gentleman undertake to apply this prohibition when clauses ?,56
582,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yes . Clause agreed to. Clause 21In. determining whether any particular of a trade mark is distinctive, regard may be had, in the case of a trade mark in actual use, to the extent to which user has rendered the trade mark or the particular distinctive for the goods with respect to which the trade mark is sought to be registered, but subject to this section, a pictorial representation of goods or words having reference to the character or quality of goods shall not of themselves be deemed distinctive.",56
583,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," Although the last three lines of the clause were in Mr. Fletcher Moulton's Bill of 1904, on which this measure seems to have been based, they do not appear in the Act of 1905, though I do not know why they were omitted. Have they been intentionally left in the clause ?",56
584,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," They are .puzzling words, and I shall be glad to omit them. I therefore move That the words "" but subject to this section, a pictorial representation of goods or words having reference to the character or quality of goods shall not of themselves be deemed distinctive,"" be left out. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 22 amended to read as follows, o and agreed°toA trade mark may be limited in whole 01 part to a particular colour or colours, and case of any application for the registration trade mark, the fact that the trade mark is so limited shall be taken into consideration by any tribunal in determining whether it is distinctive or not. If a trade mark is limitation of colour it shall be deemed to be registered for all colours.",56
585,Mr GLYNN,Unknown, Would not this be a convenient time to report progress?,56
586,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"-Oh , dear, no. not done anything yet.",56
587,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We have got through the most contentious part of the Bill, with the exception of the trade union label provisions.",56
588,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,-Then it cannot take long to deal with the rest. I think that we can go further.,56
589,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Some of us do not live in Melbourne, and cannot take things so easily as those who do.",56
590,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Many of us were travelling all last night, and it cannot be said that we not addressed ourselves to work today. I think that the present good feeling we reach the should be encouraged. Clause 23 agreed to. Clause' 24(2) The fact that a mark is publicly used by more than three persons in any one State as a mark on, or in connection with similar goods, shall be treated as conclusive evidence that it is common to the trade.",56
591,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) Why should we provide that a mark must be publicly used by more than three persons as conclusive evidence that it is common to the trade? Under section 39 of the English Act, user by only two persons is neces1 sary.",56
592,Mr KELLY,Unknown,May we have a quorum? [Quorum formed?],56
593,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I move That the word "" three "" be left out, with a view to insert the word "" two.""",56
594,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi - Attorney-General) . - Sectio n 39 of the English Act provides that under certain circumstances, where two or more persons are registered proprietors, they shall have no right of exclusive user one against the other; but it is necessary to have user by more than three persons to make a mark common to the trade. Amendment negatived. Amendments (by Mr ISAACS) agreed toThat after the word "" mark,"" line 1, the words "" or matter therein,"" be inserted; that after the in word "" publicly "" the words "" and honestly "" be in inserted; that after the word "" three "" the word of a .""several"" be inserted. Amendment (by Mr ISAACS) proposed - That the words "" treated as conclusive,"" line 4, registered* without be left Out.",56
595,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," In view of the amendments we have just made, does the Attorney-General think it desirable to We have omit these words? Surely the fact that three several persons had been honestly using a trade mark in any one State would be accepted by any Court as sufficient evi1 dence as to common user ? That is the very evidence that would"" be offered in support of a claim that the trade mark was common to the trade, and it would be regarded as sufficient without any statutory authority.",56
596,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I think that the honourable and learned member is quite right. Amendment negatived.,56
597,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," Is it intendeo* that the common use of atrade mark in any one State shall preclude any person from obtaining exclusive rights to use it m any other part of the Commonwealth? Surely it is not right that a trade mark shall become common throughout the Commonwealth because it has been in common use in any one State? Mr MeCAY (Corinella) - The fact that a trade mark has* been used by three persons in any one State would be stronger evidence of common user than if it had been used by three several persons in three several States, and therefore the clause should stand. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 25Except by order of the Court, the Registrar shall not register in respect of goods a trade mark identical with one belonging to a different proprietor which is already on the register in respect of the like goods, or class of goods, or so nearly resembling such a trade mark as to be likely to deceive.",56
598,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown," It appears to me that no Court should be empowered to order the registration of a trade mark identical with one already on the register. I could appreciate the advantage of a prohibition attaching to the registration of a trade mark so nearly resembling one already registered as to be likely to deceive, but I do not see why we should go any further.",57
599,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That is the English law.,57
600,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,- I do not care about that.,57
601,Mr WATSON,Unknown,On e trade mark may be improperly on the register.,57
602,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"That is another matter, which is dealt with in other parts of the Bill. If provision were made in regard to the registration of a trade mark identical with one wrongly on the register I should be content.",57
603,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Tw o persons may have equal rights of registration, arid the Courts have to see that justice is done.",57
604,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"The Courts are sup: posed to see that justice is done, but very often we pass Acts which the Judges say they cannot understand. Clause agreed to. Clause 26Where the name or a representation of a living person appears on a trade mark, the Registrar may require the applicant to furnish him with the consent of that person, to the name or representation appearing on the trade mark before he proceeds with the registration of the trade mark.",57
605,Mr KELLY,Unknown," This clause appears to afford no protection to the users of State registered trade marks. Under the law of a State, it may be possible for a man or firm to register a trade mark which contains some representation of a living being. But under this provision the Registrar will be compelled to ask the holder of any such trade mark to show his authority for using that representation. I do not suggest for a moment that it should be possible to place the portrait of a man upon a trade mark without his permission; but if people already enjoy that right under the law of any State, we should be very chary about interfering with them.",57
606,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,The . person portrayed in any such representation will probably be dead before the owner of the trade mark will require to re-register it.,57
607,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But this clause does not deal with the question of registrationat all.,57
608,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,It does-.,57
609,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the Attorney-General assures me that it merely deals with the question of registration, my objection vanishes.",57
610,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I move That after the word "" person,"" line 2, the following words be inserted "" or a person believed by the Registrar to be living."" In the absence of this amendment, the onus of proving that a person was living would be thrown upon the Registrar. 0 Amendment agreed to.",57
611,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," Under the amendment which has just been made, if the Registrar believes a person to be living, when, as a matter of fact, he is dead, he will be required to obtain a consent which cannot be furnished without some difficulty. Should we not provide that the Registrar shall require the applicant to furnish the proof ?",57
612,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"When a person is shown to be dead, the Registrar will not believe that he is living. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause,27 agreed to. Clause 28 (Concurrent user).",57
613,Mr MCCAY,Unknown, I suggest that the Attorney-General should report progress. Upon Tuesday night it is usual for the House to rise much earlier than 11 o'clock.,57
614,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Some of these clauses are of purely a formal character.,57
615,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"We have heard that statement before. I suggest that after clause 31 has been disposed of, the Attorney General should report progress.",58
616,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am afraid that the Attorney-General regards this Bill as one which should not be discussed at all.,58
617,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,There are one or two very debatable clauses in Division 2.,58
618,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I have no objection to business being interrupted for a moment to two, in order that a question of that character may be put to the Minister, but I would point out that' the question before the Chair is the consideration of clause 28.",58
619,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I wish to ask whether the Attorney-General is prepared to report progress ? Mr ISAACS.> - !No. ought to reach clause 46 to-night.,58
620,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I point out to the Attorney-General that clause 34, - to which attention has previously been directed, is bound to create some discussion. Attorney-General must admit that the remarks of honourable members have been commendably brief. Mr HU ME COOK - And very frequent. Clause agreed to. Clause 29(1) If the proprietor of a trade mark claims to be entitled to the exclusive use of any part of it separately he may, if the part satisfies all the conditions of a tTade mark, register it as a separate trade mark. (2) When a part of a registered trade mark is registered separately, it and the trade mark of Which it forms a part shall be deemed to be associated trade marks, but the user of the whole trade mark shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be also a user of the part separately registered as a trade mark. Amendment (by Mr ISAACS) agreed toThat after the word "" marks,"" line 9, the words "" and shall be entered on the register as such, and shall each have all the incidents of an independent trade mark"" be inserted.",58
621,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) Does this clause mean that if an individual has secured the registration of any part of a trade mark, he has obtained registration in respect of the whole of it? I think it assumes that.",58
622,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I do not understand the honourable member's difficulty.,58
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The clause contains nothing as to the applicant having proprietary interest or right in the trade mark to which the separate part that may be registered belongs.,58
624,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Yes ; the opening sentence refers to the whole.,58
625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then may a man register a trade mark and have a separate right to the use of a part of it ?,58
626,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"He may have a trade mark and be using it, and he may also be using a separate part of it. . ' Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 30 (User of associated trade mark).",58
627,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I would ask the Attorney-General whether, having regard to clause 29 as it now stands, this clause is not mere surplusage. Clause 29 provides thatThe user of the whole trade mark shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be also a user I think we of the part separately registered as a trade mark. Then we have in clause 30 the wordsWhere under the provisions of this Act user of a registered trade mark is required to be proved for any purpose the Registrar . . may . . accept user of an associated registered trade mark The as an equivalent for the user of the first mentioned trade mark. Does that mean that user of the part is, to be accepted as user of the whole, or that user of the whole is to be accepted as user of the part?",58
628,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That user of the whole thing is to be accepted as equivalent to user of the part.,58
629,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Clause 29 provides that the user of the whole trade mark shall be deemed to be also a user of the part. It gives no option, either to the Registrar, the law officer, or the Court, but clause 30 provides that either of these "" may"" accept user of an associated trade mark as an equivalent for the user of the first-mentioned trade mark.",58
630,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Sectio n 27 of the English Act takes the same view.,58
631,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Anothe r section of the English Act extends the meaning of the words "" associated trade marks."" The only associated trade marks that we have under our Bill is when a part is associated with the whole.",58
632,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The same observation would apply. _ Mr MCCAY - I do not think so. Section 24 of the English Act providesI f application be made for the registration of a trade mark so closely resembling a trade mark of the applicant already on the register for the same goods or description of goods as to be calculated to deceive or cause confusion if used by a person other than the applicant, the tribunal hearing the 8 8 9 application may require as a condition of registration that such trade marks shall be entered on the register as associated trade mark. I do not think that there is any corresponding provision in this Bill. trade marks,"" in the English Act, covers a combination which is not included in this measure. Section 27 of the English Act is to meet that particular case. Section 25 of the English Act corresponds, with clause 29 in this Bill while clause 30 corresponds with section 27 of the English Act, but has no clause relating to it in the same way.",58
633,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable and learned member thinks that the clause is mere redundancy ?,59
634,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I think it is worse than redundancy. I think that it is limiting to the option of the Court, a matter which, by the preceding clause, has been made compulsory. It is not only redundant, but contradictory, or else limiting in its effect.",59
635,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"In the one case it is the user of a mark, and' in the other the user of a registered mark. At all events I look into the point.",59
636,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I believe that if the honourable and learned gentleman does so, he will find that clause 30 is designed to provide for a case which exists under the English law, but does not exist under this measure. I think it is an oversight on the part of the draftsman.",59
637,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I shall look into the matter. Clause agreed to. Clause 31 (Series of trade marks).,59
638,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) Under this clause trade marks which, while resembling each other in essential particulars, yet differ in respect of statements of number, price, quality, or names of place may be registered as a series in one registo tration. Surely these are not distinctive qualities.",59
639,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Numbers are placed on such articles as cotton. Cottons resemble each other in essential particulars, the only difference being in the matter of grades.",59
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I fai l to see how these can be distinctive marks. there such a difference between a suit or clothes costing £ 3 and another costing ^ 3 ios. as would allow of a distinction of the kind proposed ?,59

643,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"This has been English law for many years, and is provided for in section 26 of the present Act.",59
644,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In that case I subside, though I should .like to know the meaning of the provision. It seems to me absurd.",59
645,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"New England) Clause 16 provides that a trade mark shall not be a geographical name, or a word likely to be understood in a geographical sense. Yet this clause gives power to register names of places. How can the two provisions be reconciled ?",59
646,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Indi - Attorney-General). - Clause 16 provides that the essential particulars of a registrable trade mark shall not be a geographical name used, or likely to be understood, in a geographical sense, but clause 17 provides that additional matw ill . ter, consisting of any letters, words, or figures, or combinations of them, may be used. Clause 31 deals with trade marks which resemble each other in essential particulars, but differ in respect to statements of number, quality, price, and names of places. For instance, a manufacturer may use as a trade mark a label on which is printed in red an elephant, and under it the word "" L o n d o n , "" while he may use % similar mark, substituting the word "" Manchester "" for the word "" London,'' and a third mark, substituting the words "" New York "" for the word "" Manchester,"" to indicate grades or qualities.

649,Mr MCCAY,Unknown, Every application must be lodged by being left at or sent by post to the Trade Marks Office. I suggest that applications sent by post should be deemed to have been lodged at the time stated on the post-marks they bear.,60

653,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," We have already provided that if a trade mark has been used honestly and publicly by more than three persons in any one State that fact shall be treated as conclusive evidence that it is common to the trade. Suppose, for example, that a trade mark for "" Skylark "" tea has been registered in Victoria and New South Wales, but not in Western Australia, and that some persons in the latter State, knowing of the popularity of the tea, use the trade mark-, and make it common. I presume that under the provision we have already made it will be impossible for that trade mark to be registered in any State except those in which proprietary rights have already been acquired. It appears to me that the Registrar will have to inquire not only into the questions referred to in the amendment, but also .as to whether the trade mark has been rendered common to the whole Commonwealth by user. 8",60
