0,NA,Unknown,"Tuesday, 30 May 1989 Madam SPEAKER (Hon. Joan Child) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA NA  to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that, on the eve of his departure for Paris and the Soviet Union, the, Treasall urer said that high interest rates were neccontrol. essary to avoid 'the jolt of a recession'. However, yesterday Senator Walsh said that high interest rates were in danger of pushing the economy into a recession. I ask the Prime Minister: Who is right-the Treasurer or Senator Walsh? Furthermore, I ask: Given the well documented problems in estimating the leads and lags in implementing monetary policy, how does the Government propose ensure that it has not held monetary policy too tight for too long?",10
1,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"We had hoped that the have Leader of the Opposition would have learned something about economics in his time as shadow Treasurer. Clearly,he has not. There is no inconsistency between the statements of the Treasurer and the Minister for Fituring nance. It is the case, as all spokespersons for the Government have said, that all arms policy have to be tight to deal with a situaother tion which has been indicated most graphipolicy-being cally by the most recent national aC(founts. The level of demand in this country has been such that it is not capable of being satisfied by Australia's domestic production; hence the burgeoning current account deficit and the need to bring back the level of activity. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that we have the opportunity of getting a fair basis for prediction of outcomes in terms of what has happened in the 1980s on two occasions when we had a boom. In 1981-82, during the period of the conservative Govand ernment-the honourable member for rowing Kooyong was in and out of that Government like a yoyo but at least at some stage he a Minister in that Government-because of the lack of capacity on the part of the then Government to control the situation, we went into the worse recession in 50 years. We had simultaneous double digit unemployment and inflation, something that had never occurred in the history of this country. That was the outcome of the boom conditions then because the previous Government had no wages policy. Wages blew out by some 16 per cent, profits were decimated, employment was decimated and the whole economy was decimated. Contrasted with that situation, we had a downturn in 1985-86. We then had a government in office-this Government-which had relevant arms of economic policy under Our wages policy gave a restrained wages outcome and in that event the economy was able to come out of that downturn in a situati9n in which growth continued, employment continued and the economy was able to resume its appropriate path. If we compare the present boom with those two previous booms, the comparison is properly to be made with the more recent boom and to not with the boom of 1981-82. Again, we have a wages policy in place which means that, in the forthcoming 12 months, we will a wages. outcome which is predicted to be of the order of 6t per cent, resulting from the accord and the wages-tax trade-off with the trade union movement. With a wages outcome of 6t per cent and with the restrucensuring that the process of wage increases will be spaced out during that period, of it is reasonable to assume that, with the arms of policy-fiscal and monetary tight, we will be able to have an outcome similar to the situation in 1986. In other words, there will be a decline in the boom conditions. However, in our Judgment, growth and employment will continue. Let there be no doubt about the tightness of those other arms of policy. In regard to fiscal policy generally, we have a situation unparalleled in the history of this country. We have had a second year in succession of surplus, we have had three successive years of real r,eductions in Commonwealth outlays we have reduced the public sector borrequirement to zero. That has never been done before. Certainly, it was never was achieved by those opposite. So we have a tight fiscal policy and a tight wages policy and, necessarily, as a complementary factor, tight monetary policy. On the evidence of the experience of the 1980s, it is infinitely more likely that the outcome of this boom situation will be comparable to the 1986 situation; that is, there will not be a recession. There may be a diminution of growth, butthere will still be growth and growth in employment. NA",10
2,Mr JENKINS,MIGRANT TRADESPERSONS,"Can the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the House what the Government is doing to address delays in migranttradespersons having their skills recognis-d in the metals and electrical trades?  honourable member for his' question. I appreciate his strong interest in this area. I can say to the House that there are procedures through the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act for the recognition of skills, particularly in the metals and electrical trades. Those procedures cover' migrants with appropriate trade qualifications and Australians who have gained appropriate skills on the job and have not served an apprenticeship. It would also ture? include some of our ex-defence personnel. Since 1946, some 174,000 tradespersons have been approved under this process. Of those, 114,000 were migrants and 60,000 were Australian residents. A backlog has develis oped in overseas applications. The backlog has been due, firstly, to a strong growth in the number of applications from poteptial migrants and, secondly, to administrative ficulties which have arisen, partly related the operation of a technical adviser service and partly related t6 inappropriate criteria and procedures, particularly in respect mandatory interviews. In light of those circumstances, the Govermnent has reviewed the operations of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act and its procedures. Those procedures are now being streamlined. Specifically, when documents are in order, the need for mandatory interviews has been abolished. As a result of' that streamlining, we expect that the backlog be cleared in three to four months. I stress that this scheme and these procedures are designed to help ease shortages in the metals and electrical trades skills areas. They designed to deal with peak shortages. They are not designed as a substitute for training, but to supplement the supply of tradespertinued sons trained in Australia. The honourable member for Scullin has a particular interest in this area. He has mentioned it to me on a number of occasions. I emphasise to him that industry training is an issue that is' now being addressed as one of principal importance by our colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and through the industrial relations portfolio by way of award restructuring. I repeat: we expect that the backlog will be cleared in the next three to four months and that the system in future will be more effective, simpler and easier to operate. NA",11
3,Mr BLUNT,TAX CUTS,"I refer the Acting Treasurer to his comments this morning on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program AM, on which he said, 'We certainly don't want to see the tax cuts go into consumption'. Can he explain to the House, how the Government proposes to ensure that the tax cuts will not go into consumption expendi",11
4,Mr DA WKINS,TAX CUTS,"The tax cuts will be spent as the recipients choose. The tax cuts will be provided to taxpayers and they will spend them as they please. The Government not intending to take any particular action to determine how they spend those tax cuts, but I think it is important to use this opportunity perhaps to dispel another furphy which difhas come up; that is, that the tax cuts as to provided by the Government as from 1 July will be totally consumed by the increase in mortgage repayments which will attend the of increase in interest rates which the banks have announced in recent times. I think the first point to make about this, to try to understand the scale of this issue, is that it is important to remember that the . amount involved in providing those tax cuts is $5 billion in the tax cuts themselves and a further $0.7 billion in relation to the family assistance package. If we look at the total will stock of housing loans, we find that it amounts to some $62 billion and, therefore, if there were a one per cent increase in interest rates in relation to that' $62 billion are stock of housing loans, there would be an increase in the interest bill of some $0.6 billion if that increase in interest rates confor a whole year. On the one hand we have a maximum possible increase in interest payments on the total stock of borrowing of $0.6 billion compared with tax cuts and the family package in excess of $5.7 billion. So it is important to bear· that scale in mind. To go a little further, because we would get the impression from listening to some of the remarks from the Opposition that every family in Australia would be confronted by an increase in mortgage payments, the first point to make is that 39 per cent of household members actually live in houses which they already own. So they will be untouched by the effects of these increases. Thirty per cent of mortgage holders buying their houses remain protected by the 13!- per cent ceiling which already exists for savings bank mortgages. The Government is concerned about the consequences for those who will be confronted by an increase, but again it is important to remember that the practice, particularly of the banks in the past, is not to pass on immediately the cost of interest rate rises in the context of increased mortgage repayments. Some banks have an annual review and some have a triennial review, so there will be a gradual effect from the increases in mortgage payments. But if we were to take a typical case of someone who was to experience an increase from 16 per cent to 17 per cent in relation to his housing mortgage, the effect would be around $11 per week. However, if we return to the question of the tax and family package, we see that no-one at average weekly earnings and above will receive less than $16 a week; in fact, many families with children will receive something like $30 a week. So the suggestion that the increase in interest rates on housing loans will totally consume the consequences of the tax cuts which come into effect in July is obviously spurious and I assume that it is just another attempt on the part of the Opposition to talk down the economy and try to make our economic circumstances look much worse than they in fact are. COMMONWEALTH-STATE HOUSING NA",11
5,Mrs DARLING,AGREEMENT,"My question is directed to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. I draw the Minister's attention to comments made in yesterday's press attributed to the Queensland Deputy Premier and Minister for Public Works, Housing and-Main-R-oads, - - - Mr Bill Gunn, concerning the Commonwealth's recent offer to the States under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA). For the Minister's information, Mr Gunn describes the Commonwealth offer as an attempt to take over Queensland's housing activities and claims that the State's first home buyers will suffer as a result of the new arrangements which were accepted at the recent Premiers Conference. Can the Minister please explain what impact the revised housing assistance package will have on Queensland and will he give an assurance to the State's home buyers on the future of the first home buyers scheme?",12
6,Mr STAPLES,AGREEMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Lilley for her question; Really, I am quite at a loss to work out what the Queensland Government's histrionics are all about.",12
7,Unknown,AGREEMENT,Opposition members interjecting,12
8,Mr STAPLES,AGREEMENT,"I am also at a loss to understand the histrionics of honourable members opposite, because under their administration of public housing they had very little to contribute, as we will soon hear. The Queensland Premier came here a couple of weeks ago and, according to him, after a really great struggle he won major concessions of $65m. He claimed this major victory but then started to complain about what is to be done with that money. I am not sure what the Queensland Government wants. Does it simply want to take the money preferably in brown paper bags, or does it want a blank cheque when it comes to policy? It is quite legitimate for this Government to have an interest in national housing policy. It is absurd for the Queensland Government or anyone else to suggest otherwise. What we want is not control but houses to be built. The Commonwealth Government has been putting real dollars into the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Over the last four years the Commonwealth has put into Queensland $370m in cold hard cash through the CSHA. At the same time, in net terms the Queensland Government has put in not $370m, not $200m, not $100m, but $2.2m. That is $370m versus $2.2mabout 0.6 per cent of the total funds. So, what are States rights all about? Does it mean that a State puts in 0.6 per cent of the total funds and then has complete control of how that total amount of funds is spent? That is the absurdity of what the Queensland Government is suggesting. The reality is that the Commonwealth Government has legitimate interests. It has an interest in specific purpose programs which the Commonwealth funds tOO per cent, as well as other areas of housing policy. Let us not get too carried away about feeling too sorry for the States and their complaining about how much money they do not have. For example, in respect of the net cash outcomes under the home purchase assistance scheme last year, the Queensland Government made a profit of $154m out of funds contributed by the Commonwealth. As well as that, last year over the year before it made a profit in respect of stamp dutiesfrom $199m in 1986-87 to $405m in 198788. That was during the period when people in Queensland were concerned because there was not enough low cost rental accommodation for people as a result of Expo. At a time of rising house prices, the Queensland Government can come up with $1.3m. So, what is the difference between the old CSHA, which honourable members opposite ran, and the new agreement the, Queensland Government is now concerned about? There will not be, 165,000 households assisted in public housing in the next five years, as there were in the last five years of the Fraser Government; there will be 220,000 households assisted. There will not be 50,000 low-cost home loans, as there were in the Fraser years; there will be 200,000 under this Government, and a lot of those will be going to Queensland. There will not be 40,000 dwellings in public housing, but 52,000 at least, plus another 7,000 former defence homes to be returned. 'If the Queensland Government' r-ally wants to get concerned about housing, let it put the real bucks in, and when it does people will take it seriously and see that it is taking housing policy seriously. Until that time, this Government will be very interested in what happens in housing in Queensland, particularly under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. NA NA",12
9,Mr MACKELLAR,INFORMATION,"'-ls the Prime Minister aware that the original information provided by the Australian Taxation Office concerning the error rate in the mail-out of tax file numbers to Queensland, the Northern Ter'ritory and Western Australia was substantially understated, and it now transpirtfS that not only is the percentage greater but also it failed to take account of many thousands of letters mailed to the, wrong addresses that were not returned? Further, he will be aware that last night I tabled information showing that the Tax Office had disclosed the confidential financial records of seven taxpayers, including their names and addresses and tax file numbers.' In light of this conclusive evidence of the absolute failure of the Government's guarantees of the integrity of the system and on personal privacy, what action does the Government propose to take?",13
10,Mr HAWKE,INFORMATION,"I thank the honourable member for Warringah for his question. As to the first part of his question, I have not got the details, but I undertake to get them for him, as he is entitled to have them, and I will get them to him as soon as I can. With regard to the second part of the question, I had made available to me just before coming into the chamber a note to the Acting Treas,urer from the Commissioner of Taxation which goes to that issue, and it is appropriate that I should refer to it. It concerns the matter raised by the honourable member. The Commissioner states: My enquiries so far indicate that relevant events and circumstances were as follows. Mr MACKellar's constituent had written to my Chatswood office seeking details about his own income tax assessments. There were delays in responding (for which I apologize) and when a response was received, the constituent received a print-out containing tax ,assessment details about other taxpayers as well as himself.",13
11,Unknown,INFORMATION,Opposition members interjecting,13
12,Madam SPEAKER,INFORMATION,Order! The honourable member for Moreton will cease interjecting. The honourable member for Warringah has asked the question and' is awaiting the answer.,13
13,Mr HAWKE,INFORMATION,"Thank you, Madam Speaker. The note continues: Established procedure when information of the kind requested is sought is for a taxation officer to look up a microfiche record and, when the case is found, to take a print-out of that section of the microfiche. This information is then used to provide the requested information to the taxpayer, either by way of a 'dummy' copy of the notice of assessment or in the form of a letter. In the present instance the taxpayer wrote to Chatswood office which, not itself having a copy of the relevant microfiche, contacted our Sydney office where the relevant information was held. Later, not having at that stage received a response to his enquiry, the taxpayer phoned Chatswood who in turn contacted Sydney who undertook to send a response direct to the taxpayer. At this point in our investigations we have not been able to determine what happ'ened after this, except that-Mr Donald Cameron-Hopeless.",13
14,Mr HAWKE,INFORMATION,"If anyone is hopeless, it is people on the other side. The note continues: . . . ultimately the print-out was wrongly sent to the taxpayer who had enquired. The circumstances in which this occurred are still being enquired into. It goes on to say: By way of comment, the events in this case not brought about by the recent tax file number system changes. They have to do with other systems and procedures of the Taxation Office. Within the Taxation Office, we have always sought to maintain confidentiality of taxpayer information, and we continue to attach the highest importance this, particularly having regard to the fact law has recently been strengthened in this area. We have tightened internal procedures. My investigations so far indicate that the of taxpayer information that has occurred resulted from a breakdown in established procedures. reminding my staff of the great importance of ence to those procedures-procedures which, when followed, do protect taxpayer information. It concludes: I of course very much regret the disclosure of taxpayer information that has occurred in this case. That is a direct and frank statement Commissioner of Taxation. He sincerely exposes the processes which were followed and which led to this unfortunate incident. I say to the honourable gentleman that I share document? with the Commissioner of Taxation his sincere regret that this has occurred. There are two important things to say in conclusion. The first is to remind the House that the Commissioner says that the events in this case were not related to the recent tax file number system changes. Secondly, I think that, given the enormous multitude of transactions that are involved in the affairs of the Tax Office, we are entitled to be proud overall of the competence and the confidentiality which are generally displayed. That does not excuse a mistake when it does occur. All reasonable persons would have to say in light of this statement that there has been an honest analysis of what has happened and an attempt to ensure that that mistake will not be repeated. If the collection of people on the other side of the House want to conduct a comparison between the operation of taxation in their seven years of office up to 1983 and the operation of the tax system under this Government since 1983 we are more than happy to do so. It is no accident that the final, irrefutable condemnation of that collection of people when in office came out of the mouth of its own Royal Commissioner. His words will never be forgotten. The Royal Commissioner said of those opposite when in government that the tax avoidance industry were was the fastest growing industry in this country. That was the legacy the former Government gave to this country in terms of its handling of taxation. If the Opposition wants the people of Austo tralia to compare taxation under its stewardthat the ship and governorship with taxation under this side of the House in power, the Government will face up to that comparison any release time it likes, not only in terms of comper am tence, principle and philosophy but also in adherterms of what we were left with. After walking out of office after seven years, the legacy of the former Government was a top rate of 60c in the dollar and a tax system which was described by Professor Mathews as one which had reached the situation where the payment of taxation by the rich was a matter by the not of obligation but of choice. Mr Reith-Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. Would the Prime Minister table the",14
15,Mr HAWKE,INFORMATION,I table the document. NA,14
16,Mr LEE,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"My question is addressed to the Acting Minister for Social Security. Given the Opposition's attempts to talk up fears of a recession and its call last Sunday morning for greater targeting of social security payments, can the Minister advise the House about trends in the number of people receiving unemployment benefit during the period of this Government compared with that of the previous coalition Government?",14
17,Dr BLEWETT,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"The contrast is clear and well known to all. Between May 1976 and May 1983 there was an increase in the number of people on unemployment benefit of 446,000. Between May 1983 and today-that is, May 1989-there has been a reduction of 236,000 persons receiving unemployment benefit. That contrast-a contrast between policies-is due to this Government's commitment to growth and expansion, particularly in the area of employment. In the area for which my colleague the Minister for Social Security is responsible, the emphasis has been increasingly to treat the unemployment benefit not merely as one of providing financial assistance but also of providing proposals which would, while increasing the levels of assistance, ensure that there were more in<;:entives to encourage people to go out and s.eek employment in the system. The JET and Newstart programs which I mentioned yesterday are very good examples of this approach. Both those programs are tailored to the particular needs of sole parents in one case and long term unemployment in the other. They try to. tailor personal programs to overcome the work force. bar,riers that those particular groups face, whether it be to provide child-care for sole parents or updated skills for the long term unemployed. But, while we have had these imaginative policies in this area, I think even our critics in the Opposition would acknowledge that we have been very concerned to ensure that unemployment benefits .are paid to those who are. genuinely seeking work. We have had a system of mobile review teams in every State to establish eligibility selected clients, and a whole range of review procedures has been introduced to ensure that the schemes are properly targeted. Indeed, the recent April statement carries the Government's commitment further by encouraging people to move off unemployment benefit and into employment by requiring that people seek part time or casual work in the first six weeks of unemployment. The basis. of our approach is simple: the Government believes that the best path to security and employment opportunity is through providing active incentives for people to seek employment while providing fair benefits for those who are unemployed. By way of contrast, what would be the Opposition's position? We know that it will be a return to the attitude of condescension and paternalism that we have seen in the past. The honourable member for Wentworth asked: I mean, how many genuinely needy people are there? Certainly, that kind of attitude will dominate the Opposition. Once we have got past the attitude, we find near total confusion and contradiction. We are told that there is to be a work for the dole program. Let me point out that a work for the dole program, given the present number of unemployed, would add to the bill some $700m over and above the present unemployrp.ent benefits. The reason why Mrs Thatcher, the Prime Minister of Britain, who has also nourished such a scheme as work for the dole, gave that idea away was the massive extra costs involved in such a program. That is the first part of the contradiction. Then we have had the honourable member for Wentworth promising to slash welfare. First of all he has to deal with this $700m extra as one part of the welfare prbgram. I grant that he has been fair and has acknowledged that we have dealt very well with fraud, so his cuts cannot come in the fraud area. They have to come by cutting benefits, allowances and pensions. Finally, we have the. contradiction of the honourable member for Bradfield, the shadow Minister for social security and retirement income, who said, only two weeks ago, that he did not believe that we should income test family allowances. No targeting for him. of So we have a work for the dole scheme which will increase the social welfare bill; we have a shadow Treasurer who says that we must slash and target social welfare; and we have a shadow Minister for social security and retirement income who says that there will be no targeting of family allowances, no income tests for that. That presents a picture of total confusion. What is left to the Opposition, if it is to have any credibility in this area-which it does not have· at present-is somehow to resolve that massive set of contradictions. . NA",15
18,Mr TUCKEY,INTEREST RATES,"I refer the Minister for Housing and Aged Care to statements made by leading banks, including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, that the intere!)t charges accruing. on home mortgages now exceed monthly repayments. Furthermore, in the light of the Treasurer's admission, which he made as he left the country for his overseas trip and which, by the way, was in direct contradiction to the Acting Treasurer's statements today, that the yet to be received tax cuts would only 'help people meet some of the higher repayments' resulting from the rise· in home interest rates to 17 per cent, has the Minister been advised how much extra the Australian families to which the Treasurer has referred must now find from their own pockets to cover the higher mortgage interest rates under the Government's monetary policy?",16
19,Mr STAPLES,INTEREST RATES,I have not been advised of that. The point is that this Government's record on housing is a very fine one.,16
20,Mr TUCKEY,INTEREST RATES,What about interest rates?,16
21,Mr STAPLES,INTEREST RATES,"I think if the honourable member has a question on interest rates he should address it to the Treasurer, not to me. If he wants to ask me a question on housing, I am quite happy about that because no-one else has asked me before.",16

24,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,Standing the shock is hard.,16
25,Mr STAPLES,INTEREST RATES,"Standing the shock is the problem. The Opposition goes through its housing policies one after the other, as it goes through its shadow Ministers one after the other. It has big problems right through its policies, and now it comes up with a question. The question should not even be addressed to me, but I will keep on. What has this Government done with the first home owners scheme to assist people? An amount of $1.4 billion has gone into assisting 320,000 households. This Government's housing assistance programs, including the first home owners scheme, have assisted more than 1.3 million people. That is equivalent to the total population of the· city of Perth. Over 840,000 houses have been built. They are not empty houses; they are full of Australians and their families. That is something that the Opposition did not do. What did the Opposition do under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA)? There have been about 70,000 low cost loans under the current CSHA; there will be over 200,000 in the next five years. That is what we are getting down to. That is the bottom line here. We are talking about performance here. The Opposition does not have a microeconomic policy or any macro-economic policy, and it will not come here and tell us about its fiscal policy. Members of the Opposition tell us the people should have their taxes cut, but they are not going to cuts taxes, are they? This Government has given tax cuts out of a surplus. For the first time in the history of this country we have given tax cuts out of a surplus. These are the issues that Australians are concerned about, and this Government's housing record stands on its merits. NA",16
26,Madam SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the Speaker's Callery a delegation from Saudi Arabia led by the Minister for Post, Telegraph and Telephone, His Excellency Dr Kayal.

27,Mr BLANCHARD,YOUTH EMPLOYMENT,Can the Minister for Employment and Education Services inform the House whether there has been any improvement in the· job prospects of young people and particularly what the current state of the teenage labour market is in Australia?,16
28,Mr DUNCAN,YOUTH EMPLOYMENT,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is certainly the case that teenagers and other younger people have benefited very markedly from the policies of this Government. They are the people who have shared in the 1.4 million jobs that have been created under this Government. They have not only shared in those jobs; proportionately they have seen the situation move from quite disastrous circumstances in 1982-83 when we came into government to where the unemployment rate for young people is now almost the same as it is for the adult population. That situation, as I have said, has been in marked contrast to what occurred in 1982-83. Under this Government, teenage full time unemployment has fallen by 80,100, a 50.8 per cent reduction-a halving of unemployment rates for those teenagers seeking full time work. That is an extraordinary improvement compared with the situation that this Government was confronted with when we came into office. It is in marked contrast to the situation that existed particularly in the that the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer of this nation and was receiving his advice from the now shadow Treasurer. In that period 31,000 young people were added to the dole queues of this nation. I think that is a clear indication of the sort of policy options that we would see from those on the other side of the Parliament if they were in control of the Treasury bench. Fortunately for Australia that is not likely to happen, because the people of this nation are not likely to opt again for a government that seeks to use unemployment as a principal economic tool. That was certainly the circumstance when the honourable member for Wentworth was giving advice to the honourable member for Bennelong when he was the Treasurer of this nation. This Government will never adopt the approach of saying that unemployment is a principal economic tool. The Opposition has still got the same approach. It is very interesting to refer to the press rele.ases that the Opposition has been putting out in the last few days in which it criticises this Government by saying that the only policy response that we have had is monetary policy and higher interest rates. The significant unsaid thing about that, of course, is that Opposition members, if they were in government, would use unemployment as their principal economic tool. I do not believe that the people of the nation will cop that; and they certainly would not cop it from the Opposition. They will take the appropriate steps and reject the Opposition whenever the election is held. UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN'S NA",16
29,Mr WEBSTER,FUND,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Within the context of the Government's commitment to social justice and the reference made during a recent Question Time to the Prime Minister's compassionate heart, I ask him whether he is aware of the proposal by Ken Done, Australia's goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Children's Fund, for the doubling of Australia's grant to UNICEF from $3.3m to $7m. Is he aware that such a boost would simply lift the allocation from the equivalent of less than 0.5c per head of population to time less than lc per head per week? Bearing in mind his commitment to eliminating child poverty in Australia, and given no doubt a similarly strong commitment to fighting child poverty globally, will he assure the House that UNICEF's grant will be doubled within an overall real increase in the total aid budget in the August Budget?",17
30,Mr HAWKE,FUND,"I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. Obviously, there is not a member in this House on either side who, if the fiscal circumstances were such that it were possible, would not simply say, 'Yes, we will put a tick against that. That is the sort of thing we would all like to do'. But, having heard from the Opposition the commitment of the shadow Treasurer to undertake a slashing of expenditure in the area of social welfare in this country, we would not be expecting too much from him in terms of compassion outside Australia; he has none inside the country. As far as we are concerned, we will look at the whole question of our grants in the area of assistance outside this country and we will do the very best we can to try to ensure that in a targeted way we do as much as we can.",17
31,Dr HEWSON,FUND,Targeted?,17
32,Mr HAWKE,FUND,"Obviously what I mean by that is that in our external program, as in our internal program, we have since 1983 looked at the range of programs and we have sought to give emphasis to those which we think need the most emphasis. That simply means that it is not possible, within the constraints facing this country, to do as much in the area of foreign aid as we would like to do. All I can say is that, on the record and in terms of the stated intentions from the Opposition, people both within this country and outside it who are looking for assistance would recognise .that they have much more chance of receiving that sort of assistance from this dovernment than they have from the alternative. As in this question the honourable gentleman has referred to the question of the elimination of ppverty in regard to children in this country, and as we have heard this incessant parrot cry from the Opposition about the issue of the promise not having been kept, it is appropriate that I should take this opportunity of relaying to the House an observation from sources which I hope the honourable gentleman who has asked the question would regard as reliable-I think probably he would, although I could not say the same for all those around· him. I refer to a statement on 7 May from Bishop Peter Hollingworth during a George SymeOraiion. Bishop Peter Hollingworth said: In strict income security terms, it is true that the prime ministerial promise ""that no children shall live in poverty by 1990"" . . .. will be achieved. This represents significanf progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sectors cutback and· tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. On 4 May this year the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated: . This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century has been the subject of a historic package to provide-",17
33,Mr SPENDER,FUND,Of the century?,18
34,Mr HAWKE,FUND,"These are not my words. If the honourable member wants to knock the Brotherhood of St Laurence, that· would be consistent with his whole approach. Let him understand that he is not now knocking the Prime Minister; I am easy game and I do not mind it. He should remember that in what he is saying he is knocking the Brotherhood of St Laurence. That suits me fine. I hope he will continue to do that because the judgment that will be made about him, and that should be made, will be that he is incompetent and lacking in compassion and any capacity to look at this matter in the way that it ought to be looked at-as a promise made, a promise delivered. The quote is from the Brotherhood of St Laurence. Those opposite can chortle and chuckle about the Brotherhood of St Laurence if they will. I repeat the quote of 4 May: This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century has been the subject of a historic package to provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children whose parents earn less than about $300 per week. We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. I hope that, as a result of the clear unequivocal statements, both by Bishop Peter Hollingworth and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, there will be an acceptance by those opposite, as there has been by the hundreds of beneficiaries in this country,. of both the reality of the pledge and the fact that it has been delivered six month ahead of schedule. NA Ms eRA WFORD-Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House of the benefits to be gained from an increase in day only surgery and of the steps the Government has taken to achieve such an expansion? DrLEWETTI was reading yesterday's Advertiser editorial, which all honourable members should read. I am very happy to explain the advantages of day surgery, particularly to an Opposition which does not seem to understand them, at least on the face of its present actions. If we could have greater use of day surgery, in many cases this would be more convenient to the patients. It will certainly help to reduce the hospital waiting times. It will reduce hospital costs and, of course, it will help to contain the cost of health fund contributions. In the last few years there has been a significant increase in the number of day surgery fa:cilities in this country and the Commonwealth Government has assisted both the private ·and the public sector in this development. But still less than 20 per cent of all surgical procedures are done in day surgery centres in this country, compared with between 40 per cent and 50 per cent in most comparable societies. The Government, in seeking to remove some of the obstructions to growth in day surgery, and also to provide incentives to encourage day surgery, sought in the legislation that went through this House last week to provide those incentives and to move some of those barriers. What we did was to allow for the identification of a range of largely surgical procedures which could considered as suitable for day only work, establish a new scale of benefits for those procedures. It is important to stress that those changes it remained entirely the deciin sion of the patient's doctor as to whether the procedure should be done on a the patient admitted for an overnight stay. I have now learned that these proposals are to be obstructed, as well as other proposals in that legislation. I must say that the shadow spokesperson's explanation of this is the most incredible all the tissue of arguments he has advanced on this matter. He said that we are rushing into day surgery and have not consulted ficiently with medical organisations and mentioned in particular the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee. Let me say that all those statements, except the last, nonsense. Two years ago we took our proon posals to the Australian Health Ministers' Conference and got approv\ll that day gery procedures should be reviewed. Since then we have consulted with over 20' organisations, including 12 medical organisations, all health funds and all free-standiQg day surgery centres and we have continued discussions with all State governments, irrematters, spective of whether their politics are supporceipt tive of these changes. It is true that we have not consulted with the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee, which is a body the honourable member mentioned. Although we invited it two years ago to take part in consultations, it is only in the last couple weeks that it has shown any evidence of really wanting to talk with the Government about this matter. What the Opposition is doing again in matter, as in so many other matters in the health field, is simply supporting the obstrucmatters. tion of a minority element in this whole, health field in order to delay something which has been discussed over a period of two years and which has the support of all State ernments and State health Ministers. The Opposition goes on about waiting lists. All health Ministers are agreed that we could --eut by something like 20 per cent the waiting times in our public hospitals with better day resurgery procedures. I have to say to the honourable member that, after that analysis, if he is not prepared to reconsider the kind be of obstructive tactics to prevent this useful and and widely supported set of proposals going through, I must agree with the Advertiser's in comment of yesterday in which it said that relation to health matters the Opposition seemed to care more for playing politics than day basis or for ordinary people.

35,Madam SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! Further to my statement yesterday, a matter was raised in the Senate last night which relates to the of security of the' sound reinforcement system in committee rooms. As I informed the House, each committee room is fitted with a sufsound reinforcement system which may also he be used to broadcast proceedings on the internal broadcast systems throughout the building. I am advised that the meeting in are question was publicly announced and listed the television monitors throughout the building. There is some evidence to suggest surthat the broadcast system may have been active during the meeting in question. I have asked the Serjeant-at-Arms and the Parliamentary Information Systems Office to make an urgent and full investigation of the our matter. I am very concerned about these  of a full report on it, the President and I will direct that the system be modified in such a manner as to ensure that participants in meetings in the committee rooms will be aware at all times of the status of the broadthe casting and sound reinforcement systems in of the rooms.

37,Madam SPEAKER,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"I have received a in letter from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be mitted to the House for discussion, namely: The impact of the Government's failed economic policies on families and small business. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members reper quired by the Standing Orders having in their places",20
38,Mr TUCKEY,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"It is with great concern that the Opposition brings to the Parliament this matter of public portance. We have great concern for the . people involved, the people we represent. We are speaking about the impact of the Government's failed economic policies on families and small business. As you would know, Madam Speaker, there is a great link between families and small business, simply because in the Australian context families are small business. Yesterday in the Senate the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, said: SENATE . . . some of the economic commentators . . . warned that a tight monetary policy, if held in place for too long, might overshoot, and that is a danger. It may be no more than a danger for the honourable senator, but it would be a disaster for many in small business. He went on to say: Nobody can be certain that he is correct about when it is appropriate to relax that monetary policy. Some form of lottery now operates. in terms of the Government's control of the economy. Furthermore, today on the Pru Goward show, a woman caller admitted to being forced to sell her family home because she Shipcould no longer afford the repayments. Is it not amazing that today the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) brazenly told us, with callous disregard, that it was not his business to know what sorts of pressures increased home interest rates were placing upon people such as this lady? He said may be it was some other Minister's problem. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care was unable to tell the Parliament, with even any reasonable estimate, what the costs are to people like the lady who rang in today Canberra-the city of the highest per capita income in Australia-to tell Pru Goward that she had to sell her home. She went on subto tell Pru Goward that she had had the privilege of a 13.5 per cent first mortgage, but it was the 20 per cent interest rate she had to pay on the second mortgage that did the damage. Under this Government's policies, people have to have a second mortgage because the traditional $40,000 loan at 13.5 cent interest just does not buy any porrisen tion of a house any more. This lady also said that she knew of many other people-I presume they were also in Canberra-who were selling their homes for imthe same reason. We now need to reassure those people. My proposal is that the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), give them the story that he gave them this morning, that they have absolutely nothing to worry about. That is what the Acting Treasurer told us at Question Time. By some convoluted, creative accounting the Acting Treasurer told them that their costs are up by only $11 a week. They are all making decisions to walk out of their homes, but the Acting Treasurer tells them they have absolutely nothing to worry about. Of course he comes from a background where an extra $100 a month on a housing loan has never been a great problem; he could always sell one of uncle's horses or have a few bets on the derby winner and everything would be all right. Although he has told them that there is absolutely nothing to worry about, these people see it differently. They have a simple economic indicator; it is called their purse, wallet or passbook. Those indicators are telling them that they are in deep financial trouble. Today thousands of ordinary families are asking themselves one chilling question: Can we afford to hang on; can we afford to hang on to our home or our small business under this Government's high interest rate regime? To use the jargon of the Government, they have already made the appropriate policy adjustments at home. In most cases both family members are now working, often to the detriment of their children. Families have reduced their consumption spending to the bone but they are still unable to make ends meet. Small business has actually experienced higher turnover but this increased turnover has been of little value. All their gains have been eroded-in fact, negatedby rising taxation, interest rates and tion. Many have expanded their businesses to accommodate this increase in turnover. They now find that they are simply working harder to pay the increased interest charges that this Government· has decreed in its clumsy attempt to throttle the economy that it originally inflated. Honourable members should remember, as it is often forgotten, that the first four Keating Budgets set this economy alight. The Hawke-Keating Government chose to overspend $26,000m because it thought it was smart at the time. It completely overlooked the fact that the economy was recovering without its help. This Government has created a merry-goround that it now chooses to throttle with these extremely high interest rates. Further, it is worth noting that the people who are suffering the most are those who have already made their investment decisions, whether it be in business, a home or consumer goods. They have borrowed the money and they have spent it. They are not intending to create any further demand. They are the victims, not the people who are now contemplating some form of investment or expenditure that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is worried about stopping. The simple fact is that they can make a judgment on today's interest rates. The people for whom I express concern· today are not those whom the Treasurer wants to stop spending; I am worried for the people who have already spent - nd bought a home at an interest rate. of 15 per cent and for the people who have gone into business and borrowed money at 16 per cent. They are locked in. The Treasurer, who only sees forward on this issue, is not concerned whatsoever about the damage he is doing to the people who made their decision some time ago. These people have already spent, urged on by the predictions of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that interest rates would fall and not rise. In January this year the Prime Minister said that interest rates have risen far enough and need not go any higher. They were then 18:5 per cent for small business and 15 per cent for housing; today they are 21.5 per cent for small business with some businesses paying as high as 24 per cent, and 17 per cent for housing. That does not only cast aspersions upon the Prime Minister's judgment; it also casts asinfla- persions upon his credibility. As I say, the people who have spent already will face extinction when the Government achieves its objective of reduced business activity, let alone the spectre now raised by Senator Walsh that the Government may have already achieved overkill. The Finance Minister, Senator Walsh, has said that a tight monetary policy held in place too long might overshoot, and that is a danger. We got no encouragement today in the Prime Minister's answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). We got the usual rhetoric and the usual history lesson, but we never got advice as to how the Government's strategy will stop these high interest rates. The Prime Minister did not bother to lay that out. We gave him the opportunity to do so in the simplest form. We referred to the problems that forecasters have in this area. The Prime Minister brushed them aside and relied entirely on rhetoric and history lessons. I am waiting for the day when he gets up in this chamber and wants to blame something that has happened today on Billy Hughes when he was Liberal Prime Minister. He is about the only bloke he has not blamed so far. He did nothing to allay our fears on Senator Walsh's warnings. If one reviews the continuing economic disasters presided over by this Government, the likelihood of the overshoot that Senator Walsh has predicted is almost a certainty. In terms of overconsumption, the simple fact is that goods entering Australia now have not yet been consumed. In most cases the goods are still on the shelves, where they are moving much more slowly, adding to the financing costs of small business. The Government, of course, does not know this. Members opposite are not in the habit of going out to the coal face of small business and asking small business operators how their business is going. They do not do that. Of course, the Treasurer, the man who might do that, is overseas-and there is no evidence of the plight of Australian small business in the antique shops of Paris or Leningrad. The only advice the Treasurer will receive in Russia is how to mismanage an economyand God save perestroika if he is there to give the Russians some advice! Australian families and Australian small businesses are suffering from identical burdens, all of which have been created by the Hawke-Keating Government. The first relates to high and increasing interest rates. As I said earlier, in 1983 small business was paying 15.5 per cent interest and home buyers were paying 12.5 per cent. Today, small business operators are paying 21 per cent or 24 per cent, while housing loans are at 17 per cent-assuming that one can get a first mortgage. Of course, we have international comparisons. The Government has been at great pains to tell us in here about the disasters of 1982-83. However, members opposite never mention the drought or that we had an international recession. According to them, it all related to something that happened here. However, of course, when anything internationally moves against the Government, members opposite shout it from the rooftops. We had a drought in 1982-83 and Australia had a government which managed the situation in a very successful way. The inheritance left by the Fraser Government enabled the Hawke Government to pick up the Fraser initiatives, in relation to which he made sure that the Australian agricultural industries were in a position to recover-and their recovery carried this country out of its problems. Throughout the Fraser years, if interest rates were high here they were high overseas. Today, interest rates overseas are at record lows; 4 and 5 per cent in Tokyo and less than 10 per cent in many parts of Europe. It is Australia that is the land of high interest today. It is no longer in parallel with the rest of the world. It is small business which is feeling this the worse. Small business people cannot go overseas and take the opportunity to borrow money from foreign countries at low interest rates and offset costs and hedge against currency movements by having international business enterprises. Small business people have to borrow at home and they pay whiltever the Government decrees. The loss of real disposable income since March 1983 for a family with a single income is about $58 a week for average weekly earners, and for a family with three children it is about $63 a week. We have high and increasing taxation and high and increasing inflation. In the few minutes left to me, I would like to refer quickly to the fate of a family which was considering a business investment at the beginning of the calendar year. At that time such a family would have been aware that local consumption was buoyant and would have been attracted to go into business. They may have worried about interest rates being volatile but, in their opinion, at 18 per cent they were just affordable. They needed about a $100,000 loan. They would have heard the Prime Minister of Australia announce in Perth during the Western Australian election campaign that interestrates were going to fall. They did not know, as the Prime Minister has since admitted in this Parliament, that he had made that statement without any supporting advice from the numerous sources that are available to him. They were not to know that it was an opportunistic statement and a pure· figment of the Prime Minister's imagination. They then heard words from the Treasurer-political statements defending his policies-such as those which appeared in the Australian of Thursday, 2 March: The economic policy mix and the economic strategy upon which the mix is based, that is, strong ment, moderate consumption and falling public expenditure are correct. That is what the Treasurer said. Put simply, those business people were convinced. They had heard Australia's two leaders tell them that things were good, that interest rates were falling and that economic policy was: correct. So they took the risk and borrowed their money, even at $18,000 a year in interest. Today, as they contemplate their future, they are now talking about $20,000 of interest; inflation is almost double the Treasurer's predictions and is increasing their government charges; and stock inventory now requires additional borrowing. They have discovered that fringe benefits taxes are impinging on their profits in a way that they did not understand, and they have discovered that capital gains taxes will remove the opportunity for their business investment to support them in their retirement. Notwithstanding that small business people read daily newspapers stating that over 400,000 people are still in receipt of unemployment benefit, they cannot get reliable or experienced staff. Their attempts to train people have been frustrated by trade union bureaucrats who demand unrealistic remuneration and training packages. To add to all that, Senator Walsh tells them that the Government cannot guarantee that it knows when it will have to stop applying the monetary screws sufficiently to achieve a soft landing. In other words, if they survive the Government's high interest rate policy they are likely to be wiped out by an economic crash. If our typical small business family decides to be involved in a business which has links with imports and exports, and requires the direct services of freight and handling, it cannot expect the Government to impose any decent reform on the waterfront, and all these areas where billions are at stake-",20
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND SMALL BUSINESS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,23
40,Mr WRIGHT,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"1 welcome the opportunity to enter this debate. It is time we put on the record what this Government has done to help families. It surprises me that the Opposition would investeven dare to put such a matter on the Notice Paper. I wish to quickly list some matters, because my main intention is to speak about small businesses and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) can speak at some length about families. We should record immediately that it was this Government that introduced Medicare, which has provided an all-covering health scheme for 2,000,000 families which previously had no health cover. We introduced the first home owners financial assistance scheme which helped more than 300,000 families in the low to moderate income area. We provided a real increase in housing expenditure, and 14 per cent funding for public housing. We provided an additional 68,000 child-care places, with another 30,000 to be provided by 1992-93. That is an increase of something like 200 per cent since 1983. There has been the introduction of major changes in the tertiary level of education, and some 40,000 extra tertiary places will be available by 1991. There is the rental assistance scheme which has helped hundreds of thousands of Australians and the tax free family allowance supplement, known as F AS, which has assisted 550,000 low income families across this nation. In addition, there have been changes in the tax system which have brought about fairer taxes, and a better distribution of taxes through the introduction of the assets and other tests. There have been major changes to the tax rates themselves with a threshold of $5,099 and a major lowering of the marginal tax rates. There was a new child support scheme, reforms in the superannuation tax system, increases in family allowances themselves, an attack on child poverty-and the list goes on and on. Yet the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) talks about this Government not helping families. What nonsense. That is the same nonsense as he talked about small business people. The first thing he referred to was rising taxes, but it was this Government which changed and reduced the tax levels for business from 49c in the dollar to 39c. It is this Government which did something about double taxing, where tax was paid at a company level and then on dividends. The Hawke Labor Government has addressed that problem. We appreciate the importance of small business in this nation. There are 700,000 small businesses in Australia and some 600,000 of those are in the non-farm sector. They make up 95 per cent of Australia's enterprises. They employ some 50 per cent of the total employment in the private sector. It is our Government which has addressed the problems in that field. The real significance is that 90 per cent of the job creation that has taken place in this nation under the Hawke Government has occurred in the small business area. How would those businesses have been - ble to employ these hundreds of thousands of people unless they were viable and making profits? The facts are on the record. Let us compare that with the time when the Opposition was in power. In the last 10 years in Queensland the failure rate of small business-remember that Queensland has a National Party government and previously had a Liberal-National Party governmentwas 70 per cent. I repeat: 70 per cent of small businesses failed within three years. The rate has now come down slightly. At a national level, under the Fraser Government between 1975-78 and 1978-82, we find that two out of every three small businesses failed within a five-year period. This happened because of the Opposition's policies. No doubt there are many reasons for those failures. One may talk about lack of management and insufficient finance, but it comes back to economic environment, and that is the major difference between a Liberal government and our Government. When people start making judgments they realise that the Hawke Government created, in the period 1983-88, and ongoing, a favourable business environment. There has been a business surplus. Public sector borrowing has been reduced to the lowest possible levels. There has been an increase in the flow of funds available to small business. This has come about because of the deregulation of capital markets and the awarding of 16 new bank licences-things that between 1978 and 1982-83 the former Government was not prepared to address. We have seen a change in the charter of the Commonwealth Bank, which has been expanded to allow equity investment in small business. The management and investment companies (MICs) scheme has been introduced to provide venture capital for small business. As I said before, taxation rates have been reduced from. 49 per cent to 39 per cent. Dividend imputation has been introduced, accompanied by the removal of double taxation-something the former Government talked about but did nothing about.. The tax deductability of superannuation contributions for self-employed people has doubled from $1,500 a year to $3,000 a year during the period this Government has been in office. Despite the pressure placed on the former Liberal-National Government by the insurance companies, it did nothing about it. This is the sort of thing that helps small business. When looking at the costs of small business, we must look at the cost of regulation. It is the Hawke Government that set up the Business Regulation Review Unit; it is the Hawke Government that is bringing down changes in regulation; it is the Hawke Government that is getting rid of the waste and the cost and the inefficiency in small business; and it is the Hawke Government that introduced, through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the publication Small Business in Australia, broadening the information base for small business operators, providing them with the data they need to make sure their. businesses run well. Information is vital. The reason we set up the National Industry Extension Service was mainly to help small and medium sized enterprises, particularly those in manufacturing, to develop an international competitive edge in producing manufactured goods and services. We can add to that Austrade, the specific industry development strategies and the many other microeconomic reforms, all aimed at helping small businesses to lower their costs, improve their efficiency, broaden their markets and tap new areas to enable them to sell their products, and assisting in the retail sector. There is more to come. It has been announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and by Ministers in this House that the Government intends to deregulate the transport and communications sector. There are also reforms pending in certain work practices with which we all agree: targets aimed at improving productivity and reform in education and training to enhance skills. The reforms are working and are in place. This is not something we just talk about; it has been happening for almost six years. We have seen the results: remarkable growth in the number of small businesses and the profitability of small businesses. Let us take a couple of examples. In the tourism industry, we have seen a massive change in small business operations. Before this Government came to power, some 600,000 tourists came to Australia. That was at the height of the Fraser era. In 1983, the first year under the Hawke Government, that figure rose to 700,000. Last year 2.3 million people visited this country. The flow-on effect in the food, transport and entertainment industries-in fact, in every area-has been seen. It has meant dollars in the pockets of small business and jobs for people working in the hospitality and tourist industries. The work force has increased from 250,000 in 1983 to 700,000 now. When this Government took over, the tourist industry was worth $7 billion. Today, it is worth more than four times that amount-$29 billionbecause of policies that have been developed by this Government. I want to make a particular reference to the previous Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), for guiding and leading this Government and this nation in the development of the tourism industry during that period. This is another example of what this Government has done for small business, particularly in the tourism sector. How many businesses benefit from the tourist area? We probably could never count them because everyone gains in some way. But this is not the only area of reform. There have been reforms in the service sector as well. There has been a massive increase some 76 per cent, in employment in that s-ctor. There has been a major change, a change that has been felt right across this nation. Yet the honourable member for O'Connor has the audacity to stand up here and talk about problems and. calamities in the small business area. Obviously he does not move around his electorate; he does not talk to small business people. He is not in line with the thinking of small business people, because they have hailed the polici-s of this Government. Every member of this chamber who is prepared to be honest and open about this issue will tell the House how many small .business peopl.e have - ome to them seeking access to the mformahon services the funding, the research grants and all the'types of assistance from this Government. I suggest to the honourable member that he take the time, if he has the time, to read the Small Business Review 1987, produced by the Bureau of Industry Economics Small Business Research Unit. I suggest that he look at page 10, where Commonwealth initiatives are set out. It shows page after page of things this Government has done aimed at the business sector, and the results are on the board. That is the real difference. We have realised the importance of the small business sector. We have not just talked about it we have not just presented a policy paper; i-stead we have taken action. The dollars are in the cash registers and the jobs are in the work place. The people realise that our policies have worked. It amazes me that the honourable' member would come forward with such a matter. I can understand his. wanting to argue about interest rates. No Government wants high interest rates. That is a difficult situation for any government, and no-one would hold interest rates up one minute longer than was necessary. The honourable member should be open and honest about the issue and admit, as we on this side of the House are saying, that the problem has been caused by imports and by the debts.",23
41,Mr TUCKEY,AND SMALL BUSINESS,Whose fault is that?,25
42,Mr WRIGHT,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"The honourable member asks who is causing that. It is the private sector. I recently went through some of the retail stores in this nation and I found that 90 of every 100 retail products are imported. The honourable member should have a look at them. I believe it is time we took the position taken by the Americans involved in the chain store industry. Mr Walton, who owns many chain stores in that country, has said to his managers across the nation, 'If there is an American product, buy it' first.' I suggeSt that we need to do just that. (Quorum formed) In the half second that I have left I would like to say that the calling of that quorum is typical of the hypocrisy of the Opposition. The Opposition brings forward a matter of public importance and then uses the quorum to ensure that Government members are not able to speak to the issue. The case has been put. It is quite clear that this is the Government that sets the environment for small business and cares for the families of Australia.",25
43,Mr IAN ROBINSON,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"-The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) has made one of the weakest and most ineffective responses to a matter of public importance that I can ever remember in this House. The reason is that he cannot answer the issues raised by the Opposition on this all important matter. We chose today to bring to the notice of this Parliament and the people of Australia the impact of the Government's failed economic policies as they affect families and small business. The honourable member for Capricornia did everything but talk about that aspect. The economy has drifted into a worsening state, as the honourable member well knows, with home loan interest rates rising to a record 17 per cent. Of course, there are even higher interest rates for loaris, overdrafts and accommodation for small business. Mr Rocher-There are more increases in prospect.",26
44,Mr IAN ROBINSON,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"As the honourable member just interjected, there are more increases in prospect. Let us examine the reason for that. Unfortunately, the Government has decided on an economic policy determination and this was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the April statement. Despite the fact that things have gone horribly wrong since that time, he is just too proud of his own past. He is absolutely impervious to suggestions. I dare say that he is not even influenced in the slightest by the apparent concern of so many members of his own Party. Despite what the honourable member for Capricornia has said about deregulation of the banking industry and assistance for low income earners in the housing field, the banks of this country are in dire trouble simply because of the policies of the Government. They are saying so loud and clear. We saw the Treasurer appear on a television program a weekend or so ago. His utterances were insulting to the management of the banks of this country and he got the response he deserved from the banking institutions. They made it very clear' that Government policy is taking this nation to the brink. The impact of the increase in our foreign debt and current account deficit is absolutely horrific. The Government is not prepared to answer the proposition put by the Opposition on this issue. The reason is that the Government is committed to a policy dictated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), a policy which is just not working. The major issues are in a complete and utter mess. Those major issues are productivity and the need for a cost structure in this country that makes us competitive on the world market. At the same time, the honourable member for Capricornia wants to blame the Waltons Bond Ltd chain, or some ridiculous thing like that, for the massive imports that are flowing into this country. What utter hypocrisy! The reason for the inflow of imports of that kind simply relates to the ratio of costs to the Australian production lines. We do not produce in this country a wide range of goods. This lamentable situation has been caused by the Government's economic policies. Let me come back for a moment to the increase in housing loans which is causing such dire trouble for so many people. It is all very well to say, as the Minister said this afternoon, that there are all sorts of statistics that can be quoted on first home ownership, housing assistance and so on, but let us take the facts. The issue is one that affects those home owners who have raised a loan and now are committed to paying it back. I have some figures that reveal with some clarity the situation of an ordinary family. On a loan of $40,000, raised a comparatively short time ago when interest rates were at 12.5 per cent-they subsequently rose to 13.5 per cent-the repayment at the outset was $420 a month. Since that time interest rates have gone up to 14.5 per cent and now to the astronomical level of 17 per cent. Without taking into account the latest interest rise calculation, the repayment on that $40,000 loan has risen to no less than $550 per month. Mr Adermann-How much?",26
45,Mr IAN ROBINSON,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"No less than $550 per month. In this particular instance that I am quoting, the income of the breadwinner is $317 a week. The family budget shows that, after paying for essentials-repayments of the home loan, electricity, water rates, insurance, telephone, car registration and the like-there is $40 left from that level of income to feed' and clothe the parents and children of that family. That is the issue we raise today. That is the question that is in the minds of the average middle income Australian family which is absolutely caught by Government policies and a government unwilling even to look at or recognise the real problem. There has been no decision on the part of the Government to take any action whatsoever. It has let this horrific situation run and hopes for the best. That is just not good enough and it will not work out. The simple reason is that the trends economically in this country and externally spell doom for the Government's policies. Until it makes a major change-a change that was hoped for last April but did not come, a change that was denied the thinking people of this nation-what prospect do we face? Will the August Budget be another fake Budget? Will it address these issues? Time does not permit one to talk about the real problems of small business. Small business people are in absolutely dire straits, for two reasons: interest rates and escalating costs. They are the big employer in this nation and they face a grim winter and a grim outlook for the rest of this year. The position of the farming sector is too , horrible to contemplate. There is no way that a farming enterprise can meet these increases in interest rates and do all the necessary things to motivate productivity and then compete on a world market that provi des no margin whatever. It is down to bedrock for returns in investment in farming and small business. . I mentioned that the Government has an opportunity. It has an opportunity with the August Budget, if it wishes to take it. Will it take that challenge? Will it face up to its responsibilities between now and August or will it take one of two options: rush off to an early election and escape the responsibility and try to tell the people of this country that through. tax cuts and other phoney manoeuvres all will be well, when it is so patently clear that this is a course that will not work; or construct a fake Budget, as it has done for the past 2t years? If there was any honesty in the earlier Budgets, that was blown away by the May economic statement of 1987, the May economic statement of 1988, followed by a Budget that was really a phoney document, and now we have had the April statement. What have been the consequences of that? Since April the economy has worsened in monumental proportions, and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have run away from it. The Opposition, on behalf of thinking Australians-those people who are in dire need-puts forward this proposition this afternoon because of its concern for all Australians, but in particular those families who, in order to have a roof over their heads, depend on being able to repay the loan that made it possible for them to live in better circumstances. They face a grim outlook, as do small business people who, sadly, are equally badly affected.",27
46,Mr JENKINS,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"Nothing which has been said by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) or the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson) proves that the notion put before us is in any way a definite matter of public importance. It is simply part of the Opposition's desperate attempt to win the hearts and minds of middle Australia. It is predicated on the notion that the Opposition has a mortgage on concern for families and, therefore, is patent and arrant nonsense. If we look at what happened in Question Time we will see a number of areas which prove that this matter of public importance is patently wrong. One of the first questions that was answered in Question Time today· related to employment. The Acting Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) presented information to the House which indicated that in the years from 1976 to 1983 there had been an increase of some 446,000 in the number of people receiving unemployment benefit. When we compare this with the period from May 1983 to the present we see that there has been a decrease of 236,000 in the number of people receiving unemployment benefit. As we all know, there has been . a great expansion in employment under this Government. Under this Government in excess of 1.3 million new jobs have been created because of the historic cooperation between the Government and the union movement under the accord. The rates of unemployment have fallen from the double digit figures of the previous coalition Government to much lower figures. The next topic placed before us in Question Time was in the area of housing. Again the Government can quite rightly come before the House with a performance which should be given some regard. If we look at the information given in Question Time, we see that some 1.3 million Australians have been assisted through the first home owners scheme. Some 840,000 houses have been built with the assistance of the first home owners scheme. Under the previous coalition Government a measly 70,000 homes were built under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement, whereas in the next five years 200,000 homes will go to low income families. As was emphasised in Question Time, in the areas of micro-economics, macro-economics and fiscal policy, the Opposition is devoid of any policies. This is a sad indictment of the present political situation that we find in Australia. If Opposition members parade themselves as an alternative government, one might expect that they should come before the Australian people and indicate their policies in some of those major areas that impinge on the quality of life of Australian families. They should say what they would carry out if we ever had the misfortune of their being elected. Fortunately, that is an unlikely occurrence. Another topic raised in Question Time, which was quite adequately explained in favour of the Government, was the child poverty pledge of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the last election campaign. We heard the sniggers of Opposition members when that was mentioned. We should look at some of the outstanding endorsements of that pledge and the Government's success. The Prime Minister quoted Bishop Peter Hollingworth, who has said: In strict income security terms, it is true that the Prime Ministerial promise ""that no children shall live in poverty by 1990"" . . . will be achieved. Bishop Hollingworth went on to say: This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. There we have an eminent Australian indicating that this Government, whilst not ignoring the necessity of the economic actions that have had to be taken, has displayed an ability still to work towards a social justice objective. Why do those opposite continually cry poor? We are forced continually to compare the record of the dark years of the previous coalition Government with the present Government's performance. We need to go back to those comparisons because it is simply impossible-to compare our performance with any policy of the coalition. In all of these major areas there is no indication of what the Opposition would do. Of course, we have that wonderful 'Futile Diversions' document, entitled Future Directions, released late last year. It is simply a cobbledtogether document. It is merely a series of motherhood statements, with no basis and no indications of how things to which it refers might be achieved. While that has been put forward, the Government has conducted the necessary analysis and research into the needs of Australian families. That is important because, if we try to seek out what the Opposition might or might not do, we go back to the comments of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), at the weekend when he indicated that spending on welfare, education and health could be cut under a coalition government. He gave no specifics-just a warning of what is likely to occur under a coalition government. It is simply nonsense to expect us to debate this type of matter of public importance, which expresses some form of concern for Australian families and small business, when we on this side of the House are unable to debate alternative policy options put forward by the Opposition. It is completely crass of the Opposition to bring forward such a matter without suggesting where it would. do things differently. Let us look at some of the issues mentioned by the good professor, the honourable member for Wentworth, at the weekend. He mentioned welfare spending under the Labor Government. We have seen an increase of 8.4 per cent in the age pension. During the years of the Fraser Government the increase was 2.3 per cent. What a nonsense for him to suggest that we need more adequate targeting. Already the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has praised Australia for its targeting of social security and indicated that our education programs are also well targeted. The honourable member for Wentworth said: I mean, how many genuine needy people are What a nonsense to predicate policy decisions on that sort of position. In the area of education and. post-primary school retention rates, 60 per cent of students commencing secondary school now go through to year 12. That compares with the figure in 1983 of 36 per cent. We have created 49,000 new tertiary student places. Yet members of the Opposition talk about what the policies of t-e Government are doing to families. They do not look at the breadth of policy decisions and the effect that they can have on fat:nilies. It is a wonder that they have the cheek to say that there is something wrong with what is happening to Australian families. The third area mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth was health. Under Medicare, two million Australians have a form of medical cover that they did not have under the previous Government. The honourable member for O'Connor, who brought forward this matter of public importance, was at one stage the shadow Minister for health. He ran around the countryside scaring Australian families with all his suggestions about where health policy might go . under a coalition government. How can any Australian family feel assured when people such as the honourable member for O'Connor are in senior positions on the front bench of the Opposition? it was interesting that the honourable member for O'Connor was able to contain himself during Question Time and thus be with us to bring forward this matter of public importance. We all remember. what happened last week when he had submitted another matter of .public importance but could not contain his normal behaviour. It should be emphasised, as it was emphasised at Question Time, that the Government's record stands on its merits. The underlying base of this matter of public importance is a nonsense. As such, the implications that it brings forward should be totally rejected. At some stage over the next 12 months the Australian community will have the opportunity once again to reject a tired coalition that cannot put forward alternative strategies.",27
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND SMALL BUSINESS,"Order! The honourable member's there? time has expired. The discussion is concluded. NA NA Motion (by Mr Humphreys for Mr Beazley) proposed: That this House authorises: (I) the Speaker to make arrangement for the preliminary proceedings relating to the introduction of the Appropriation Bill (No. I) 1989-90, all or part of the second reading speech of the Treasurer, and all or part of the reply to that speech by the Leader \If the Opposition to be televised; (2) the direct, live broadcast of all or part of those proceedings by any television station provided that a station broadcasts both speeches live and gives approximately equal time to both speeches; and (3) the use by any television station of any part of the televised proceedings in subsequent news, current affairs and documentary programs.",29
48,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPEECH AND REPLY,"On behalf of the Opposition I signify our support of this standard motion to effect the televising of the Budget Speech for 1989-90. In so doing, I point out that the exact dates of the two telecasts involved, that of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) delivering the Budget Speech and that of the Leader of the Op left flexible. That may be just as well, depending on what mayor may not happen in the course of this winter recess. On the program previously circulated, the Parliament was due to resume on Tuesday, 15 August, which suggests that the Budget will be presented on the night of Tuesday, 15 August, with a reply by the Leader of the Opposition on an equal time basis in accordance with the standard formula. This motion, in effect, allows synchronised voice and picture grabs of the proceedings of this House. Last week I raised a matter which relates to the motion-",29
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEECH AND REPLY,Thehonotirable member for Farrer should not canvass a matter that will be before the House in another form at a later date. He should stick to the motion.,30
50,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPEECH AND REPLY,"I accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I just want to mention that this motion authorises synchronised voice and picture grabs from this chamber on the two occasions of the Budget and the reply of the Leader of the Opposition. I recognise that last week when I raised this matter channels 2, 7 and 9 had not technically breached synchronisation, but that points to how complex the question of breaching synchronisation is. This motion clearly gives a green light for synchronised coverage of both the Budget Speech and the Leader of the Opposition in reply. I realise that the other matter is before a committee and I will not dwell on that, except to say that the coalition supports the provision of the synchronised grabs. I gather that that is not necessarily the Government's view. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 11 May, on the following papers presented by Mr Simmons: Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-Joint Comcomment: mittee-Report-Persbnnel wastage in the Australian Defence ForceGovernment response, dated 11 May 1989. Ministerial statement, 11 May 1989. and on motion by Mrs Kelly: That the House take note of the papers.",30
51,Mr CROSS,DEFENCE FORCE,"As Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I would like to express, on behalf of the Committee, our pleasure at the response from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) on 11 May to our report entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence ForceReport and Recommendations. That inquiry was probably the most participatory inquiry that the Committee has ever held in terms of the input from members of the Australian Defence Force at all levels and from other people interested in the defence of Australia. I would like to express my personal appreciation to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), to the previous Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), and, of course, to her successor, the honourable member for Cal-re (Mr Simmons), for the attention that they have given to a range of these matters. I was also pleased to see the comments made by the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) and other senior members of the Defence Force about the usefulness of the report in identifying the concerns of so many people in the Se'tvices and in being the basis of a comprehensive and thorough examination of all the matters raised. When one debates a 'matter of this kind it follows that one concentrates on the matters which one does not think have been adequately dealt with. But that is not to say that a large number of the recommendations that have been made have not been dealt with in a most appropriate way. I would like to focus some attention on several matters arising from our report and the reply of the Minister. Recommendation 21 deals with remuneration. The reply from the Minister focuses on the summary of our recommendation and spells out that the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal is an independent body. The Minister makes this The only limitation placed on the Tribunal is the requirement that it should have regard to principles determined by the Industrial Relations Commission. These principles include the national wage guidelines. When we look at the report-and I refer to paragraph 7.41' on page 267-we see that we were not suggesting that the Defence Force should break out of the wage guidelines. Naturally, we accept that all areas of employment in Australia should be bound by the national wage guidelines. We were saying that, following the report of theColdham Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay, the so-called committee of review, the Defence Force incurred a wage freeze, as other sections of the community incurred a wage freeze, and certain recommendations of the Cold ham report were not given effect to. We heard from people in various areas and from many people in the Defence Force that they believed that the base on which they had gone forward was inappropriate. Paragraph 7.41 in our report is as follows: Accordingly, while we support the establishment of the DFRTthe Defence Force Remuneration Tribunalwe believe that the wage base from which percentage increases awarded by the Tribunal apply may be wrong; at the least, the method by which that base has evolved is questionable. As long as that base remains unchallenged, therefore, doubts about the adequacy imd correctness of ADF salaries will justifiably continue. This unsatisfactory circumstance is compounded by the fact that the DFRT has prevented any inquiry into the correctness of the CORthe committee of reviewdeterminations by consistently holding itself bound by National Wage Case lines . . . Consequently, Service personnel 'have found themselves locked into a' system in which the starting-point may be unfair, but the rules have prevented any challenge. So the substance of our proposal is that the Remuneration Tribunal should look at that base to determine whether what has been said to us by numerous officers and men and women of the Defence Force about the anomalies at that time are true. We have not purported to answer that question. It is an important question in the Defence Force and we believe that it should be looked at. Another matter dealing with remuneration that I would like to deal with is the way in which these matters are handled by the Department of Industrial Relations. We received evidence from a number of people to the effect that there were untimely delays in the Department. The Minister, in his response, made the comment that the Department had not been given an opportunity to reply. I would have to say that that is not true. An officer of that Department attended many of our hearings and the minutes of our hearings were sent to the Department. So I would not like it to go on the record that that Department did not have an opportunity to make a further submission, if that was considered by it to be appropriate. Honourable members will appreciate that when the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal was set up, there was some criticism that the material going to the Tribunal was prepared by the Department of Defence. Many people in the Defence Force and elsewhere argued that it was one arm of the Defence Force, as it were, arguing against the other. In other words, the Department was arguing against the CI>F and the Australian Defence Force itself. Consequently, this responsibility was transferred to the Department of Industrial Relations. I would just like to say a few things about that. Whatever department actually handles the carriage of those matters, the important thing to remember is that our industrial relations system is geared to assist unions and employers. In many respects it is a confrontation system, driven by the need to resolve industrial disputes. Many people in the Defence Force resent what they regard as long deillys in dealing with important matters, Guidesuch as adjusting allowances and other conditions of service, because, they are not able to take industrial action; they do not belong to a union; and they regard themselves as being, I suppose, in a special circumstance needing some of the protection of government as they are not able to go down the industrial relations track. So, whoever has the carriage of these matters, it is important that they be dealt with in a timely way. From my point of view, I have been pleased with the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. It was unfortunate that the first determination it brought down was about service allowances, and that was not well received. At that time the Australian Defence Force had not realised what was required to act in an industrial situation. It has come a long way since then. Mr Tim Fischer-They did mess it up.",30
52,Mr CROSS,DEFENCE FORCE,"While there was a lot of dissatisfaction about that I am sure. that the honourable member for Farrer, who is. seated at the table, would agree that, since that time, the decisions of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal have been well received. I believe that many of these matters, including adjusting allowances, should be able to be handled by executive decision on the basis of the same formula that applies to the national wage case or the cost of living, and the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal should be targeted towards the big issues. Naturally, with the decision to refer this whole question of pay to the Tribunal, it will have a big task on its hands. We wish it well in that important responsibility. Recommendation 28 relates to education. While our proposal was not agreed to at this stage, the Minister commented that the specific recommendations made by the Subcommittee are currently under interdepartmental examination along with other options aimed at extending the availability of the allowance. I understand that, even with the extended availability of this allowance, little more that 80 members of the Australian Defence Force actually received the allowance. We have had evidence from people-indeed, we had people expressing opinions in the course of our ordinary Committee contacts-about the equal employer principle and the fact that, if we went down this track, it would flow on in the Public Service. I believe that we cannot compare the Australian Defence Force with the Australian Public ServiCe. Men and women of the Defence Force are not public servants in uniform; they are people y,'ith a particular dedication, with a partiCular preparedness to undertake demanding physical and mental training; to serve long hours; to be at the' call of the nation; and to lay down their lives for their country. But my experience of transfers in the Australian Public Service is that most public servants stay in the same city where they enrolled for the whole of their careers. The people who get transferred are mostly the people who apply for a transfer and they are the more upwardly mobile people who aspire to the higher echelons of the Public ServiCe. But the ,ordinary public servant, if transferred, may undergo only two or three transfers, if that, in the course of a Public Service career. I had a cousin in the Royal Australian Air Force who had had 23 transfers in the RAAF career; and that is not unusual. It is quite usual to meet service people who have had 15, 20 or 25 transfers in the course of a long and useful defence career. So we have to cater for this problem. At this stage it is our belief that the criteria for the education allowance' are too restrictive. The report picks up situations in whiCh a person may be transferred from one post to an isolated post where no satisfactory course is available. Time and again people in'the forces-not 'only those serving a short time, but also those with a distinguished serviCe record; perhaps officers who had 20 years service or thereabouts and who had children at high school or at universityreported that an untimely transfer, which coincided with the need to encourage a child or children to continue their education at secondary school or university, meant that they had to pull the plug. They decided that they could not impose on their children the disabilities involved in a transfer. The Defence Force and the Defence Department should look at the necessity to provide for stability across the whole four years of secondary education. I know that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade posts many people overseas. Very often their sons .and daughters go to a grammar schoolCanberra Grammar School is a notable example, but there are plenty of others-where they. undertake perhaps their whole secondary education in order that their education might not be disadvantaged by their parents' transfer. The' Australian Defence Force should be approached in the same way. We need to have in place a system that assists members of the Defence Force so that their children might have stability through their secondary education career or their university careers, although, naturally, they would be more independent when at university. This tremendously important element in our report is still being looked at. But it ought to be looked at sympathetically because we are not serving members of the Defence Force and their children very well in terms of the restrictive nature of the present education allowance. In our report we said a number of things that reflected the views expressed to us by members of the Australian Defence Force. At times they said that they did not think their officers were as interested in them as they might be and the like. While that might be true· in some cases, it is certainly in the overwhelming number of cases. We came out of the inquiry with a very great admiration for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, the officers of the Defence Force and, in particular, the chiefs and the Chief of the Defence Forces. Mr Quick, the former Defence Force advocate, made the comment that the present CDF, General Peter Gration, and his predecessor, General Sir Phillip Bennett, were absolutely devoted to the personal well-being of members of the Defence Force. While that did not always come through, it was certainly the impression of our Committee that it is so. The report makes a useful contribution. I express my appreciation to members on the other side of the House for the genuine bipartisan way in which the report was 'prepared and has been debated in the· House and the Senate.",32
53,Mr CARLTON,DEFENCE FORCE,"1 welcome the opportunity to respond to this report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force-Report and Recommendations, which was tabled on 11 May this year. I particularly welcome the opportunity to speak after the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross), who was Chairman of the Subcommittee which produced this report. I pay a tribute to him not only for this report, but also for a number of others which he has produced as Chairman of that Subcommittee on which I once had the honour to serve. Mr Katter-With distinction.",33
54,Mr CARLTON,DEFENCE FORCE,"As indeed did the honourable member for Kennedy, a former Chairman of that Committee under whom I also had the honour of serving. I follow a very fine distinguished soldier in the position of shadow Minister for defence. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White) served this country in wartime and was honoured, through valour, with a Military Cross. Although he no longer has responsibility for defence matters on this side of the House, he continues to devote his life in this Parliament to the cause of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the cause of Australia's defence. It is a great privilege for me to not true continue that work. I also pay tribute to the work of the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, Senator Jocelyn Newman, who is in the gallery today. She has taken a deep personal interest in this issue and has had direct experience of service life. She is fully informed on these issues and has carried out a major program of visits to installations and bases throughout Australia. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who was at the table with me a short time ago, has similarly taken an interest as shadow Minister for veterans' affairs. During the debate so far, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), a former Deputy Chairman of the Committee, and the honourable member for MCPherson have responded on behalf of the Opposition. So many of the issues have been canvassed in some depth. The report has very considerable force not only because of the quality of the inquiry, but also because of the personal standing of the Chairman of the Subcommittee that produced it and the fact that it is bipartisan. Therefore, a report of this kind, when it contains the kinds of criticisms it does, represents a very severe reflection on the way in which the Government has managed our defence effort and our Defence Force. I will quote one or two paragraphs from the summary of the report to indicate the very great level of concern that must exist in the Australian community when these kinds of findings are made by this kind of committee. The report states: The extent and magnitude of wastage in some of those areasreferring to a number of areas in the ADFis such that it will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade. The report also states: It is manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personnel wastage is damaging the organisational health of the ADF. Wastage is undermining the experience and competence levels of personnel. It is imp-cting on the capacity of the training and personnel management systems to maintain the Force's integrity. The financial cost arising from the abnormal loss of skilled staff and the increased training effort is enormous. At the psychological level, morale has fallen and the potential has been created for institutional and community polarisation. I have not read in any report presented to this Parliament a more damning indictment of a department than that, a more damning indictment of the overall management of department by a Minister and by a governby ment. I think it was worth repeating. finding was quoted by previous speakers. solutely fundamental to an understanding what is wrong with the Australian Defence Force at the moment is the fact that the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Government are at fa),llt in respect of agement. It was the hapless junior Minister, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who had to come in here and reply to this report. In the course of remarks, he said: The Committee's deliberations and its report took place within the context of a continuing program Government action. both to address the. wastage problem and, more broadly, to improve the tions and personnel management of the Defence force. He went on to say: Many of the Coinmittee's recommendations had already been implemented or were in train before Committee's report was tabled. Action has continued during the period in which we have been analysing the Committee's report. All I can say .to the junior Minister is, American vernacular,'Tell that to the mathe rines'! We have only to read the report find out that that is absolute nonsense. The speech that we. have just heard from the honourable member for Brisbane makes it quite clear why the Government is not this trusted by the armed forces. It was quite clear from the junior Minister's responsecriteria and the first point he made was damningthere that he simply did not understand the recService. ommendation the Committee had made on remuneration. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) made it quite clear that the recommendation was unacceptable. What the Committee meant to say, and did say in the body of the report-maybe the Minister read only the introduction or. the summary-was that it was quite clear that the Committee was concerned that the basis of remuneration the Coldham Committee of Review had laid down had not been taken into account by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal and it wanted the whole matter investigated by the Tribunal taking those considerations into account. It was clear from the Minister's a reply, and obviously from the remarks made the honourable member for Brisbane, that That the Department or the Minister-whoever Abdrafted the speech-simply did not underof stand what the Committee was getting at. If the Minister and the Department do not understand that, what guarantee have the defence forces that there will be any symmanpathetic or satisfactory recommendation or action coming out of these reports in the Department? The second matter raised by the honourable member for Brisbane gives equal cause his for concern. With regard to the Department of Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Brisbane said that the Minister's reof ply was simply not true. The Department of Industrial Relations claimed that it had not condihad an opportunity to comment on the report. The Chairman of the Committee which conducted the inquiry says that that is simply not true, that it did. If the Government is so tied up with the corporate state, with the the Australian Council of Trade Unions and with centralised wage fixation that it simply does not understand the problem there is when these corporate state principles are apin plied to our defence forces; then God help armed services in this country. That has to become absolutely clear from this debate. Indeed, the honourable member for Brisbane, whose integrity and knowledge of these matters has been questioned by no-one, has given evidence directly to the House. He also went on with a similar example about the for the education allowance where had been a comparison with the Public Clearly people in the Department and the Minister ought to understand that . the movements in the armed forces bear no relationship to the movements of public servants and they have to be treated on their merits and quite differently. All this tells us that there is still a tremendous . problem in the management of this Department. It should not have been the junior Minister who came into this House to respond to this inquiry; it should have been the Minister himself. I have been the first to acknowledge in interviews I have done so far and in various statements I have made that the Minister has made a substantial contribution to the sorting out of dMence strategy in this country. I certainly have questions about how far he still has to go, but I acknowledge that contribution and in no way do I question his dedication or his intelligence. But when we get down to examining what is actually happening on the ground by way of morale, management and capability we see that there are massive shortcomings coming to light all the time. Certainly we have a further example of this here and it goes to the very heart of the management of the Department in Russell Hill. I will quote from the report. Under the heading 'Russell Offices', it states: The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, CDF and DEPSEC A made a point of stressing to this Committee that the working relationships at Russell Offices are good. Yet during the same hearing CDF singled out the Defence complex in Canberra as having the worse morale in the ADF.. This is the headquarters of the whole show, for God's sake! How on earth are we going to have good morale where things are happening out on the ground' if at the very headquarters of the show morale is the worse in the whole of the Australian Defence Force? I mean, if a fish is bad, it is bad the head and that is where we start doing something about it. The report continues: Our previous report criticised the structure at primarily on the grounds of iriefficiency. That was the management report which the Minister dismissed almost out of hand. Incidentally, that was a report which I called for as a member of the Cross Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when I was last on it. I. was pleased to see that the Chairman supported that reference. The report continues: Central to that criticism .was our assessment existing organisational arrangements tend to favour the civilian hierarchy at the expense of the military. In the Committee's judgment that situation is to diminish the quality of defence policy by ing the military's voice in the key policy determinamember tion areas. Ours is a judgment which apparently is shared by those highly-reported middle-level officers-ship captains, battalion commanders and so on-who among others resign rather than work in Russell. Thus, an organisational failing which last year this Committee identified and defined in terms of an unsatisfactory decision-making process also is the root cause of a certain level of personnel. wastage which often includes the highest quality officers. This was identified 12 months before in the earlier report. Was anything done about that? No, the Minister for Defence summarily dismissed that report. The report continues: Given Russell Offices' unenviable reputation, the Government's continuing refusal to promote more harmonious and efficient working relationships between the broad military and civilian components of the diarchy through fundamental organisational reform remains something of a mystery. As long as senior management continues to subscribe to the absurd euphemism of 'creative tension' as a description of the work environment within the Defence complel\., the 'Russell Office syndrome' will continue to generate avoidable wastage. That is a polite way of saying that there is an absolute cat's nest over there because of the Government's failure to change the organisational arrangements to ensure harmony in the supreme headquarters. Heaven forbid if we were engaged currently in combat. Do honourable members think that we could put up with the situation where we had so-called 'creative tension' in the headquarters of the whole show? Of course we could not. There is always a certain amount of friction in any organisation, but if it is elevated to high at policy whereby - e require people to be some way at each other's throats, then I would say that that is the worse example of manRussell agement organisation that I have seen in a .long career of direct involvement in organisational practice. The conclusion I come to in looking at this report-sadly I had to come to that conclusion about the minesweeping report which we had the other day-is that it is yet another example, another piece of evidence, of the fact that the management side of this Department and of the Defence Force is really at the heart of the problem. Whilst that the the Minister may have made a major contribution to sorting out a lot of the intellectual likely issues in defence-heaven's above, I served diminishon the Committee chaired by the honourable for Kennedy with the current Minister some years ago, and I acknowledged that it seems that everybody in the Force, and presumably most of the civilians over there, believe that the management of the whole show, the way in which it is led at the top, is insufficient to get that kind of morale, that kind of feeling that one is part - of a good feeling that one needs to run a satisfactory Australian Defence Force. Everybody who is concerned about the future of defence and the people who work there---:a.nd there - are good people, civilian and mlhtary-should read this report and should get on to the Minister, and all the backbenchers on that side of the House should get onto the Minister, and ask him to start doing something about it. Mr.CLEELAND (MCEwen)' (4.l8)-We have J.ust heard a shallow, hollow piece of rhetOrIC from the new shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mack-llar (Mr Carlton), one of the great bouncmg balls of the Opposition. He is on the front bench one day, the back bench the next day, and back on to the front bench the next day. Half the Opposition front bench should be described as bouncing balls because members of the Opposition change their position so often. One problem the defence forces now have to cope with is that the honourable member for Mackellar is notorious as the failed shadow Treasurer. He is notorious as the person who went to the Australian public in the last election with a program to cut $14 billion to $16 billion from expenditure. He could not tell the Australian public then where it would be cut. Today he came into this House with a shallow speech full of rhetoric, but did not leave the defence forces or the Australian public any the wiser and there was no elucidation on where the Opposition actually stands in regard to the problems disclosed by the Cross report. It would be very foolish for any member of this House to stand here and say that there are no problems; of course there are. But unlike the Opposition when it was in government, this Government is not afraid to have inquiries such as the Hamilton Review of E!fect of Service Life on Spouses, - nd the Cross - eport on Personnel Wastage In the Australzan Defence Force and is not afraid to stand in this House with full knowledge of those defects and debate them. However, again, the debates in this House are very shallow. One always has one arm tied behind one's back in such debates, because the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member f?r Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has not yet disclosed a policy. If I were a member of the Defence Force today I would be very worried. I am told that Senator Newman is sitting in the gallery at the moment. We all know what her position is: she wants the job. She wants the honourable gentleman who is the present incumbent out of the job and she wants it. That is no secret; it is well known throughout this place. Senator Newman is re-own-d in the Senate for being very good at Isolatmg problems. She spends most of her time saying what should be done but never comes up with the promise that should she ever be in government, she w'ill find the money to do it. It is very easy for people like the good senator to run around the traps saying, 'Look, these are all the problems'. However, she never says, 'When I am in government I will give you the money'. As for the great cutter of the Opposition, the great dry, the honourable memb-r. for Mackellar, what will he say when he VISitS the defence establishments? Will he tell the truth? Will he be honest and say to our Defence Force personnel, 'If I ever get onto the Government front bench as a Minister for Defence my job will be to cut. That is what my leader will have put me there for.'? We all know that he will not say that. We also know that he will not go around promising increases in expenditure. A former shadow Mi1).ister for defence-the one before the previous one-is on record as saying that there will be only modest increases, whatever that may mean. Those former members of the defence forces who mutter loudly on the Opposition back bench about what they would do in government really do not have an answer. They cannot say, and neither can anyone in the Opposition say, that in government they would find the money to redress the problem areas. None of them will say that. Why can members of the Opposition not sometimes be a little more honest in this House and lay their program on the table? It s.o - appens that the Puckapunyal Army base IS m my electorate. I am quite happy to go to that base with the shadow Minister and debate with him in front of all the Defence Force personnel what his program would be. If he does not have the guts and the courtesy to tell those people, then really should not hold the job. If he does not have the guts to go to an Army base such Puckapunyal and say that he will find the money to redress the problems that he is now complaining about, his approach is shallow and hollow. I can tell him now that Defence Force personnel will not vote for him. People who do not believe that need only look at the election results Puckapunyal Army booth between 1984 and 1987. There was a major increase in the Labor vote in 1987, when I then had running against me a lieutenant-colonel of the Army. The Liberal vote at the Puckapunyal Army base went down 12 per cent in less than three years. Honourable members opposite should not kid themselves; they should think that by wandering around the countryand side making shallow promises they will fool the people. The people in these places better; they know the record of those oppobers site in government. One had only to walk into Puckapunyal in 1984 to see the abysmal conditions that the previous coalition Govthink ernment left the defence forces in with reopposite gard to housing and hospitals. The Army hospital at Puckapunyal was built during the Second World War. It was built of corruMinister, gated iron and it was still there in 1984. Government is now replacing it with a modbers ern hospital. New housing is sprouting up in Puckapunbe yal as has never been seen before. I served there in 1958 and did not go back to Puckto apunyal until 1984. It was like walking a time tunnel. There was one big new building there, to house the Army school of catering. That was built under the defence stewardship of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). There is very good story attached to this and honourArmy able members opposite should be reminded of it every now and then. During the conand struction program the then Minister, the right honourable member for New England, was so concerned about the defence forces that he cut out the funds for air-conditioning the building. It is a solid concrete building, and when the Army's new school of catering occupied it just before 1984 when I first went back there, it found that it could not be used. With all those stoves and cooking equipmerit being used when there was a hot he summer sun the temperature in the building got to 50 and 60 degrees centigrade. It could as not be used and had to be evacuated. That is an indication of the sorts of nonsensical things that honourable members opposite do very when in government. The present Government had to· find nearly $19m to put into that building the air-conditioning system which the right honourable member for New from the England had cut out. Honourable members opposite cannot come into this House with shallow rhetoric and hollow approaches. Their record is there in every defence facility in this country. The record of their stewardship stares one in the face when one walks into those facilities. Defence personnel will not believe honournot able members opposite when they go there talk with them, unless they are going to promise dollars down the line and deliver. know However, we know that honoUJ;able. memopposite will not do that. We""know that they would cut funds. That is their role in this dry Opposition. All the Tories opposite about is cutting. Honourable members are Tories-let us forget about this name 'Liberal'. Their job is to cut funds. "" None of them, including the former"" shadow has ever said that they would spend This more money on defence. Honourable memopposite should not come into this place and be hollow and shallow, as they all will in this debate, talking about their little pet hobbyhorses, unless they have the money spend, because it will take money to reinto pair the damage they left. This Government is spending money. I am very proud now when I go to Puckapunyal. In the town of Seymour 74 houses are now empty. Why are they empty? It is because a honourable members opposite used to make personnel and their families live in them. We have now taken those people out the houses will be handed back to the State. The State Government will spend some money on them and put ordinary families back in them. The present state of those in houses is so abysmal, so poor, that we had to take those Army families out. We are now building new homes at Puckapunyal at an ever increasing rate. These are brand new, three-bedroom, brick veneer homes with decent curtains, equipment and facilities, and Defence Force families can be proud to live in them. The community facilities being built at Puckapunyal are something of which I am proud. This is not to say that there are not further problems. I am the first to recognise those problems, but at least this Government knows about them. It recognises that they exist and is attempting, under the very tight fiscal framework within which we are working, to do something about them. The report of the Hamilton Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses identified most of the major problems affecting families in the Defence Force. No other government in the history of this country has bothered to consider Defence Force personnel in terms of the family unit. Under the coalition Government one would have thought that the Defence Force comprised just single people-with no wives, no children, no educational requirement, no child-care requirement and no dual income requirement. These things were simply unheard of when honourable members opposite were in government. This Government recognises that the Defence Force is not just about the serving member of the family, male or female; it is about the family of that member as well. Suddenly education and curricula are high on the target list of this Government. Suddenly Defence Force families know that serious moves are being made in relation to the transfer of personnel from post to post, that a uniform standard curriculum will be available for the families. That has never been in the policy of honourable members opposite. It has never been thought about by them. It is now there, on the ground. Education is recognised by this Government as being of value for our Defence Force families. Honourable members opposite are very quick to criticise the Government for not spending enough on remuneration, but none of them will say today what the Opposition would do about it. Not one member of the Opposition, not one tory in this House, will stand up today and say, 'When in Government we will increase expenditure to$X'. I challenge any honourable member opposite to say that, but none will. The shadow Treasurer is saying that expenditure would be cut. Honourable members opposite should not be shallow. They do not have the guts or the integrity to put the promises on the table. They can come to the Puckapunyal base any time they like and I will debate with them in front of all the personnel there. But I know they will not. They will not deliver a promise; they will not lay it on the table. So they should not talk about remuneration. We have now set up a tribunal for defence personnel such as that available to any other worker and wage earner in this country. Those opposite never did that. It was never a promise they made and it was. never on their agenda. However, it has been done. An independent tribunal is available and at least now Defence Force personnel, as they learn the industrial rules, will go to that tribunal and get justice. They can put their case like any other person. That is valuable, and it is something that has been done. Then there is the dual career situation. Again, this goes back to the fact that Opposition members never recognised that there were other than Defence Force personnel. Suddenly, dual careers and the right of wives to have a career are being recognised. It is suddenly there on the board. I can tell this House that there are many women married to Defence Force personnel in Puckapunyal who have met with me and have raised after 1984, as· one of their major ·concerns, that, being married to Defence Force personnel, they suffer because of the posting system. One thing which I find valuable in the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is the career path opportunity for Defence Force personnel, particularly officers. I recently had a meeting with a major in the Australian Army who resigned earlier this year. He told me, as other officers have told me, that the reason he resigned was not dissatisfaction with his pay and conditions but dissatisfaction with his career path. He happens to have a management speciality for which he is trained. It is unbelievable that the Office of Personnel in the Army, after having him in that position for two years, where his specialty was exercised and where he was quite happy in the job, decided to post him elsewhere, to an area where he had no cialty or training, away from the area in which he wanted to work. He appealed and went through the processes. All the paperence, work came back from the personnel people and he was told, 'We do not recognise that land). simply because you have a specialty you, in the Army, should be allowed to spend your life on that career path'. He took the obvious course. He resigned, and he is now following his career outside the Services. It is fundamental in any professional ganisation that people who do have a career path, who are specialised in the!r skills talents, should be allowed to utthse those their own career benefit. When people not do that,of course they are going to leave the Defence Forces; and one cannot blame them .. It is vital that the career path system be strengthened and that our officers, who do train very skilfully t-day, I might addof they are very skilful people-should be ofit will become. fered the chance, whilst serving, to follow that major career path. There are several other items I wanted mention. I have mentioned housing. I do not know whether the shadow Minister has been to Puckapunyal yet, but if he comes down and wants me to meet him there I will him what the Opposition left in the way housing. There are still some houses left where doors do not open and, when it gets wet, they do not close. I will show him what the Opposition left behin? and what we. building. I cannot show him the old hospital. It is still there, but I hope that it will be pulled down very soon. Let us not have shallow debate. The shadow Minister has a new job. I know that that is people. he knows nothing about defence; he has never worn a uniform, as I understand it, or served. He should get out to the def-nce forces talk to them. Why does he not promise them what the Opposition would do? Why does he not tell them now w,hat the Opposition would cut, and be honest about it, so that they will have a clear alternative between this Government which ,is spending money on them and what the Opposition would to them?",33
55,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE FORCE,"I rise to contribute to this debate not only as a ber of the Opposition but also as, until about spe15 months ago, a serving Defence Force officer for some 30 years plus. What I have to say comes with a little personal experiwhich is more than I can say for the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr CleeFirst of all, like my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), I pay tribute to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) both for his contribution today and for his stewardship of a very orcomprehensive report, the results of which are before us this afternoon. I also agree and with him in what he said about particular for recommendations of that report concerning canremuneration-recommendations 21 to 24 in particular. My only reaction to what he had to say, in summary, would be that, the longer the Defence Force remuneration machinery stays under the umbrella of the Department Industrial Relations, the more ineffective I support the honourable member for Mackellar in what he said about a summary to of the report. It certainly is a damning indictment of departmental management. It is also an indictment of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the previous Minister show for Defence Science and Personnel-the of Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly). Like the honourable member for Mackellar, I do not doubt the dedication and intelligence of Minister are - Beazley in his sorting out of some of the intellectual issues, but I question his administrative ability and say, as I have said over and over again in this place, that there is one thing that he has forgotten about, and ln a nutshell, my reaction to what the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and (Mr Simmons) had to say is one of deep disappointment. Not enough of those recommendations have against them the citation 'Agreed and implemented'. Too many of them have against them, 'Agree in principle', 'Alternative proposed' or 'Not agreed'. While the Minister talked about the Returned Servdo ices League (RSL) complimenting the Government on its acceptance of 41 of the 48 recommendations, it is more meaningful to memhighlight what Senator Newman said in the other place, namely, that less than one-third of those 48 recommendations have been agreed and implemented. The criticism I make is no criticism of two very good departmental officers who were the .architects in preparing the response to the Cross report. I speak of Rear-Admiral Alan lJeaumont and Mr Ray Finnegan. I compliment them on the work they put into the preparation of the response. However, I have to say that the response, in my view, is totally inadequate. I preface one or two points I wish to make this afternoon by goihg back to November last year and referring to some of the statements that were made both in this place and in the other place about the report when it was first submitted. Firstly, I refer to what Senator Newman said: This report of the Committee gives the Government a blueprint on which to base its future conduct. But it.has no time to spare. It has been warned now for several years that its neglect would prove disastrous. It is now five minutes to midnight for the defence forces. Nothing less than an immediate and total commitment will reverse the process of deterioration and emasculation within the forces, and nothing less will preserve the capable and credible defence of this country. Senator Tambling said, on the same date: . '. Minister Beazley and Minister Kelly have to look at sins of the past few years. They have to address these problems urgently. They have to make sure that everyone of the issues in the 48 recommendations can be identifie- in the actions that they take and the ministerial responsibilities that they exercise in the next few months. We need to see in the Budget next year a real determination by the Government to correct this situation. In this place on 10 November the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) said: I would suggest everyone within the defence forces-have been waiting for this report to be published; have been waiting for this debate; have been expecting and demanding that something be done as a result of the publication of this report. We, in this Parliament, now have an enormous responsibility not only to note the contents of the report but also, much more importantly, to put into effect the recommendations contained in it. It is a responsibility that this Government cannot escape. It is a responsibility that this Government must accept and that we, ,as parliamentarians, must ensure that it accepts. I also refer to a couple of media references made at about that time. Firstly, I refer to an article by Julie Power in the Australian Financial Review in which she said: After a year of hearings, 226 written submissions, and 4000 pages of evidence, the joint committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade found it was ""manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personnel wastage is undermining the organisation health of the ADF"". It said wastage (the number of personnel leaving the forces) had undermined experience and ,competence levels and impacted on the capacity of the training and personnel management systems to maintain the forces integrity at an enormous financial ,cost. She want on to say: This was rejected by the . . . Defence Minister, Mr Beazley . . . who said that this was not the view of his 'principal military advisers' and that the forces were as good as any in the western alliance. Peter. Yoi.mg, in the Australian of 14 November 1988, commented: The third Cross report . . . is an indictment of the Federal Government's handling of defence. It points to a systematic cover-up of a situation that was well-known to the Government more than two years ago but was suppressed-and senior officers silenced-in support of the massive confidence tricks being played on the Australian public over the state of our defences. He went on to say: . . . there is evidence that the Government was warned of the gravity of the situation almost two years ago but chose to do nothing about it. That advice-which closely follows that given in last week's report-was contained in 'a top-level classified document commissioned by the Chiefs of Staff Committee and sent to the Minister in January 1987. The document pulled no punches. It warned that: Immediate action had to be taken to remedy widespread dissatisfaction over' what was seen as a continued neglect and erosion of conditions of service. The diversion of manpower from operational employment to r'ecruiting and training caused by these losses would result in increased administrative costs and posting problems that would further exacerbate the situation. The credibility of the service leadership was under question. The loss rate of personnel . . . 'could not be sustained without a significant. lowering of operational capability and expertise'. Finally, it listed a series of positive measures urgently needed to stern the haemorrhage. These match, almost word for word, those recommended by last week's Cross report. Despite this, and the rapidly worsened situation caused by further cuts in defence spending, that report was kept under wraps and the Government continued to play down the problem. Personnel wastage in itself is serious enough and a matter now generally understood by the community. But the effects on operational capabilities are even more serious. As the report states, they will be felt by the Australian Defence Force for at least the next decade. These effects include, first, the reduction in the naval fleet. I refer to decisions made recently in relation to HMAS Stalwart. They include also the lack of pilots and technicians and the general inexperience in Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) front line units. I refer to the Chinook decision and the possible involvement of the Royal New Zealand Air Force in picking up our fleet's support tasks. They include problems in the submarine service, where we find at anyone time there may be two or three of the six boats at sea, and the lack of sustainability of Army field force units in the field. We have to await the results of the Kangaroo 89 exercise to prove that one way or another. They include the promotion of personnel too early and sometimes, I regret to say, beyond their level of competence. They include financial penalties in that funds have to be diverted from operational areas into activities such as recruiting and training, and a loss of experienced training staff. In the 12-month period to March last year, half of the qualified flying instructors in the RAAF's Advanced Flying School had resigned. Realistic training exercises are hard to achieve because of manpower shortages and financial constraints, and manpower shortages result in extra duties and longer hours of work. At the time Major General Jeffery, the Commander of 1 Division, said: I estimate we are doing a 38,OOO-man task with a 32,OOO-man Army. Other effects in.clude increased posting turbulence and family instability. The Committee noted in its report that one resignation can generate about five postings. The Committee also commented on low morale, stating: Our judgment is that in some areas of the ADF morale is unacceptably low. In relation to the responses of the Minister in this place on 11 May I refer to another comment by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White) of the same day, when he said: Certainly, the report contains things that. will be welcomed. I have already heard the Government's response described as evasive, insubstantial, self-congratulatory, inconsistent, bureaucratic, rhetorical and a disappointment. In some respects I agree with all those criticisms. The average soldier, sailor or airman who picks up this report, which undoubtedly they will do from this afternoon onwards, and reads it will, generally speaking, look in vain for a substantial improvement in his pay and conditions of service. I also refer to Senator Newman's comments as reported in the Defence Industry periodical of last week: Senator Newman said the real story behind the Government response to the Cross Report was an economic one. 'The time for studies is over. . . Action is needed. But this response, deliberately designed to be 'cost-neutral', reveals just what priority this Government gives its servicemen and women. They and their families are completely justified in feeling bitterly disappointed and betrayed. This response has failed as a retention package'. In the West Australian newspaper of 13-14 May 1989 Barry Lowe said: Defence personnel have criticised the Federal Government's package of measures aimed at reduc-. ing the high rate of resignations from the services as too narrow and lacking substance. Army, Air Force and Navy personnel contacted yesterday gave the thumbs down to the package, announced in Parliament on Thursday by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Simmons . . . long-serving officers contacted. . . said the package offered them little in the way of real improvements to their conditions. They felt the measures were aimed only at people who had recently joined. The Chief Executive of the Armed Forces Federation, Retired Colonel Michael Bindley, predicted the measures would not be sufficient to cut the resignation rate. Colonel Bindley went on to say: The package does not address the problems raised by the Cross committee . . . Its measures are not designed to influence the people that the services want to hold onto. The new housing scheme, which is really only a replacement for the scheme that was taken away from defence personnel in 1985, affects only recent recruits. I refer to a report released yesterday by the RSL entitled Australian Regional Defence Policy: How Does our Defence Capability Measure Up? At page 18 it states: Despite the competence within the ADF, its capabilities are not adequate to meet Government policies. A situation has developed where there emphasis on capabilities aligned to deterrence high level operations. On the other hand, in the more likely scenarios of low level operations there is not . the capability or capacity (to sustain operations) to have decisive effect or timely influence in the unless circumstances are unimaginably favourable. The report also comments on shortages of personnel. On page 10 it says, in part: The loss of trained and experienced people ously reduces the professionalism of the force. can in turn lead to a loss of self-esteem and and a faltering in commitment to the ideal of to the country. It can stimulate further wastage. This regenerative nature of high wastage is a major concern. I would like to finish my comments this afternoon by reiterating the comments of Peter Young in the Australian of 14 Novemthat ber 1988: The first Cross report revealed that our defences were in disarray and could not even meet low level threats on Australia's security in a timely and effective manner. He goes on to say-and I agree with this entirely: The answer is . . . simple. Pay the military what they are worth, stop. politicising the leadership and just for once tell the truth about real state of our defences.",39
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE FORCE,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,42
57,Mr JENKINS,DEFENCE FORCE,"The recussion port of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Personnel Waspolicy tage in the Australian Defence Force, is a comprehensive and balanced examination of a complex problem. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) stated in his response: The present levels of personnel wastage from the Defence Force is an issue of very great importance and concern. The Government has not sought to deny this fact, nor to disguise, in any way, the extent of the problem. It is now clear as a result of the work of the Committee that the problem of personnel wastage has no one cause and no quick fix solution. The Committee highlighted that there is no ideal separation rate for the Australian Defence Force (ADF)-a rate of between 7 per cent and 11 per cent was felt to be acceptable. This compares with a separation rate in the Australian Public Service as is a whole in 1986 of 8.3 per cent. Problems and with methodology and the calculation of statistics were also brought to light. No informed debate can take place in the region absence of accurate information. The Committee addressed this problem in recommendations 12 and 13. In recommendation 12 it called for the establishment of 'a comprehenserisive centralised defence manpower planning This data base'; in recommendation 13 it called morale for a 'formal, coordinated program of reservice search on personnel wastage management'. It is also clear that over the next decades the recruitment environment in which .the Australian Defence Force operates will become increasingly difficult. Projections are there will be a notable decline in the 15 to 24 years age category over the decade 1989-99. As retention rates continue to climb towards the Government's objectives, the ADF will face more competition for recruits from further .education and other careers. In addition, it is clear that the ADF separation rate has a strong positive correlation to real growth in the economy, as represenior sented by the gross domestic product over the the .years 1977-88. By the same token, it must be said that historically the Defence Force has not adequately recruited among women and among Australians from .non Anglo-Saxon backgrounds. The only group that is incapable of conducting rational dison the subject of defence is the Opposition. As in all other areas, the defence of the Opposition is divided, self-contradictory and full of irresponsible rhetoric. Let me illustrate. On the one hand we have the statement in 'Futile Diversions'Future Directions--of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that: Manpower levels in all three services must be increased in order to being operational units to realistic strengths. Ignoring the blatant sexism, this must have been penned by yesterday's hero, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White). On the other hand, we all remember how the reheated Leader of the Opposition  proposals of the Business Council of Australia in April last year. Indeed, he said that they did not go far enough. And yet the BCA proposal included a $300m cut to defence-a 2.5 per cent cut to the defence budget. As the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) stated at the time: On the one hand we have a plethora of irresponsible promises made by some' Opposition spokespersons to defence personnel all around the country. On the other hand we have Opposition spokespersons, like the shadow Treasurer, calling for massive defence cuts. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel have subsequently highlighted the dismal performance of the honourable member for MCPherson when he was the shadow Minister for Defence. As recently as 1 May, practically on the eve of the coup, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel slammed the 'gross errors of fact' in the continuing media beatup of the defence force personnel issue. The recycled Leader of the Opposition obviously agrees. Not only has he consigned the honourable member for MCPherson to political oblivion, but he has passed the mantle to the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton). So we go from a spokesperson who was renowned for making at least four rash statements a week to a spokesperson who, before he was dumped, was renowned for saying nothing at all. So little confidence do members of the Liberal Party of Australia have in the capacity of the honourable member for Mackellar to deal with defence issues that even his own branch members called on him to resign to make way for the honourable member for Bennelong. This Government's strong and continuing support for the Defence Force is a matter of record. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has stated: This Government has been the first to truly recognise and act on the problems of service families. The Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal was established in 1984 to provide an independent tribunal to determine matters of pay for the ADF. The Australian Defence Families Information and Liaison Staff has been established. It is in the context of this record and commitment that the work of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade must be understood. As an aside, it is probably worth referring back to today's matter of public importance when we talked about the impact of policies on families. We have to recognise that families do not make up a homogenous group. No on- family represents the average Australian family. We must look at the way in which government reacts and provides services to each of those groups, and· defence personnel families are a particular case. This Government has recognised that fact and has done much in respect of the special needs of those people as a group. Many of the 48 recommendations of the Cross report deal with nuts and bolts issues relating to the welfare of Defence Force personnel and their families. As the Minister has stated: Much of what this report recommends has been implemented, is in the process of being implemented. or will be. This will certainly go some way towards improving the lot of service personnel and their families. I wish to refer in particular to the measures announced in relation to Defence Force housing. We all know that there has been a commitment of more than $750m over a lO-year period to address the long neglect of service housing, with more than $200m being spent in the last two years. I acknowledge the statements by my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) in this context. He has worked diligently on behalf of families based in Puckapunyal regarding the type of housing to which they have been subjected in the Seymour area. A lot of work has been done, but the Government recognises that much more can be done. At the recent Premiers Conference, as part of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement it was agreed that some 7,000 houses would be offered back to the States for public housing and a further 4,400 low cost houses would be to be released. The important thing is that defence will take over the ownership of the remaining 7,000 houses. The Cross report also deals with the question of leadership, morale, public perception and self-esteem. The Committee recognises that the period of extended peace since the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam 16 years ago has led to: A natural tendency for defence personnel to question their role in society . . . indeed soldiers may not only question their utility to society but also often feel under pressure to justify their existence and values. Further, the Committee notes that as a sult of the extended peace less than 9 per cent of the Army personnel, for example, have served under active combat conditions and that this has compounded the degradathe tion of experience resulting from personnel wastage. I do not necessarily regard these called problems as problems at all. I look forward to the day when it can be said that no member of the Australian Defence Force has active combat experience. If this causes individuals to question their role, so be it. After all, soldiers are trained to defend as an aspect of that, to kill, and we intend this as a deterrent. It is important that their role be seen as a deterrent in the Defence Force. Inevitably, there is a contradiction the fact that the more effective the Defence Forces are as a deterrent, the less likely are ever actually to use their skills. I believe that it should not go unnoticed that this debate is taking place on the day that our newspapers are reporting offers and counter offers in relation to a reduction conventional forces and weaponry between the United States and the Soviet Union which will dramatically alter the military map Europe and contribute to a significant reducparticularly tion in global tension. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has rightly pointed out: What proves to be possible in Europe will be, believe, an invaluable precedent for other regions, including the Asia-Pacific region . . . It is worth recalling the level of resources expended globally on the military. It is mated that during the 1970s the world about $4 trillion-that is, four million miltheir lion dollars-on the military. In 1985 alone, total world military expenditure was some $US850 billion to $US870 billion. This is tragic waste and brings to mind the words the great Irish satirist, Jonathon Swift, long before Australia was settled by Eurowould appreciate. peans said: Give me the money that has been spent in war, I will· purchase every foot of land on the globe. will clothe every man, women and child in attire which kings and queens would be proud. I will build a school house on every hillside and in every valley over the whole earth; I will build an academy every town and endow it: A· college in every and fill it with able professors. The Australian Government must stand ready to participate in multilateral global and reregional reductions in military expenditure. Whilst advocating that, I note the work of the Cross Committee-the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-and positive response of the Government to it. It is important in notiQg those responses so that one of the things uppermost in the minds of those in the Government is the well-being and the good welfare of families of our defence force personnel. Whilst I hope the defence forces are merely to be a deterrent, they play an important role in Austraand, lian life and that should be recognised.",42
58,Mr KATTER,DEFENCE FORCE,"Before I proceed I would like to draw the attention of the House and the nation to the irony of in not only the present situation of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the shadow they Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), but the defence spectrum generally. I preface my remarks by pointing out with characteristic humility that when I chaired the Joint Comof mittee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, as the honourable member for Mackellar was kind enough to point out, we of had a few landmarks. But one that was significant was our report on the levels of threats to this nation. The Committee worked extremely hard over a period of a couple of years. ,We had excellent consultwe ants and the evidence that was brought before the Committee was of immense value. But there were two people to whom the Committee was extremely indebted. Both had estikeen analytical minds and were dedicated spent men. They were both well renowned for academic standing. The irony of it all is that one of them was Kim Beazley and the other was Jim Carlton. Those two men a worked in a bipartisan fashion to produce a of report. Again I speak with my characteristic who humility, which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, The report of the Committee is now at and the Pentagon. Throughout the world it is in I many of the centres of defence of people of who are friendly to us. The irony of it all is that the present Minister for Defence and in shadow Minister for defence are now on state opposite sides and have to try to score off each other. I do not propose to score off anyone. I cannot take a great deal of credit for the report presently being debated because during the period of the major work associated with it I was incapacitated. I was nailed down. Regrettably I was unable to be very actively associated with the inquiries that were made. But the Committee is very fortunate in having a person like the honourable member for Brisbane(Mr Cross) as Chairman, in having Senator MACGIBBON as Deputy Chairman and in having everyone else who is associated with it. Over the years the members of the Committee have been particularly dedicated. Let us get on to the matter of wastage. I much prefer to use the word 'resignations'; it means more to people around the country. I want to associate it with one very special aspect of the. Committee's inquiry. We decided we would talk to members of the Royal Australian Navy and certain Qantas pilots who had resigned from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The Committee convened in Sydney. It consisted of myself and Alan Stephens, the Secretary, because other members were very much tied up all over Australia. That was one of the most depressing days I think I have ever spent in relation to the issue of defence-and after all I was the Minister when the action in Vietnam ceased. I then had the great privilege of chairing the Committee over the period of the golden days of the Fraser-Anthony Government. Then came the shadows and clouds, which no doubt will be dissipated within the next 12 months. However, I am getting political, and that is unforgivable .. At the hearing in Sydney certain obvious and glaring facts .began to emerge. I think we spoke to six com parativelyyoung men in relation to why they had left the RAAF and moved to Qantas. There were the predictable things such as salaries, conditions and their general freedom of movement and so on. But both Alan Stephens, a former very important member of the Defence Force himself, and I came away with the very profound impression that these people were not happy abQut leaving the RAAF. Nothing very spectacular emerged from that. There were the usual things: lack of morale and lack of conditions. I want to make one point before we move on. I have heard various speakers here today talk about Minister Beazley and management. They have got to understand that the Minister for Defence-and I note that all speakers conceded that he is a man of talent and a man who is well respected;-has the great difficulty that any honourable member has when.he is throwing punches for his own portfolio. If one is a Minister in a socialist government and if one is trying to attract funds for defenc.e or for traditional family matters, one has got a pretty tough road ahead. I am not trying to be nasty; I am a gentle soul and never try to be nasty when I speak in this House, but I would like to say that we should look around the world and study the countries that have moved over to socialist doctrine. We are in an extraordinary situation here where socialism has been disguised. If members of the Government rub shoulders with billionaires it is very difficult to convince people that they still make up a socialist government. With all due. respect to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), he is a man with a sense of purpose. If anyone feels that I am being nasty there, let him read the Prime Minister's Boyer lectures. The whole philosophy of this Government is based on the Prime Minister's thrust in the Boyer lectures. So we get back to the matter of defence. We get back to morale. We. get back to why we have these worrying resignations. It would be silly for me to stand here and say that genuine men on the other side of the House are not as worried as we are. The only difference is that we feel that the fundamental and basic philosophy of a socialist government contributes vastly to the problem. Morale is a funny thing. It is a sort of vapour. It is the sort of thing that spreads and permeates. The more uninhibited young people are the more they react to whether they have the sort of basic fundamental sense of direction which any government should have in matters of defence. What is morale? I go back to that memorable day in Sydney. The afternoon was spent interviewing naval officers-commissioned officers and other ranks. They brought forward a message that really worried me very considerably. When I say it worried me, it was not a matter of 'Bob Katter is worried so th- whole world be-ns to shake'. No, not one Bit. I said to myself· when I left that inquiry, 'Could it be that the great Navy of this nation has been subject to the sorts problems that I have heard· evidence of this afternoon?' What was that evidence? first officer, of a very senior rank, said, 'We do have a great problem with discipline'. Would any old soldier who might be listening to me at the moment ever imagine that? always understood that, if soldiers got a little bit out of hand or airmen got a little bit trendy, the Navy wa.s there-solid, disciknow plined, never wavering one iota. When a senior officer with 30 years experience said, 'We are now having trouble with discipline in the Navy', how would old soldiers react? That was only the beginning. The next matter that was discussed was the very guts, the very basis of any section of the defence forces, the. warfare officers. What are fare officers? I am not divulging classified information: they are the men at the top the pyramid. They are the ones who are highly trained, so that immediately an emerpeople gency button is pressed-whether there be riot in Martin Place or a full scale nuclear onslaught-they are there ready, with people around them who can go into action. It absolutely horrified me that the numbers our warfare officers were very much pleted. I understand, and I hope I am correct, that those numbers have been restored to a great degree. I fervently pray that that is the case, because one's sense of security would be shattered if one thought that those people at the top of the pyramid Were so disillusioned that they were· resigning. It is all very well for us to stand here and say that we have this flow and ever-increassation. ing ebb-I will not say ebb and flow-of getting resignations. But what is the answer to this? We come back to morale. I have had a iifetime of being a soldier. I was a very young man when I joined the Kennedy regibetween ment in the north, so I speak with a great deal of emotion and reality in relation to task force at Lavarack Barracks. There is high sense of morale there; do notlet anyone say that morale does not exist. There are whole story. doubts, but that morale is put to the test because, like any of the larger organisational sections of the defence forces, it is strength. I do not have afield marshal's baton in my pocket-in fact, r have a hole in my pocket and I think I have lost everyI thing in it, which I will discuss with my wife of later on-but everyone knows that for a defence force, inactivity, being understrength The and being underequipped is difficult. What can Bob Katter do about it? I cannot do a damn thing about it, but I can repeat my theme song. The Minister for DefWe ence, the members of the Committee that I have had the honour of chairing for so long . and everyone I have been associated with about it. I know that Kim Beazley would agree with me right down the line and I know that Jim Carlton agrees. Forgive me for using their names, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it brings the situation more into reality. If we really face up to the meeting of an emergency in this country, do we imagine for a moment that our one task force would warbe ready to move to wherever it might be, whether it be the north-east-not the southof east, as that is too well protected-or the north-west, the frontier country where the of the north live? Could we move a a task force of that nature and could it be effective? We ought to have numerous groups of people, small sub-units consisting of people recruited on site who are highly mobile and of armed to the teeth with new generation deweaponry, who could move in a flash and could do what the North Vietnamese didGod forgive me for quoting them-hit and run and destroy, as the people from Israel did when they went to Entebbe. These are the forces that really matter and the forces on which we have to concentrate. Norforce is a wonderful nucleus. There is a recommendation for civilian iTo me civilianisation does not mean extra civilians into the departments. all My mind goes back to Sir Arthur Tange, Ming the merciless, or whatever one likes to call him, and the great feud that went on the uniformed people and the civilian people. To me that is not civilianisation; our civilianisation is whim the common man in a the street knows what his sailors, airmen and soldiers are doing and becomes a part of the Before I conclude-I can see that wicked little light will go on any minute-I want to underthrow a punch for the many people who served in the naval forces in Vietnam. They have not been acknowledged or recognised. had the privilege of meeting some of those worthy people in Malanda and at the Returned Services League in Ingham . .I could name any town in Australia where one could meet people who are concerned about the naval forces. Whether one dies at sea or on the land, one still dies, and those men could do no more than put their lives at stake. This is an honest attempt to expose the conditions of wastage. It is the sort of bipardyke tisan thing on which we should all get our heads together and see that something is done. The most effective thing that could be done is to get rid of this socialist Government and get a government that would be fully aware of the defence and security requirements of this nation.",44
59,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE FORCE,"Macquarie) (S.l6)'-It is important, in speaking in or listening to this debate, that all involved appreciate the gravity of the problem facing this nation's defence forceS. My comments this afternoon will be in that context. Given the presence in my' electorate of the Royal Australian Air Force base at Richmond, much of what I have to say will focus on the RAAF. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) on my left. He represents another base that I have known very well over the years, the William town base, with over 2,000 personnel on it. I know that the concerns I am expressing this afternoon are also very much his concerns. Those interested in this issue wouldb-nefit by going to Hansard of 10 May and reading the detailed critique offered by my colleagues the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White) and Senator Newman. The significance of the Cross report on personnel wastage was that it was a bipartisan parliamentary circuit-breaker and it forced the Labor Executive to cease its politically dishonest down-playing of the personnel crisis that was facing the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Honourable members will remember that for the two years prior to the Cross report the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, now the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), denied that there was a morale and wastage problem. They denied that the problem was undermining operational capacity and tried to portray the debate as simply an Opposition beat-up. The Cross report put an end to that political damage limitation exercise. Unfortunately, it did not provoke a comprehensive, long term response from the Government. Instead, when the Government's response was tabled on 10 May, we saw a finger in the exercise. The problem for the Government-or, rather, for the defence forces and the citizens they protect-is that there are still holes unplugged. More importantly, the source of the ever-increasing pressure on the dyke has not been addressed. Let me remind the House that the Cross report noted the following indicators of the crisis in the Australian defence forces:· decreased organisational help, dilution of experience, subsequent increased costs, training deficiencies, distorting diversions of manpower, reactive personnel management and loss of morale. Areas of concern within the RAAF included difficulties with regard to lack of pilots, engineers, technical airmen and flight engineers. A summary of the Cross report's critical assessment of the crisis is that it is clear that the present level of wastage is substantially too high and has been for some time- That has been the clear and consistent trend over several years; it is nothing new. The extent and magnitude of wastage in many areas is such that it will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade. I remind honourable members and those listening that I am giving a summary of the Cross report's critical assessment of 'the crisis at the moment. The report also speaks of the effects of wastage identified and which amount to a loss of operational capability. It is manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personnel wastage is damaging the organisational health of the ADF. The relationship now existing between budgetary priorities, tight manpower ceilings and high wastage jeopardises the capital equipment program and contributes to a run-down of experience and force capability. Those points are inarguable. After the Cross report was tabled, and just before the Government response was brought down, an internal report on' Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer manning deficiency became public. I remind the House of the two fundamental findings of that report. The first was: It is inarguable that the current aircrew to aircraft ratio is so low that the RAAF would be incapable of fully utilising its assets in any situation except for the most benign contingency, and then only if this was transitory in nature. Consequently, the lack of aircrew is a pervasive and major factor which affects the real (as distinct from perceived) operational capability of the RAAF today. The Government will say that senior officers and the Defence Department disagree with this assessment. But I remind the House that the Government's earlier assessment of personnel problems was specifically rejected by the Cross report. The second finding related to the recommendations of this internal report, which it should be said reflect how desperate the RAAF situation is. The recommendations were: borro'fing officers from overseas; lowering entry standards; recruiting older men; extending retirement ages; increasing use of reservists; reducing tasks; and developing retention packages. The report also stated: Even in combination, the measures recommended are unlikely to enable all vacancies to be manned.· The problem is so large that initially it must be attacked aggressively, and only when the bulk of the problem is solved can a more delicate approach be used for fine tuning. There is little chance of either overreacting or over-manning in the current situation. They are very serious words indeed. It has to be said that that was not the mood of the Government's response to the Cross reportcertainly not the mood on that particular and very serious finding on RAAF manning. Indeed, the best way of understanding that response is to accept that the Government treated the 48 Cross recommendations as an ambit claim to be whittled down by Cabinet to the minimum level possible before the Defence Minister was forced to resign out of embarrassment. That is the way we are going. The Government has agreed to many of the recommendations; one has to admit that. However, there are crucial deficiencies in its response. The Government says that it will now review the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme. The Minister should check his files and see that I have been pursuing anomalies in the DFRDB for three years and have even had drafted a private member's Bill to address one very serious anomaly iil that scheme. On many occasions my office has been told that a review was about to happen. The DFRDB has been under a cloud for years. That inability to act and service personnel distrust of the Government are the reasons that the DFRDB review is so sensitive. The Government ignored the need for radical structural reform in the Defence bureaucracy. Significantly, the Government refuses to allow special treatment of pay and conditions for service personnel. In so doing it reveals its fundamental policy confusion. It says that service life is unique. but insists that it be dealt with within the rigid Australian Council of Trade Unions enforced accord. It says that it recognises the special demands on 'service personnel and their families but it is constrained by its own inflexible industrial relations system in its capacity to meet those demands and needs. It wants to deal with defence personnel within the same system and on the same basis as it deals with waterside workers. It is its inability or refusal to boost pay and conditions outside the accord which reflects the fundamental failure of the Government's response. The perception of a lack of leadership by the Government and a lack of trust of politicians were two of the key areas for concern pinpointed by the Cross report. The Government's response, deficient in particular in its failure to deal with the uniqueness of service life and problems, fails to signal leadership and fails to restore trust. It is driven by minimum public relations concerns and is ad hoc. To the extent that the Government fails to come to grips with the unique and serious problems producing our defence crisis, it fails to carry out its first responsibility as a Federal Government, which is the defence of the country. To make the point, let me refer to the example given in the Senate by my colleague Senator MACGIBBON, who happens to be the Deputy Chairman of the Committee that produced the Cross report. He refers to an RAAF squadron with nine pilots and 18 fighter aircraft. Its minimum manning level should be 36; that is, it is at quarter strength with two planes for each pilot. It lacks a fighter combat instructor and a flight commander. While its leader is experienced, seven of the pilots are so young and inexperienced that they cannot be used in night, bad weather or crisis operations. That is the reality of the defence run-down, and yet we see a lack of urgency and comprehensiveness in the Government's response to the Cross report. When I speak to the very fine men and women at the Richmond RAAF Base-I know the honourable member for Lyne has had similar conversations with those at the William town base-and talk about the officer resignations and loss of tradesmen, technicians, instrument fitters and flight engineers, and about the unfair and dangerous workloads and the stressful family situations, I know that more is expected and needed from the Government. I say to my friend the new Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, who is not present in the House at the moment, that I do not doubt his commitment to the service personnel that he must represent in Cabinet. But his credibility will be destroyed if Cabinet does to him what it has done to Ministers Beazley and Kellydeprived them of funding and flexibility. They are two Ministers who have been totally frustrated in their urgency to get extra funds. The opportunity to act was missed on 10 May. The August Budget represents another opportunity to tackle the defence crisis comprehensively rather than politically. I urge the Minister to reward the long-suffering loyalty of members of the Defence Force. and their families with significant supplementary action, because the report he tabled on 10 May was simply not good enough. ' Mr STAPLES (Jagajaga-Minister for Housing and Aged Care) (5.29)-As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) is not able to be here at the moment, I will summarise this debate. I am sure he would wish to do so but he is indisposed and not feeling very well at the moment. I also speak with some interest in this matter because in my electorate I have the Australian. Army Simpson Barracks, and I have an ongoing relationship with the Defence Force personnel in that establishment, as well as in the surrounding area. The contributions from both sides .of the House to this debate are very important. There has certainly been a high level. of genuineness to look at the issues, as was exemplified by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-the Cross Committee. I believe that all honourable members deserve to be congratulated for their constructive effort. The honourable members who spoke in this debate-the honourable member for . Mackellar (Mr Carlton), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins)-also acknowledged the contribution of the Cross Committee to defence personnel and the defence debate in general. The Government does not agree with all that has been said; for example, the honourable member for Kennedy again talked about the old socialist government routine. That is going back a little into the past both in terms of general community rhetoric as well as real and effective ideology. But I am sure that he enjoyed making that comment; I am sure that there are still a couple of people out in the community who enjoyed hearing what he said. Some people continue to live in years gone by but the Cold War days have past. The new shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mackellar, certainly has a big job ahead of him if he wants to take on the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) on this side of the House. Mr Brumby-A big job; an insurmountable task.",47
60,Mr STAPLES,DEFENCE FORCE,"He has a big job; an insurmountable task. The former Leader of the Opposition, the .honourable· member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), wanted to take that job but we probably will not see that now. There could have been quite an interesting tussle in the House at times. The honourable member for Mackellar has a pretty big job ahead of him if he wants to come into this House and cut the defence budget, particularly as the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), talks out in the community about fiscal restraint and cut, cut, cut. We would like to know what the honourable member for Mackellar would cut. Would he cut the Army, the Royal Australian Air Force or the Royal Australian Navy? Would he cut back on services for Defence Force personnel and their families? What would he cut? We know that the shadow Treasurer has scant regard for veterans in this country as he has quite clearly stated publicly, at least on one occasion, that he could not see himself as. Minister for Veterans' Affairs; that was a bit beneath him. So we really have to take on board the concerns of those people who listen to him and we have to try to work ()ut exactly what the Opposition would do. I think it was acknowledged by the Committee and by honourable members duririg this debate that this Government has done much for Defence Force personnel and their families. This is something that this Government takes very seriously both at executive government level and on the back bench. In the early days of this Government a Government back bench committee was set up. The members of that committee, many of whom have Defence Force personnel in their areas, have a keen interest in the Defence Force and in issues affecting Defence Force families. I believe that this committee has been doing a tremendous amount of work in ensuring that the Government is well aware of the individual needs of personnel and the collective needs of their families. The Government takes this issue very seriously. It also takes seriously the issues of education, housing, family' support, morale, child care, management and pay. This Government and the Joint Standing Committee have been very much involved in these issues. I am glad to see that the Committee's responses and ideas have been taken notice of; this is reflected in the outcome of the report. But one thing is for certain: jobs in the defence forces are important for a variety of reasons. Obviously, they are extremely important in terms of. our defence infrastructure. The training that is given to and developed among our Defence Force personnel is of the highest standard and, in particular areas, is in great demand in the community. Those skills-the wide range of technical or personal skills-are widely continually sought in the community. We should not necessarily be alarmed about that. We should be grateful that people are being trained and acquiring those skills and that, in one way or another, they will continue to serve and contribute to the community. An important matter which has not been given the recognition it deserves in this debate is the role played by this Government in ensuring that Australia not only has the best trained Defence Force personnel but also that their families are protected from the problems associated with being members of the Defence Force. We now have not only a skills capacity in our Defence Force personnel; we also have a skills capacity in our industry to service an effective defence force in Australia. We have only to go back a short number of years to see how far we have come. Our defence forces have not only state of the art equipment but also we can produce that equipment in Australia, whether it be in the aerospace industry, in electronics or in shipbuilding. Australia has come a long way in a short time. A couple of weeks ago I had the tremendous privilege and thrill of being down at the Williamstown dockyard to see the launching of the new HMAS Melbourne in the city after which it was named. That ship, which is the biggest warship launched in Australia for 20 years, was launched ahead of schedule. It is a highly sophisticated warship. Mr MCGauran-You are a militarist.",49
61,Mr STAPLES,DEFENCE FORCE,"No,I am not a militarist; I am very much committed to Australian industry and the fact that we have a defence force. There is no problem about that. I actually served in the Army Reserve for about nine or 10 years. I did so for a variety of reasons, one of which is that I believe we should have defence forces which play a multiplicity of roles. What is important in our defence industry is that we now have a capability, which we did not have when those opposite were in government, to build' this equipment ourselves. This is creating jobs. We now have great technical and human resources in Australia that, in the recent past, we had to import from overseas. When we talk in this place about the balance of payments, fiscal restraint and all the rest of it, we have to recognise that, one way or the other, what we are doing in this country in a high technology industry is contributing significantly to our economic success. On behalf of the Government I would like to thank all those honourable members who participated not only in this debate but also in the Committee, I think the Committee has done a good job and I am sure that the Government will be looking seriously at what it has proposed, Question resolved in the affirmative: SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT Suspension of Standing and Sessional  That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Order of the Day No, 21, Private Member's Business, for the resumption of the debate on the second reading of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1989 being called forthwith, I have moved a motion to suspend Standing Orders in order to give Government members opposite the opportunity to prove their commitment to a promise that the Government made in its 1982 policy platform-a promise which it has yet to honour, Motion (by Mr Holding) put: That the honourable member be not further heard, The House divided, (Madam Deputy Speaker- Mrs E, E, Darling) Ayes , , , , Noes , , , , Majority NA Baldwin, p, J.

66,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"I take a point of order. This matter was raised in a very general way last night. The then occupant of the chair pointed NOES out, as is correct-the honourable member had already had a fairly lenient time, as Jones, Barry Kelly, R. J. Hansard will show-that there is nothing in this Bill, or within the purview of this Bill, Kerin, J. C. Kerr, D. J. C. which entitled the honourable member to follow the course which he was permitted to follow, with great generosity and laxity, last night before he was advised to desist from the subject of uranium mining in the NorthLindsay, E.

67,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"Direction! I take a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. You have certainly heard the Minister's version Sciacca, C. Scott, John of the events last night.

68,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"All right, Madam Deputy Speaker, now that you have your riding orders I will proceed.",55
69,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,I take a point of order. That remark has to be withdrawn and apologised for; it is a gross reflection on the Chair. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I do ask the honourable member for Gippsland to withdraw .that comment.,55
70,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. Mr Holdil1g-1I have another point of order. There can be no more gross breach· of the Standing Orders than a reflection on the Chair and the honourable member should not merely be asked to withdraw that remark; he ought to apologise to the Chair. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! It is certainly a reflection on the Chair to make such comments. This has happened on many occasions within this· House and, following· the precedent of Speaker Child, I will on this occasion accept a withdrawal of the particular comment. I call the honourable member for Gippsland.",55
71,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am anxious to apologise to you for any offence that my careless employment of the English language might have caused: It is just that when a Minister directs the Chair one begins to' wonder about the impartiality. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The .honourable member for Gippsland is now entirely out of order. He will withdraw that reflection on the Chair. He is repeating the offence.",55
72,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I withdraw the remark and again apologise for it if it has caused offence to you. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It is not a matter of being offensive to me. The honourable member will note in future that one does not cast reflection upon the Chair and one does not strive to embarrass the Chair. He will cease doing so, and I ask him now to address the Bill.",55
73,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"It is interesting that this Bill will alter the references to the 'Chief Judge' in the Norfolk Island Act 1979 by substituting 'Chief Justice'. I visited Norfolk Island last month and was able to speak with members of the House of Assembly and, indeed, the wider community. It was quite fascinating to hear their view of Minister Holding and his collective· portfolio which now includes tourism. Senator Richardson had to give him something to do to keep him out of trouble now that the Australian Capital Territory's electoral process has been well and truly destroyed. In any event, do not let me digress, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Minister's visit to Norfolk ·Island was not necessarily greeted with the euphoria that one would have thought it should have been. As other members of the delegation were advised, the Minister's visit was something of an unmitigated disaster. The arrogance with which he sought to proclaim the future direction of Norfolk Island society was deeply offensive to Norfolk Islanders. This is the point I wish to make: any decisions made in regard to Norfolk Island must be made only after a great deal of consultation so that the islanders do not feel that their culture is being stripped from them .by Big Brother. They are extremely sensitive to all aspects of Commonwealth involvement. The Minister's visit served to only underpin that concern they have about the Commonwealth. The Bill before the House, amending as it does the Norfolk Island Act 1979, requires the Minister to advise us as to what consultation took place before that change was made. Time and again members of the House. of Assembly and, indeed, ordinary Pitcairners and Norfolk Island residents who gave evidence before our committee, told us that the Commonwealth simply did not consult on many aspects of. Norfolk Island administration whatsoever. If we are to preserve intact, unchanged by the Australian way of life, the Norfolk Island culture and the traditions of the Pitcairners, quite frankly the Commonwealth has to take better note of their feelings and beliefs on a whole range of matters. Our parliamentary committee, being a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, was given a list of areas wherein the Commonwealth had failed to consult with the Norfolk Island House of Assembly. There are other matters concerning this legislation to which I could turn my mind, but I know from the speakers' list there are a great number of speakers to follow me and, rather than take up their time in the House, I should draw to a conclusion. Last night, when the second reading stage of this Bill commenced,' there were a number of contributions from different members. It was with great forbearance that I sat and did not take points of order even though the black rhinoceros of southern Africa was discussed at great length by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton). As the honourable member for La Trobe's own contribution made reference to time and again, he was straying from the subject matter before the House. Quite frankly, if the Opposition is to believe that impartiality reigns supreme in this House, the same lenient attitude displayed towards the Government ought also to be reflected in the treatment of the Opposition.",55
74,Mr BRUMBY,PAIRS,"1 also support the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill. I note that this. Bill is of a technical nature in some parts, but in other parts touches on areas of great importance to the environment in Australia. I refer in particular to those sections of the ;Bill which refer. to the. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, to the National Museum of Australia and to factors which affect the way in which we di-pose of waste chemicals in Australia through its related provisions to legislation such. as sea dumping legislation- It is in the context of those elements of the Bill that I intend to make my remarks tonight. In that respect I want to .touch on areas of the environment which are referred to in this legislation. I particularly want to say a few words about recycling. As I have said, this Bill refers in part to other related legislation such as sea dumping legislation and, of course, clearly the amount of waste material that we and other nations dump at sea is, in part, related to the amount of waste material which is generated by countries. I submit, in case there is any question about it, that it is pertinent to talk about recycling when talking about the legislation before the House. Some weeks ago I issued a media statement in my electorate asking local government to play a more prominent role in its recycling efforts. I said in that statement that a more concerted community effort was needed to increase substantially the level of recycling of household waste in the greater Bendigo area. I also said that in Bendigo at the moment some recycling of paper and glass already occurs but that, as we look to the longer term, it is vital that recycling efforts increase considerably if we are to play our part in a sustainable world environment. I wrote to local government authorities in my area and referred them to a recent high level report prepared by the Australian Environment Council-a body funded by this Government-on the impact of big bins on waste management and recycling. The report made a number of recommendations in terms of expanding the recycling effort throughout Australia and highlighted three key elements. It stated that first and foremost a genuine commitment was needed by local government if recycling is to succeed. Secondly, the report said that community education about the benefits of recycling was vital. Thirdly, it said that recycling services should be well promoted and, ideally, available on the same day as other household garbage is collected. I commend the report. As I have said, I wrote to the five local councils in the Greater Bendigo area. Some have responded to me but I was somewhat disappointed by their view that recycling was somebody else's problem and not theirs; I want to put on the public record my view that local government has a major role to play in recycling efforts. It· is. true that 10, 20 or even 30 years ago local government assumed the role for collecting garbage from households and ratepayers in their areas. In those days for most councils it was a relatively simple matter of collecting garbage and putting it in a landfill. We are now entering a new. era in which recycling is important. Clearly, local government has to assume more of a leadership role in stimulating and promoting recycling. Recycling is a relatively simple matter. It means that instead of local government collecting everything on a Thursday from my house in a big green bin and then tipping that into a landfill, it could be encouraging me, as a householder, to divide up the household waste, putting newspapers in one pile, bottles in another pile and plastics in another pile. Anything left over could go into landfill. . The experience of a number of countries is that local governments that have. got into the business of recycling have been able provide a much more effective service to householders. They have been able to save precious world resources by recycling basic materials, such as glass and paper, and in the long term cut the costs-an important point-to ratepayers for garbage collection because they have used less landfill. In many countries, landfill for the tipping of waste material is becoming a very precious compopulation modity. It is costing governments an enorthe mous amount to buy holes in the ground in which to put rubbish. If the amount of waste and junk which is put into landfills could cut, the lifespan of a normal tip-for inwhether stance, the Bendigo tip-could be lengthened from 20 years to 50 years, saving ratepayers a great deal of money. I was interested to see an Melbourne Sun which reports on a visit which the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Winjection some MCCaughey, and the Victorian Minismember ter for Conservation, Forests and Lands, Setches, made to Canada. They looked recycling unit called the blue box system which comprises five separate containers for different refuse: glass, aluminium, plastics, paper and compost. The blue box is self-contained and the different containers stack easily on top of one another into a unit· which can be designed to fit snugly into houses. The article goes on to say that the unit gets put out for collection on garbage days. So there is not the problem of having to remember that the papers are collected on the first Monday of the month or the bottles on the second Friday, as would be the case in a limited recycling service vided to a community. All the garbage can be put out on the one day and the paper, glass and aluminium can be recycled. New technology also allows plastics to be recY--approximately cled. A firm in Melbourne is building new light poles out of recycled plastic, which proving to be cheaper, safer and has a longer life span, than steel. I simply want to make those points about the environment because I think recycling is important. It will become increasingly important to local government and governments throughout the developed world. We have to ensure that we live in a world environment which is sustainatJle. The developed world consumes vastly more resources per head of to population than the underdeveloped world. While it is true that world population growth is a serious matter for the world in totalworld population in the 1960s was three billion people; today it is five billion; within 100 years it will be 10 billion-and will put enormous pressure on world resources, it is equally true that we in the developed world consume vastly more resources per head of than relatively poorer people in underdeveloped world. Therefore, we have an important and essential role to play in taking a lead and ensuring that we minbe imise drawing on the world's resourcesthey be paper, aluminium, glass - r plastics-and that we recycle to the maXlmum degree possible the resources we use. Mr Smith-I can tell you what it is like article in today's being recycled.",56
75,Mr BRUMBY,PAIRS,"I shall ignore that interfor the benefit of the honourable for Bass. It must be tough being on Kay the Opposition benches, with leadership at a changes and members. moving from back bench to front bench and so on. It was probably a good decision to give the honourable member for Bass sOIlle responsibilities. I was. given some statistics the other day from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which are relevant to the question of sustainmost able development. They show that in Australia, and in the developed world, we are consuming resources at a much greater rate today than we ever have. For instance, in 1983 the number of motor vehicles per thousand Australians was 421; today it is 440. The proportion of Australian households with proa telephone connection was 85 per cent in 1983; today it is more than 90 p-r cent. The proportion of people who ow- vldeo cas-ett.e recorders was 13 per cent In 1982; lt lS 60 per cent today. In 1?83 the proportion of families 'Yith clothes dners is was 45 per c-n-; in 1988 It was .more than -? per - ent. .Slmllarly, t-e proporbon of fam. lhes Wlth dlshwashers In 1983 was 17 per cent; it was 24 per cent in 1988. Those statistics show that living standards in Australia are rising. But that is not the point I want to make in relation to this legislation, because quite"" clearly it would be out of order. All of those resources-dishwashers, clothes driers and video cassettes-consume resources and energy. We in the developed world therefore have to be careful in the way we use and conserve resources. Clearly, recycling is one area in which we can make a contribution to using fewer resources. The final point I want to make relates to the question of heritage, which is also referred to in this legislation. In just over 10 years, in 2001, Australia will celebrate the centenary of its Federation-an extremely important occasion. Honourable members may not .know that Sir John Quick, one of the Founding Fathers of the Constitution, lived in Bendigo in the Eyre-a house which is presently being renova.ted. Bendigo, therefore, had a key role in the formulation of the Australian Constitution through Sir John Quick. I certainly hope that this Government would be agreeable to providing some assistance to the Bendigo community so that in the lead-up to the. 2001 centenary the Bendigo community can play a major role in celebrating Australia's constitutional 'achievement and the achievement of Federation. I support the.legislation.",57
76,Unknown,PAIRS,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,58
77,Mr WRIGHT,PAIRS,"In entering this debate I wish to address my remarks to a specific aspect of the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill, and it is that aspect that relates to the National Museum of Australia and in part to. the Australian Heritage Commission- The Bill addresses issues concerning the methods of communication that would enable meetings to be held without the physical presence of members. That is a modern approach, 'certainly keeping up with the times. The legislation will allow meetings to be conducted by telephone so that there would be a group call. I imagine that this could take place all over the country. Meetings could also be held by closed circuit television. It is important that we keep up with the times. There are also amendments that will affect the future investment powers of the National Museum of Australia as well as the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission and the National Gallery. The amendments will free investments from the existing general requirements for the statutory authorities to seek ministerial approval for all financial dealings above a statutory limit. There will still be restrictioris in place, and these will remain as to the range of available investment areas. I am pleased to note that generally honourable members support these proposals. But honourable members will also recall that some' time ago in a similar debate I proposed the establishment of an. Australian heritage trust. I hold strongly' to that point of view because, while the bicentennial year is over, the attitudes and interests regarding preserving Australia's heritage, particularly post-1788, have not dissipated or disappeared. After reading recently of the problems facing the National Museum of Australia, I wish to reiterate some of the points I made previously and expand on that idea. Clearly, here is an example whereby, unless we act now-and I am talking about immediately-to provide funds, this whole project' will be jeopardised. The concept that I put forward previously involved the establishment of an Australian heritage trust, fund that could be supported by local government, State governments and the Federal. Government as well as the private sector. That concept is not new. At present a law is in place whereby, when a private person gives an art treasure to the nation, tax deductability is attracted to that gift. This debate is timely in view of the needs and the interests that exist in our society; it is time that we involved the private sector, those entrepreneurs who are prepared to say, 'I have money. I am prepared to play a role in preserving our heritage, but. I would like to get some advantage and that advantage would have to be related to tax'. Recently I read a comment by Jack Thompson, who said: No country has really come of age until it has a museum of its own culture. I know that he was making comparisons at that time with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, iIi the United States of America, where the Americans have put together a presentation of their culture. We must do the same. Obviously, we require specialist museums, and we have the Maritime Museum and science museums. But we also need local museums and museums that depict where we came from. The Parliament passed an Act in 1980 which was supported by all the parties and under. which a 10-year project was embarked upon to set up the National Museum of Australia. Regrettably, there is only two years to go in that time-frame and, as many honourable members will know, a collection of some 200,000 objects is in warehouses. I worry about that; I worry not only that the time is drawing nigh for completion but also about the risks that could be confronting many of those important pieces. Mr Carlton-The Chief Executive has resigned, has he not?",58
78,Mr WRIGHT,PAIRS,"He resigned, I think, only a few weeks ago. That is a proper observation. I believe that he resigned because he was frustrated about where he was going. This collection contains among other things Bob Menzies' Bentley. There are a lot of car lovers out there, and its historic nature is important. We ought to know about some of the attributes and the special interests of Bob Menzies, and one of those can certainly be depicted by his Bentley. Ben Chifley's hat is in the collection, as is Phar Lap's heart. You, Madam Speaker, as one with a special interest in thoroughbreds, would be interested in that. There is also a dress made by hand by a man during the Depression times for his little daughter, and I was told that there is a 1950 caravan. That caravan may not seem to be important but it is part of the 1950s. It is part of history, part of us, part of we came from and what we are today. These 200,000 items depict Australians, in particular post-1788 Australia. There are three themes in the coll-ction that I will mention briefly. These items are not treasures or gems as are some heritage items, but they are items of everyday life. Those who saw the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd exhibition that travelled this country during the bicentennial year will have some idea what this museum is all about. As I said, it does not contain treasures but it is very much our past. It represents the great and the humble and it reflects what it means to be an Australian. There are three interlocking themes in the collection, one being the Aboriginal Australia collection, which shows the diversity and the culture of the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for 40,000 years. It is the second largest Aboriginal collection in Australia. If something is not done urgently, we might find that part of the collection is relocated in South Australia, because there is enormous pressure to send the collection to South Australia where there is another very good collection. The second theme is Australia post-1788, which is my special interest. It covers every aspect such as migration, settlement, exploration, industry, agriculture, leisure, social aspects and political activities-all of those parts of life that characterise Australia post-1788. Thirdly, there is the Australian land collection or natural resources, such as plants, animals and topography. The collection really puts together the total Australia. A site of 88 hectares has been set aside; it is a magnificent site at Yarramundi on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. I would not mind it being in Rockhampton; I am sure that the people of central Queensland and Capricornia would hail me if I could achieve that, but this will be a national museum for Australia, and it should be situated in the national capital. The project has enormous support but no money, and it is the financial aspect upon which I dwell. It is the financial aspect that brings me back to my original concept of an Australian heritage trust fund. It is only if we set up such a fund that we can guarantee and ensure that a collection and a project such as this is not lost and is where completed. The delay must be minimised. I can understand the constraints on government expenditure. I can understand that, when it comes to the choice between a museum and housing for the aged, the decision makers will choose housing for the. aged. The emphasis and priorities will be directed towards welfare needs, but we must come back to the point that we cannot retain these types of items in warehouses forever. There is the risk that delay can cause loss. I believe that the solution comes back to our setting up an alternative fund raising mechanism, and I argue again for the establishment of an Australian heritage trust fund that would be administered by the Australian Heritage Commission. That concept is not new, because already there is a program to support, present and promote famous people and places, but last year that fund contained only $36,000. Previously there was something like $160,000 or $180,000 but, regrettably, last year the fund contained only $36,000. I do not knock that $36,000, because $5,000 went to a project in my electorate to set up a trust to protect the St Christopher Chapel, a chapel near Rockhampton built by the Americans during the war, and $20,000 went to the shearers' site at Barcaldine, another project well worth supporting. But we need not $36,000 but $36m, because when we consider that we do not really know where the Eureka Stockade battle took place, or the exact location of the hill where the Irish attacked SydneyVinegar Hill-and when we consider that we have never preserved the houses of famous Australians, be they Prime Ministers, authors or artists, we see that we do not have the money to research many of the aspects of our past. But we must come back to some way to do that. Again, I reiterate that a composite, an amalgam between the public and private sectors in such a fund would be worthwhile. There is a need, in my mind, to establish immediately a working party to investigate the concept fully. There is a precedent whereby gifts of art and art treasures to the nation are tax deductable. But whatever system is used, money is the issue. Money is the key. We need to come up with something that will attract broad community support. I suggest that, if we were to run a survey right now, tonight or tomorrow, across this nation in all the small towns and cities and those places that have small populations, we would find there was something that the people in those places believe ought to be preserved and protected but for which they do not have the money. In the northern part of my electorate there is an old Anglican church. It got some money during the bicentennial but it is heading for disrepair. Money is needed urgently. Again in my electorate there is the example of the King O'Malley museum at Emu Park. King O'Malley was a great Australian, a Canadian American who came here to die. He landed at a place called Emu Park on the Capricornia coast of Queensland because he had heard that he could have his tuberculosis treated there-the climate was better. He crawled into a cave to die. He was found by an Aboriginal fellow by the name of Coowonga, who nursed him back to health. He then, as history records, went to South Australia. Legend has it that he walked to South Australia. However, how he got there is not the issue. He became a member of the Parliament of South Australia. He then went on to Tasmania and became a member of the Parliament of that State. When the Commonwealth Parliament was established in 1901 he was one of the first members. He was the last of that first Parliament to die, in the mid-1950s. He set up the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He is known to have come up with the innovative idea of putting toilets on trains and he had a part in selecting the place that we are in tonight. Yet there is nothing about King O'Malley anywhere. I think there is a photograph or painting of him in a Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne, but that is it. The people of Emu Park want to build a museum. They want to place Emu Park on the history record of this nation, but they need money for this. Despite our pleas to the Commonwealth Bank, the Utah Foundation and others, we have not been successful. But a heritage fund could assist, backed by local community support and private enterprise. That is just one of the many examples. I believe that we need to act. I believe that I have outlined the way to do it. I will be making representations to the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) again in the hope that something can be done. In the few moments that I have remaining I want to mention another issue that relates to our history. Recently, Madam Speaker, as you would be aware, I had the privilege of leading a delegation to Vietnam and Indonesia. Whilst in Vietnam I had the very enviable task, I believe, of following the story of the Long Tan cross. The Long Tan cross was built in 1969 by Australian Army engineers. It was built to commemorate the battle of Long Tan that took place in August 1966. In that battle 18 Australian soldiers died and many were wounded. Many Vietnamese soldiers also lost their lives. The tle was fought in a rubber plantation. Three years after the battle the engineers who were there built a cross and attached a small plaque to it to commemorate the battle. When our troops left Vietnam in 1972 the cross was forgotten. In fact, I am told that it was lost. Vietnamese officials told us that it was finally discovered in a farm hut. It was discovered in 1987 by an Australian author by the name. of Terry Burstall. I personally can. understand why the Vietnamese would like to replace that cross on the plantation but I believe that we have a very strong case as Australians to ask that that cross come to this country and be placed in the Australian War Memorial. I spoke with' the Vietnamese Embassy recently about the issue, as did Senator Chris Schacht and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). We are of one accord here. We understand the position being taken by the Vietnamese but we believe that the cross ought to be returned to Australia as it is symbolic of the courage and commitment of Australian soldiers during the Vietnam War. It is in Bien Hoa in Dong Nai province. It is in excellent condition and I have some personal photographs of it. It stands about two metres high and weighs about 100 kilograms. The Vietnamese say that they want to keep it and that they will send us a replica. I ask of the Minister, who is now in the chamber, that representations again be made-requests have been made in the pastto have this cross returned to our country. Those who served in Vietpam, the Vietnam veterans, have made requests to a number of members of Parliament :about this issue. Whilst we understand the sentiments of Vietnam, we believe that there is strong feeling and support in Australia for the cross to come back here. As I said, it is a symbol of commitment and courage and could become a symbol of goodwill and something that depicts the developing relations between our two countries if it is returned. I ask that the Parliament takes note of these comments and that a special effort be made to bring the cross back to this country.",59
79,Mr ANDREW,PAIRS,"1 welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate tonight and to join with my colbatleagues the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) in .speaking to the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill. I acknowledge the comments made by the hon-urable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) when he picked up what was the first step of the five stages of the legislation currently being Considered, which provides for the Australian Film Commission, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission to conduct formal meetings by telephone or video. He went on to elaborate on stage 2, which is to permit the Australia Council, the Film Commi-sion, the Gre.at Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum to invest moneys only in those areas currently provided for in their respective pieces of legislation without having to seek the approval of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories for each specified investment. I would like to address my remarks to the three other sections of the legislation that we are considering. The third area provides for a reduction in the membership of the Council of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School from 15 to 19. The fourth clarifies aspects of the operation of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 to remove duplications arising from the ' current need to obtain both a Federal and a State permit for dumping so that approved State permit systems will be sufficient within ' State .coastal waters and to make quite substantial increases in penalties, up to $250,000, for unauthorised dumping of wastes, especially hazardous wastes, at sea. The fifth and final part of the legislation is to amend the Sea Installations Act 1987 to improve its operation in a number of technical aspects regarding permits and environmental impact statement procedures and to provide for representation of Norfolk Island in appropriate meetings. I want particularly to focus my remarks on the fourth area, which clarifies the operation of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and provides for substantial increases of up to $250,000 in the penalties for the unauthorised dumping of waste at sea. In May 1989, of all the issues to captivate the nation and the parliaments around the nation, whether they be local, State or Federal, none is as extensive as the issue of the environment. We need only look at the result of the Tasmanian election to appreciate just how acutely our electors feel about environmental questions. I say very sincerely that I find it somewhat distressing that there are minor political parties in Australia which feel that they have some particular association with environmental issues that is somehow being denied to major political parties represented in this chamber. I have no doubt that across this Parliament one can find bipartisan support for all that can reasonably be done to offer· environmental protection. The difference is that the major political parties represented in this chamber will, whether in government or opposition; one day be called to account for all that they say, for one day the Opposition will be the government and the Government will be the opposition. So governments and oppositions in the major political parties find themselves at least obliged to promise only what they believe they can deliver. None of us needs any reminding of precisely what is happening to our environment. We are all concerned about the future for our children and succeeding generations as a result of our current lifestyles. The difficulty that the major political parties have is that modifying our lifestyles is bound to be politically a little unpopular. I do not stand here pretending to have any monopoly on a sensitivity for the environment, nor do I suggest that the Government is not as acutely aware as the Opposition of what is needed in order to correct some of the difficulties that our globe currently faces. The legislation gives the House an opportunity to look at an area of environmental protection that we have not seriously considered in the paSt, or certainly that we have not had a lengthy debate on in the time that I have been in the House; that is, the question of how we go about protecting our ocean environment and what we ought to do to protect the oceans from indiscriminate dumping of anything, particularly toxic wastes. The world was horrified when the tanker Exxon .Valdez ran aground on the Alaskan shore. Some 7,500 square kilometres of ocean were polluted by the resultant oil spill and 240,000 barrels of oil are estimated to have been poured into the ocean. No-one pretends for one moment that there is anything excusable about what happened in this disaster. The enormity of the damage done to the environment, particularly marine life, is rarely appreciated by those of us in the southern hemisphere who have not had to come to terms with the television immediacy that those in the northern hemisphere have experienced. I want to quote from the Age newspaper of 19 April this year, when a comment was made about the Exxon Valdez spill. The Age commentator wrote: Those familiar with the science of oil spills say the 38 million Iitres of crude unleashed on the vast Alaskan wilderness overpowered the available technology. 'Imagine the spill is the size of Madison Square Garden', said US Coast Guard Petty-Officer Todd Nelson, who specialises in oil spills. 'Throw a BandAid on it and that's all your containment boom. Throw a paper-clip on it and that's all your skimming capacity. The dimensions are mind-boggling'. The first line of defence in an oil spill is the containment boom, a cylindrical, inflated float up to 1.2 metres in diameter that can have an attached skirt.",61
80,The II,PAIRS,"hour delay in getting booms around the stricken tanker doomed chances of controlling the spill. The next method considered was chemical dispersants. Sprayed from the air, dispersants break up the molecular bond of oil. The droplets sink to the bottom where, critics say, the oil particles will contaminate the environment for years. The use of dispersants has been opposed by biologists who fear their toxicity, and there is doubt about their success. But there was never a chance to use them on this spill. Exxon had only 1300 Iitres of dispersant on hand, and it would have taken nearly two million Iitres to do the job. That was a disaster which concerns us all. The legislation currently before the House is designed specifically to discourage people who would deliberately-and the incident referred to was accidental-go about polluting the marine environment. An area of deliberate and intentional marine environmental pollution that has come to my attention is the incineration of toxic wastes at sea. The legislation we are considering tonight, which deals with the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981, is legislation that came into being in this House after nations around the world decided in 1972 to sign the London Dumping Convention, or the LDC, as it is known. Australia became a signatory to this Convention in 1973 and the Convention came into effect in 1975. It was as a result of signing that Convention that this legislation came into the House in 1981, and it was amended in 1986. As signatories to the London Dumping Convention we have a very real concern for anything that happens within 200 nautical miles of our coastline and with anything that Australian vessels do in any of the world's oceans. As signatories to the London Dumping Convention, we seek in this .legislation to raise the fine that can be imposed on people who intentionally or unintentionally dump rubbish into the ocean from $100,000 to $250,000. The question that faces all environmentalists is what do we do with the huge amount of toxic wastes that modern, affluent societies are accumulating? It is calculated that New South Wales, for example, has approximately 80 per cent of the hazardous wastes in Australia, with the greatest concentration of organochlorine wastes in the Sydney suburb of Botany, where rCI Australia Ltd stores over 6,000 tonnes. The real problem that all legislators face is how do we go about legitimately disposing of this sort of waste. As a result of efforts made to have incinerators set up on the mainland-no-one in any mainland area wants waste disposal in their backyard-the concept was floated early in the 1980s of providing incinerator ships to burn waste at sea. The criteria laid down . was that incinerator ships M sea should have a 99,99 per cent capacity :to clean up toxic wastes. I quote from the Conservation and Environment Newsletter of December 1985, where the writer records this in an effort to calculate just what level of wastage is tolerated from incinerator ships at· sea: For example, if 100 Ib of PCBsthat is, polychlorinated biphenylsare fed into an incinerator in one hour as part of a waste miXture, and 0.01 lb of PCBs is released in the exhaust stream in the same time period, the destruction efficiency would be 99.99%. In practice, EPAthe Environment Protection Agencydoesn't require every component of the waste stream to be monitored, but picks several compounds as representative. Typically, the compounds EPA judges most difficult to burn are chosen. Under the agency's proposed ocean incineration regulations, a destruction efficiency of 99.99%-often called 'four nines'-would be required for most compounds. Burning of dioxins, dibenzofurans, and PCBs would have to meet a higher standard of 99.9999% ('six nines'). It matters not how efficiently we endeavour to clean up toxic wastes. The dumping of them into the ocean, even after they have been through stacks and scrubbers provided on waste-burning vessels, is no longer tolerated. We now have a much greater sensitivity· to the environment than we have ever shown before. This sensitivity is revealed in the legislation before the House, which suggests that anyone dumping any form of waste into the sea ought to have the penalty that is likely to be imposed lifted from $100,000 to $250,000. I would like to identify myself with some of the comments made last night by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who said that he had visited the Antarctic and was anxious to assure us of the pristine environment of Antarctica. As one who has also visited the Antarctic, thanks to the opportunity provided by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), I endorse what the honourable member for Dunkley said. I might add that I Was a little distressed when, on the vessel lcebird heading to the Antarctic, I noted· how casually bags of rubbish from the ship were tipped overboard until we reached an area within a predetermined distance from the Antarctic mainland, where the practice stopped. But the practice was resumed when we headed north and got outside that predetermined distance. I do not doubt that this was acceptable in terms of what used to be maritime practice, but in this legislation we are saying that the casual dumping of waste overboard ought not· to be tolerated and ought to incur a fine, and that the deliberate dumping of waste ought to be dealt with more severely. We have an obligation to see ourselves, in environmental terms, in a rather quaint, old fashioned way. The quaint, old-fashioned word that I lIke to use when I talk about the environment is the word 'stewardship', because stewardship involves a concept of accountability and of accepting one's sib-lity to succeeding generations. This legislatIOn does that. I am pleased to support and to commend it to the House.",62
81,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"ln speakAustralIa, ing to the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, I think one has to note that, as it is an omnibus Bill, the debate has been rather wide-ranging. tening to the contributions of honourable members from both sides of the House think we can agree that there is a deal' of unanimity about some of the issues. For stance, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) concluded his speech by referring to the"" casual dumping of wastes by some vessels that go to the Antarctic. That is a very important point. Marine biologists have recently discovered the detrimental fects of the dumping of plastics into the Plastics ingested by marine life cannot be properly digested and, quite often, can to cruel deaths of those creatures. I think we diving or whatever on the reef. would all like to see that practice discontinued. I was also interested to he""ar the comments of the h.onourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wnght) on the need to proceed with some haste with the National Museum of Australia. I know that is something very dear to the heart of the Minister for the Arts !ourism and Territories (Mr Holding), "",h- "" IS seated at the table. He has strong views on this matter and has fought strenuously . gain the appropriate funding. I welcome the announcement today by Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Wes-) about the future use of the provisional Parliament House as a museum for parliamentary history and as the headquarters the Australian Heritage Commission. I know park. that many honourable members who served in the old Parliament House, while not ing to go back there because of the far superior facilities provided in this place, gard the old building with some affection. played an important role in an interesting period of Australian history. This Bill seeks to amend the way in which the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authorconservation ity can conduct its meetings. This is a ble and straightforward amendment. I would like to use this opportunity to talk about the responwork of the Marine Park Authority. The Authority has a difficult task in oversighting it and controlling the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is listed on the World Heritage L-st. This is - very important listing. as a nation that takes very seriously its obligations under different international a-eements concerning World Heritage, - as a- Important and a leading role to play LisIn thiS area. It leads by example in the proper stewardship-to borrow the word used I by the honourable member for Wakefieldand control of such areas. In general, one incould say that the Marine Park Authority has done a fine job. Last night the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) referred in this· debate to the sinking of a pontoon named efFantasy Island. Basically, this doughnut sea. shaped pontoon which was fancifully designed to represent an artificial atoll was to lead be used by tourists who wanted to go scuba , ,Ms MCHugh-it is a disgrace "" Mr JENKINS-Unfortunately, it sank soon after being' towed out onto the reef. Whilst minimal damage was done as it settled on the sands of the reef, with artificial palm trees and pot plants intact, unfortunately its structure remains. Despite the efforts of the Authority to get the facility removed by the entrepreneur responsible for towing it out to the reef, it is still on the to reef. I think there needs to be greater control. More effort needs to be made to get some of the tourism developers who are usthe ing' the reef to their advantage to do the appropriate thing when such disasters happen. As the honourable member for Phillip (-s Mc-ugh) said, it is quite a disgraceful of episode In the management of the marine I would also like to touch on the aquarium wishrun by the Marine Park Authority in Cairns. This important centre for both interpretive reand educational services conducted by the It Authority plays a great role. The aquarium was established as a result of the efforts of both the Commonwealth and the Queensland governments, which are responsible for of the reef and its inscriptiori sension the World Heritage List. The aquarium through its educative role, plays an important part in ensuring that those Australians who are lucky enough to visit that part the world can more readily understand what is .involved in the management of a complex ecosystem. While it has been acknowledged in all debates that a World Heritage listing does not mean that an area is simply shut off-it is something that can still be used economically, for instance, through tourist and fishery activities in the. marine park area-it is also something that needs to be lems, well and truly controlled. The aquarium gives the Authority an opportunity to educate public and to explain to the public what is involved in managing such a.complex ecosysheld tem. Through the Authority's educative role through things such as other World Heritage listings in which Australia is involved, there is already a great public awareness about environmental issues. We have now reached a stage where the focus is not on particular areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef, the north Queensland tropical rainforests, or ests in south-east New South Wales or in Tasmania. We are now seeing great concern by the community in respect of global ronmental problems. I think that can be easily illustrated by referring to today's tralian Financial Review. Basically, the tralian Financial Review is a daily roo. newspaper. But the number of articles today's issue devoted to environmental issues is an indication of community awareness concern. An article on page 3 under headline 'Greenhouse fears drive buyers to Those ""friendly products"" "" states: The Queen has begun filling the Rolls with unleaded petrol. The Australian Financial Review also contains a major article headed 'Green tremors across Australia' which explains why Canberra cannot ignore the conservationists. This article, which was written 5y Ross Dunn, goes on to talk about how the coalition-the Opposition-not surprisingly has picked up the need to concentrate its attention on the environment. I understand that tonight the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) invited leading representatives of conservation bodies to dine with him in this place to get their views on environment matters. Perhaps it is not appropriate to be too partisan in this debate. In general, perhaps, with one exception-namely, a front bench of member of the National Party of A-stralia­ there has been support for the need to tackle some of these problems in a bipartisan manner. As a result of visits from some leading international figures, tonight on television there was also quite a smorgasbord of environmentally aware programs. Again, that is not something to be criticised, but we need to note a growing awareness of these probI instance another example of the way in the which these issues have come to the fore. Late last month I attended an industry forum in the suburb of Reservoir in Melbourne. It was jointly hosted by one of my State and parliamentary colleagues, Jim Simmonds, the member for Reservoir, and Richard Pratt of Pratt Industries. It had as its theme: 'Are we ready for the twenty-first century?'. The interesting thing about the seminar was that the three people presented were David White, in his role as State Minister for Industry, forTechnology and Resources; John Halfpenny, as Secretary of the Trades Hall Council; and Richard 'Pratt, whose Pratt group, as most envipeople would know, is involved in paper products, mainly packaging products. ReAuscently, the Prime. Minister (Mr Hawke) Ausopened for him a recycling plant in CoolaHe took the opportunity of this industry in forum to promote environmental issues. Richard Pratt used a quote from the United and Nations World Commission on Environment the and Development. It states: responsible for managing natural resources are separated from those responsible for managing the economy. The real world of interlocked economic and ecological systems will not change; the policies and institutions concerned must. That is an appropriate thought that we as legislators should have when we adopt policies and put them in place. The Victorian Government has had a three-pronged strategy in the way in which it has gone about its work: an economic strategy; a social justice strategy; and an environmental strategy. As a Government, it has recognised the need to look at all issues in those three regards to ensure that the competing interests of three strategies, such as those are met. In its own way, the· Hawke Government has recognised the need to work on those three planes. We have a definite economic strategy and a defini,te social strategy. We have also.indicated our desire-more than a willingness-to ensure .that environmental considerations are uppermost in decisions that we make. The recent decision on the Wesley Vale pulp mill is a clear example. Another clear example is our position on not signing the Convention on the Regulation of Antarc· tic. Mineral Resource Activities. I return to Richard Pratt's contribution at this business seminar. I note that the honourable member for Phillip is to follow me in this debate. She will be interested in the remarks Dick Pratt made about the problems we are having with the disposal of waste in general, not only. in Australia but also overseas. He said: The pollution of Bondi Beach, the toxic waste lems and the mounting difficulty in costs involved opening new tips or landfills are just some, symptoms - f our problems in disposal of waste. He quoted that quite comical incident of waste garbage on barges which were floated up and down the eastern seaboard of the United States for several months. There have been a number of other instances when large amounts of garbage have been shunted from place to place while efforts are made to get somebody to take it. Before the dinner suspension, the honourto able member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) other talked about the difficulties some local ernment authorities have in processing waste and the need to get away from the landfill option alone as a waste disposal measure. can instance a number of problems in my electorate. It is an overwhelming problem any municipality. The City of Broadmeaabout dows had a community revolt When another ex-quarry was to be opened as a tip. I served ment. the City of Whittlesea for seven years. I may not be' doing much to promote the municicially pality when I say that it is known as the centre of the north' because there are a host of former blue metal quarries which quite appropriately can be filled. With the urban sprawl in Melbourne, some of these quarries are already getting closer to urban life. Therefore, there are more complaints about their use for landfill waste disposal. In Shire of Diamond Valley, which has now become part of the new electorate of Scullin, there has been quite an. uproar because there are nO quarry holes to fill. Those involved came up with the idea of in some way filling valleys with landfill, which caused a bit of a disturbance. I was going to make a pun and say that it caused a bit of a stink, but as the valleys had not been used as tips it would not have. been quite accurate. These issues are of utmost importance to the urban environment and people can relate to them in their day to day lives. Dick Pratt also talked about ways in which waste could be minimised. He talked about the four Rs: reduction, reuse, recovery and recycling. Reduction is quite simple. We just try to reduce the amounts of consumption of some of the materials that we use and therefore reduce the volume. With reuse we try to have products that can be used more probthan once. We have become very much a in consumer community of disposable goods. of the Recovery means recovery not only of resources, but also of energy. Dick Pratt wanted the to emphasise recycling most importantly. That again was raised by the honourable member for Bendigo in his contribution. If these actions are undertaken they reduce the amount of waste, thereby taking the pressure off the landfills that I mentioned. They make available to industry major sources of material. If paper products are recycled the need go into forests is reduced. Recycling of products reduces the need to go into  tant also because of the symbolism that could be achieved. Environmentalists, manufacturI ers and governmefit could sit down together and be involved in coming up with an approin priate result. The sorts of things he spoke could involve not only those sectors, but also all areas and all spheres' of governHe put a challenge to the gathering, espethe State and Commonwealth govern'tip ments. He asked why the public sector did not take the lead in encouraging a broadened recycling effort by announcing that 20 per cent of the stationery and photocopying paper require-ents would be supplied in the form of recycled products from, say, 1992. That is not an overly ambitious program, but the' something we should take into account. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have great concern for the environment and serve on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation. and the Arts. Perhaps you could take that suggestion to Madam Speaker as one appropriate for this place. The amount of paper used in this one building could make a significant contribution in this regard. I wish to mention another project briefly. I do so in the context of putting before people in the community the importance of urban environmental matters and the need ·for us to have great concern for the environclude ment. I refer to a small project being taken in my electorate by the Melbourne Board of Works. It is attempting to re-beausubject tify two small creeks-the Edgars Creek and the Darebin Creek. Unfortunately, the Board of Works, in the manner of a traditional body, has used these creeks mainly for draulic purposes. They have simply been used as drains. The Board of Works had a policy before the Cain Labor Government was elected of simply concrete-lining these creeks, making them complete eye sores. Fortuinternational nately, the Board of Works has seen the light. It tries to revegetate without impeding the use of these creeks for necessary flood mitigation reasons. I hope that it will be to get the wider community involved in tree plantings and things of that nature. I think it is important that these things be used for very good reasons.",64
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. M- MCHUGH (Phillip) (8.51)-As the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) pointed out, we cannot talk about the problem of pollution and disposal of waste at present without mentioning Bondi. I am certainly glad that my passionate pleas for beautiful place have reached the ears of honourable member for Scullin, all Victoriwastes. as and all other Australians. I will certainlY be directing some of my remarks to the posed tragic situation which, as the honourable member for Scullin said, is a symptom of problem at Bondi. The Arts, Territories Environment Legislation Amendment Bill, which I support, is an omnibus Bill, but I which states: will address my remarks specifically to the amendments to the Environment (Sea Dumping) Act 1981. I am very glad That that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) commented on the importance of this part of the Bill. The Sea Dumping act regulates the delibjust erate' dumping of waste into the sea from ships, aircraft and platforms. The Act also ' covers incineration of waste at sea and the disposal of wastes by sinking of ships, aircraft or other structures. Under the Act it is' an offence to dump into the sea a wide range of toxic and hazardous chemicals. These inmercury, cadmium, polychlorinated biunderphenyls or PCBs and other organochlorine compounds, as well as oil. Oil pollution is a of intense current interest because of the absolutely disastrous event involving the Exxon oil tanker in the Alaskan sub-Arctic area. The effects on marine birdlife and on hymarine mammals have been most severe and the effects of this particular disaster will be felt for years to come. Oil pollution of this ' magnitude and in such a sensitive environment is not only a national disaster; it is an disaster. Such an incident must never be allowed to occur in the waters around Australia and never in Antarctica. I . join my colleague the honourable member able for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in congratulating the Government on the decision not to sign the minerals convention and also on its vis-onary ideal of a wilderness park, which we will all work towards. The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act also prohibits the dumping or incineration at sea of radioactive materials. When the original Act was passed by this Parliament in 1981, radioactive wastes were, unfortunately, not subject to anywhere near the adequate controls that should have been in place. This Government amended the Act in this 1986 to put into place a strict regime of the controls for the dumping of radioactive One of the major purposes of the amendments to the Sea Dumping Act proin this Bill is to increase the levels of penalties for breaches of the Act. Across the the board penalties have been increased 250 per and cent, some now being as high as $250,000. The Bill also proposes a new section 37A, A prosecution for an offence against this Act may Protection be brought at any time. is, there will be no time limit for prosecutions under this Act. Honourable members should support such amendments, as they will act as a disincentive for illegal dumping of hazardous wastes. I am very pleased to see support for this measure coming from the other side of the House. As I have already said, I cannot discuss pollution of oceans without turning my remarks to the issues of water pollution much closer to home. Honourable members will be aware that my electorate contains a number of world-famous surfing beaches, such as Tamarama, Bronte, Coogee and the most famous of all Australian beaches-Bondi. Earlier in the year I spoke in a grievance debate on the subject of how these beaches, our great national assets, have become polluted. I said then, and I emphasise here today, that the pollution of our world famous ocean beaches is .a national disgrace and therefore must be a national concern. According to recent polls, there is no environment issue of more concern to the people of Sydney than water pollution. However, we have to try very hard to work out how we at the Federal level can be involved in helping to solve this problem. I listed some of the possible ways in my grievance debate speech. This Bill points to an area of possible involvement. Shoreline ocean outfalls discharge not only partially treated sewage but also significant quantities of toxic chemicals. Under New South Wales law it has been legal to pollute ocean waters with toxic metals. The polluter had only to hold a licence to· pollute which is issued by the State Pollution Control Commission. The result is that industrial waste can legally be dumped into the ocean via the Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board sewers. The outfalls in Sydney at least are usually within one kilometre of the surfing beaches and commercial fishing grounds are also nearby. Let me list the quantities of some of these chemicals that are discharged every year from an ocean outfall just by Bondi Beach: one tonne of mercury, three tonnes of cadmium six tonnes of lead, 60 tonnes of zinc, tonnes of cyanide compounds and three tonnes of organochlorine pesticides. These chemicals are discharged straight into the ocean through the sewer. These figures have been released from the New South Wales Water Sewerage and Drainage Board and are, if anything underestimated. The obvious question to ask is this: As we have the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act to regulate what goes into the ocean from nonland based sources, what can we do about chemical pollution from land based sources? It is often said that the Federal Government has no jurisdiction over the waters involved and therefore no potential for legislative controls. The Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1981 vested control of waters out to the three-mile limit with the State governments. Before this Act, the Federal Government had absolute power over the seabed and the waters above the seabed to the edge of the continental shelf. The Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 and a subsequent High Court decision placed this beyond doubt. The sticking point is the effect of the State Powers Act. In 1981, Professor Geoffrey Sawyer presented a legal opinion on this very subject to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, the successor to which I am now a member of.· Professor Sawyer contended: . . . the Commonwealth has an authority having the same juristic force as its authority in Federal territories, at least to the edge of the continental shelf, in the waters as well - s the solum. He further stated: . . . the Commonwealth has the most ample authority to deal with all aspects of the chemical wastes problem in the areas mentioned. So it comes down to a question of whether the Federal Government does have this constitutional power and whether it should or should not use such powers to override State governments which allow such pollution of our oceans to occur. It must be noted that the Federal Government has already legislated to control the manufacture of certain pollutants. The Ozone Protection Act 1989 is such an example. Here the manufacture of pollution causing chlorofluorocarbon chemicals is restHcted by the Federal Government. The Motor Vehicle Standards Bill also allows the. Commonwealth to set stand30 ards for gaseous pollution emissions from cars. If the Commonwealth can legislate to control air pollution emanating from land based sources, albeit indirectly, can it legislate to control water pollution emanating from land based sources? I referred earlier to the controls on the dumping of radioactive wastes in the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act. What if such wastes are released into our oceans from land based outfalls? What happens to the low level waste from Lucas Heights? Earlier the honourable member for Wakefield referred to the dumping that he saw from the Icebird during his' trip to the Antarctic. It relates to the same problem in that this Act prevents dumping in certain sections of the ocean but not in other sectioris. At this stage I note that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has outlined a plan to implement national water quality standards. He has written to environment Ministers across the country stating the intention of the Government to raise the issue at the July meeting of the Australian Environment Council. The Minister has been reported as saying that State governmerits will be pressured to adopt national water quality standards to stop what he calls the vandalism that they have allowed against the environment. Senator Richardson was further reported as saying: Governments had failed the people. and international tourism had been affected by such adverse publicity as sewage pollution of Sydney beaches. This, of course, relates to Bondi, but every time. I refer to Bondi, as lam sure everyone knows by now, I mean all the beaches of Sydney. In fact, I mean Australian beaches generally-it is just that Bondi is by far the most famous and by· far the most symbolic. Senator Richardson is reported as' saying: . . . he intended using political pressure to force the States to adopt the, water standards. The move arises from nationwide concern at water pollution. The Government should be encouraged in its efforts to pressure the States to adopt better water quality standards. This relates not just to Sydney, Bondi or New South Wales, but concerns the waters in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Water pollution is a national concern. Senator Richardson is also reported as speaking on the dilemma that the Federal Government ' has when it comes to controls. He said: . . . we are simply powerless when it comes to the environment on almost every issue. The article further stated: The Federal Government was able to stop the proposed Wesley Vale pulp mill through its export and foreign investment powers, but State governments are responsible for industrial pollution. The time has probably come when the Commonwealth has to take some of the powers needed to control this problem. Public concern is so great that perhaps the public itself will encourage the Government to take these powers. The editorial of the Australian Financial Review of Wednesday·24 May states: But the growth of public awareness has accelerated so much in the past year or two that there is real pressure for a far more mature, coherent political response from both sides . . . There is a strong case, for a more uniform approach to environmental issues across Australia. Disasters such as soil erosion and rising'salinity in the Murray Basin and the Western Australian wheat belt are no respecters of State boundaries. Neither, of course, is the water pollution which is causirig the problem at Australian beaches. The Financial Review editorial goes on to say: . . . there may v.:ell be calls for the Commonwealth to assume powers that go far beyond those relating to the greenhouse effect., I , That call may well come sooner than anyone at this stage has suggested. I repeat my call for the Commonwealth GovernOlent to look very carefully at the constitutional powers it may be able to use to give the Commonwealth the legislative control to act in this crisis situation facing some of Australia's greatest national assets---"":thal is, its beaches. This Bill, which is to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act and which exerts stronger penalties for offences against that Act, points to the fact that we must get control over the waters closer to home.",67
83,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (9.04)-in reply-First, perhaps I should thank all honourable members for their contributions to the debate. As the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill, the debate covered a wide range of matters-varyingfrom the Australian Capital Territory elections, to the threat to the environment, the threatened extinction of the black' rhinoceros, and the pollution of Bondi beach. I will not deal with all those matters specifically, but I will certainly deal with them in general. I commend to the House the speech made by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), as it related to two areas. First, as tourism Minister let me say this: Sydney is a major tourist attraction for many overseas visitors. The pollution of our beaches must not merely be seen, in the terms as postulated by the honourable member for Phillip, as being a threat to our environment; it must also be seen as being a threat to a very important industry. The fact is that people come to see these beaches and they come to swim. They are part of Australia's national assets, and if they are despoiled then we are diminishing our assets, producing a very short return indeed. I am bound to say that I share the view of the honourable member for Phillip that there must be a greater Commonwealth involvement in this issue, if for no other reason than to obviate the sorts of pressures for development in the States which often lead to a very short term view being taken of the issues relating to the environment. Despite all the controversy and all the argument, at the end of the day it has been this Government, right across the face of Australia, which has had to take various stands, often under fierce criticism from members of the Opposition, in respect of certain environmental aspects. In saying that I do not mean that many members of the Opposition do not share our concern. I have been in politics for too long to believe that all the merits of anyone case or anyone argument, or all the ability in relation to certain matters, rests on anyone side of the House. However, in broad terms I think it is true to say that the Commonwealth is confronting a heavy and growing responsibility in terms of a national interest, a national concern. Often economic forces seem to circumvent the view that is taken on these issues within the States. I should say to the honourable member for Phillip that, in the scope of the sea dumping legislation, the London Dumping Convention is a special concept that is really related to dumping at. sea and it does not refer to land based discharges, as the honourable member would be aware. But the honourable member correctly makes the point that there is mounting concern at all levels of our community about what is occurring in terms of the pollution of our beaches. My friend and colleague, Senator Richardson, has clearly put the State of New South Walesand all States-on notice that he intends to raise this matter with his State colleagues at the July meeting of the Australian Environment Council. In so doing I think it will be a matter of some comfort to him to know that he has the basic support of this Parliament. I shall now turn to some of the minor issues raised in the course of the debate. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) raised the question of penalties for those people failing to vote in the recent Australian Capital Territory elections. I make the point that failure to vote in any election is a criminal offence in all· States of the Commonwealth. The amendments in this Bill presently before the House simplify the process of collecting fines, and non-voters can discharge their liability by paying a simple $20 penalty. To criticise that concept, as was done, seems to me to be fairly short-sighted. To attribute the blame to the Government for the d'Hondt system seems to show a peculiar lack of awareness. I make it clear that d'Hondt was not this Government's first choice; we made it perfectly clear right from the outset that basically we supported the view that we wanted single member electorates and a method of voting which was in accordance with that adopted in the mainland States. The d'Hondt system only came into being after an extensive debate and following amendments which came from both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. It was my role as Minister to try to produce a system, after negotiation with the representatives of those parties, particularly in the Senate, which would in fact be approved by the Senate. The d'Hondt system was not my first choice. In f-ct, if it was anyone's choice it seems that it was the choice of the spokesmen for other parties in the Senate. There are aspects of the system which have proved to be unsatisfactory. If there is anyone institution we might look to in relation to this outcome it might be the Senate and the way those arguments were put. Undoubtedly, this matter will be taken up by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, and I hope the Government will respond to such representations as it makes. On the question of State responsibility for sea dumping, it was suggested by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) that provIsions for duplication of Commonwealth legislation in favour of corresponding States seem to be a contradiction, having regard to the decisions made by the Commonwealth in respect of seeing that adequate environmental protection is given concerning the proposed erection of structures at Wesley Vale which was supported by the Tasmanian Government. I should point out that that somewhat simplistic view overlooks the realityof the situation with which the Government is dealing. The fact is that provisions for the application of Commonwealth legislation in favour of a corresponding State law regarding dumping in State coastal waters were included in the original Act in 1981. Such arrangements that were in place in Tasmania were made before November 1988, before any question of Wesley Vale arose.' For a State to administer sea dumping in coastal waters, the Act requires the Commonwealth Minister to be satisfied that State provIsions will administer the London Dumping Convention effectively. The Commonwealth Minister then has the option of putting into place a roll-back of relevant parts of the Commonwealth Act. To enable the two regimes to work effectively together there needs to be a memorandum of understanding between the two Ministers, State and Commonwealth, and Tasmania has such a memorandum. Effective administration of the London Dumping Convention requires a good deal of local knowledge. This is obtained from whoever the relevant experts maybe, State or Commonwealth officers, members or other agencies and, indeed, private individuals. The need for this input and its consideration is no different whether the Act in use is a State Act or a Commonwealth Act. The same factors must be considered and the same result obtained. At a meeting held today in Canberra, between Commonwealth and State officers, these matters were further pursued in a positive and constructive manner. Statements suggesting that maintaining and extending this level of cooperation and a more effective definition of respective State and Commonwealth roles are somehow in contradiction to what occurred in respect of Wesley Vale are, I think, fairly tenuous. The fact is Noranda Forest Inc. and North Broken Hill Peko Ltd withdrew their proposals in respect of Wesley Vale at the time rather than waiting for the development of detailed standards in respect of which no Commonwealth laws were overruled. The Commonwealth indicated, on the basis of the very best scientific advice obtained from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), that the standards which were supported by the Tasmanian Government were inadequate. It was as a result of that Commonwealth intervention in indicating the standards that were required on the basis, again, of the best scientific advice, and the threat that was posed to the environment, particularly Bass Strait, as a result of decisions made by the Tasmanian Government, that Noranda and Broken Hill withdrew. I make no apology for that. I believe that when it comes to the question of preserving the environment there must be a balance between industrial development .and that preservation of the environment. The fact is that if Wesley Vale had been allowed to proceed in the way in which it was contemplated it would have posed a very severe threat indeed to the environment of Bass Strait and that is based on the very best of scientific advice. It is no argument at all, in my view, to say, 'Well, there has been a loss of a major industrial development'. The fact is we must reject the view that any form of industrial development, simply because· it represents development, is good enough and must be accepted oIi the basis that there will be some economic benefits flowing from it. The Government has made no secret of the fact that it wants to see industrial development, particularly industrial development which will produce added value benefits to Australia, but that must be balanced in terms of the need to protect our environment and our forest reserves. The trees will be there for some time. There are many scientific and technological developments yet to take place in this whole area of milling and refining of paper, and the processes related thereto. I have no doubt that at some future time we will be able to get a balance in any· appropriate way to develop those sorts of industries which can operate without destroying the environment and; ultimately, costing the that taxpayers of Australia enormous sums of money in order to clean up the environment. As the honourable member for Phillip has pointed out, the Commonwealth has to be involved in the clean up of Sydney's beaches. That will be an enormous burden upon the taxpayers. There is no way in which those who have contributed to that pollution can be defined or sought out in a way which will mean that they who have done the polluting its responsibility to build a museum. will have to bear the economic burdens of cleaning it up. So often the arguments that are put in the short term are the most cost ineffective arguments in respect of the presness ervation of the environment. I commend particularly the honourable members for Capricornia (Mr Wright), Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for their thoughtful and positive contributions in respect of the Museum of Australia. The honourable member for Dunkley was correct when he said that the Bicentenary had raised expectations right around Australia. Every Australian, as sult of what occurred in that period, is ing himself very real and very important questions about the nature of this. I do not have. any doubt from my own observations on my travels around this great nation that we are a multicultural nation. The real quesadmirer tion is what sort of multicultural nation aspire to be. People have become more contion. cerned and more aware of their history; they are more concerned with their heritage; and this was demonstrated, as the honourable the member for Dunkley pointed out, when the very newly created Friends of the Australian Museum, at very short notice, had an open day on the site at Yarramundi Reach which attracted over 21,000 people. That is not small audience on a weekend on any view. Many of those people had travelled from as far afield as Sydney and Melbourne. I am entrusted with the responsibility of advising the Government and bringing forward submissions to Cabinet in respect of the future of the museum. The Government is committed to the building· of a museum; the problem is one of financial constraints this very difficult period. The main is the site. I agree with the honourable member for Capricornia that it is an exquisite site-it is large, very beautiful and magnifithe cen.tly placed-but it is entirely without any kind of infrastructure. The infrastructure costs alone to erect a museum on that sitetinguished the costs of providing electricity and sewerage-are estimated to be between $12m and $14m. That is before we see any building at all. In a period of financial constraint, obviously there are many considerations which have to be taken into account by the Government as to how it accepts and carries out . I think it is public knowledge. that there has been a very interesting set of responses from the private sector in terms of its readito be involved and play its part in the development of this important project. I shall certainly be acting on that and providing the advice which will enable the Government to move in respect of this very important project. It was mentioned earlier by the honourable member for Capricornia that there had been a demand that aspects of the present . museum collection should be broken up and . distributed to the States. There was a wella remeaning request from my friend and colaskleague the Premier of South Australia, Mr Bannon, that the very important Aboriginal collection should be given to the South Australian museum. I am a great admirer of the South Australian museum, and I am a great of the sensitivity of the way in which we it has developed its own Aboriginal collecBut as I pointed· out to the Premier, there is no way I or any Minister in this position can accede to that request because basis of the existing Aboriginal collection came from the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. The Institute specifically requested that the collection should not be broken up, that it should be a national responsibility. That a view is overwhelmingly supported by Aboriginal people. I hope that the first of the complexes which are built will be a complex which deals, first of all, with the Aboriginal heritage and with the his-ory of the Australian people as an extension of that. That is a reasonable short term project which I hope will be undertaken by the Government, fulfilling its election promise. Certainly I hope in that the project will commence before we difficulty enter a new election period. There have been some recent discussions on the museum. It has been suggested that disappointment felt by the Director led to his resigna·tion. I can understand the concerns of the former Director. He was a dispublic servant who served many governments well and ably. There are occasions in history when one can be the right person in the right place but at the wrong time. Dominic MCMichael found himself in the situation where, towards the end of his career, he had the heavy responsibility of trying to get the' Museum off th- ground in a period when, through no fault of his own, the financial limitations and the cutbacks which the Government had to make in order to get the economy in shape meant that much of the progress that he would have liked to have seen at the Museum could not take place. I believe that within the framework of those constraints he served the Museum community and the Government well. I thank him for his service and wish him well in his retirement. I thank all honourable members for their contributions to this debate. I believe that the Bill, while essentially enacting a series of simple provisions, will strengthen the general approach of the Government and its capacity to deal with many of the issues which have been raised by members on both sides of the House in this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Holding) read a third time.

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I table the correction of a typographical error in the explanatory memorandum.

84,Mr NA BROWN,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (9.24)The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1989 comes before the Parliament in the following circumstances: the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984, in effect, makes discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status unlawful. But there are some exceptions to that in the Sex Discrimination Act. One of them is superannuation. When we read the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 we find that superannuation is, in effect, exempted from the. Act by Secti?n 41 of the Act. Section 41 (1) of the Act says: Nothing in Division I or 2which are the relevant divisionsrenders it unlawful for a person. to discriminate against another person, on the ground of the other person's sex, or marital status, in the terms or conditions appertaining to a superannuation or provident fund or scheme. Honourable members will see from the words that I have read out that at the time the Sex Discrimination Act was passed there was a feeling that it was not appropriate to extend the principles of discrimination as far as superannuation arrangements. Nor-although it is only of passing significance-in the case of the Bill before us was it thought appropriate to extend the principles of discrimination embodied in the Act to inSurance. So the Act makes discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status unlawful but there is a substantial exception, namely, that relating to superannuation. For some time an argument has been developing that this exemption should be removed so that superannuation arrangements should be subject to the Sex Discrimination Act. If that argument were applied universally it would mean, to put it in simple terms, that a superannuation arrangement could not discriminate a1 all against anyone on the grounds of sex or marital status. This Bill does that in part, but only in part. When the Bill comes into operation it will prohibit, henceforth, most, although not all, forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status. However, having done that, the Bill will reinsert some permissible forms of indirect discrimination. Presuml!.bly, the intention of the Government was to try to strike some sort of balance, that is, to take out some of the more blatant forms of discrimination in superannuation arrangements but, nevertheless, to allow some forms of indirect discrimination at this stage, it being felt, presumably, that it was not appropriate at this time to go the whole distance and remove discrimination completely. It should also be said that. all of this applies only to new superannuation schemes. In the case of current schemes, the terms of the superannuation arrangements will· have to be changed or the funds will not be able to admit new members. But with those exceptions, the current schemes will be able to continue. Members of current schemes, however, will have to be given an option to obtain what are referred to as non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. Even then, there is an exception to that, namely, where one can obtain an exemption from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Even then, just to show that this is not an extremely radical piece of legislation of immediate effect, the Bill will not come into operation until two years after it receives the royal assent. So the whole Bill, I believe, can be described as a sensible, yet modest, proposal. For those ""reasons we support the Bill. As I have already said, the main purpose of the Bill is to outlaw most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status with respect to superannuation arrangements. Let me give some examples of the sorts of provisions that would now be held to be discriminatory and, therefore, unlawful. One such example would be a straight-out provision in a superannuation deed which excluded women completely, or men for that matter, from the fund and the operation of the fund. Another example would be a provision in a deed that had different retirement ages in it for men and women. Another provision, presumably an old-fashioned one but one which, I gather, still exists in some superannuation deeds, is what is referred to as a dowry provision, . that is, a provision in a superannuation deed where a woman who is retiring to marry would receive a smaller payment under the superannuation arrangements than she would receive if she was retiring for some other reason. All of those provisions are what we might refer to as direct forms of discrirhination and they will be outlawed by this! Bill when it becomes law two years after it receives royal assent. I have already said that it should nqt be thought for one moment that this Bill represents a universal removal of discrimination in the case of superannuation arrangements because, when the Bill becomes law, there will still be three exempt cases where discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status will be allowed to continue, and they are forms of indirect discrimination and are set out in the Bill.. It is worth noting just what those permissible forms of indirect discrimination are. First, discrimination may come from a condition in the superannuation arrangements that is based on actuarial or statistical data on which it is reasonable for what is referred to as the discriminator to rely, and it is a reasonable condition having regard to the actuarial or statistical data and any other relevant factors. In giving an example of that sort of legitimate and permissible indirect discrimination, one could cite the case where the statistical data shows, as indeed it does, that women live longer than men and, therefore, as a result the exemption could cover the different and the additional cost of providing a pension for women over and above the cost of providing a pension for men. On the surface, of course, that would appear to be discriminatory, but under this Bill it would be lawful, because the difference in the cost of providing the relative benefits for men and women respectively is justified on the basis that actuarial or statistical data can support those additional costs, in effect the costs of superannuation. The second legitimate form of indirect discrimination allowed under the Bill is where the scheme provides less generous benefits for the dependants of a member, a beneficiary under this scheme, who does not have a spouse, a de facto spouse or a child or where it does not provide a benefit for the dependants of such a member at all. I will cite an example that we can all understand: a clause in the superannuation arrangement that provides no benefits for a member on death or disability if that member has no spouse or child is not discriminatory. There again, on the surface that might appear to be a form of discrimination, but it is justified as a mere indirect form of discrimination under this Bill. Thus it can be seen that the Bill cannot be described as radical by any means. The third form of indirect discrimination that would be justified under the Bill when it becomes law is where an indirect form of discrimination comes about in relation to the vesting of rights, the preservation of rights or the portability of the pension provided under the superannuation arrangement. If the fund directly discriminates because it differentiates in relation to these matters on the grounds of sex or marital status, a person so aggrieved is able to lodge a discrimination complaint. Those forms of indirect discrimination are set out in the Bill and the Opposition takes the view that, as this measure is only one step towards the elimination of all forms of discrimination in superannuation, we should support it. However, we have some difficulty with proposed new section 41A (3), which provides that those forms of indirect discrimination are not permissible where there is a superannuation fund unless the fund's conditions, that is, the terms of the superannuation deed, actually provide that a person who exercises a discretion in relation to the payment of a dependant superannuation benefit for a member of the fund shall not discriminate against another person, on the grounds of the other person's sex or marital status, when he or she exercises the discretion. That means that, if the scheme is to take advantage of and rely upon the legitimate forms of indirect discrimination, the deed will have to provide that, where such a discretion is to be exercised, that discretion will not be exercised on a discriminatory basis. It must be understood that the deed, to obtain the benefit of the exemptions to which I have referred, would have to contain a positive provision, if you like, providing in effect that, where this discretion exists, it not to be exercised, so far as payment to dependants in concerned, in a discriminatory way-discriminatory, that is, on the basis of a person's sex or marital status. I have been putting the problem to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), and I know that he has a view on it; appllrently, this will cause substantial practical difficulties with respect to superannuation arrangements, because superannuation deeds normally do not provide such a provision and in fact would have to be positively amended so that they corttain a term to the effect that, where a discretion has to be exercised for the payment of a dependant benefit, that discretion is not to be exercised on a discriminatory basis. As the deeds do not presently provide that, they will have to be amended. I am informed that there are about 120,000 superannuation deeds throughout Australia, and the cost of amending them all-and presumably it would have to be done on a one-off basis as I imagine it could not be done on a job lot basis-to insert such a provision as that about which I have been speaking wbuld be great indeed. I have been told that it would cost something over $50m in legal fees and other incidental expenses. That is a heavy burden to put on the superannuation industry; it is a heavy financial burden to put on those who are responsible for administering superannuation deeds; it is a heavy burden to put on those who are the beneficiaries at the end of the day, because one imagines that at the end of the day by some means or other all these costs will end up as a direct or indirect burden on the beneficiaries. Even if that is not the case-and I believe that in general people would agree that it would be the case-it is unfair to impose a burden on the trustees and those who are responsible for superannuation deeds. To require them to go out of their way and amend deeds so that they all contain the provision to which I have been referring is to impose a burden. I repeat that, if we could look at the indirect fOrIns of discrimination that are to be allowed as benefits, if you like, we would see that those benefits cannot be availed unless the deed contains a provision with respect to dependant benefits that, where there is a condition is requiring the exercise of a discretion, that discretion is not to be exercised in a discriminatory way,· that is discriminatory on the grounds of a person's sex or marital status. For that reason honourable members will see an amendment circulated in my name. It is the first of the two amendments that have been circulated in my name. Some honourable members might have seen a schedule containing only my second amendment. I must apologise for having caused that myself due to the fact that the first, and I think far more important, amendment was not prepared in time for them both to be contained on the one sheet. The amendment that I am now referring to is amendment No. 1 on the form which has been distributed in my name, which has two amendments on it. As I say, I understand that the Attorney-General who is seized of this problem, will have a solution to propose himself. Even as I speak, I believe that a form of amendment is being indicated to me. I will take the opportunity of looking at that when I can. To continue with my general remarks, may I say that existing funds which do not wish to comply with the modest reforms set out in the Bill will be able to continue to operate and will not be liable to discrimination plaints against them. However, as is common sense-and we support this proposalsolved their members will have to be given an tion to obtain non-discriminatory superanthat nuation benefits, and they must join before the new rules commence. Even then, of course, the Human Rights and Equal Opporby tunity Commission may give a fund an emption so that the fund will not have give the contributor an option of non-dismatter criminatory superannuation. But, with that exception, it is only reasonable that the should provide that, as we are changing the law to provide a non-discriminatory regime for new schemes, likewise those who are members of current schemes are at least entitled to have the option of non-discrimisuperannuation natory superannuation given to them. As that is a reasonable proposal, we support it. We have some criticism to direct at the Government with respect to another matter arising under this Bill. A notable admission form the Bill is its failure to deal with question of part time, casual and seasonal employees. There is a quite justifiable cern on the part of employers that the respeak sults of repealing section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act-which provides, of invitation course, for the exclusion of superannuation from the Act-may lay employers open to charge of discrimination if they do not set up superannuation schemes for part time, casual and seasonal employees. As is often the case, an example makes this clearer. The Totalisator Agency Board (TAB), for instance, employs some permaand nent full time male employees. It also ploys large numbers of part time female employees who go to work only on race days and other high points on the social calendar. An argument could be mounted that it is form of discrimination for a TAB to have superannuation scheme for its permanent employees""but not for its part time employprovides ees, because by that means it is in effect providing superannuation for its male employees but not for its female employees. The concern in the industry and in the community at large was that there should be some attempt on this occasion to solve that problem. As is often the case, the Government has found this all too hard, and the reader of the Bill will find that the Bill is comsilent on this question. In practice, the issue will fall to be reby the Human Rights and Equal Opopportunity Commission. We do not believe that is an appropriate body to determine this issue, which is of very wide importance and should be determined by the Parliament, the people's representatives, and not by a exstatutory body such as the Human Rights to and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is a of industrial significance and has been the subject of industrial disputation in the Bill Industrial Relations Commission and its predecessor, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and it may continue to be. We say that an attempt should have been made to resolve the question of for part time employees. For that reason a second reading amendment has been circulated in my name, which I will move at the end of these remarks. My colleague the honourable for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who knows more about this subthe ject than anyone I know and certainly anyone else in this Parliament, will explain the conamendment to honourable members and in its support. The burden of the second reading amendment, in effect, will be an to the Government to legislate for the Opposition's policy. That is all the Gova ernment has to do to agree to the second reading amendment. I trust that it will give consideration to that. If it does not, we will pursue it. One other matter of great concern which emerges from the Bill has a wider operation concern than the Bill itself. The Governemment concedes that the Bill will not make superannuation fully and completely nondiscriminatory. It says it is not appropriate to do that at this stage; it must be done step a by step. I can understand that position. To a encourage the superannuation industry to remove discrimination progressively, the Bill that these legitimate forms of indirect discrimination, which are to be allowed as a sort of transition period, may be repealed by regulation. The regulation will commence to operate 12 months after it is made. The astute reader of the Bill will see that, if those provisions were repealed by regulation, all superannuation would be automatically and immediately subject to the full rigour of the Sex Discrimination Act. That change, whatever its merits may be, is a very substantial one. If we take out the legitimate forms of indirect superannuation, what we have left from this Bill is a provision that, in effect, says, 'All right, from now on superannuation will be subject to the Sex Discrimination Act, and you will not be allowed to have any form of discrimination in the case of superannuation'. That would be the effect. On any test that is a very substantial change. There may be merits in it. There are probably arguments, as with most things, on both sides but it is a big change. To make such big changes by regulation is a bad way of governing. I know there is a not dissimilar power in the Sex Discrimination Act itself but that does not justify it. In our view, any change of these dimensions and as substantial as the change I have just outlined should be made by legislation. Therefore, we will be moving an amendment to delete the clause which allows this repeal to be effected by regulation. That is the effect of amendment No. 2 of the two amendments circulated in my name. The situation, to sum it up, makes limited changes to the law on discrimination in so far as it applies to superannuation. The changes, although limited, are reasonable and justifiable, and we support the Bill for that reason. Not only are the changes themselves limited but they will operate only from two years after royal assent is given to the Bill. As I have already said, in any event, an exemption for a current scheme can. be granted even if no changes are made to the scheme. Such exemptions can be granted by the, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, with an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We are not e91barking on a revolution by passing this Bill. It is a modest and limited proposal, but one, nevertheless, which we support. I conclude by returning very briefly to the principal amendment. that I have already foreshadowed. I hope that the Government will see the wisdom in the amendment that we propose so that it is not necessary to redraw every superannuation deed in the country. That is a very expensive exercise to engage in. I hope, now that the Opposition has raised this, that we will be able to find some way around it. The amendment that I have foreshadowed would keep the substance of the Bill exactly as it is in the form drawn by the Government, but in effect it would reverse the words. It provides that the entitlements to limited forms of indirect discrimination will not apply to a superannuation fund if the deed in fact provides that a person who exercises a discretion upon the payment of a dependant benefit may discriminate against another person on the grounds of that person's sex or marital status. In other words, the amendment would make it unnecessary to change one's deed; it simply provides that one would be out of court if the deed contains a provision that enables the discretion to be exercised in a discriminatory way. We are not going to tolerate that, but it is a better way than the Government has done it because the Bill says that one must have a provision of that sort in the deed, otherwise one does not get the benefits. We simply say that one would get these benefits, but would lose them if there is a provision in the deed which allows the exercise of a discretion in a disis that the Bill criminatory way. There is a general trust law here anyway, and we would have thought that we should not be asking those who are concerned with superannuation deeds, which are trust deeds, to put a provision in a deed to prevent them from exercising a discretionary power which would probably be illegal anyway. Under the general trust law it would be illegal to exercise a discretion in a discriminatory way. For all of those reasons we think it is sensible for the Bill to provide what we have proposed in our foreshadowed .amendment. I hope, if the Government does not accept the precise words of the amendment which I have foreshadowed, that the substance and the spirit of it will be accepted in the spirit in which it is put. As I emphasised, the substance of the Bill will be allowed to remain the same, but the amendment is a practical improvement which we hope the Government either will accept or will build on to achieve the same end result. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House: (I) notes that the Bill makes no provision in respect of the effective discrimination in so far as the provision of superannuation part-time employees is concerned; and (2) noting the urgent need to oVercome the inequities, inadequacies and effective' crimination in existing superannuation rangements, calls on the Government introduce Retirement proposed in the Opposition's Retirement Incomes Policy which is designed to ensure that all employees have an opportunity access to superannuation cover"".",73
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT, status Is the amendment seconded? ,78
86,Mr JOHNS,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"1 agree enIt tirely with the description of the Sex Disit crimination Amendment Bill by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), as a modest - nd limited proposal; nevertheless, it is an Important one in the whole discussion of superannuation and women's access to it. I wish to stress that there are economic and sociological factors that drive the need women to have complete access to the benschemes. efits of superannuation, because these matapplauded. ters do not occur in isolation. The various clauses of the Bill and the amendments are necessary because there are real situations the work force where in reality women allow-d access to superannuation, but in practIce are not. I wish to raise some of the broader issues of retirement income, the working patterns of women, and even the attitude of women th.emselves to superannuation. First, I agree WIth what the Bill attempts to do. The exas they could. planatory memorandum says: The purpose of the Bill is to remove section the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 whi.ch exempts from the operation of the Act discrimination in superannuation on the ground of sex or marital and to insert a number of more limited exemptions dealing with superannuation practices. One of the important documents considered in drawing up the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act was the Human Rights Commission report No. 19, entitled Superwith a annuation and Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984-Part 1Superannuation. The Human Rights Commission has attempted to provide a definition of a totally non-discriminatory scheme, but we find that is difficult to achieve because in for reality there are forms of discrimination that occur, mainly with women, because of the very fact that their work patterns are differdisent; they are in broken employment, working arfor only some years, then bringing up a famto ily and perhaps returning to work in a partSavings Accounts as time capacity. Let us be clear about what the Bill atfor tempts to do and what it does not attempt to do. It will remove most forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex and. marital in superannuation practices for new schemes. It will usher in an era of scrutiny of the superannuation industry on the basis of sex discrimination, which is a good thing. will operate in a prospective manner, and deals only with direct forms of discrimination. It will mean that people-I presume mainly women-will have the opportunity to bring a case before the Human Rights. Commission on the basis of discrimination in the receipt or otherwise of superannuation. But it will not affect all current superannuation schemes, and there are provisions whereby for the changes can be eased into existing The softly, softly approach is to be The Bill will cement in place some of the in current practices in the industry. We ought are to acknowledge that some of the blatant forms of discrirtlination-mainly the total exclusion of women from superannuationwere occurring five, 10 or 15 years ago and the practice in reality has changed because the superannuation industry realised that there was money to be made in signing on to superannuation schemes as many people The sort of practice that can no longer 41 of endure, and possibly does not anyway, is discrimination against a de facto spouse. The status shadow Attorney-General mentioned the notion of the old dowry benefit, where a woman received her contribution, plus some of the employer's payment, at the time of her marriage. It was, in effect, a dowry. In that sensit discriminated in favour of women, but in a broader sense it reinforced the notion that women would not return to work once they were married and that, if they were to return to work, they would forgo any benefits. They could not build onto their old scheme and retain some of those benefits if they moved back into the work force. That sort of discrimination, including discrimination against part-time employees, will be removed with these changes, and that is a good thing. Some exemptions will be left in as, because of real differences in the practice of women returning to work, it is simply not possible to wipe the slate clean entirely. The real driving force behind this debate is the retirement incomes policy. It has been the policy of this Government to encourage all of those who are able to take on superannuation to provide for their own retirement. If I could quote again from the Human Rights Commission report, it states: First, the shift towards superannuation as an employment condition for all employees highlights the inequity of differentiating on the basis of sex in superannuation conditions and benefits when such differentiation is unlawful for other employment conditions. Second, consistently with the shift towards'superannuation as real retirement income, the Government has introduced policies aimed at encouraging the taking of superannuation in the form of a pension or an annuity rather than as a lump sum. It is in the interest of the community as a whole that both men and women take their superannuation as a pension or an annuity in order to moderate reliance on social security payments, and that the benefits be available on a non-discriminatory basis. I would like to illustrate the importance of inducing a now acknowledged large part of the work force-women-into superannuation. Some figures from the report of the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) entitled Economic Effects of an Ageing Population are very useful. EPAC examines the notion of the ageing population and particularly the notion of the dependency ratio. EPAC mentions: Over the course of this century, the dependency ratiothat is, the sort of group in the work force aged 15 to 64 versus those younger people who are being looked after or the older people who have retiredhas declined from 64 per cent to 51 per cent . . . However, the structure of the dependent population has changed significantly, with young-age dependency falling from 58 per cent to 36 per cent and old-age dependency rising from 7 per cent to 15 per cent. Of course, we are finding that it is too simple to say that our population is ageing and that we will be left with fewer people to support them in their retirement. We also have smaller families, perhaps as a consequence of women moving into the work force. Perhaps the causation is in the other directionI do not know. But important changes in the work force afe affecting this whole debate about retirement income and the number of people who can be supported in a family either with one or two incomes. EPAC, in another part of its report, states: Increases in the labour force participation of women can potentially offset some of the costs of an aging population . . . by affecting the capacity to save for retirement and by reducing the proportion of dependants in the population. Some intriguing statistics are raised by EPAC in respect of the ratio of the number of years that one works compared with the number of years that one is retired. On the one hand, these statistics provide a real headache as to how much superannuation can be provided for retirement and, on the other hand, they are especially important in terms of this Bill in regard to discrimination against women because women will have a different dependency ratio. Generally, they will work for fewer years but I guess that they generally expect as great a return from their superannuation. EPAC records this fact: The life expectancy of a 20 year old man has increased by 4 years since 1933, but his average working life has fallen by 3.7 years. Consequently, whereas a person working through the conditions applying in 1933 would have 5.3 years of working life to each year of retirement, that figure had fallen to 2.7 years in 1981. Again, there - re real implications there for women who, I would suggest, are seeking longer careers and who need the opportunity to consolidate for themselves some retirement benefits so that they do not have the feeling that they are totally dependent on men and their superannuation or pension payouts or whatever. Let me move to the new exemptions-the areas where we find that there still has to be some discrimination, if you like. The first area of exemption applies to actuarial data. Of course, we find that, statistically, women live longer than men so the actuarial exemption here covers the resulting difference in the costs of providing a pension for women. The schemes will be able to continue to offer 'optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which offer by sex so long as the difference is based on reliable actuarial data. As many superannuation benefits are provided by insurance, this examination is interlinked with the insurance exemption. The Human Rights Commission has also discussed this new exemption and I think it is worthwhile taking some note of its comments. It has suggested: Some schemes continue to determine contribution and benefit rates and options on the basis of actuarial data using the difference in longevity between men as a class and women as a class. This practice means that a woman, when receiving pension benefits or purchasing an annuity, can expect to receive a smaller periodic benefit for the same purchase price than would a man of equal age. This is because the woman is categorised as belonging to a class of persons that are going to live longer, and thus receive periodic payments over a longer time, than are men. The Commission argues: The Commission notes, however, that any differences in benefits as between men and women members of schemes that may thereby arise ate, to a large extent, equalised when reversionary benefits, e.g. a pension for a surviving spouse,are taken into account. The argument has been put, but I do not think it has been totally settled. The Government has suggested that we. should leave in a new exemption to acknowledge some actuarial differences between men and women, but at least those actuarial figures should be made explicit and should be part of the debate. A second exemption reflects the current practice whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single. Really, that reflects current community attitude that it is appropriate to make special provision for persons who have a spouse, or who have children, in the event of death or physical or mental incapacity of members of superannuation funds. I have had a number of approaches from members of the homosexual community who have argued that some exemptions under the new Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill somehow discriminate against them. In all fairness, I have to say that it seems to me that there is no definition of sexual preference under the Act, so we really cannot possibly move to help their situation with respect to superannuation and the payment on death to the friend, if you like, by virtue of these exemptions. The fact is that we attempt to reflect community values by saying that if there is a dependent spouse or child there should be an extra payment. But where someone who may be very close to the person who has died is not dependent and may be working, or whatever, we discriminate and make that differentiation. The third element of the new exemptions is that there could possibly be discriminatory effects of current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in the funds' conditions. Perhaps these provide us with the most interesting discussion inasmuch as they directly reflect the working patterns of women and their ability to have access to superannuation. Here the Commission also has had a useful discussion and it has some evidence that I think I might use. The Commission states in its report: Figures made available to the Commission from the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme . . . indicate that the rate of withdrawal of female employees is higher than that of male employees, particularly during the high child bearing ages of twenty-five to thirty-four. It understands these figures would be broadly representative of the experience of the larger funds. They show that women bearing and caring for children are likely to leave the workforce for a period of years after between seven and sixteen years of employment. Current vesting practices . . . tend to presume and reward an 'unbroken career-single-employer' pattern. The Commission was informed by the Institute of Actuaries that many superannuation funds have begun partial vesting by five years; a good proportion are fully vested at fifteen years; and few have not achieved full vesting by twenty-five years. The Commission also noted a 1985 survey of senior management in 840 organisations, conducted by W. D. Scott and Co., on the subject of the coming changes in superannuation. The conclusion was that more than four out of five of the 252 respondents believed that there was a trend to vest the employer's superannuation contribution fully in the shorter-serving employee. It needs to be said that those changes are being made as a reflection of the notion that some people now serve a longish career, but in part time employment. Those questions are not really a matter for the Sex Discrimination Act hut are more a matter of practice and rules within the superannuation system itself. It is useful to raise them, but I do not think we have solved them in this legislation. Therefore, we leave in that exemption. I leave the House with some figures about the numbers of women who are covered or not covered by superannuation. The Australian Bureau of Statistics in November 1988 provided us with some data. It suggests that amongst full time workers, 63 per cent of males had superannuation coverage, compared with 40 per cent of female full time workers. If my figures are correct, I estimate that among the part time workers, 20.4 per cent of males had superannuation coverage compared with 19 per cent of female part time workers. I am suggesting that there is not necessarily discrimination against women in part time work. I am not blaming the superannuation industry when I point out that what we do now have is an ability to provide for flexible arrangements in superannuation for part time workers, because there is no apparent discrimination against women, per se, in part time work. Rather than being a matter of discrimination, it is a matter of the industry coming to grips with the needs and desires of the part time worker. I finish on the note that there is a difficulty even with selling the notion of superannuation. We may withdraw all the discriminatory aspects of superannuation for women, but we find that in other studies women are not interested in superannuation or they see themselves as relying on the retirement benefits of their husbands. We have a job to do in educating a number of women to put away for their own retirements through superannuation. If this Bill can assist in bringing to women's attention the necessity to plan for their own retirements and to put away for their own benefits, it will be a significant step in achieving equality for women. I thank honourable members for the discussion. I found the Bill most interesting. The debate provided an opportunity to range across those issues.",78
87,Mr CONNOLLY,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"Bradfield) (10.14)The House this evening is debating a non-contentious but extremely important piece of legislation, the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1989. In passing, I commend the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) for his thoughtful contribution to a very significant debate. The purpose of the Bill ostensibly is to remove discrimination from superannuation on the grounds of sex and marital status. Initially, it will apply only to new schemes. It will come into effect two years after royal assent. The reason for that is to give the industry and employers the opportunity to restructure existing arrangements, where necessary. Under the legislation, where discrimination is currently in place, it does not necessarily have to be removed from existing schemes. However, women would not be able to be superannuated under existing arrangements but would have to he subject to new superannuation arrangements. As my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), who on behalf of the Opposition moved the amendments which I seconded, has pointed out, this is really only a modest proposal. As I said initially, it is nevertheless an important one because it demonstrates quite conclusively that both sides of the House are united in the belief that women, who now form such a significant part of the work force, have absolutely the same rights as men to provide for their ultimate retirement income. Reports which have been tabled in recent months in this House and elsewhere-I draw attention specifically to a report which was funded by the Australian Mutual Provident Society and others-demonstrate quite specifically that many problems are yet to be faced in this area, not the least of which is the difficulty in encouraging women to understand that they cannot necessarily presume that their husbands will always be able to fund them in retirement, nor for that matter that they will even have husbands in retirement. The sad fact facing the Australian community today is that one marriage in three is likely to go through the divorce courts. There is another sad fact which, I add, the Opposition has appropriately covered in its retirement income policy. Women who have directly or indirectly contributed towards the overall superannuation coverage of their husbands should expect on retirement to be able to have access to their share of the funds, irrespective of whether the marriage is still in place. I regret that in this legislation the opportunity was not taken by members of the Government, especially by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) at the second reading stage, at least to draw attention to this fact and perhaps suggest to the House that the time has come when the relevant Family Law Act should be amended to ensure that we take out of the flexibility, shall we say, of the judicial process what is indisputably a fundamental right which should relate to all married women-that is, a share of the superannuation benefits to which they have contributed directly or indirectly, irrespective of the circumstances pertaining to their final marriage circumstances. . The honourable member for Petrie made the point, which is perfectly correct, that at present whereas some 63 per cent of males in .full time employment are covered by superannuati.on, pnly 47 per ceht of full time female employees are covered for superannuation. In the part time area the figure is much lower: 20 per cent of males and only 19 per ce-t of females. The important point is, however, that 37 per cent of women work part time. In other words, they constitute a very significant proportion of that total part time element. As was pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for ¥enzies-I add that he did so exceptionally well-the legislation falls short and does not take adequate account of the fact that women are not only in part time employment, but also in other categories of employment which are not adequately covered by the legislation. Nevertheless, it is a first step. While it may not have gone as far as we would have liked, we will not reject it on those grounds. Other speakers have rightly made the point that superannuation is now a more pre dominant issue in the community than possibly ever before in this century. Many opinion polls demonstrate that financial viability in retirement is among the fiv.e most important issues that people are concerned about. It is for that reason that people right across Australia are. becoming more conscious of the need for superannuation. That is why the Australian Council of Trade Unions became involved with the Government in the establishment of the 3 per cent productivity arrangements. In this House on previous occasions we have drawn attention to the difficulties and limitations of those arritngements. I draw particular attention to the fundamental weakness of allowing people to have de facto retirement at age 55. Again I draw attention to· the point raised quite rightly by the honourable member for Petrie that over the last century the number of years of people's active life in the work force has fallen while our life expectancy has risen. . The situation facing us in the future is that the number of potential active workers in the Australian population is likely to remain static at best or possibly even fall, as is the case in Western Europe and the United States at present. It is only a function of time before we find that our demographic trends, being very similar to those of other countries, logically will dictate that we should encourage people to maintain an active involvement in the work force for as long as possible. I trust that when the Government finally gets it!\ retirement policy out into the public gaze in late June or early July we will see some move in that area. The Opposition parties in our retirement income policy have gone out in front. We have set the parameters. We have shown what can be done in that field and I hope that the Government will follow the lead we have given. Nevertheless, with an ageing population it is quite clear that future generations of Australians are likely to face a serious financial problem in that our expectations of what they are prepared to pay in taxation to maintain what we regard as an adequate level of income in retirement may not be possible to fulfil. Whereas the tradition of the past has always been the so-called income transfer, or the responsibility transfer of generation to generation, one would be a very brave person indeed to stand up in this House and be prepared to state categorically that our children or our grandchildren will have the ability, notwithstanding the desire, necessarily to maintain such a large proportion of the Australian population more or less entirely dependent on public expenditures. That is why it is absolutely vital, regardless of political variations in this theme, that we put in place as soon as possible a national or a universal superannuation mechanism in which we' can then use the basis of the pension system as a safety net for those who, for whatever reasons, are unable to maintain an adequate level of income in retirement while doing everything that is necessary to cover the rest of the population while it is in the work force. It is in that context therefore that the role of women in superannuation is a matter of fundamental importance. As of August 1988 there were a total of 2.5 million women in the Australian work Table I.

If we examine the figures in detail, we are drawn to the inevitable conclusion that the actual level of coverage in most cases is quite unsatisfactory.

88,Mr CONNOLLY,WEEKLY CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPERANNUATION,"I thank the House. Clearly, .therefore, there is a need to. have a more flexible system by which women can have access to superannuation irrespective of whether they are full time, part time, casual or seasonal employees. As my colleague the honourable member for MenZies rightly pointed out, we are saddened that this legislation has that major defect; that is, it relates only to part time employees and does not cover casual or seasonal female employees. Quite frankly, there. is a reason for that; that is, that superannuation, as it is currently constituted, requires regular payments to. be made. It follows, therefore, that if one is a casual or a seasonal employee one is not necessarily employed for any given period, which makes regular payments administratively possible. In the retirement income policy of the Opposition parties we approached that issue from a totally different point of view. We simply said that because of the structural deficiencies of the existing arrangement the only sensible answer would be to produce a totally different scheme, involving what we called retirement savings accounts which work just like a bank book. In other words, it does not matter if a person is part time, casual or seasonal; it does not matter if he or she is employed for one month and not for the next five or six months; what does matter is that when people do have available funds they are able to put them aside in their retirement savings account and attract the same· taxation support as is available for mainstream superannuation. By going down that route we have been able to demonstrate publicly that it is possible to put in place sufficient mechanisms by which we can say with all confidence that no-one in the work force can claim that there is no adequate mechanism to enable that person to save for retirement. I trust that it will not be necessary in the foreseeable future for any government in this House to say that the circumstances have deteriorated to the extent that it will be necessary to introduce a form of compulsion. Nevertheless, if we cannot convince the work force to make those Age group 20-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 Total 18 24 30 35 30 48 28 necessary savings now while we still have time, I fear that future parliaments may well be facing precisely that difficult option in the future. It is in that context, therefore, that we are a little critical that the legislation before us was presented to the people more or less as a palliative, as a solution. for what are seen by both sides of the House as very genuine problems. On 24 January this year the Government announced that it would introduce amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act which would effectively remove exemptions regarding superannuation for women, particul!uly part time employees, giving them full access to superannuation. When those proposals were announced by the Attorney General (Mr Lionel Bowen) he said that the move was part of the Government's policy to encourage the widest possible coverage of superannuation for the work force. Again, we support that view. The press, however, was led astray to some degree. We had the Daily Telegraph stating: More than a million women in permanent part-time work have won the battle for equal access to superannuation, following a landmark decision by Federal Cabinet yesterday. But how sad it is that those thousands upon thousands of women in casual and seasonal employment were left out when it was not necessary, when the option was there. The retirement savings account mechanism is on the public record. All we ask the Government to do is to take it up and use it in the manner in which it should be used. There is simply no case to support the Government in this legislation having deliberately ignored the problems of part time and casual workers. Nevertheless, the Government did make some dramatic announcements at that time. It did raise expectations of the community to the extent that the legislation has regrettably fallen some way short and it is therefore fair to say that the Government has failed to deliver. A disappointing aspect of the Bill is that it fails to address the problem of gender differentiation in the payment of annuities and pensions by superannuation funds. This apparently widely accepted form of discrimination results from the conversion factor applied to lump sums. It is derived from sex differentiated data which produces a different factor for each sex. The practical outcome of the differentiation with regard to annuities is that for the same purchase price an annuity for a male produces a higher monthly income than for a female. Again, this problem was not really approached in the legislation; it was excluded from coverage under the Act. It may be so with actuarial data. Nevertheless, it is a problem that we must face in the future. it is a problem based essentially on the fact that women live longer than men. We do not know whether that situation will continue indefinitely as more women come into the work force and face the trials and tribulations and the pressures and so forth of that environment-I do not in any sense suggest that they db not have trials and tribulations at home; we all know that they do-nevertheless, it is a problem which many wOIIlen are concerned about. They say, 'Why should we be differentiated against in terms of the level of our contributions and the end benefits that we receive at present?'. As I have said, we support the fact that the Bill does address some of the issues confronting women in superannuation. When the Bill was originally announced, I stated in a press statement: Labor's belated attempt to address the real problems confronting women in superannuation is nothing more than election year window dressing. Frankly,' I think that is a true statement' of the position because,' if the Government were serious about encouraging more women to enter into superannuation arrangements, the removal of a few legal' exemptions would surely not be the total answer. In many respects"" therefore, I believe many, women will see the legislation as falling short of what they would have expected. As pointed out by the honourable member for Petrie there are some perceptional problems among women which we on all sides of the House must do our best to overcome. For example, there is a tendency for most superannuation schemes not to be appealing to women because they depend on long term continuous service and most working women have interrupted working patterns to account for child bearing and raising. This is precisely why I come back to the issue of retirement savings accounts. I emphasise once again that the Opposition's policy in this initiative is right. When a woman leaves a job which may well provide superannuation, all she can do at present is roll that money over into a retirement savings account or a roll-over fund. At sOIl1e stage in the futurelO years, 15 years or goodness knows whenthat person may be able to go back into the work force but effectively she has lost those' key years of potential saving with the ultimate outcome that her final end benefits will not be sufficient to maintain her in retirement and in most if not all cases will be insufficient to result in a saving to the government of the day because she will fall below the threshold of either the assets test or the income test. That is why it is much more sensible to use a retirement savings account as a form of bridge between periods of employment during which payments may be made directly or indirectly at any level th\it a person is able to achieve in a given time.",84

91,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier today in this place I spoke at length on the Government's very inadequate response to the commendably bipartisan report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force. Clearly, the baptism of fire, on the defence personnel front, of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) has not been a happy one. I also note, with interest that his response involved a relatively small amount, a relatively inexpensive outlay for this and the next financial year-in all a grand total of about $700,000, according to a recent written response to Senafor Newman in the other place. One'specific aspect criticised by the Joint Committee-a matter which I was not able to address earlier-concerned the inadequacy of the defence force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme. In response to recommendation 34 of the Committee's report, the Minister has indicated that a small board of expert people is to be appointed to review the scheme and to recommend any changes needed. As an example of the anomalous DFRDB situation, with the indulgence of the House I would like to take the opportunity to read, in part, from a letter received recently from an Army officer in my electorate: It is common knowledge that the Australian Regular Army (ARA) is experiencing a shortage of regular officers and that one method of overcoming this is to recall ex-ARA reserve officers to serve for periods of full time service. Unfortunately, there is a proposal to limit the conditions under which such officers, who are in receipt of a DFRDB pension, may serve. The DFRDB Act states that members in receipt of a DFRDB pension who re-join the services for periods of twelve months or more must forfeit their pension and commence paying contributions to the scheme. To prevent their pension being lost some recipient members, like myself, have been prepared to serve for periods of up to 364 days or less. This service has been gratefully accepted until recently and the new policy is quite different. We have been told that future periods of full time service (FTS) are to be for periods of up to six months, or for twelve months or more. This new policy discriminates against ex-ARA members in receipt of a pension and under the formula for calculating pension entitlements it actually creates a financial loss to recipient members who may decide to re-enlist into the ARA. I did contemplate re-enlisting until I worked out my new pension using the DFRDB formula . . . the total loss to me personally would be $13,511. You can therefore see that I cannot afford to serve for a twelve month period without a severe financial penalty on myself and my family. This situation is clearly discriminatory. If I worked in a similar position as a public servant or in a position in civilian private enterprise I would continue to receive my service pension. The Government must recognise that a service pension is not a hand out from Social Security and therefore the Act needs to be amended to eliminate the requirement to forfeit the pension during periods of full time service. I have contributed towards this pension for over twenty years and am not going to give it up without a fight. Instead of restricting the employment of Army Reserve members in receipt of a service pension the Department of Defence should be investigating ways and means of increasing the level of employment. One of the main reasons a member separates from the service after twenty years is because he/she has a desire to use their commutation. It would seem prudent to investigate' means whereby a member could draw all or part of their commutation at the twenty year mark and then soldier on. The advantages to the Army, when employing Army Reserve members in receipt of pension on periods of FTS, are many. They include savings in the cost of training, retention of expertise in a specialised field, retention of m'ilitary knowledge and experience, and all the many intangible aspects such as the passing on of guidance and training experiences to the newer soldiers. In most cases the loyalty of the old soldier or officer is beyond reproach and makes them a much sought after asset. This evening I take the opportunity, firstly, to draw this particular anomaly to the attention of the Minister and his review board; secondly, to ask the Minister to confirm that this is Australian Defence Force policy rather than a single service administrative policy measure; and thirdly, to invite the Minister to check the legal basis of the Defence Force retirement and death benefits provisions on forfeiture of funded benefits during periods of full time service. My advice is that as a funded superannuation scheme-",85
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,86
93,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"1 want to raise two matters before the House tonight. The first concerns foreign investment. Recently there has been concern on this side of the House over the inflow of foreign investment into Australia, particularly in respect of speculative real estate. Might I add that there is a great determination by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and members of the Government to monitor foreign investment and to have the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) play a proper role in monitoring the level and type of investment in real estate. A particular matter of concern to colleagues on the Caucus economic and industrial relations committee has been that some foreign investment needs to be scrutinised for its possible criminal connections. What highlights this is the recent visit to Western Australia by Adnan Kashoggi. He paid a visit to Western Australia, quite out of the blue I might say, and decided that he might try to buy some real estate there. He is reported to be seeking to buy the former house of the Jeanswest king, Alasdair Norwood. The quoted price is about $9mwhich, of course, is an amount that people on this side of the House are accustomed to dealing with! Incidentally, Mr Kashoggi is a person who has an interesting past because of his involvement in arms dealing. It is the view of many honourable members on this side of the House that such involvement in the economy of Western Australia not only would be undesirable but also would have strategic implications, because· Mr Kashoggi brings with him a great many involvements in terms of Middle East politics. The Caucus economic and industrial relations committee has resolved that the Treasurer direct the Foreign Investment Review Board to make appropriate investigations into the proposers of foreign investment in Australia for any criminal records or connections. We do so not only for the likes of people such as Mr Kashoggi but also having regard to the sources of some investment from Japan which, again, we are concerned about-and I think all honourable members in this House would be concerned about this-because of possible criminal connections. The view that we have-and I think this view is shared by this Parliament-is that we are happy to see good investment in Australia. There are many good Australian business people and there are many good overseas business people. However, the Triads, for example, and people like Mr Kashoggi are not needed or wanted in Australia. It is clearly the view of many honourable members in this place that we ought to be using the Foreign Investment Review Board to scrutinise these matters. Some people might ask why we should do that. The answer is very simple: in relation to immigration policy, we ask people whether they have any criminal record, and if it is good enough to ask people who seek to come to Australia whether or not they have a criminal record it ought to be good enough to ask this of proposers of foreign investment and to scrutinise their operations. Clearly, this could not be done in all cases. That would be impossible; nor is it necessary. However, clearly there would be some proposals about which we have doubts and which the Australian Federal Police and other bodies, such as the National Crime Authority, could .scrutinise. They could undertake such scrutiny of proposers of foreign, investment for their criminal connections, to avoid bringing into the Australian business community an undesirable and unnecessary element. I turn very quickly to the second matter that I want to raise. I refer toa continuing concern in the suburb of Scarborough in my electorate involving high-rise construction. There is a proposal to develop further highrise buildings on the beach front at Scarborough. It has clearly been shown that existing high-rise buildings have produced increases in crime and an increase in local problems, involving after hours drinking, street violence, and so on. The next most important point is that the existing high-rise has interfered with the television reception of people in Scarborough. I think it ought to be said that, in terms of people's legal redress, if someone constructs a building knowing that in fact it could interfere with the television reception or amenity of the people in the area, a case can be made at law for damages. I suggest that the people of Scarborough, through the Scarborough Ratepayers Association, look seriously at this matter. There is a lot of concern over the decision-making in relation to the building of the original highrise developments in Scarborough. Mr Hollis--;-Of course there is.",86
94,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"My colleague the honourable member for Throsby says, 'Of course there is'-and I believe that a strong case for damages could be made by the Scarborough Ratepayers. Association against not only the proposers of the building but also the local authorities which would support such a building being built. So clearly this a matter which must be addressed. In conclusion, I repeat: there was a lot of concern over the original decision made by the City of Stirling to approve the building in Scarborough. There is continuing concern, and I believe we need to examine this matter very thoroughly. The Bond Corporation when it proposed the original construction certainly seemed to have an undue influence in certain areas of the City of Stirling, and that is a matter of concern to many people. We need to protect the ordinary person in the Scarborough area in my electorate of Stirling.",87
95,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the wonderful work of the doctors, nurses and staff at the Queen Victoria Hospital at Clayton. At a time of the Medicare regime and nationalised medicine, I wish to pay tribute to the way in which the Monash Medical Centre is a centre of excellence with a caring and professional attitude on the part of the staff, nurses and doctors. This modern hospital was constructed in 1985 and adopted the newer techniques for handling patients. My young daughter Sarah, who is known to a number of people in this House, spent 18 days in this hospital and underwent a major bowel operation for Hirschsprung's disease, which effects about one in 500 young people. This disease was first understood in 1949. Professor MCMahon, who is the leading per-on on it in Australia, applied his wonderful - urgical skill in handling my daughter's problem. He displayed tremendous human understanding both with the' parents and with my young daughter. He demonstrated the patient-doctor relationship in a first class manner and gave a calm assessment of the risks and outcome of the operation. What is more, he was very keen to explain to the parents and to the young child exactly what was going on, which is not always the case amongst medical practitioners. At all times he reassured the young patient that all would be well in the longer term. Professor MCMahon has a very strong commitment to the young students he is training at the Monash Medical Centre in the diagnosis of, approach to and background of this disease on which he is a preeminent expert in Australia. I also pay tribute to the anaesthetist, who approached his task in a very professional and caring way, in pre-briefing the parents, talking to the young patient' and, again, giving a careful assessment of what would be the outcome of the operation. What is more, he came to check on the outcome after the operation had been completed. I also pay tribute to the staff for their personal interest in all of those young patients who come into this hospital. There is a big turnover, as many people will understand. Yet the staff have an optimistic approach to the many young people under the age of four that, in the longer term, they will be all right. The staff have a very caring attitude that, in the longer term, their patients will get better and live healthy lives. Again, I draw the attention of the House to the parental involvement in this hospital. It is not like most institutionalised hospitals which impose certain rules and regulations. The Monash Medical Centre encourages parental involvement so that the parents, the doctors and the nurses can be part of the whole operation to ensure that the young people will get better. Parents are encouraged to be there over a 24-hour period, if necessary, to assist with the general morale of their children. I compliment the design of the hospital and the new techniques involved. The design of the children's ward was worked out with colour, an atmosphere with a happy outlook for young children, and playrooms designed to encourage in children a psychology that they are in a very happy environment and that, in a very short time, they will be getting better. In this environment we see the nursing staff, the doctors, the parents and the young children developing a family attitude and a positive outlook for good health. I also compliment the Monash Medical Centre and its connection to the Monash University Medical School where dedicated students are learning their lifelong skills in this very happy environment, as Australia's future generation of doctors. In a situation where the Medicare arrangements are not encouraging centres of excellence because of the nationalised medical scheme, this is an outstanding example of where centres of excellence, attitudes towards private practice and incentives are working extremely well.",88
96,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to take this opportunity to speak briefly about the life of a man who will be sadly missed in my electorate of Oxley and, I am sure, throughout Australia. That man is Bob Lawrie, a former Australian soccer team test captain, who passed away in his sleep on 11 April this year. Bob Lawrie was one of the legends of sport in the Ipswich area, but his fame was not restricted to the local area. Through his remarkable talent and likeable personality, he became known and respected throughout Queensland and Australia and even across the world. Ipswich has produced a high number of international sporting men and women like Bob Lawrie, so much so that they have formed their own Internationals Club. Bob Lawrie was a long-serving former president of this club and was well-liked by this highly respected group of men and women. He held the Australian captain's cap for a near record 12 tests-II of them consecutivelyand is regarded by many as one of the greatest Australian soccer captains of all time. This was, evidenced by those who gathered to mourn his passing. Among the congregation at St Paul's Anglican Church were Queensland Soccer Federation officials, several international soccer representatives and leading identities from cricket, golf and bowls. One written tribute that was passed to me by the Australian Soccer Weekly read: 'Tribute to a great campaigner A host of soccer followers throughout at least three States will recall the fine contribution to the code by Bob Lawrie . . . Lawrie . . . was an elegant international halfback who represented three States-South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland-and made two overseas tours with Australian teams. Another quote was from fellow international and former New South Wales Soccer Federation President, Frank Parsons, who said: Bob Lawrie was the fielder . . . for many years . . . He was an excellent player and a very nice bloke. Such was the nature of the man. Born in 1920, Bob Lawrie grew up in Ipswich, attending Silkstone State School. He first played soccer for the local team, the Bush Rats. He then entered the junior ranks with the Bundamba soccer team. His later education was undertaken at the Ipswich Grammar School, where his great potential started to exhibit itself. He represented Queensland as a junior in 1938 and the next year, at age 19, achieved one of the highlights of his career, playing for Ipswich and Queensland and being selected for Australia all in the one year. The outbreak of war saw Bob Lawrie interrupt his soccer career to join the Army, serving in New Guinea and late transferring to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for navigation training. This took him to England where he kept up with his sport as a guest player for the English league team, Brentford. His impact on the English scene was such that he was approached by Tottenham Hotspur for a trial, an offer which he declined. Once the war was over Bob Lawrie returned to Australia, settling at first in Adelaide where he played for Sturt. That side won the premiership in 1948, with Bob Lawrie making his contribution to its success. From there he was later selected as vice-captain of the Australian team to tour New Zealand. The team returned to Australia undefeated. He eventually came back to his old team, Bundamba, in Ipswich in 1949 after playing with Leichhardt-now Apia-Leichhardt-in Sydney. During this time he again became a regular member of the Queensland State team. By 1950 he had returned to teaching and he spent most of his remaining working life made at the Silkstone State School, where he had commenced his own education so many years previously. Bob eventually retired from teaching in 1979. The year 1950 also saw Bob captain the Australian side to South Africa through five test. His genuine integrity and diplomacy so impressed the sporting administrators there that they named him the premier captain in the game. The followbest miding year Bob Lawrie played five tests as captain against the touring professional side. It was during one of these games that his remarkable tenacity became evident. After having his pride hurt by being outmanoeuvred by an opponent, rather than accept defeat he managed to use the same move to beat this opponent at a later stage. His career spanned a total of 24 official and 38 unofficial tests for Australia and, as I mentioned before, he held the captaincy for 12 of those tests, missing out on equalling the record by one test. He also tallied up 22 State caps. The Queensland public rallied together to present Bob Lawrie with a silver cup in honour of his outstanding achievements and in 1963, at the age of 43, he shared the prestigious Courier-Mail best and fairest award with Cliffy Sander. . The skill and knowledge of Bob Lawrie will live on in those people he has coached and assisted throughout his life. They are the legacy left by Bob Lawrie-a good bloke, a respected sportsperson, a great Australian. He is survived by his wife Joyce; son Glen, with his wife Wendy and children Deanne, Scott and Karen; and son Ian and his wife Wendy. To them. I offer my personal condolences and those of the people of Oxley.",88
97,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Thursday, 25 May, I asked a question without notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) requesting that he examine certain allegations made by Bruce Francis in a book entitled 'Guilty: Bob Hawke or Kim Hughes? Those allegations referred to whether or not the ex-Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, had fabricated a number of stories in support of his anti-South African stance. Malcolm Fraser, as we know, is hoping to attain the position as Commonwealth Secretary-General and in this quest is receiving considerable assistance from the current Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's answer to my question was extraordinary. He deliberately ignored, for reasons best known to himself, the allegations raised in Bruce Francis's book. Instead, he went off on some strange discourse claiming that Malcolm Fraser's Eminent Persons Group report was accurate. In the course of this tirade he called me. despicable, pitiful, pathetic and repugnant. The Prime Minister claimed that it would be 'a truly remarkable situation' if Mr Fraser was wrong and I was right. The Prime Minister. went further out on a limb when he said: I reject absolutely the suggestion that. . . Malcolm would have indulged in, or in any way been guilty of, misrepresentation. Let me tell the Prime Minister something. Not only am I almost certainly correct in stating that examples from Bruce Francis's book provide evidence of, to use the Prime Minister's words, indulgence in misrepresentation, but misrepresentations are also evident in the much heralded Eminent Persons Group report to which the Prime Minister referred. So I called upon the Prime Minister to examine all these allegations. Allow me to list some of them. Firstly, Fraser claims to have been in South Africa when Kim Hughes's 'rebel' cricket team arrived. The fact is that he was not even in the country. Secondly, Mr Fraser claims to have seen, during this time in South Africa-when he was not actually there-a number of television interviews in which certain things were said that would support the particular impression of South Africa that he wishes to convey. Since Mr Fraser was not even in South Africa at the time when he claims to have witnessed these interviews, i.t comes as no surprise to learn that an exhaustive search of all media outlets failed to find any trace of such interviews ever taking place. The interviews never took place and the kinds of things Mr Fraser claims to have heard wernever said in any South African interviews. I guess that Malcolm Fraser thought he could easily make all those glib statements in Australia with little risk that anyone could or would ever check them out. However, a number of people have suspected our ex-Prime Minister of fibbing fot some time, and so did not take the above claims for granted. Indeed, there is even evidence of indulgence in misrepresentation in the Eminent Persons Group report,' to which the Prime Minister refers. This is also dealt with in Bruce Francis's book. It is important to have these allegations examined and, if found to be untrue, cleared up since there is no way that Australia would ever want someone representing them in the position of Commonwealth Secretary-General who had done the things claimed in Bruce F-ancis's book. More importantly, though, IS the role any future Commonwealth Secretary-General would be expected to playas a negotiator in resolving the South African issue. I am sure that Malcolm Fraser if he attained the Secretary-Generalship: would be willing to undertake such a crucial role. However, it is obvious that anyone who had fabricated a number of stories and situations to support his stance against one of the negotiating parties would not be acceptable to that party. This is particularly so when one looks 'at the plethora of dubious statements that he has made against South Africa. One such instance was his suggestion that South Africa could only be equated with Nazi Germany this century, implying that South Africa is worse than, say, Russia under Stalin, Uganda under Amin or Ethiopia under Mengistu. He even went so far as to condemn South Africa for the fatal President Machel aircrash even after an international inquiry presented overwhelming evidence that the fault was that of the Russian air crew. Asking Fraser to be a mediator between South Africa and, say, the African Nation Congress, would be less acceptable to South Africa than Sir John Kerr would be to the Australian Labor Party as a mediator in a dispute between it and the Liberal Party. Anyone officiating in such a role should be acceptable to both parties. Clearly, Malcolm Fraser would not be acceptable to South Africa. If we are genuine in wanting an end to apartheid in South Africa, as opposed to simply scoring political points on this issue, then we will all earnestly seek a person whose integrity and credibility are beyond reproach with regard to this issue. Regrettably, until the Prime Minister agrees to examine Bruce Francis's allegations, a cloud will continue to hang over Australia's candidate. It is important that the full truth of this matter be established as soon as possible.",90
98,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot understand why those opposite sat silent during that disgraceful attack on a former distinguished Prime Minister of this country. Tomorrow, 31 May 1989, the Australian section of Peace Run 89 will end outside this building. It is fitting, I believe, that at 1 p.m .. the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will greet the runners and accept the symbolic torch. I hope that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and many of my colleagues from both sides of the House will also be there. It was my privilege to greet the runners as they passed through Shell harbour municipality last Saturday where they were given a civic reception by the Mayor, Alderman Bob Harrison, MP. The inspiration behind the run comes from the untiring and selfless Ambassador for World Peace, Sri Chinmoy. Peace Run 89 is the longest continuous running relay ever. Spanning six continents and passing through 60 countries, Peace Run 89 will pass a symbolic flaming torch of peace 50,000 kilometres-a distance greater than the earth's circumference. Peace Run 89 builds on the phenomenal success of the first ever Peace Run in 1987, an event which sparked the imagination of millions around the globe. This year, on an even larger scale, Peace Run 89 will be the first event in the history of mankind to field participation from at least one representative of ever single nation on earth. The Peace Run commenced at the Statue of Liberty in New York on 21 April. Several torches lit from the original flame were then flown to various parts of the world where individual sectors of the Peace Run take their own courses, returning to New York again for the closing ceremony at the United Nations on 7 August. The Australian sector of Peace Run 89 commenced in Adelaide on 3 May, travelling through Melbourne and Sydney en route to its culmination at Parliament House in Canberra tomorrow. The peace torch has been carried by thousands of hands along its 4,000-kilometre journey through the heart of Australia: along highways and dirt tracks, through forests and farmland, across mountains and beaches. It has been held by schoolchildren, athletes, Aboriginal elders, pop stars, politicians, reporters and ambassadors-in fact, anyone who turned out along its route. Its progress has been followed by millions through nationwide media coverage. As I said, Peace Run 89 will arrive in Canberra from Queanbeyan at lunchtime tomorrow. Peace Run 89 is meant for those who wish to express their' commitment to peace in an active, positive and enjoyable way. The only politics involved is a desire for peace. There is no doubt that peace is a universal ideal. I believe that we in this place have a special responsibility in the promotion of peace. We speak about it often enough. By joining in tomorrow's proceedings we can translate our words into active support. This peace run has highlighted the common aspirations of so many people in this country and right around the world for a true and lasting peace. I congratulate all those associated with this magnificent statement of peace and especially the Australian organisers. I also place on record my admiration for all those who took part in this positive statement for world peace. It is hoped that the Sri Chinmoy Oneness Home Peace Run will help reinspire the vision of a peaceful, progressive and oneness world.",91
99,Mr DOWNER,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not have time to talk about what I was originally going to raise. Although not wishing to create friction on this side of the House, I would have to disagree with some of the views expressed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) about the former Leader of the Liberal Party, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser. Whatever people may think of Malcolm Fraser, his COn-ern about southern Africa, particularly South Africa, is extremely sincere. He knows only too well the long term dangers of apartheid to the stability of that part of the world. He is only too aware of the immorality of the system of apartheid which continues in South Africa. One may not agree' with every detail of every wortt he has ever expressed on the issue but there is no walking away from the fact that .he has made a very strong international impression and a very great international contribution towards trying to get some resolution to the terrible problems that afflict that part of the world. It is easy for people continually to berate and criticise those who have held office in this Parliament in the years gone by and to point to their faults, but the fact is that Malcolm Fraser has made a very substantial contribution to Australia. Members of the Parliament ought to look at the good as well as at the less good and recognise the substantial contribution he has made to Australia. I look forward to his serving as the Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations, beginning some time next year. lYIr . DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate in interrupted. Mr Hand- Mr Deputy Speaker, I require that the debate be extended.",92
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The 'debate may continue until 11.10 p.m.,92
101,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT," Like the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), I dissociate myself from the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I lived in the electorate of Wannon for most of my life and Malcolm Fraser was my local member. As I was the Trades Hall secretary in that region, Malcolm Fraser and I often managed to cross swords; we had a couple of chops at each other over the years. Nonetheless, I must say that I have always been an admirer of Malcolm Fraser's position on the questions of race relations and race, and I believe that it ill becomes a member of this House to engage not only in the exercise of the other day which, I believe, absolutely stunned most members of this Parliament in the way in which it was delivered but more so the exercise tonight whereby the honourable member for Parkes again launched an attack on Malcolm Fraser. As I said, over the years I have held many views that are quite opposite to the views of Malcolm Fraser, and I still hold those views. But it seems extraordinary to me that in this place tonight members of Malcolm Fraser's own party, the Liberal Party of Australia, sat mum-and that includes former Liberal Ministers-while a former leader of their Party was criticised. It is outrageous that that occurred.",92
102,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,I rise on a point of order. I,92
103,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,It is all right to take a point of order.,92
104,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"The Minister will have time to complete his remarks, because he has until 11.10 p.m. NIy point of order is that that cannot be said. It is contrary to the Standing Orders, because it was not possible for members on this side to speak at that time as the debate concluded at 11 p.m.",92
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no point of order.,92
106,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,There is no point of order. I wanted to say this: it should be on the record that there was not one murmur. Mr MACKellar-What about Downer?,92
107,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"The point is that no honourable member opposite except for the member for Mayo-and I acknowledged his comments-made comments in Malcolm Fraser's defence. I would not have expected the honourable' member for Deakin (Mr Beale), who has just entered the chamber, to defend him. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) and the honourable member for  the point to them that it should not be possible to get away with that sort of attack. They should not be allowed to get away with . making those comments.",92
108,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,Will you give us an extension of time?,93
109,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,They will have their chance tomorrow and on other occasions. Members opposite had their chance after Question Time when that outrageous question was asked.,93
110,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: what the Minister is saying is quite contrary to the Standing Orders. I have been studying the Standing Orders and the debate concluded at 11 p.m.",93
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member for Menzies will resume his seat.,93
112,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"If I had had an opportunity to speak, I would have defended the former Prime Minister.",93
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for, Menzies knows that he has not point of order.",93
114,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,I am glad to hear that. I took the opportunity tonight as a member of the Government-,93
115,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"No, as a Minister.",93
116,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"and as a Minister, to make my views known in this House. The point is that I believe it is high time we all got behind the views of Malcolm Fraser in regard to South Africa and what is going on there. We should be more outspoken in our criticisms of what, I hope, is a minority point of view in this place, that is, the view of the honourable member for Parkes. Mr MACKellar-They certainly are.",93
117,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I am glad to hear that interjection ,and I hope that that is the case. I join with the Prime Minister and I know now that honourable members opposite those who are here tonight condemn another attack by the member for Parkes on a person who I believe has done a lot to try to rectify the injustices that are occurring in South Africa and who, hopefully, will go on to bring about an end to those unfair, cruel and harsh attitudes that prevail and dominate in that country.",93
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The debate having concluded, the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.

119,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The press clipping service is provided by Monitair Pty Ltd of Be\connen, ACT on a daily basis. Media Monitoring is provided both by Monitair Pty Ltd and Croll Communications (Aust.) of Sydney, also on a daily basis. (3) The press clipping service and monitoring service advisory is circulated to 250 people within the Department of Defence, the Australian Defence Force and the Padiament. (4) Yes. The press clipping service and monitoring service advisory is distributed to six locations outside the Department of Defence, Australian Defence Force and the two ministers' offices. They are as follows: Senator the Honourable Graham Richardson  Senator Robert Hill Senator Jocelyn Newman Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Parliamentary Library (5) The cost of providing these services were as follows: For the Financial Year83-84-$10,670, 84-85-$16,025 85-86-$18,441 86-87-$22,258 87-88-$28,761 (to March 5)88-89-$20,998 (6) No. (7) There is a period contract in force which went to tender for the press clipping and media monitoringservices within the ACT. The contract' was Organised by the Department of Administrative Services and further, inquiries should properly be addressed to the appropriate Minister. Croll Communications (Aust.) was selected to provide a support media monitoring service on a' national 'basis because, at the time, it 'was the sole supplier of such a service. (8) The Department of Defence pays for the service. (9) DAS has advised that, in addition tq Monitair, there was one other tenderer; Neville Jeffress Pty Ltd. (10) Croll Communications (Aust.) was the only supplier at the time able to offer a national media monitoring service and was therefore awarded the contract. (II) The press clipping and media monitoring services provide material which originates from information in the public domain. Defence Purchase Contracts (Question No. 1678) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) What procedures were followed by the Clothing, Field and Barracks Section of Headquarters Logistics Command, Melbourne, for the granting of defence purchase contracts between 30 June 1983 and 30 June 1987. (2) How many (a) tenders were received from, and (b) contracts were awarded to, insignia manufacturers in the same period. (3) Were any of these firms permitted to submit an amended price offer after the closure of a tender; if so, why was this permitted. (4) How many of the contracts referred to in part (2) were completed on time. (5) What were the reasons for outstanding contracts. (6) Were further contracts aWarded to firms which had not completed contracts on time. ' (7) Did the section accept informal assurances from any contractor concerning price and delivery. (8) Have any ch-nges to the procedures for granting of defence purchase contracts by the section been made since 30 June 1987; if so, what are they.",94
120,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am advised by Army that the procedures followed by the Clothing, Field and Barracks Section of Headquarters Logistic Command for the granting of Defence Purchase Contracts between 30 June 1983 and 30 June 1987 were dependent upon the value and source of the items being purchased. In essence the procedl!res were: a. June 1983-June 1986 (I) Procurement Demands on Australian Army Staff Washington for items of USA or Canadian origin not subject to direct requisitioning procedures, Quotations were called from commercial and/or government sources, evaluated 'and Purchase Orders placed on successful tenderers by the Washington personnel. (2) Procurement Demands on Counsellor Pur: chasing, Australian High Comm,ission London for items of British or European origin. Quotations were called' from 'com'mercial and/or government sources, evaluated and Purchase Orders placed on s'uccessful tenderers by the London personnel. (3) Purchases above ,the tender threshold and not available from a Government instrumentality or under a Commonwealth or State Government Period Contract Circular were handled by the' Defence' Contracting Office. The Defence Contracting Office arranged tenders which were passed to the Clothing Field and Barracks Section for evaluation and tender recommendation. The Defence Contracting Office then raised a Contract and Purchase Order on the successful tenderer. (4) Foreign Military Sales were requisitioned directly on the US Department of Defence using the MILSTRIP system. (5) Decision to Depot Purchase. The Clothing Field and Barrack Section having decided that a purchase should be made by the staff of one of the Supply Battalions caused a Demand and Issue Voucher to be produced at the nominated Supply Battalion. The Local Purchase staff of the Supply Battalion then carried out all action in regard to quotations, evaluation and placement of Purchase Orders. (6) Letter of Authority. This was the same procedure as the Decision to Depot Purchase except for the funding arrangements and the format of the documentation. b. July 1986-June 1987 The only change during this period related to the Letter of Authority system which was re"" placed by the Purchase Order (SP20) where the Clothing, Field and Barracks Staff placed orders directly on suppliers where: (I) a Period Contract existed for the item; or, (2) supply was from a Government factory or instrumentality; or (3) the value was below the tender threshold. In this case quotations were called and evaluated before placement of the order. (2) During the period in question there were 159 quotations/tenders received for a total of 89 contracts awarded. In addition there were 61 orders placed or Government factories and firms holding Period Contracts. (3) Army advise that a review of all relevant procurement files has not revealed any evidence to suggest that any firms were permitted to amend quotations/tenders after the closing date. (4) Of the 89 contracts awarded and 61 orders placed 15 were cancelled and of the remainder 35 were completed on time. (5) The reasons for late delivery included the following: a. delays associated with Quality Assurance; b. repairs required to Commonwealth tooling; c. production of tooling; d. delays in supplying the raw material to the contractor; e. delays in the contractor receiving the ate tooling from the Commonwealth or previous contractor; d. delivery of finished product to the wrong address; g. priority being given to other Commonwealth orders; and, h. production difficulties. Note: With a multiple line contract, the contract was deemed to be late if even one item was not delivered on time. (6) There was a total of 114 contracts given to II different contractors after those contractors had previously been in default because of delivery dates. These contractors included all the manufacturing firms with which the Clothing, Field and Barracks Section dealt. (7) In regard to informal assurances, Army advise that it is normal practice to contact contractors to check delivery dates. This is usually done when the estimated date of delivery approaches and on a regular basis for all overdue deliveries. This contact is usually by means of the telephone and a ""record of conversation"" is maintained on the relevant file. Informal assurances in regard to price are not accepted and no evidence was found on the relevant procurement files that any had been accepted. Price variation requests from the contractor must be in writing and are checked against the conditions of the contract. (8) Army advises that there have been no changes to the formal contracting procedures used by the Clothing, Field and Barracks Section since June 1987. However, to alleviate some of the delays to the contractors caused by tooling difficulties a second set of tooling has been purchased for the higher usage items. Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1682) Mr John Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not, why not. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided appropri- the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. Security checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security clearance, are conducted on people selected to occupy Designated Security Assessment Positions (DSAPs) or Positions of Trust (POTs). Requesting ASIO to provide a security assessment forms part of the security clearance process to DSAPs-i.e. where access is required to national security information classified confidential and above or to secure areas. (2) (a) For Positions of Trust, the Commonwealth Personnel Management Manual requires the department/ Agency to assess the general suitability of that occupant to occupy a position which may allow the occupant access to sensitive, non-national security information or to valuable assets. The process involves: a check of the person's identity; requesting a check of Police records; an assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character. An ASIO security assessment is not required for POTs. For DSAPs, in addition to the above requirements for POTs, the Commonwealth's Protective Security Manual and Personnel Assessment Manual require that a security assessment .be requested from ASIO, but only after the Departmental/Agency Head is satisfied as to a person's general suitability to a DSAP. Where it is determined that, on general suitability ground, a person is unsuitable to occupy a DSAP a decision is taken to cease fu rther clearance action and a security assessment is not sought from ASIO. 2. (b) Where a Departmental Secretary/Agency Head decides not to grant a security clearance, or ceases further clearance action, based on general suitability ground, the following avenues of appeal are available: under Division 3, Part III of the Public Service Regulations; The Merit Protection Review Agency for Commonwealth employees; and The Commonwealth Ombudsman for non-Commonwealth employees. Nursing Homes and Hostels (Question No. 1698) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) What are the (a) names and (b) addresses of all nursing homes and hostels in each State which receive subsidies from the Fed,eral Government. (2) Is there any reason why this information cannot be supplied immediately. : Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Prior to this question, you requested this information orally and in writing from me, as well as lodging a request under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. A copy of the names and addresses of all hostels in each State which receive subsidies from the Federal Government has been supplied as a result of the FOI request. (2) The supply of the information in respect of nursing homes is subject to the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act. Given these provisions, I am not in a position to release. the information requested. Project DESINE (Question No. 1722) Mr White asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: (I) What is the value of the Project DESINE contract to Australian companies. (2) Will he introduce a monitoring system to ensure that the Australian content expectations of the contract are fulfilled. (3) In letting the Project DESINE contract to IBM, is his Department committed to Open Systems Interconnections (OSI); if so (a) how quickly will his Department move to implement OSI architecture, (b) what contractual commitments have IBM given to his Department with respect to implementoccupy ing OSI, (c) will his Department ensure that any new networks implemented under the DESINE contract be based on OSI protocols and not on the proprietary IBM System Network Architecture (SNA), (d) are there OSI products currently available from multiple sources in the marketplace, (e) will OSI products be acquired by his department through an open tendering process to ensure competitive pricing and (f) if his Department implements SNA, what action does it propose to take to ensure that these networks can be migrated to OSI within the five year period of the current contract.",95
121,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) DESINE is a period contract so total sales under the contract are uncertain. Defence information systems purchases for hardware and operating software have been running at $55m/yr, but not all of this will be spent under DESINE as existing systems will need continuing support which will be sourced from existing contracts. The contract requires a continuing level of Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) content of 23.8%. As new subcontractors can be added to the contract over its life, it is expected that the level of ANZ content may increase. (2) Yes, such a system is under development. (3) Defence is committed to OSr. The commitment of all shortlisted full tenderers to OSI was subject to detailed investigations during tender evaluation. IBM has already implemented a number of international standards (not only restricted to OSI) and is continuing to do so. (a) Defence will implement proven products that support OSI standards as they become available and meet a Defence requirement. This will include the use of OSI standards in place of IBM proprietary standards where feasible. As the OSI standards are still being formulated and ratified by various sub-committees under the auspices of the International Standards Organization (ISO), none of the tenderers for DESINE were able to offer a complete OSI architecture. It will be some years before this architecture is available. The DESINE evaluation selected a contractor who offered the most cost effective solution which included a complete proven network architecture, who demonstrated that it was implementing OSI protocols and who agreed to maintain the development of OSI products. The initial environment is based on IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA) which supports networking based on IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and includes OSI standards, and other relevant standards endorsed by international bodies. This environment enables the immediate implementation and development of Defence systems and networks incorporating international standards. As further international standards are ratified and products are delivered in the market place, DESINE will be updated to include them as appropriate. (b) IBM agreed to maintain the development of products which implement OSI standards and to periodically notify Defence of these developments. IBM further agreed to provide defence with early access to such products prior to commercial release. (c) OSI is concerned with the exchange of information between proprietary systems and not the internal functioning of each individual system as potentially provided by IBM's System Network Architecture, SNA. Defence required a proven network architecture, including support for international standards, to the extent that these are available. That is, the network architecture must comprise proven hardware and software products, provide advanced networking services, incorporate both wide-area and local area communications facilities and support a variety of transmission media. This has resulted in the selection of SNA. Defence will implement networks using proven products that support OSI standards as they become available. This will include the use of OSI standards in place of SNA standards within systems where feasible. Where possible OSI standards will be used for the interconnection of existing systems with DESINE systems. (d) Yes, but they are not always competing products in the sense that they are commonly developed for specific vendor environments. (e) OSI products will be acquired from the DESINE contract where they are available. Generally a product implementing an OSI standard(s) is designed to allow interconnection between one vendor's proprietary system and another's that likewise has an interface product that will implement the same OSI standard. The products are proprietary, the standards are not. As further products which implement emerging OSI standards become available from IBM and the subcontractors, and are compatible with the evolving Defence environment, these products would be incorporated in the DESINE contract after ascertaining that the price is fair. This would be in line with the technology update provisions in the contract. OSI products for equipment not incorporated in the DESINE contract would be bought under conventional procedures which would include open tendering where appropriate. (f) Defence will be using Systems Application architecture (SAA) which provides a standard programming interface for communication over either SNA or OSI protocols. Hence there will be no need to rewrite SAA applications to support OSI protocols as they are introduced over the five year period. As a result Defence can migrate DESINE applications to OSI by replacing SNA protocols in networks with the OSI equivalents as they become available. IBM has a contractual commitment to make these products available on a priority basis to Defence.",97
