1,Mr DEAKIN,HONORABLE SIR HENRY,"Ballarat-Minister of External Aff airs) . [2.31] - This morning's cablegrams inform us of the decease of the distinguished man who, but a few days since, was Prime Minister of Great Britain. On his career, involved as it was with the. party politics of the Mother Country, there is no"" need to dwell; his high character, . his genial disposition, - his staunch sincerity were patent to all observers. This Commonwealth owes him a distinct debt, because, when the Constitution Bill was before the House of Commons, we had the advantage of his earnest support at every stage of the consideration of the measure. He, and several of those. who are now members of the Ministry which he so lately led, were ardent in their, desire to further the growth of self government in Australia. 'Again, last year, when there was considerable doubt as to the course which should be followed, he recognised the importance of the gathering of the representatives of the self governing Dominions of the Empire, by attending the Conference in person andwelcoming them in an opening speech which breathed the broadest statesmanship. iUnder these circumstances, I - ' trust the House will forgive the fulfilment of what appears to me an obligation to the memory of a great man. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK (Parramatta) [2.33] - The Prime Minister did well to note the passing of the late Prime Minister of Great Britain. The death of a great Britisher-must always be a matter of concern to us, and the'late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the embodiment. of the characteristics which make up a great Britisher. I cannot think of him without - at the same time thinking' of another great . Englishman who, too, has lately passed over to the majority. I . refer to the late Duke of. DevonshireBoth loved their country intensely, both served it faithfully and. well for ' nearly forty years. We must remember thit these men were born to high station, and possessed all that goes to make life easy and pleasant; but, in spite of these advantages and temptations, they de-voted their best abilities to the service of their country, and served the Empire with arare devotion and a high sense of duty. There have been many men, perhaps,' more brilliant than the late Prime Minister; but he was a much bigger man than we were apt to think. When one read his speeches, one realized how sane, how wise, and how broad were his views,-and saw how much grit*, courage, and honour he possessed. He must be regarded as one of those who are very much greater than is disclosed by a superficial g]ance. Many men have been able to appeal more strongly to the imagination of their countrymen ; but, in our time, m d within our knowledge, no man has so firmly implanted himself in the hearts' and affections of h is fellows, more particularly within the last two or three years. The nation loved him, and did so because it came to see that he loved the people. So long as our Empire is as f r u it f u l as it has been in the production of men such as the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, we need not doubt our abilitv to maintain our pride of place among the nations of the world.",14
2,Mr FISHER,HONORABLE SIR HENRY,"Wide Bay) [2.37] - The passing of public men, especially of recent days, seems to indicate that the wear and tear of public life in modern times is more severe than it was in the past. Any one who had personal acquaintance with the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman will cheerfully admit that be was a man of broader view, greater mind, and keener susceptibility to the wants of his own people, and possessed of a wider knowledge of the development of civil government in foreign countries, than perhaps any other Prime Minister, of recent date, except the late Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone. I had the pleasure of meeting him, and' hearing him speak, and what impressed me more than anything else was his broad, general, human sympathy, and his desire, not only that the Government of his own country should be ""broad based' upon the people's will,."", but that other countries should possess as liberal political institutions as they were 'able to conduct with advantage to themselves. The Prime Minister has mentioned what the right honourable gentleman did for this Commonwealth. May I bepermitted to allude to what he did for the sister colonies of the Transvaal and Orange River? I am almost tempted to name, too, a foreign country in regard to which .he said that, although its young Parliament might be dead, another would arise and establish itself on its ashes. A great man has passed; one who, perhaps, will, in the future, appear greater than he seems now. He was one of those statesmen who had the people's benefit at heart, and his broad sympathies linked together the members of a party in the great Government which, under the lead of his successor now controls the destinies of the Empire. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA.",15
3,Mr KELLY,HONORABLE SIR HENRY,"I understand that a number of copies of a publication called Australia To-day were procured by the Government for advertising purposes. I desire to ask the Prime Minister-whether any other publications of an Australian character were procured, and, if so, whether he can, from memory, inform the House what they were ?",15
4,Mr DEAKIN,HONORABLE SIR HENRY,"I do not remember any other publication of exactly the same class. There was also a handbook of Australia, which is a statistical compilation, giving figures relating to the commerce, trade, production., population, and so forth, for the whole of Australia. Beyond that, I clo not recollect any other such, publication. NAVAL AGREEMENT.",15
5,Mr BRUCE SMITH,HONORABLE SIR HENRY,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen the report of an interview with Lord Tweedmouth in the Sydney Morning Herald of a day or' two ago in which that statesman positively affirms ""that there is no desire on the part of the Imperial naval authorities to terminate the Naval Agreement, and no present intention of doing so. - W i ll the Prime Minister reconsider whether he can lay on the table of the House the correspondence with the naval authorities containing the discussion left unfinished in his December speech?",15
6,Mr DEAKIN,HONORABLE SIR HENRY,"I have hot had the pleasure of reading the interview referred to, but shall take an opportunity of reading it . I have received, within the last two> or three days, a cabled reply saying that the explicit information for which I asked, further defining the position of the Admiralty, will be prepared and forwarded very shortly. Until that information arrives the correspondence is incomplete. NA PRESERVATION ACT. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Some time ago we were told by the Attorney-General that he had in contemplation action under the Australian Industries Preservation Act in regard to five or six alleged Australian trusts, and for that purpose he asked for an amending Bill . When that Bill was passing, the Attorney-General intimated that he proposed to take speedy action to bring some of those trusts to book - That is now some weeks ago, and I should like to know what has been done in the meantime.",15
7,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIE S,"I think the honourable member for Parramatta alleges that I made a statement a little more definite than that I did make. WhatT said was fhat we had caused certain) inquiries to be made, and that I had in my possession reports in reference to a number of trusts, showing that it was absolutely necessary for the Government to have larger powers than we possessed. I might add that, as a matter of fact, the doings of one of the trusts are at present under consideration, and the Crown Solicitor has the matter in hand. Beyond that, it is not wise for me to make any announcement. NORTHER N TERRITORY.",16
8,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIE S,"Havin g regard to the close relationship of the taking over of Northern Territory with the 'policy of imunlimited. migration and the policy of defence, already foreshadowed by the Government, will the Prime Minister give the House an indication, of when the ""question of the Territory and the agreement with South Australia will be dealt.with by the House?",16
9,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIE S,As soon as current business permits. FINANCIAL RELATIONS: NA,16
10,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I desire - to ask the Prime Minister whether it is possible for him to carry out the intention he expressed some time ago of placing on the table the scheme for the financial arrangePostmaster-General ments between the Commonwealth and the States. If I understood the honourable gentleman aright, he said that the scheme session ? would be placed on the table before the meeting of the Premiers.",16
11,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"That a statement would be made. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - No ; I understood that the scheme would be placed on the table. As the Premiers meet on the 28th instant, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister will be able to fulfil his intention, or, if not, when he intends to place the scheme before the House?",16
12,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"A recent interruption of the business of the House has required the concentration of the attention of my colleague' the Treasure? on fiscal matters to the exclusion of the financial scheme, which is already well advanced. I am not quite sure now whether, under the circumstances, we shall be able to place it on the table as early as anticipated. But the scheme is at that stage when, I think, I may say an outline of it will be placed on the table very shortly.",16
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"When the scheme is placed on the table, will the House be invited to consider it ?",16
14,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I doubt whether there will be time for that, until it has been considered elsewhere. The scheme will be extensive, and involve directly and indirectly, a number of matters; and it would probably be an advantage to the House, and save time, if , when we proceed to consider it , we have before us the criticism of the State Ministries. I have in view the fact that we are pressed for the time; it might be otherwise if time were",16
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"There will not be much advantage in placing the scheme on the table, if we are not to consider it .",16
16,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,- I desire to ask the Treasurer why there has been delay in printing the paper dealing with the relations referred to which has been submitted to him by the honourable member for Darwin ?,16
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,That paper . will be circulated tomorrow morning. POSTAL RATESBILL .,16
18,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I desire to ask the whether the Government have any serious intention of proceeding with the Postal Rates Bill this,16
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,When the state of public business permits. REPRESENTATION OF VICTORIA. CENSUS STATISTICS.,16
20,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice I. Is it a fact, as stated in the Age newspaper, that the Commonwealth Statistician admits that, under the metliod of computation, the population of Victoria has been under-estimated?. 2. If so, and correction were made, would it have disturbed the number of members allotted to Victoria and New South Wales respectively at the last election? 3. What is the relative increase of population, after any necessary correction, in each of the two States named, since the last allotment, and what number of members would the. latest figures give for each State?",17
21,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The Commonwealth Statistician is of opinion that the allowance of .9 per cent, for Victorian unrecorded departures by sea decided upon at the Statistical Conference of 1903 is somewhat too high for the year 1907, and that if such an allowance were made, the increase in the population of the State for that year would have been under-estimated to the extent of 2,587. Similarly the increase in the population of New South Wales would have been underestimated to the extent of 1,973. 2. No . 3. The figures on which the last allotment of representation was based were, those for 30th September, 1905. Between that date and 31st December, 1907, the population of Victoria, .according to the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician, increased by 33,995, while that of New South Wales increased by 85,573. According to the Victorian Government Statist the increase in the population of Victoria during the period referred to was 44,040. Under either set of figures the representation of the States would be as at present. SUGAR EXCISE.",17
22,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"the Treasurer, u-bon notice I. Referring to his reply to questions on 15th inst., in which he stated that ""no drawback of duty has been claimed on Excise sugar,"" will he be good enough to explain why the Comptroller-General of Customs, in October, 1907, made the following statement:""When imported sugar is used, a drawback of the import duty is allowed upon the exportation of Australian jam. . . When Excise sugar 'is used, a drawback is allowed up to 30s. per ton of the weight of the jam."" Will he also explain why' the Customs Department found it necessary on the 12th March, 1908, to issue a regulation under the Excise Act 1901, of which the following are the material portions :. 50. Drawback of the full amount of the .Excise duty paid may be allowed upon the exportation of the following excisable goods, namely :-Spirits , Tobacco, Cigars, Cigarettes, Snuff, Beer, Sugar, Starch. Provided that as to sugar used in.the manu- facture of the following articles drawback may be allowed on the exportation of the articles, but so that no allowance shall be made for sugar contents in excess of the following proportions to the . total weight of the articles :Confectionery, Comfits, Succades, Sweetmeats, and Sugar Candy ... ... frds. Jams and Jellies ... ... A Jellies, table, in packet .. - Jths. 1 Fruits, canned andi preserved ... ... 5-36ths? 2. If ""no drawback of Excise duty has been claimed,"" or was in contemplation of being claimed, why was this regulation issued making provision for. the payment of such drawbacks of duty? 3. If drawback is paid on Excise sugar sent abroad for consumption will not the results of such payment be(a) That the Treasury will have paid away in bounty and in drawback £ 3 per ton more than it has received from Excise; and (4) That the Australian people will have been taxed in order to provide cheap beer, jams, jellies, & c , for foreigners, though themselves paying the full Australian market price for these commodities? 4. Does he not think that the reason why "" no drawback of duty has been claimed on Excise sugar"" is that it pays the exporter's of jams, & c, better to receive a drawback of the import duty (£6 per ton) than of the Excise duty (£4 per ton)? 5. Is he in a position to say definitely that no Excise sugar was contained in commodities exported for foreign consumption, and that drawback at the rate of £ 6 per ton has not been improperly paid in some instances? 6. In the case of Excise sugar which has obtained the drawback allowed on export to foreign sugar, has not the Treasury paid out £ 5 per ton more than it received? 7. What means does the Customs Department possess for determining whether commodities for export contain Excise sugar or imported sugar?. 8. Referring to his reply that the Constitution Act provides "" authority for the payment of bountv ""(a) Does he contend that the Constitution entitles him to pay, on his own motion and without the sanction of Parliament, a bounty on exported sugar? (4) Can he mention any other product except sugar which obtains a bounty on export without the authority of an Act of Parliament; and {c) If he considered that local sugar, when ' exported, was entitled to be assisted by bounty, why did he not include that commoditv in the measure recently before this House which appropriates revenue for the payment of bounties ?",17
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The answers' tc the honourable member's questions are as foHow- 1. The reference to Excise sugar was intended merely to show what drawback is payable under the Excise regulations. The amending regulation of 12th March, 1908, was issued chiefly to make the form identical with the corresponding regulation under the Customs Act by stating sugar contents as proportion of the total weight of articles, and thus applicable, independently of the rates of duty - „ 2. As implied in reply to (1) the regulation is - not new, but was amended as to form. lar regulations have been in force since January, 1902. 3. The object of the bounty is:-in accordance with the Commonwealth policy-to secure to the grower of the sugar cane (not the manufacturer of sugar) a certain definite advantage if white labour is employed. This object, is apart from any consideration of profit or loss by the imposition of an Excise duty or any question of the ultimate disposal of the sugar made from cane upon which bounty has been paid. As a matter of fact, the'sugar used in exported manufactures is imported sugar on which' import duty has' been paid, and of which drawback is given. 4.. Yes. 5. In view of the precautions taken there is no reason to suspect that any improper payments have been made. 6. See answer to No. 5. 7. Information is obtained both from the vendors of the sugar, and from the manufacturers of 'the articles exported, and such information is verified by statutory declaration. 8. Under the' Acts of 1903 and 1905, bounty is payable on the production by white labour of sugar cane delivered at a factory, and such payment does not depend in any way on the ultimate .manufacture of the cane into sugar or the actual quantity of the latter produced, and has no connection with the ultimate use or destination of the sugar made from the cane. ' BRIMPAEN-HORSHA M ' TELEPHONE LINE.",18
24,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"the. Postmaster-General, upon noticex. Whether it is true, as stated in the Horsham Times, that an officer of the Postal Department has, .by submitting an adverse .report, hindered indefinitely the completion of the Brimpaen-Horsliam telephone line, which line is 25 miles in length, and is being erected by the farmers at a cost of about ^350? 2. Is it a fact that 5 out of 39 poles erected within the Horsham borough boundary, and a large - number of the insulators supplied by the farmers, have been condemned by the officer in question ? 3. Is it also true that the Department has refused to allow the Brimpaen-Horsham farmers to connect their telephone line with the De- partment's poles in Firebrace-street until such poles are replaced with new ones? 4. When does the Department intend to erect the new poles in Firebrace-street? 5. If the Minister is anxious tp give telephonic facilities to the farmers, will he show his disapproval of the official red-tape obstruction to the Brimpaen-Horsham telephone line by authorizing his Department to consent to the completion of the said line at once? . Mr .MAUGER - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. It is not true that the Line Inspector has indefinitely postponed the completion of this line. The Inspector has not'so far taken any objection to any portion of the line outside the Simi1 borough of Horsham. 2. .Several poles erected by the Telephone Syndicate within the town boundary are unsuitable, i.e., they are very crooked, covered with large knots where the limbs have been cut off, and ugly in appearance. Such poles would not be erected by the Department. If the Borough Council agree to the erection of such poles, and make no further Claim on the Department, with reganl to them, 'the Department .is prepared to waive its objection. The insulators supplied' by the farmers are of a class which has been condemned by the Department as far back as igoi. Where the private wire is on Departmental, poles proper insulators and fittings should be used. 3. The Telephone Syndicate-proposed to erect, their wire on Departmental poles in Firebracestreet, which would only allow of the' wire being at a height, of 11 f t . 6 in. over street crossings. . This cannot be allowed. By fixing ""extenders to poles, the necessary height of .the wire would be pttained. 4. The poles in Firebrace-street do not at present require renewal. The necessary alterations will be made with the development of telephone service in Horsham. .5. See previous replies. I will not allow any unnecessary obstruction, ""and will causefurther inquiries to be made at once.

25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.50] - The honourable member for Riverina announced last night his intention to move that the duty should not take effect until after ""six months' time.

Will honourable members say that circumstances do not alter the case, and also the application of principle, when, ordinarily, good fodder can be bought for £ 2 ios. arid ,-£3 a ton, whereas'now those unfortunate land-owners are compelled to pay ^ 8 a ton for what is real rubbish?

I am not speaking williout. knowledge in this matter, nor am I pleading only for my own constituents. I speak on behalf of a very large area of the Commonwealth, ancl of people who, while they, perhaps, have a little fodder to sell, are not .so inhuman as to desire the present oppressively high prices to continue.",19

63,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"In my opinion, I was not wrong then, nor am I now. I am only departing from a principle in consequence of a very grave necessity which has arisen. I appeal to the Committee to accept the Senate's request with the modification I have proposed.",20
64,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Nepean) [ . ] . _ The 3 5 honourable member for Riverina repudiates the suggestion that he is a parochialist. plea that he puts forward is that cerhaptain parts of New South Wales and Victoria, particularly the electorate which he in the former State, are suffering from a drought, and the stock-owners need he' cheap fodder, but he hopes that in the course of six months the drought will have passed away. He seems to forget that there may be a drought in some other part of New South Wales, or'other parts of Commonwealth, when there is no drought in Riverina. He was correct in stating three or four months ago there was a very is a shortage. severe drought in the district I represent. Six months ago, I . supported, if move a proposal, that fodder should be made free. I hold exactly the same view today, for reasons which I do not wish to posal. repeat. This duty can only be operative when there is a drought somewhere, and then persons in other parts wealth are able to suck a little more blood out of their poorer neighbours when it can be least spared. In October last, the orable member for Riverina pleaded for suspension of the duty for six months. H told us then that he did not want a suspension of the duty for twelve months, because he felt quite sure that the shorter suspension would be sufficient.",20
65,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I said that I hoped would be.,21
66,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"What I tried to point mania. out to the honourable member just now, by way of interjection, was that he was wrong when he first asked - for a suspension. On a former occasion, he should have asked for a suspension of the duty .for twelve months, not for six months. Whether is right or wrong in his estimate of the out- look in his constituency, I point out that this duty can only operate at a time when it must press hardly upon stock-owners suffering from drought. That very fact alone should impel us to remove the duty. I . intend again to vote for its abolition.

115,Mr LIVINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Barker) [3.31] I agree with the honourable member for Riverina that his electorate is in a deplorable condition, and sincerely sympathize with the farmers and graziers there. I travelled through part of his electorate a it few days ago, and saw that it was in a very bad state; but I should not like to to say that all Australia is suffering from be drought, and that we have to go beyond the buy. Commonwealth to obtain fodder for our can stock. In the southern part of South Australia we are enjoying one of the best to seasons we have experienced there; whilst of throughout the northern part of that State the season has ""been an exceedingly good He one. Men from the north are visiting the southern districts to purchase cattle for their runs. Had they known that starving to stock was so plentiful in the Riverina, I - am sure that some of them would have gone there for their supplies instead of to Gambier and other' districts in the. south-east of South Australia. I was inby my brother, whom I met in SydAfter all ney a few days ago, that in his districtbetween Mungindi and St. George-the grass is over the tops of the wire fences, so that there, too, the season has been a good one: What we need is a ready means of conveying fodder from one part of the Commonwealth to another. It would rot and pay to feed ordinary stock for any length of time on hay and chaff; only very valuable stock can' be fed in that way. I am much sorry that the Riverina should be stricken by drought, but the. farmers and graziers there can readily obtain hay and chaff in tide South Australia at a very cheap rate.",24
116,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The honourable member for for Boothby said that the price of chafF f we do not there was £ 5 per ton. - I think that it I is less than that. When I left home a fortnight ago, chaff, delivered without bags, was offering at £ 3 ios. per ton. We have an abundant supply of fodder; all that we need is adequate means of conveying it at cheap rates to the drought-stricken or of taking the stock to. the dismemtricts where food is obtainable at reasonable rates. In the olden days when we had> so to speak, a free country, stock could be easily shifted by road from one district to another, but nowadays we need to push our railways into the drought-stricken districts in order to enable us to combat the evils of dry seasons. Fortunately, a very small portion of Australia is at present affected by drought, and I hope that we shall never have, a repetition of. the drought of 1902. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that our farmers and graziers should make better preparation for dry seasons. I certainly thought that the drought of 1902 would teach them to make provisionfor the maintenance of their stock in bad times. In my electorate, we have never had a drought, and I do not think that we shall ever have one. The more severe the drought in other parts of Australia, the more bountiful is the supply of fodder in the electorate of Barker. There one may see stacks of hay which have been kept for two or three years as a provision against drought, but, fortunately, we have not yet experienced one.",24
117,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"South Sydney) [3.36] It seems to me that to specially exempt hay and chaff when we arej passing a generally protective Tariff is to give Australia a very undesirable advertisement. The principle that we have in view in passing a generally protective Tariff is that we should encourage industries and productions for which the Commonwealth is suited, and in respect of all such industries we impose stimulating duties. The special exemption of hay and chaff would be a declaration to the rest of the world that Australia was unable, in our opinion, to produce sufficient fodder for her own requirements. In other words, it would seem to indicate that the great primary industries upon which we pride ourselves, and for which Australia is held to be peculiarly suited are, in our opinion, so liable to periodic interruption that we are not prepared to extend to them the same measure of encouragement that we grant to other industries. That would be one of the worse possible advertisements that we could give Australia.",25
118,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Surely protective duties are imposed to assist budding industries?,25
119,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,The honourable member has not yet studied protection.,25
120,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I have studied the honourable member's speeches.,25
121,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The honourable member, in making that statement, is exercising his capacity for bluff, which, after all, is of not; much value, since his bluffing is only superficial. I have said nothing that would warrant the honourable member's assertion; I have said repeatedly that, even when an industry is well established, it may still be necessary to impose protective duties in relation to it, in order to prevent the dumping from abroad of products which are likely to undermine the local production. As long as .prices locally are not unduly inflated against the consumer, protective duties in such circumstances should be maintained. If those who oppose a protective duty on fodder are anxious to help the farmers, they should direct their energies to an effort to break ^ up the rings that now controlthe supply and distribution of fodder. That is the crux of the question. Australia can produce, and at trie presenttime holds, more than the fodder necessary for the starving stock within her borders. As to the suggestion made by ""the honourable member for Wimmera respecting the educational effects of the last drought, one might reasonably have expected it to have a fair measure of influence upon our farmers. In my old electorate of Bland, which comprised a part of the Riverina, many farmers who suffered heavily during the last drought have learned a lesson from it, and. have conserved both natural and specially-grown fodder in ensilage pits, tub silos, and ordinary stacks. These men have not suffered in the slightest degree from the drought. In the case of one big pastoral property those in charge gathered together fodder, of various descriptions' to such an extent as to insure the management against any loss from drought. My strong conviction is that there is not one beast that need go without fodder because of any scarcity in the supply to be obtained in Australia. It is only a matter of making proper provision for seasons of drought and of our farmers and settlers generally being educated to take advantage of the opportunities Providence has placed at their disposal, and, what is, perhaps, quite as important,-of insuring that when a time of stress and scarcity arises a few people shall not be able to corner the market. That is what, at the present time, as well as during the last big drought, constituted the principal trouble from which 'those who had to provide for starving stock had to suffer. It was not that supplies were not available from farms in Tasmania or South Australia at reasonable prices, but that middlemen were, with the assistance of the shippingring, able to control the whole situation and prevent the farmer or squatter who had starving stock to keep alive from getting access to what should be their natural opportunities for relief. been asked what steps I would take to deal with the matter. The first step to be taken should be to' nationalize the coastal shippingservice of Australia. We should nationalize the steam-ships engaged in our coastal trade, just as we bave nationalized our railways, and in that way we should be able to transfer fodder cheaply from one part of the country to another.  sovereign balm for ' all our wounds.",25
122,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I do not know that that view should necessarily prejudice eventhe most ignorant from attempting to inquire into. the best means to overcome the difficulty.,26
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Would'.that vent the operations of the fodder ring?,26
124,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"It would have a material influence in that direction. The honourable member for Parramatta is aware that at the present time the shipping, ring and coal proprietors of Newcastle are working under an agreement by which only certain parties are supplied, and only at certain rates. . The CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member not to enlarge upon that question, as to do so would open up quite another debate.",26
125,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I do not intend to enlarge upon it , but it seems to me that a discussion of methods by which a scarcity of fodder in various parts of Australia might be prevented is quite germane to a proposal to impose a duty of is . ' a on hay and chaff. «I agree with the honourable member for Barker that the difficulties under which our settlers labour in various parts of the Commonwealth during times of drought could, perhaps, best be met by improving and increasing facilities for the cheap transport of fodder - Of course, in addition, we should require to have farmers' co-operative associations to insure.that fodder from any district might be purchased without the intervention of - too many middlemen, orof rings that, getting control of supplies, put up prices unduly.",26

129,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I do not think so. Is the honourable member for Parramatta not aware that our farmers have already established a number of co-operative institutions, which are doing a very great deal of good ? I should imagine that the extension of their operations to the purchase and distribution of fodder need be but. a very small step'in advance. The nationalization of our coastal shipping might be a year or two ahead, but it should not be very many years pre-, distant. I dare say that even the honourable member for Parramatta has no objection to help on the millennium. With regard to the special exemption proposed by the honor: able member for. Riverina, I do not think that the - suspension of this duty for six months would have any real effect in the direction the honourable member anticipates, because the only place from which fodder might be imported at the present time is the Argentine. Fodder is as dear in New Zealand as in Australia just now,, and we cannot, therefore, expect to get any from that .Dominion. Whatever supplies we are to get must be obtained - within the Commonwealth, and they might be obtained much more cheaply than they can be obtained at present if better methods of distribution were devised.",26
130,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Flinders) [3.45]. cwt - It seems to me that whatever view we may take of the general question, the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Riverina is absolutely without any logical foundation 'whatever. Every reason which can be urged in favour of it is a reason in' favour of not imposing such a duty at any time. We all deplore the fact that there is a drought prevailing in the honourable member's' constituency, and in other parts of Australia similarly situated, but those who support this duty in the interests of the farmers must remember that that very fact affords them an opportunity to avail themselves of the benefit of the duty. Why should we deprive the fanners of the benefit of the duty at the only time at which they can avail themselves of it? For my own part, I am absolutely opposed to the proposed duty. There is one aspect of the question which has not been touched upon by any honourable member I have yet heard speak upon the subject. It must be remembered that every duty we impose upon an article produced by farmers must be considered from a totally new point of view, in the light of the policy of the new protection adopted by the Government, and which the Prime Minister has stated that he intends to give full effect to. Every farmer, or nearly every farmer, in Australia at some time produces more or less hay and chaff, 'and, therefore, if the duty, be carried, it may be assumed that it will bring every farmer throughout the length and breadth of Aus- tralia within the operation of the drastic provisions proposed by the Government in respect to the new protection.",26
131,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,That is done already by the duty imposed on oats.,27
132,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,And wheat.,27
133,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Not necessarily so. If a. duty is imposed on hay and chaff, one of the effects under the new policy of the Government, apart from the regulation of wages and working time, must be that the price at which farmers, will be allowed to dispose of their hay and chaff will be regulated by an Act of Parliament - or by some body appointed under an Act of Parliament. This particular duty can become effective only at a time when people engaged in the most important industry in Australia are in dire distress and in absolute straits in their endeavours to keep starving stock alive, and if there be any possible time at which it would be justifiable to impose a restriction upon the price of any produce protected under the Tariff, surely that would be the time.",27

Such a suggestion is both cruel arid unjust; and could only be surpassed if it be true as stated, that English officials in high positions protested to the Viceroy in India against charitable people in England subscribing money to save starving millions in our Eastern Possession.

222,Mr MALONE Y,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I know that some men were noble enough to give their paddocks for the use of starving stock; but the facts are as I have stated. The object of the proposal is to prevent undue inflation of prices, and when we grant protection, it is right that we should have some power in this respect over the industry protected. The soundness of this view is shown in the case of the harvester industry; and we know that in High Court proceedings of the kind, the splendid abilities of the honourable member for Flinders may be utilized at any time if he is retained. It was a great truth uttered by Charles Sumner that for the betrayal of a country. or a great cause, one had not to ' go far to find a friend ready made in any lawyer we came across. We have heard how the honourable member has argued today; but we know that tomorrow, - if the Combine were to retain him, - he would argue the other way ; and his legal twisting of the case against the honourable member for Riverina is unworthy of him. If human beings may be punished, it cannot be said that starving stock deserve' any punishment. Our cattle are confined within fences, and are powerless to roam in search of pasture; man only can assist them, and, in any such cause, my vote shall be found on the side of the helpless.",31
223,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Wilmot) [4.20] - I was surprised a little while ago to hear the Treasurer say that he would accept the amendment of the honourable member for Riverina. A few months ago he strenuously opposed any reduction or postponement of the duty. The Committee remitted the duty, but the Senate now wisely requests its restoration. I did think that the Treasurer would seek-to have it restored at once, especially as, according to the printed statement which has been circulated, the Government have agreed to accept this request; yet the Treasurer now wants the. operation of the.duty postponed for six months. The duty was imposed in the first Federal Tariff, and has always been retained until now. Seeing that Australia has decided for, protection, I do not see why the farmer, as well as the other producers of the community, should not receive some meed of it.",31
224,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,We thought - that from some of the honourable member's votes on other matters.,31
225,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I always voted for moderate protection, - when I did vote in that direction. I believe that - Australia, when it says that it is protectionist, means that it is so in a moderate degree, and is not so extreme in its views as to inand dorse the propositions that used to come from the Government benches. We have heard a good deal about the callousness and hard-heartedness of the farmer in trying to wring these high prices from the poor pastoralists, but, occasions like the present, when the drought is so extreme, I do not think that the mer receives the extra J £ I per ton supposed to result from this duty. ' As the orable member for Boothby says, chaff can be obtained in Adelaide at about £ 5 per ton. I believe it can be obtained less than that in Tasmania, and in other places which produce fodder. It is more likely that when the fodder reaches New South Wales it goes into the hands of a paid by the consumers. ring which, as the honourable member a for Riverina said, controls prices. That ring is helped by the fact that New tection isapplied to the farmers. Zealand, which in ordinary years would be the chief competitor with the Australian States, has this year apparently no hay chaff to export, as the prices ruling in Dominion will show. That gives the ring orable member has my sympathy. a much better chance to corner all the the hay and chaff that enters the port of Syding ney. The excessive price, when there is shortage, as at present, is due, not. to duty, but to some intermediate body, such as a ring of . middlemen. I do not why, on that account, the farmers should be penalized. I am sure that the farmers of Australia would be prepared to remit the. duty when prices are as high as are now, the object of the duty being protect them in normal seasons. In those times New Zealand might be a competitor, and to give the Australian farmers somenearly to the extent that they might. thing like a reasonable price for their duce this duty is imposed, New Zealand should noi? be placed in a position to the Australian markets. Those are about vernment. the only times that the duty will 'prove of actual benefit to the farmer. it that we are legislating more for ordinary than for extreme seasons, and, seeing that we are here to give protection, why should we not give fair protection all round? hope that the Treasurer will move to imreturn pose the duty at once, as requested Senate.",31
226,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"New England) [4.25] I hope the Committee will carry the is. duty on - fodder. We have heard a good deal from the Opposition about the terrible burden which the primary producer would have to bear by paying duties on other articles for the good of other industries, now, when a duty is proposed for the benefit of the farmer, surely the members of the Opposition should give him a vote. Like the honourable member for Wilmot, I believe that the main protection which the farmers will get out of this duty will be on against New Zealand competition, and not when fodder is very high in price either. farWhen prices are more moderate, the protection will be very useful to them. As honfor the new protection, and the bugbear raised by the honourable member for F l i nders, who tried to drag a red herring across for the trail, and raise a scare amongst the farmers, I do not fear that one iota, be' cause the prices obtained ' today by the actual producers are a long way below those There is such large margin of difference - that I feel that a long time will elapse before the new proThe - amendment of the honourable member for Riverina does not seem very effective.

The only way to solve the problem as between the producer and the consumer, to insure that the consumer shall pay a reasonable price, and I that the producer shall get a reasonable for his product, is the adoption of a by the scheme of national distribution.",32
227,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Wimmera) [4.29] The question of a duty on hay and chaff naturally affects my district very closely. I suppose that in my constituency there is a larger area of country requiring rain than in any other part of Victoria, but, as a protectionist, I cannot consistently vote for the remission of this duty. I .look upon protection to the agricultural communityas a principle that should apply all round. If the duty of is. per cwt. on hay and chaff is likely to assist the southern farmers, it is the duty of the northern farmers to be loyal to the principle of protection, if it is to apply all round. The retention or remission of this duty will make no material difference to the price. I do not think that there is any reasonable chance of importations fiom abroad. The price of chaff in New Zealand is about the same as in Australia. The Argentine, so far as I can learn, does not do a great deal of exportation at low prices, so that whether the duty is retained or struck off it will make very little difference to the retail price of chaff. It is very largely a sentimental question, but if the duty is retained, it gives the farmer a sense of securitv in respect of his future production. that reason alone, it is necessary that it should be retained. The question of the operation of the new protection might well be discussed by itself. We are dealing now with the question of an import duty on hay and chaff. It will be for us to deal with the new protection when it comes before us. It is not desirable to mix up the two questions. I had intended to go into some figures, but at this late stage of the debate, I do not think that that is necessary. For the last four or five years our exports of hay and chaff have been greater than our imports. In 1906, we imported only 895 cwt. of hay and chaff altogether, and up to the present this year only a small 'Importation has taken 'place. 'From information published from time to time, there is every reason to believe that there is plenty of hay in the southern districts of Australia to supply the requirements of those who can afford to pay a reasonable price for it. When hay reaches £ 3 or £ 4 a ton, it becomes altogether too dear for people to buv to feed sheep on.",32
228,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"They , are paying £ 8 a ton in Riverina. M.r. SAMPSON - That is probablv a higher price than they should be paying. It has been stated that chaff is quoted at £ 5 a ton in South Australia, and another honourable member stated that it could be got for something like £ 4 a ton in Tasmania.",33
229,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,It costs another £ 3 or £ 4 a ton to carry it to the Riverina. [375],33
230,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Freight s are much higher than they should be, but I do not think it costs anything like £ 3 or £ 4 a ton to carry chaff from South Australia to the Riverina. At any rate, I am not discussing present prices, but the prices that people can afford to pay to feed starving stock. When hay reaches £ 3 a ton, it is already too dear to feed stock on, unless it is for valuable dairy herds or stud stock. The question of the fodder, duties has, therefore, anything but an important bearing on the question of starving stock ii: Australia. As a matter of consistency, and for the sake of the retention of a duty which will apply all round to the agricultural community, I am prepared to vote for the adoption of the Senate's request.  this question was last before this Chamber, 1 voted to place hay and chaff upon the For free list, as did also the honourable member for Riverina. The circumstances were then admitted to be peculiar, inasmuch as we were facing a possible harvest failure. At the present time the conditions are peculiar. Although there is in South Australia a very considerable supply of hay and fodder",33
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"And in Western Australia and in Tasmania.  tions of Victoria and of New South Wales there is a very considerable deficiency, and the exorbitant price of about £ 8 per ton is demanded. I venture to say that the practical effect of this amendment, if made, would be nil. Since October last hay and chaff have been on the-free list, but in spite of that fact an abnormal price is demanded. The amendment of the honourable member for Riverina simply proposes that hay and chaff shall be continued on the free list for a further period of six months. To what extent is that likely to affect the price ? I cannot conceive how the remission of the duty for six months is likely to be of the least advantage to the unfortunate persons who are now paying an abnormal price. Too much regard to peculiar circumstances should not be paid in a measure which has to deal with general circumstances. Although we may have a prolific season today, still in the course of a year or two we may have a drought, and then it would be impossible to make a special arrangement to meeF the situation. We cannot place the people of the Commonwealth on all-fours. We have to look at the question not from a local point of view, but from a. national stand-point, and that must take account of the benefit of Australia as a whole. I voted in favour of placing hay and chaff on the free list not only because of the special circumstances which then existed, but also for a broader reason. I venture to say that if a tax on hay and chaff is likely to be effective in an ordinary season, it is our bounden duty to confer that measure of protection, but normally hay and chaff are sold at such prices that there is no possibility of any importations being made to compete with the local produce. Consequently our farmers have nothing to fear, and so far as they are concerned, the contention that they are benefited by the duty is only a fallacy.",33
232,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"They get no benefit times of special stress.  that a duty on hay and chaff has no pro-, tective effect. Some - honourable members want to impose a duty for protective puragainst the continuance of the duty. poses, although they know that it is not likely to be effective. They might as well talk about protecting the labour of the miner or bricklayer. That cannot possibly be done. If honourable members put on the. statute-book a duty which seems to give protection, and yet does not, they are only deluding the farmers into the belief they are going to derive some advantage which cannot possibly be conferred them. I am opposed to that method, and broadly for that reason I am prepared to renew vote which I gave previously, and to vpte against the Senate's request.",34

I cannot call mind a single season when it has had any practical effect so far as the producers concerned, and if it has operated on or two very rare occasions I venture to say that the sum total of the disadvantage altogether outweighs the seeming advantage which the farmers might have derived from its imposition.",34

Then the Commonwealth derived a ' revenue of ""about £500,000.",34
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"How much did it receive from the duty on hay and chaff? ' Mr KNOX - I remember that the fodder duties yielded a large revenue when a considerable portionof the Commonwealth. was in dire distress' from a terrible drought. It seems to me, therefore, that the duty only becomes operative in a period of great severity, when our own people are suffering. It cannot be shown that when' normal conditions prevail the duty has been operative. I thoroughly support the rein presentations which have been made in opposition to it. Not only will I support the amendment of _ the honourable member for Riverina, but if the opportunity is offered I shall certainly vote I hope that the Committee will extend its sympathy to those persons who axe suffering great distress in many portions of the Commonwealth, and that, as a result of this discussion, the duty mav be eliminated.",34
237,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Riverina) [4-43J-Before a division is taken, I wish to offer that a few remarks in . reply to several honourable members. . The honourable memupon ber for Flinders went so far as to assert that no one could the deny that the fodder duties were only operative in a time of severe .stress-that is, during a drought. I interjected that I exfor one did not subscribe to that view, and similar interjections were made. As a matter of fact, I'he duties are operative at the very, time when the honourable member declared that they were not. Let me cite one instance to prove my contention. We are now dealing with a duty on hay and if chaff only. We have dealt with the duties to on all kinds of cereals and root crops as .fodder for stock, and there is no opportuare nity of reconsidering our decisions on one cereals. Stock-owners of all classes know that cereals are used very largely for keeping stock alive. .' Dairy farmers know that it is very much more profitable to use cereals and root crops for their herds than to give them dry fodder. Prior to Fedee ration, New South Wales was the one State into which fodder of all kinds could In Victoria there was a'duty of 2s. per bushel on andwheat. The result was that wheat was imported from California and landed in the stores at Sydney for ios. per ton-that is less than one-half of the price which the local farmer would have to pay for the carriage of his produce to the metropolitan markets. And what happened in New South Wales would, happen throughout the Commonwealth if its ports were thrown open to the world in that respect.",34
238,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Cereals , not chaff.",35
239,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,It ' applies to all kinds of fodder.,35
240,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,'No .,35
241,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Well , my experience is different from that of my honourable friend. To my personal knowledge chaff and compressed'fodder have been dumped upon the wharfs of Sydney from New Zealand, Argentina, and California. The effect of those importations on,the local market for cereals' was that the millers withdrew their country buyers, snapped their fingers at the farmers of New South Wales, and said to them, "" We will not buy your wheat unless you accept our price, because we can buy wheat abroad at so much less than you want, and the sea carriage costs 50 per cent, less than the land carriage."" - In normal times the duties on fodder do affect, and beneficially affect, the local producers. Some honourable members appear to think only one class of the commuir'ty is suffering-the pastoralistsand that the farmers are going to rob them. Now it is the farmers who are suffering today, and it is for them. I am pleading with honourable members.'",35
242,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,We will vote with the honourable member if he will allow a division to be taken.,35
243,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,The honourable member will - not get any more votes by speaking - and whilst there a paddock was pointed,35
244,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"No ; he may get fewer votes. ' . . -- Mr CHANTER - Whilst there are some honourable members who are sincerely supporting my amendment, there are others who are only supporting it 'for the purpose of destroying the duty afterwards..",35
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Hear , hear. - Mr CHANTER - That is honest. want honourable members generally to understand what is sought to be done. I claim the votes of those who think that it is better to. suspend the duty for six months than not at all. I ask them to stand by me and to resist the attempt to repeal the duty. I desire to remove one impression [3751- 2 which the honourable member for Flinders left by his speech, and I am glad that the honourable member for Gippsland is here to corroborate my statement. There is a strong sympathetic feeling between the farmers of Gippsland and those of the mallee country. Why ? It was because the Gippsland farmers having been vis'ited by a disastrous fire, which practically destroyed their homesteads, the Wimmera farmers extended them a helping hand by saying to them, "" Send us along your stock, and we will provide it with grass until you recover from the effects of the calamity which now affects you."" As a result, when the - Mallee farmers in their turn were suffering from a severe drought, the farmers of Gippsland extended to them reciprocal treatment. . That period; however, has passed. Can the honourable member for Flinders point to a single individual in Victoria who has provided free grass for starving stock this year? ' Mr HEDGES' - Ha d the farmers here the grass to give? . Mr CHANTER - Yes .  vide free grass?",35
246,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"At least it would show humanity on their part.  provide free ,grass ?",35
247,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I'a m merely replying to the statement of the honourable membeT for Flinders that there was no necessity to suspend the operation of this duty, because those who possessed stock but had no grass were always invited by those who had grass to place their starving stock upon it. As a matter of fact, I was in Gippsland during the early, portion of this year-the honourable member for Gippsland is in a position to vouch for the accuracy of my statement out to me which was under lease for six months to a Riverina grazier who was paying 30s. fin acre for it. Everybody knows that extremely high prices are being asked for the use of such paddocks.' Only last week I was interviewed in the parliamentary buildings by a ruined dairy farmer, who informed me that, after having paid I for a considerable. period the sum of £ 8 per ton for chaff with which to feed his 100 head of dairy cattle, which had cost him £ 6 each, he was obliged to put them in the saleyards, where they .'realized only 25s. per head. I recognise that the members of the Opposition intend to support my amendment, but I am sorry that I shall receive only .their temporary assistance, inasmuch as they subsequently intend to vote in favour of placing hay and chaff upon the free list for all time.",35
248,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Franklin) [4.55]- I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Riverina. I frankly confess that I am unable to see that a duty upon hay and chaff ever becomes operative. During the past six months these articles have been free of duty, and yet not a ton of them has been imported. But this Parliament, having deliberately adopted a policy of protection!, it should be applied fairly all round. We have piled up duties upon almost every article usedby the farmer, and I do not see how we can consistently refuse tQ sanction the imposition of a duty upon hay and chaff. Of course, we all recognise that in ordinary years such a duty will be entirely iiiopera-tive. But, when a drought comes along, I do not think that we ought to give the primary producers in one State an advantage which in some cases leads to the absolute impoverishment of farmers in other States. The claim of the honourable member for Riverina, that there is one portion Of Australia, suffering from a drought, whose special requirements ought to be met, is, I think, a fair onfe.

I understand that some honourable memlsers think it is wise to suspend the operation of a. duty upon these commodities for a period of six months. I sliould like to know why it is wise to adopt that course ? .,36
250,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,The honourable member should think it out for himself.,36
251,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I should like the honourable member's intelligence to render me a little assistance.,36
252,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,It would do the honourable member good.,36
253,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The honourable memher was anxious to susnend the operation of a 'duty upon hay and chaff for a period of six months. To be consistent, therefore, he must now vote in favour of placing these commodities upon the free list.",36
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,He supported proposal of the honourable member for Riverina merely as a compromise.,36
255,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Do . I understand that honourable members arrive at compromises outside of this chamber without explaining to their constituents the bases upon which those compromises rest? If the principle be good that a duty should not be collected upon hay and chaff for six months,36
256,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,In normal times a duty has to be paid upon them.,36
257,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"In normal times, \yhen we are producing more hay and chaff than we require, it is right to levy a duty upon those commodities? There will certainly be no imports then !",36
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,There are no imports now.,36
259,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Then why does the right honourable member wish to impose a duty upon hay and chaff?,36
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,To encourage production.,36
261,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,This is - one of those occasions when an innocent member like myself has his intelligence strained to the utmost in an endeavour to follow the compromise arrived at. I cannot understand it .,36
262,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"That is not our fault. Mr K ' ELLY - I am sure that it is not. I cannot be expected to follow the honourable member along the tortuous path by which he reached his compromises! If it be a good thing to suspend the operation of a duty for six months, would it not be equally ' a good thing to suspend its operation entirely? Irrespective of what action honourable members may take in accordance with some compromise, of the terms of which I am not cognisant, I wish to say that a majority of this Committee is opposed to the duty which it is now proposed to levy upon hay and chaff.",36
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Upon a previous occasion there was a majority"" of only one against the proposal.",36
264,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"U p o n that occasion there was a majority of four against it , and there is a larger majority now.",36
265,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"But the whole of the absent members of the Committee were not "" paired "" upon a previous occasion.",36
266,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"That is quite true. There were five members absent who were not paired, four of whom would have voted in favour of placing hay and chaff upon the free list. If , upon that occasion, there were a majority of four members in favour the of the adoption of that course, that number has increased to eight or nine now - Upon a auestion of this kind-seein g that we definitely know the opinions of honourable members-it is only fair that every absentee should be ""paired."" I ara. sure that in these democratic days, honourable members gains. do not wish to take advantage of the difficulties which occasionally result in some honourable members being absent unpaired to sneak through something which is not in accord with the expressed opinions the majority.",36
267,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"It is the duty of honorpairs, able members to be here.",37
268,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I quite agree with the honourable member. But, at the present time, we are more concerned with what the will of the people.",37
269,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,This House will express the will of the people.,37
270,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Seeing that proper notice has been given of the .business to be conproposal sidered, it cannot be urged that the prowill posal to levy a duty upon these commodiI ties is being ""sneaked through.""",37

272,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"They knew that there was to be no other business but the confered, sideration of the Senate's requests Customs Tariff Bill.",37
273,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"My point is that there is a majority opposed to a duty on hay and chaff, and while it may be considered smart to refuse to pair up the whole Committee, it is not the kind of thing I care to be mixed up in. On important questions whole Committee should be paired, views of honourable members can. be ascertained.",37
274,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Who is to blame ? The honourable member must not expect members who are here to stand out. . Mr KELLY - I have on several occawhole sions stood out to pair with an absent member whose opinion I knew. I did so to facilitate the true expression of the will of the people.,37

281,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The honourable member occasionally does not keep his bargains, though he often makes them. If he suspects that I have the numbers, let it be of proved by pairing up the whole Committee. I cannot understand his action in refusing unless it be due to & determination to sneak through this duty, notwithstanding the popular objection to it. If Ministers take advantage of the temporary abis sence of some honourable members, they must salve their own consciences. I give them warning that this is not the last that will be heardof the matter, but that the - question will be tested again later, on a to recommit.

If the division about to be taken is lost, another opportunity will be made to secure the true expression of the will of the people on this proposal. the Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Le t it go. if the Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [5.10] - It Ms all very well for the Treasurer to say "" Let it go "" ; I wish to protest' agaanst the action of the Government in treating us scurvily in the matter of pairs. The fact is that the Committee as a is opposed to the duty, but, owing, to unfortunate circumstances beyond control, the vote about to be taken is likely to go in favour of the. Government. Therefore I , for one, shall not be content with the result, and intend to take advantage of a subsequent occasion to. ascertain the mind of the Committee. There are six or seven members away, for whom This is scurvy treatment from members who me live in or close to Melbourne, seeing that many other members have to travel thousands of miles to get here. Incidents this make one wish that Parliament was meeting fur from Melbourne, so that members would have to share alike the inconvenience of travelling long distances from their homes to attend' its sittings. They would then have to meet us in a fairer spirit.",37
285,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"West Sydney) [5.14] I regret that I was not present to vote against the proposal.of the honourable member for Riverina to postpone the operation of the duty until November. It was most illogical for him to ask for a postponement of .the duty merely because there is now a drought in the Riverina. A short time hence there may be a drought elsewhere. Either there should be no duty, or a dury should be imposed at once; as in the case of other articles. At the present time, owing to the recent bountiful rains arid .warm ..weather,' abundance of fodder is obtainableon the New South Wales coast, the people there having,, not only enough for then: own requirements, but also plenty to sell. The honourable member for Riverina, however, objects to them making a fair profit by selling to his constituents, and has proposed the postponement of the operation of the .duty until November, by which time he hopes that Providence, which is apparentlv overlooking his district now, will have sent ' rain there. I emphatically protest against this postponement. The proposal to make hay and chaff dutiable is absurd, - because any duty can operate only at the expense of pastoralists and dairymen who are suffering by reason of drought'. The proposed duty, if operative at all, will be operative in favour of, perhaps, one State when some, or perhaps all, of the others are suffering. The Minister might fairly' take up a more liberal attitude. It is upon the pastoral and agricultural industries that the prosperity of this country is becoming more and more dependent. Every year the amount of capital invested in dairying is increasing, and it is impossible to make dairying pay during periods of drought in the face of high fodder duties. Tlio recent experience of Sydney is that scarcity of fodder increases the price of milk to the people. If those wbo are opposed to the duty are defeated on this occasion, and a recommittal is moved for, I shall vote-for it Question-That the requested amendment, as modified, making the duty on Hay and Chaff, per cwt., is., on and after ist November, 1908 (item 6-j), be made-put .

419,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,My information was gained direct from a manufacturer. The gentleman who supplied it to me may be absolutely relied upon.,48

421,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I believe it to be an 2-acre block? absolute fact that it takes 2 lbs. of mustard seed to manufacture 1 lb. of mustard. The duty on: the mustard seed is therefore valent to i d . per lb. upon the manufac-tured article, and the proposal of the Senate, that we should extend a preference of i d . per lb. to Great Britain in addition, would have the effect of practically wiping out the protection afforded to this industry. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will refuse to agree to the request of the . Mr FAIRBAIRN (Fawkner) [8.5] - do hope that the Treasurer will not agree the request of the Senate. In this case, question of preference does not enter into consideration, because the value of the mustard imported' from the United Kingshown dom is ^41,445, whereas tihe value of that imported from other countries totals only",48
422,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Thos e figures show that we can here grant the United Kingdom substantial preference. ' Mr FAIRBAIRN - They simply show that Great Britain already possesses the self. whole of the trade. ..,48
423,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"We 'want her have it . - I Mr FAIRBAIRN - It is perfectly hopeless to argue with the honourable member. Mustard seed-Vvhic h is the raw maof this industry-wa s formerly admitted free, but under this Tariff it has been made dutiable at £d. per lb. As it it takes 2 lbs. of seed to manufacture 1 lb. of mustard, it follows that the cost of production has been increased by i d . per lb It is only fair, therefore, that we should increase the duty which was formerly the operative upon the manufactured article 2d. to. 3d. per lb.

424,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"New England) [8.8] - I . appeal to honourable members to reject the request of the Senate. . I hold that we should do our best to encourage small insay dustries, such as mustard-growing and the of herbs,' in which men upon small areas can succeed. If we wish to attract population, surely we must look after, the interests of the man upon the 2-acre block as well as those of the individual upon the 2,000-acre block.",48
425,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,How would the honourable member like to grow mustard seed upon a,48
426,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"As the honourable member is so dense, I may tell him. that when equiI said a 2-acre block I meant anything from a 2-acre block to a 100-acre block.",48
427,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Wentworth) [8.10] - I understand that there is some principle of vital interest involved in the question of the duty upon mustard. Apparently the whole important principle of preferential trade rests upon it. The chief contention of the Senate. honourable member for New England was I that small interests, demanded considerato tion if they were to thrive. If he applies the that doctrine in the present instance, he must vote in favour of extending a preference to the United Kingdom. It has been that, the imports of mustard from foreign countries are exceedingly small, and if the honourable member is prepared to encourage such imports by refusing to grant a preference to"" Great Britain, they will eventually assume quite as large dimensions a as those from Great Britain.",48
428,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I am. looking after Australia. The Britisher can look after him,48
429,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"If honourable members to are voting for preferential trade upon that principle, I have nothing more to say. ' Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [8.14] - The argument of the honourable member for Wentworth, in this case, completely falls to the ground, because the principle of preferential trade should .be applied only in cases where the importations from Great Britain have been, or are likely' to be, superseded by those from foreign countries. In the present instance, the United Kingdom already commands practically the whole of the trade, so that the principle of preferential trada is not involved.

430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,There is trouble about' that resolution.,49
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,A resolution to the 3° same effect was passed after the Tariff had been dealt with in the case of the 1902 Tariff.,49
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I reay inform AYES. honourable members that I have taken the trouble to consult the Comptroller-General today in reference to the matter. He has taken advice, and has given me his opinion. The Comptroller-General's opinion is that the resolution! passed last night is absoStorrer. D. lutely correct, and that there will be no trouble whatever. ' I have received the following memorandumfrom the Comptroller-GeneralThe practice invariably followed has been to commence charging duty on any article directly the rate of such duty has been approved by the House of Representatives (and when under the States, by the lower House). The position is no different when such rate NOES. has been fixed on a request or suggestion of the Senate. The reason why the House of Representatives fixes a rate does not affect the question. The latter, following constitutional practice, fixes the rate, which 'is at once charged, unless expressly - stated to the contrary in the resolution. The position is the same as when an item is PAIRS. recommitted. The House, in the latter case, originally fixes a rate, which becomes immediately operative. The item is then recommitted, and (say) a new rate fixed. The latter then becomes operative at once. The action in both cases, i.e., request by the Senate and recommittal by the House of Representatives, itself; seems synonymous, and the practice snould logically be the same in both cases, and, as a matter of fact, is so. The resolution passed last night, viz "" That the date of any amendment shall be the date of its being made by the Committee,"" .is a direction that the date of each amendment shall be inserted under each item amended, and thus wil l be in compliance with .section s of the Bill. The schedule when thus completed is printed with the dates inserted, and on becoming law no legal question can arise on the point. The position is not altered by the House of Representatives accepting any suggestion, with modifications. I asked the Comptroller-General this morning to make the matter thoroughly clear. T know that he' consulted the Crown Law officers, and he afterwards wrote the memorandum which I have read. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [8.25] - I am afraid that the .Treasurer has not caught the point of the criticism. The memorandum which he has, read does Committee. not touch the difficulty that has been raised in relation to those duties which are fixed for a period ahead. which we passed last night reads- r That the date of any amendmentshall date of its being made by the Committee; not the date attached to any particular duty, but the date when the amendment is made by the Committee. That distinction. We have, therefore, passed a resolution which provides that a duty shall become operative the moment ment is made by the Committee.",49
433,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Unles s it is othersurer) wise stated ,50
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,The resolution does not say so at. all - Sir SirW ILLIAM LYNE - That is what the Comptroller-General savs.,50
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,The Compinto operation troller-General cannot read into the resolution more. than it states.,50

438,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"We have not the slightest idea of what the question is. Mr JOSEP H "" COOK - The position is - this : We are now engaged in fixing dates ahead as to ' when these duties shall begraph :come operative.",50
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,We have not tered-the last item.,50
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,But the Minister is proposing to alter the one before us.,50
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"No , Perhaps it was a mistake for me to read the Comptroller-General's memorandum at all. The officers who are advising me did not know that I had consulted him in reference to the matter.",50
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The Comptroller-General's memorandum does not clear up the difficulty. What he says is quite right, where a duty is fixed to become immediately operative. The difficulty arises when we determine that the date when a duty shall be operative shall be, not immediately, but some time ahead. The governing resolution which we passed last night provides that the duty shall commence from the date of an amendment (Parramatta) being, made by the Committee; not the date which is fixed by 'the Committee, but the date of the amendment being made by the That is the difference. I m mediately after passing that resolution, we proceeded in several cases to fix dates for The resolution the operation of duties' three or six months ahead - What we are now doing is in be the direct conflict with the resolution we passed last night.",50
443,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The Comptroller General touches on that very point, and is the says that it is not so.",50

LYNE (Hume-Trea [8.29].'- I think that the memorandum of the Comptroller-General which I have read is quite clear.

446,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Trea surer) [8.37] - The amendment requested by the Senate, in this case, would, if made, ' be attended by very serious, consequences. With a duty bf 3s. ad. per central on uncleaned rice, it would pay rice merchants fo import cleaned rice under a duty of Atkinson, L . 4s. 3d. per central rather than to import Cook, Joseph uncleaned rice at 3s. 4d. per central and clean it here. One hundred pounds of unKelly, W. H . cleaned rice yields 70 lbs. of cleaned rice, Sinclair, H . the balance being waste and rice meal. The duty of 3s. 4d. per' central on uncleaned rice would, therefore, apply to the Watson, 70 lbs. of cleaned rice obtained from that Kingston, C. C. quantity, and would be equal to 4s. 9d. Gioom, L . E. on 100. lbs. of cleaned rice, or 6d. per Webster, W. central more than the Senate's proposal in Frazer, C. E. respect of imported cleaned rice.

450,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,' I think the honourable member is wrong. The duty would operate only if the packing were done elsewhere.,52
451,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"The in tention of the Committee in agreeing tcr the item originally was to insure that the ing of tea in i - l b. and J-lb. packets should be clone in the Commonwealth. Some tea form. has always been imported to Australia in 10-lb. and ""20-lb. boxes of wood lined.with lead. These are not ordinary packets, such as are the i - l b. and J-lb. packets, which it imported. was intended to make dutiable if imported from abroad - boxes of tea.",52
452,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Is it not a fact that the packing of tea in the boxes to which the origin ? honourable member refers is done to preserve its flavour? . . Mr DUGALD THOMSON course, the less tea is exposed the better. The trade done in packing tea in monwealth is not affected by the importation of tea in these 10-lb. ancl 20-lb. boxes. The tea packed.in Australia is tea imported in bulk, in 40, 60, and 80-lb. chests. It is packed in i - l b. and J-lb. packets, not generally in boxes containing 10 lbs. 20 lbs.",52
453,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Did the Committee, when previously considering 'the item, divide upon it?",52
454,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"There was a division on the item, but -1 do not know whether there was a division as the weight of the packets. The 10-lh. and 20-lb. boxes of tea to which I refer will continue to be imported, because tea is rement of duty under this item ? quired packed in that form. On that tea the consumers will have to pay the duty of i d . per lb., so that we are really imposing a duty on tea, whilst professing that we have no wish to do so. Mr HUTCHISON:-Canno t tea be packed here in the weights to which the honourable memberrefers ?",52
455,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"We could also pack tea here in chests and half chests, but' to impose a duty on tea imported in chests and half chests would be about the same as a universal duty upon tea. So far as I am",52

I think the duties I have proposed n or as a modification of the Senate's request Mr. JOSEPH Cook - How can the Treasurer say that, since he has told us he . I . "" be inknows nothing of the subject?-'",54
488,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"It is true I do wear corset's, but I .have given honourable val. (Genemembers the information I have on the matter. ' ' Mr MALONEY (Melbourne) [9.18] - I hope the Committee, will not agree to the the motion of the Treasurer. If the honourable. gentleman had made any inquiries from' of the Department, and others, he would have found that corsets, in the proper sense of the word, are not made in the 'Australia. The so-called very low-priced corsets made here are really not corsets, but are what are known as "" ribbon band stays,"" which any clever girl, with Corsets, in the proper sense of the word, are the result of the labours of gene-, rations of workers, particularly in France, which country this industry is most closely associated. I presume that the Treasurer refers to Mr White, the manufacturer in Sydney, as having had to close (United his works. It has been said that Mr. White had a thriving industry, and, while I wish that were the factj the - newspapers the last few days tell' us that he has imvoluntarily sequestrated his estate. Sir'- WILLIAM LYNE - Because there is informed not an adequate duty. . Mr MALONEY - That is not the reason. Fashions change, and, as they change, the figures of women are moulded by the kind of corsets used. Four or five years ago there was a change in the fashion, and large stocks of the older sort were left in the various warehouses, and had to be got rid of somehow. Mr White, I am credibly informed, purchased large quantities of those stays at a minimum of cost, and altered them for the market by removing the bones and steel, shortening them, and so forth. That was altering and mending, not making corsets. It was stated that something like 365 hands were employed in the factories in New South Wales, but that is absolute rubbish. In 1905, under a Tariff of 25 per cent., which"", with costs and charges, ran up to about 40 per cent., there were, four makers in Victoria, employing forty-four workers, and making stays at from £ 2 2s. to ,£15 15s. I am endeavouring to obtain a lower duty so that the wives and daughters of the workers will not be continually made to pay a higher price. With the active work which they do, their stays will not last so long as would higher-priced pairs made to order. They purchase stays at 2s. n d . The existing duty has raised that price to 3s. 6d. That class of article wears out very much quicker, owing to the amount of stooping necessitated by constant house work. I am perfectly certain that the average stays made by Madame Masseran will run to £ 3 3s. or £ 4 4s., and up to £ 1 0 ios. and £12 12s. per pair, according to order. With suspenders added, the cost would be even more. It is impossible for the wife of a worker to obtain a garment of that kind. The makers of Such high-priced articles would not care if a duty of even'200 or 300 per cent, were imposed, because their customers would obtain them from them no matter what the duty was. I have a friend who has lived in England for the last eight years, and who still orders his boots from Collins-stireet, simply because the Melbourne maker suits his requirements, and makes to his order. I was informed that Madame Masseran has clients travelling on the Continent who send to her for their stays, as she has their measure. In Bourke-street ribbon band stays can be purchased for is. 1 id., but they are simply bands of ribbon which any girl with a proper machine can make. They are not corsets. The making of corsets seems to have gone entirely into the hands of the French. America, ' when its population was 30,000,000, endeavoured to establish .the industry. It made no mistake about the duty, for it charged no less than 60. per cent. After considerable loss of time and money the industry was established when that wonderful increase of population that has distinguished America took place. It was aided by the quick transit between America and European ports, and by the natural acumen and ability of the American manufacturer, who will select his workmen from any part of the world, and take them to where he wants them. But when an American proprietary company endeavoured to start, and laid down .works and machinery at Plymouth, in England, they found the greatest difficulty in'educating the supposed highly trained English workmen. It is acknowledged throughout the world that this work is a specialty, oftentimes running through generations of one family, and France seems to hold the key to it. When in Brisbane during - the recent election, I made inquiries about the matter. The managing director of Messrs. Finney, Isles, and Ca.,- a very large firm, who is a personal friend of my own, assured me that they made corsets only at from 35s. That gentleman is perhaps one of the keenest business men in Australia. He added that corsets used in surgery were made by them, some at a lower and some at a higher price. This duty is purely a revenue one, and I , as a protectionist, object to it. If there was a chance of these articles being manufactured here, I should vote for a protective duty. If the Government honestly intend to encourage the industry, they should start a Government factory, and then, people would know that the prices would be according to sample. The Treasurer cannot look, me in the eyes and say that this is anything but a revenue duty. Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-Yes , it is.",54
489,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"If America, with a population of 30,000,000, could not make the industry ""a success until the population increased still further,' and skilled workmen were brought over, how can the honourable member expect it to succeed in Australia, with only 4,000,000 people? I ask him to avoid any - further delay by accepting the Senate's request. Although I think that these articles ought to be admitted free, I am willing to accept that as a compromise. Mr - MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [97]-- I thought that the Treasurer, out 2 of his kindness of heart, would concede this point. But I see that he is still bar of iron, or a Roman father, and will not give in. I may be charged with hood. slipping on stays. The moment a protectionist objects to a duty, he is told that he is slipping. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne, that this simply a revenue duty. make these articles free, but I ' will taking that step. The corsets manufacafraid tured here are high priced. that the Treasurer has been misinformed in regard to a firm in Sydney, making for 3s. 6d. The whiteworkers tralia are paid low enough as it is. this trade they must be paid still lower those prices, out of which it would be possible, considering the amount of work that would have to be done, to pay a living wage. Seeing that there is no sibility of the greater number of these articles being manufactured here, the ComSenate's request? mittee should agree to-the Senate's request. Honourable members who are protectionists cannot possibly be charged with abandonopen ing protection by taking that cause this is. simply a revenue, and not a protective, duty.  know very little about this subject, and, therefore, I speak with the greater freedom.

As honourable members will recollect, for some days before the vote took pla'ce on this very important item there was a good deal of discussion amongst honourable members on all sides, as to the rate ' of duty which shouldultimately be adopted.

The honourable member for Wimmera was among the number. I must confess that I do not remember any Minister stating that the Government were prepared to accept a reduction to 35 per cent., biit such an impression got abroad, and my recollection is fortified by the fact that immediately, after the amendment moved by the honourable member for Corangamite had been lost, a proposal that the duty under the general Tariff be reduced to 35 per cent, was agreed to on the voices.

581,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I to do so.,61
582,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,If the Government had such an intention,61
583,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I had at the no such intention.,61
584,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"If it was the intention of the Government to ask the Senate to request this House to restore the old duty, they should have intimated that intention and have called for a division.",61
585,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I slightest intention or thought at the time of doing so.,61
586,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,We can determine what were the honourable gentleman's . thoughts only by his actions.,61
587,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Then able member now says that he will not accept my word. I cast back that statement, and sav that I do not believe his word.",61
588,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I am not bound to say whether I believe, or do.not believe, the honourable member's words; I say that I judge his intentions only by his acts. It was undoubtedly conveyed to the minds of many honourable members who voted as I did that the Government would accept a reduction of the duty to 35 per cent., as proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne, as a compromise between the various conflicting views.",61
589,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Angas) [10.5] - I propose"" to refer, not to any understanding entered into, but to the fact that it is not in accord with the spirit of the Constitution for the Treasurer to support any request by the Senate to increase duties passed by this House. The Constitution not only provides that the Senate may not honourable amend Bills dealing with taxation, but contains an express provision against its so amending any Bill as to increase a burden or charge upon . the people. The Senate is entitled to make suggestions, but we should have some ruling for our guidance. Taking the wording of the Constitution for my guidance, I think it is almost 'incumbent upon the 1 Treasurer to ask the Committee to refuse to agree to requests by the Senate for increased duties. Only a Minister may propose these additions. Take the case of a State having twenty or twenty-five representatives in this House, eighteen or nineteen of whom are free-traders. Is the will of the people of that State expressed by those eighteen or nineteen representatives in this House, or by two or three of their representatives in another place? It would did not intend be absurd if the rates of duty were to be determined by the views of three or four members of another place, who cannot possibly represent the masses of the people of time the larger States: In imposing Customs duties, we are dealing with matters affecting the people in the mass. These views certainly influence me. We are entitled, having regard to section 53 of the Constitution,"" to pay a good deal of respect to requests by the Senate that duties be had not the decreased; but there is an express prohibition against the Senate so amending Bills as to increase a burden or charge upon the people. Taking that as my guide as to what requests we ought to accept, I think we should vote against every request to in the honorcrease the duties in the schedule as passed by this House.",61
590,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Swan) [10.8] The proposal to restore the duty under the general Tariff to 40 per cent, would not be in keeping with the duty under the general Tariff on item 106, which the Government proposed should be 45 per cent. The duty under the general Tariff, on item 106, was reduced from 45 per cent, to 40 per cent., and to 35 per cent, in the case of imports from the United Kingdom. A corresponding reduction of 5 per cent, in the duties under item 107 was then made.",61
591,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,And also because there were higher import duties on woollens.,62
592,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"Quite so. By that reduction the' difference proposed by the Government between the duties on items 106 and 107 was preserved. There is no doubt that the Government agreed to that arrangement, and I certainly think it is unpeople. precedented for the Government to have one opinion in this House and another in the Senate. I also agree with the honourable member for Angas that it is monstrous that we should be considering requests by. the Senate for increased duties. I argued_this point yesterday, and I think that the honourable member for Angas has strengthened my contention. The honourable member has discussed the question raised by me from another and very important point of view. Allowing that the Senate has the right to submit requests for increases .of the burdens of the people-whic h I do not admit for a moment, - although Mr Speaker has ruled that the Senate has. that right-iher e is nio reason whatever why this House should accept such requests. ' Honourable members of this House should maintain its privilege to alone possess the right to impose burdens upon the people. .",62
593,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,Why did not the honourable gentleman object to the Speaker's ruling?,62
594,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"It has not been my custom hitherto, and I shall not begin now, to question a ruling of the Speaker.",62
595,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,The honourable gentleman is doing so now.,62
596,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I am merely expressing my personal opinion. Perhaps the honourable member for Bass will give expression to his directly if he has any. Admitting that the Senate has the right to submit requests for increases of duties, I submit that this House will be foregoing its O'Malley, King rights and privileges if it agrees to any requests by the Senate for increases of the burdens on the people.",62
597,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable gentleman in order in discussing in the way he is doing the powers of the Senate in this matter after the ruling given by the Speaker yesterday ?,62
598,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,I point out that in Committee we 'are not supposed to know what is done in the House. The right honourable member for Swan has been quite in order in what he has said.,62
599,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND STATES,"I submit that this House should' maintain its rights and privileges as the only body entitled to impose increased burdens on the people - I am surprised at the action taken by the Government in ignoring the right of this House to be the sole' authority invested with the power to impose burdens on the Question-That the requested amendment making the duties (General Tariff) 40 per cent.

600,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"Boothby) [10.20]. - I should like the Minister to move the insertion, after the word "" flour,"" of the words "" salt, gypsum, and manure."" That would allow of the free importation, not of bags, which are made in the Commonwealth, but of sacks, which are imported. There was some confusion in regard to the matter, and the Minister agreed to have things set right in the Senate. was not done. It is impossible to prevent the use .as salt, gypsum, and manure Bags, of corn sacks, which can be imported free, and therefore we might as well allow sacks to be imported specifically for such use.",63
601,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,"Melbourne Ports)' [10.22] - I support the honourable member's request. I am sure that the Committee does not wish to do an injustice, and. therefore point out that manure imported in bags is admitted free, including the bags. As no protection is given to the local manufacturers.of manure, they should not be put on a worse footing than the importers by being made to pay duty on their bags.",63
602,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,Wide Bay) [10.23J - M v recollection is that the decision come to by the Committee on this matter was a deliberate one. . .,63
603,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"That was in regard to bags, not sacks.",63
604,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,-The point is that it is desirable that sacks should be made here.,63
605,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,Then why sacks and sugar sacks as well?,63
606,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"I should be ready to vote against the free admission of sugar sacks. In my opinion, too many things which can be made here are being admitted free.",63
607,Mr BAMFORD,PAIRS,"As we have allowed other bags to be admitted free, why not sugar bags?",63
608,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"I admit, that there is no good reason for differentiating at this stage.",63
609,Mr STORRER,PAIRS,"Bass) [10.25] - When .the item was first dealt with, a vote was come to hurriedly,' and next morning it was found that a mistake had been made, and that the decision of the Committee was likely to injure those engaged in'the manufacture of bags. Consequently there was a recommittal, and an alteration was made.",63
610,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAIRS,"It was_ intended to make the alteration in respect' to ) pro- bags, not in respect to sacks. . Mr STORRER - Sample s were shown here, .and no one could tell the difference.",63
611,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"It was said that there was no objection to the free admission of sacks, though the free admission of bags was objected to.",63
612,Mr STORRER,PAIRS,"We should adhere to our decision, and not make the amendment requested by' the Senate.",63
613,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAIRS,I rise to a point of order. The proposal of the honourable But that member for Boothby,63
614,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,No proposal is before the Chair.,63
615,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAIRS,"I submit that effect cannot be given to the honourable member's suggestion-. The Senate has power fo request by message the omission or amendment of any item or .provision, and the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make or refuse to make any such omission or ..amendment, with or without modification. The proposal to insert a number of articles not referred to in the Senate's request is not within the powerof the Committee or indeed this House to consider.",63
616,Mr MAHON,PAIRS,"I was going to raise a similar point. The only amendment' requested by the Senate is the insertion of the word ""sugar,"" and I contend that we should confine ourselves to the consideration of that request.",63
617,Mr GLYNN,PAIRS,"I understand that the honnot corn orable member for Boothby has asked the Minister to made a modification, in view of an understanding that the matter would be rectified in the Senate.",63
618,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAIRS,He cannot do that.,63
619,Mr GLYNN,PAIRS,I doubt if he can do it in the way suggested; but in considering a request for an amendment Ave can operate on the request as we could operate on an amendment. Mr W. H . . IRVINE - An y modification must be relevant.,63
620,Mr GLYNN,PAIRS,"Yes ; and I admit that-the proposed modification may not be relevant. I do not know, however, whether it might not be relevant to operate on the suggestion by proposing the omission from the word "" sugar "" of all the letters following the initial "" S,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the letters "" alt.""",63
621,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"Boothby) [10.29]. - - In order to test the matter,' I move.That the modification "" But that the words ' Salt, Gypsum and Manure' beinserted after the word ' Flour' "" be added. In the first instance, salt,' gypsum, and manure bags and sacks were made free. Then the local bag manufacturers got to work, and on it being shown that bags were made in Australia, the decision was reversed. On the second recommittal; the Committee unforunately confused bags with sacks, which are not made here, and that being pointed out, the Government agreed to. have, an alteration made in the Senate.",64
622,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,But there is a duty on the material.,64
623,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"But sacks are quite a 'different matter. At the first division, when this matter was previously before us, the item, including salt, gypsum, and manure bags, was carried in the form in which it appears. The next day it was struck out, but, instead of being struck out altogether, the word "" sacks"" should have taken the place of "" bags."" That was desired by the Committee, and by the bagmakers, who had no objection to offer in reference to the sacks, but took exception particularly to the small hessian and calico bags. If you, Mr Chairman, rule that this modification cannot be moved, we shall have to see whether it cannot be made on recommittal.",64
624,Mr WH IRVINE,PAIRS,"I merely wish to refer to the point of order which has been raised, as it is rather important in the relation of one House to the other. I should be very sorry to urge the Committee to adopt any rule that would unduly curtail our powers. On the other hand, we may be in danger of adopting a rule which would place it in the hands of the Senate, by making some small suggestion, to give us a power of review which the Constitution would not give us if the Senate had not made such a suggestion. The point raised by the right honourable member for Swan is not only important, but I see no answer to it at the present time. The request which comes from the Senate is to include sugar sacks with a number of other sacks in the free list; and all we can do is set forth in the following words in the ConstitutionAnd the House of Representatives may,' if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with, or without modification. We can make the amendment which the Senate requests, or decline to make it, or, if we make it, it may be with modification. The essence of the request is that one particular article shall be included in this particular free list. Could it oe said to be a modification if we replied, ""Yes, we will include sugar sacks, but we will also include a lot of other articles?"" In the next item, for example, there are words "" Blankets (except of Rubber), Blanketing Flannels,"" and so forth. In that item the Senate suggests that the words "" whether plain, fancy or printed "" shall be inserted after "" Flannels.""",64
625,Mr CHANTER,PAIRS,"The range is greater in that case. . Mr W. H. IRVINE - It is only a question of degree. Could we say ""Yes, we accept that suggestion; but we propose to ' strike out the words ""(except of Rubber)"" ? It could not be suggested that we could take such a step. If we could, it would mean that any amendment, no matter how trifling, suggested by the Senate, . would throw open. to us the discussion of everything included in the item, whether relevant to the particular suggestion, or whether a modification of it or not.",64
626,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"Would the honourable member suggest that the striking out of the words "" except of Rubber "" presents a parallel case? Mr WH IRVINE.:- I say it is an extreme case, but we test principles by extreme cases. If the request of the Senate would enable us to include gypsum and manure sacks, it would also entitle us to alter the whole free list and include anything or everything.",64
627,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"The Words ""except of Rubber "" seem to me almost consequential, and not to present so extreme a case as the one we are considering now.",64
628,Mr WH IRVINE,PAIRS,"Perhaps,'that is so, but it is only a difference in degree. It would be rather dangerous to say that the Senate's suggesting an amendment, no matter how insignificant, in any part of the item, gives us the power to re-open a matter which, without such a suggestion, has been absolutely closed.",64
629,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,Anything cognate to sugar sacks could be addedby us.,64
630,Mr WH IRVINE,PAIRS,"Yes ; for instance, even in other items, there might be matters affected by the introduction of the suggested word; and I should say that we would be quite at liberty to deal with them.",65
631,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"For instance, we might provide for sugar sacks certain material.",65
632,Mr WH IRVINE,PAIRS,"Quite so; we must look at the essence of the request, and at the mere form. If the Senate submits suggestion, it is open to us to consider and make what we may regard as legitimate consequential amendments.",65
633,Mr MAHON,PAIRS,"Suppose, , for instance, we provided for sugar sacks used for gypsum or manure.",65
634,Mr WH IRVINE,PAIRS,"Such an amendthere. ment might be held to be relevant. Without going into the merits of the proposal, which I know nothing, it seems to me a item. rather, dangerous precedent to enable the Senate, by request, to give us certain bag. powers we would not otherwise possess.",65
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"There is not only somewhere else in the Tariff. the' question of relevancy to be considered, but also the well-known parliamentary that this Chamber may not revert to any item which has been agreed to by both Houses.",65
636,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,We can modify any amendment the Senate suggests.,65
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Yes , but we cannot introduce new matter in regard to which the Senate has sent no request. This House has already decided to exclude other kinds of sacks, and in the Senate has concurred, and, therefore, I submit that we cannot re-open the matter.",65
638,Mr WH IRVINE,PAIRS,"As an illustration, if we included other items, they could be sent back to us with further suggested amendments. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Yes , and thereby re-open a whole range' of subjects which have, by parliamentary rule, been closed. There must be some finality, and all we do must be in reference to what the Senate has actually, done, which,' in this instance, has been to exclude every other except sugar sacks. This is more than a matter of relevancy. It involves the known parliamentary rule, which has order. existed since time immemorial, and without which there would be no finality, to our debates, or to the consideration of any ject as to which differences of opinion isted. What the honourable member desires would be equivalent to the Senate initiating [376] taxation, which they cannot do. The President of that Chamber ruled distinctly upon that point. He would not permit to be made any requests that would have tht effect of initiating taxation.",65
639,Mr BAMFORD,PAIRS,In the next request they made of a do initiate taxation.,65
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"' That is an not article which has been covered by some other a item in the Tariff. The President laid it, down the rule that new items could not be introduced in the Senate. Their power consists in requesting amendments on items which we have submitted to them.",65
641,Mr CHANTER,PAIRS,loo k at request No. 36. They have initiated .a new proposition,65
642,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,The honourable of member will find that that is not a new,65
643,Mr CHANTER,PAIRS,They have added saddle',65
644,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Saddleba g was The honourable member cannot find salt, gypsum, rule and manure sacks anywhere else in the Tariff, and therefore the proposal of the honourable member for Boothby would be actually introducing new items which it had already been decided by both Houses to exclude from the schedule. If we do that we shall never reach finality. The point raised by the honourable member for Swan is a good one, and must stand as the against the contention of the honourable .that decision member for Boothby.",65
645,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,"I do not pretend to be an authority upon constitutional law or procedure, but I wish to appeal to the Treasurer to remedy an injustice which has certainly been , done to the manure manufacturers. There is no duty upon their finished product, and they have to pay a duty on their bags. ' Other industries, which enjoy the benefit of heavy duties, have free bags. I ask the Treasurer to consider this line of industry, and if there is any method by which he can put these sacks on the freekind of sack list to adopt it.",65
646,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"I have listened carewellfully to the discussion on the point of ' It has only confirmed the opinion . that I held previously. If I were'to allow,, in an item, like this, general amendments subsuch as that suggested by the honourable ex-member for Boothby, we should practically open up the whole Tariff for discussion again.
