As a result of our inquiries, we have, learned that the Gommonwealth Government has no power to interfere in the matter. ""We have endeavoured to come to an arrangement satisfactory to Tasmania, but the matter is one which' comes exclusively within the province of the Victorian Government. UNEMPLOYMENT.

GOMMBNTB BY BlSUOP OT AltlflDALE .",10
6,Mr CURTIN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the report in this morning's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald of an address delivered yesterday by Rev. J. S. Moyes, Bishop of Armidale, to a meeting of St. Peter's Men's Brotherhood at Hamilton? The report readsThe building of industry on production, he continued, had brought the community face to face with « maladministration of finance. No reasonable objection could be mode to interest on capital where borrowing was for production and to increase value. But banking was a technical function for the servico nf the community, and its policy in the end must be dictated by that purpose of service. The demand that banking must be free from outside dictation was only half a truth, and a dangerous half truth at that. The present system of credit and currency was an illogical compromise between old traditions and new needs. Is it the intention of the Government to bring down legislation to prevent the control of banking remaining in the hands of non-legislative bodies?",11
7,Mr LATHAM,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"Is it in order for an honourable member to read an opinion of a private citizen or, indeed, of anybody, .and then frame upon it a question having no reference to the statement made by that person, but merely dealing with the same subject?",11
8,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"Hon. Norman Makin). - It is a common practice for honourable members to preface their questions by reading extracts from reports appearing in newspapers, but their questions must be directed to some phase of the subject covered by the newspaper extract, and have relation to the business of the House. It is not for the Chair to determine how an honourable member is to ask a question provided it conforms to the orders of the House.",11
9,Mr MOGKATH,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"On a point of order,. I understand that when an honourable member asks a question based upon a newspaper report he is required to guarantee the accuracy of the report. Has the honourable member for Premantle (Mr Curtin) done this? Mr SPEAKER,(Hon. Norman Makin). - I ask this honourable member for Premantle whether he accepts responsibility for the accuracy of the report he has just read.",11
10,Mr CURTIN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"I can do so with confidence, having learned from experience to rely upon the accuracy of the reports appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald. '",11
11,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"I have not read the report referred to by the honourable member, but, judging by the extract he quoted, the address seems to have been a very interesting one, and I shall make it my business to read it when I have an opportunity. Regarding the honourable member's question, however, it is not the practice of the Government to announce in advance its policy in reply to questions. ASSISTANCE TO WHEAT GROWERS.",11
12,Mr THOMPSON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"If the Minister for Markets has any difficulty at the forthcoming conference of wheat-growers in coming to a satisfactory arrangement for making direct payments to the farmers, will he, before making any definite agreement, bring the matter before the House so that honourable members may express their opinions?  conference is being called in response to representations from the States. Certain interests have expressed a wish that the Government should hear them upon the matter, and I am holding the conference in order to meet their wishes. I am keeping in mind the fact that one of the most important considerations is to make the payments direct to the growers. Before arrangements are completed, the proposal will have to come before the House-in the f o rm of a hill, and honourable members will have an opportunity of discussing it .  guaranteeing the farmers 3s. a bushel for their wheat was never put into operation because, although passed by both Houses of Parliament, it did not meet with the approval of the Commonwealth Bank, which was to provide the money, will the Minister, at the forthcoming conference in Melbourne, secure the presence of a responsible representative of the Commonwealth Bank, so that any decisions arrived at may be assured of its approval?  conference is being called to determine in what way the sum of £3,000,000 is to be disposed of, and we wish to hear the opinions of those concerned as to how it should be distributed. If it is necessary to confer with the banks, or any one else, that will be done.",11
13,Mr HAWKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"Can the Minister indicate. when the necessary bill will be introduced to provide for the payment of the wheat bounty?  the conference has been held, and finality reached as to the method of payment, I shall take, the earliest opportunity to introduce the bill.",12
14,Mr NAIRN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"Is it not a fact that the £3,000,000 which the banks offered to provide for the assistance of our wheat-farmers, was to be used for the payment of a bounty on wheat exported, and not on general production?  thing that has been done in this matter up to the present has been more in the nature of suggestions than anything else. The matter is not yet finalized. ELECTORAL DISTRIBUTION.",12
15,Mr MACKAY,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"I ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that the proposed redistribution of Commonwealth electoral boundaries has been abandoned, and, if so, will the Minister explain why he has rejected the Commissioners' recommendation ?",12

19,Mr MCGRATH,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"As the Minister for Customs has stated that he has no power to refund the duties paid by those who imported petrol in cases, will he take steps to have the Tariff Bill amended while it is before another place to enable refunds of duty to be made to those petrol importers who were almost ruined when the dutieB, since disallowed by the House, were put into operation?",12
20,Mr FORDE,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"Ful l consideration will be given to any representations in regard to this or other matters, but the honourable member's request will have to be taken in conjunction with similar requests regarding other items on which duties have been reduced. The question arises whether the Government should, out of Consolidated Revenue, make refunds to persons who have paid duties which have since been reduced. That practice has not been followed in the past. CANBERR A FOUNDATIO N STONE.",12
21,Dr MALONEY,SHIPPING FREIGHTS TO THE,"I ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that the foundation stone laid at Canberra by the Prince of Wales has been removed from its original position, and, if so, where it is hidden? Further, was permission refused from England for its removal, and, if so, who was the person who ordered its removal in spite of such refusal?",12

25,Mr SCULLIN,STOCK MORTGAGES IN THE,"The request submitted to the bank by the Premiers Conference included, not only £3,000,000 for the relief of 'wheat-farmers , but also £5,000,000 for the relief of our unemployed. The Government felt that the claim on behalf of the unemployed was as strong as that for the relief of our wheat-farmers. Both sections of the community are very greatly in need of assistance. ""We are still pressing for financial aid for the relief of our unemployed in conjunction with our proposals for the relief of wheatfa rmers. REMONETIZATION OF SILVER,",13
26,Mr WHITE,STOCK MORTGAGES IN THE,"It is stated in today's newspapers that twelve of the thirteen delegations represented at the fourth PanAmerican Conference have approved resolutions calling for an international conference to study the possibility of the rehabilitation of silver.

28,Mr WHITE,STOCK MORTGAGES IN THE,I accept no responsibilitv at all in the matter.,13
29,Mr SPEAKER,STOCK MORTGAGES IN THE,"Then , the honourable member cannot base his question upon the report. Later",13

32,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"Arisin g out of your ruling, Mr Speaker, with regard to a question just asked by the honourable member for Balaclava, I ask the Prime Minister if he will give consideration to the advisableness of amending any standing order which requires that a member asking a question based on a newspaper report, shall go through the formality of professing to vouch for its accuracy, or whether, if there is no such standing order, he will consider the introduction of some rule which will introduce ordinary common sense into our proceedings?",13
33,Mr SCULLIN,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"It is the practice of all Ministers, in answering questions, to endeavour to display common sense. I may add that the-apparent lack of common sense in oue of our standing orders would not have been noticed but for the action of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in directing attention to it.

38,Mr SCULLIN,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"As it is a money bill, it must be initiated in this House. As to the length of the recess, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should be able to assist me in formulating an answer to his inquiry. We shall have to make some estimate of the time which the Senate will occupy in dealing with the tariff, and after consultation I may be able'to give the House some information on the point.

47,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH OIL,"I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that Mr. MCFarlane, an official of the Treasury, has been appointed to the board of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, and, if so, have instructions been given to him to report to the Government with regard to the relation of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited to the major oil com]ianic3 operating in Australia? Also, is he satisfied with the inquiry now being made by two departmental officers, or does he consider it would be better to have a public inquiry so that a searching investigation may be made into the reasons for the present high price of petrol to consumers in Australia ?",14
48,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH OIL,"The Government has, for some time, been very much concerned about the price of petrol in Australia; but we are not in a position to say whether it is or is not too high. all appearances it seems to be very high, but we ai e not well informed upon subject, nor have we been kept aa fully informed as we believe we ought to in have been. For this reason we have to the directorate of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited one of the most reliable and trustworthy officials of the Treasury-and that is saying a great deal, since there are so many highlyqualified and trustworthy officers in that case department-wh o will act as a liaison officer between the Treasury and the to Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited.

In view of the fact that food is cheaper in England, and that our meat is sold there at less than in Australia, that our dried fruits are sold for less in England than in Australia, and that any of our sugar exported to England is sold at a price lower 'than in Australia, is it recognized that men and women seeking to live on 5s. to 7s. per week are suffering in health and stamina? 3.

Likewise, Mr. Tonkin filled a similar post to that sturdy old democrat, Mr C. C. Kingston, when he held office in the Barton Ministry.

60,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill which is of a purely machinery character relates to an excise duty on wine, and will apply to any excise on wine which may be imposed by Parliament. It. is the intention of the Government, at a later date, by an amendment of the excise tariff to provide for a specific duty on wine. It is not proposed, nor is it on wine as such. desirable, at this stage, to indicate what rate of duty will ajpply. In 1930 this .Government appointed the Hon. John Gunn, Director of Development in the Prime Minister's Department, and? Mr R. MCK . Gollan, of the Department of Trade and Customs, to inquire intothe wine industry in the Commonwealth, and to furnish a report.  made available?",16
61,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"I think it has. The question was exhaustively dealt with, and one of the recommendations made in their report was in these termsThat the present method of levying taxation on wine through an excise duty on fortifying spirit be abandoned, and that in its stead an excise duty at the rate of 2s. peT gallon be imposed on fortified wine when the wine is delivered for home consumption. Previous to 1918 the rate of duty on forPAPER, t if y in g spirits was a nominal one, and was imposed so that the amount collected would be sufficient to pay for the services of officers. It was necessary that the mixing of spirit with wine be closely supervised, and every operation was done in the presence of an excise officer. In (No . 2). 1918 the Government was in need of additional revenue, and a duty of 6s. per proof gallon was levied on spirits used in the fortification of wine. W it h the exception of dry sherry, for t if y in g spirit is only used in the manufacture of sweet wines of the port or muscat type. Forti f y in g spirit is not used in the production of dry wines of the claret or hock type. In 1925, in order to assist the growers of Doradillo grape's, the duty was reduced to 5s. so far as spirit made from this class of grapes was concerned. The duty on spirit made from all other classes of grape remained at 6s. per proof gallon. Since 1924 a bounty has been paid on fortified wine exported fro m the Commonwealth with a view to clearing some [3.1]-by of the surplus production. Up to March, 1930, the payment of this bounty was made from the Consolidated Revenue. Owing to the fal l in revenue and the heavy burden which the payment of this bounty placed upon the country, it was decided to ask the industry to pay the bounty.",16
62,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"That bounty was paid in relation to the spirit contents, and not  wine.",16
63,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,It was not strictly on wine as such;,17
64,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"The excise duty was on the fortifying spirit, and about 1 gallon goes to about 5 gallons of wine. The bounty was based on per gallon of wine exported, but a drawback of the duty was allowed on the fortifying spirit contained in the wine.",17
65,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,The whole scheme was based on an excise duty on fortifying spirit.,17
66,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,The excise duty was levied on fortified spirit. We are now providing the machinery to levy an excise duty per gallon of wine instead of on fortifying spirit as formerly. Mr E. RILEY - It will not cost the Commonwealth anything.,17
67,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,No . The Commonwealth will be in a slightly better position than formerly.  considerable policing.,17
68,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"The other system was becoming almost unworkable because of the volume of work that had. to be done in bond. Although this system will require policing, I do not think it will be more difficult than the other system."" Last year this Government was of the opinion that the necessary funds for bounty payments should be provided by the wine industry. The duty on fortifying spirit was then raised hy 5s. per proof gallon, and it was provided that the amount collected at this increased rate should be paid into a trust fund from which payments for bounty would be made. The present rates of duty on fortifying spirit are as follow:Item 2 (.T) (1) Spirit for fortifying Aus(2) Spirit for fortifying Iu 1918, when the duty was levied on fortifying spirit for revenue purposes for the first time it was considered that this form of collecting a tax on wine was as simple as it was efficient. At that time this was so. Later, however, there was a great change in the economic conditions of the wine industry. Returned soldiers were established in vineyards on the river Murray and on the Murrumbidgee irrigation area in New South Wales. When the vines in the river Murray districts in South Australia came into bearing the State Government assisted the settlers to process the grapes by financing the establishment of wineries on a co-operative basis. This led to a surplus production of wine, and caused many difficulties in the industry. out> on fortifying spirit was at that time collected at the time of fortification. The co-operative companies found they were unable to finance the payment of duty ou fortifying spirit at the time it was mixed with the wine. They approached"" the Government with a request to be allowed to fortify the wine in bond, the duty on the fortifying spirit to be collected when the wine was delivered for consumption. Their request was granted. Other wine-makers were soon attracted by tkii> concession, and at the moment nearly all fortification throughout the Commonwealth is carried out in bond. Other concessions followed this arrangement, and ultimately such operations as racking, fining, blending, and other similar operations were allowed to be carried out in bond.",17

This transaction is termed a drawback of duty. It is not possible, however, to arrive at the precise amount of duty which was paid on any particular wine exported. It was necessary in the circumstances to provide for a flat rate of drawback which covered the average fee amount of duty cost of for t if y in g in each gallon of wine. The flat provided as the duty cost of for t if y i the present rate of duty is 2s. 4d. per gallon of wine. In some cases this amount is more than the actual cost. cases the amount is less than the actual cost. There are no less than seven different rates of drawback. They deal with the various rates of duty and with various classes of wine. Rebates on spirit exsold for export? tracted from lees of wine have to be provided for, and the department always been on the lookout forpossible revenue leakages. Referring to this matter in their report, Messrs. Gunn and Gollan saidThese drawbacks, rebates, and remissions relating to wine exported are necessary order that the wine-makers and distillers may receive equitable treatment in having the excise duty already paid returned to them when the wine is shipped overseas. It is very necessary that effective methods adopted to supervise the exact quantity wine dealt with so that ""the correct amounts of drawback^, rebates, and remissions may j;iven. All transactions have, therefore, to IKS carefully scrutinized by officers to make made. certain that the amount of drawbacks, refunds nnd remissions arc properly due. With the removal of the duty on for t i ing spirit as proposed in this bill, there will be no need for drawbacks, rebates, or remissions. This will be a great relief to the department as well as to the winepayment of a fee of £1 a year. maker who finds that the drawback rates do not compensate him.

78,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"That will be dealt with The repreColsentations made by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) on behalf of the growers in the Great Western district will be considered. Provision is made for the licensing of persons who desire to receive and store wine for export. This will enable a merchant who is not a wine-maker, and who has built up an export trade, to prepare and bottle wine, which is subject to excise duty, and ship it overseas. This wil l be a considerable convenience to those who intend to bottle wine for shipment to Canada. Since the Canadian treaty, a trade in bottled wines with Canada has opened up, aud there is every indication that it will assume very large proportions.",18
79,Mr MARRS,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"It is about time, too.",19
80,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"As the honourable member knows, there has always been a dearth of Australian wines in Canada. The consumers there have been accustomed to - drinking the best Prench wines, but soon ""they will be able to obtain Australian champagne. In providing for the payment of duty on wine delivered for home consumption, it is intended that all duty shall accrue at the winery. Payments will be made weekly or monthly, as may be prescribed. The wine-maker will have to keep certain books, which will reveal details of all the wine sent out of the winery, and a penalty of £500 is provided for, should there be any irregularity in the removal of wine from the winery. At the moment there are large stocks of wine containing spirit ou which excise duty has been paid. A quantity of this will be used for home consumption, and a quantity will be blended with newer wiiuis. It is intended that duty will not be again levied on these wines, and provision is made in the bill that if any of it is blended with wines subject to the wine excise duty, a refund will be made. Entries will be required when wine is removed, but an exception is made where a wine-maker wishes to transfer wine from one winery to another when they are both owned by him, also when a wine-maker wishes to transfer wine from his winery to his distillery or his vinegar factory. In order to simplify the procedure in these instances, provision is made so that these transactions may take place under permit. This bill gives to officers certain which are necessary to carry out efficiently grapes for wine-making? the provisions contained in the bill, and to protect properly the revenue. Officers will have access to the premises of sons licensed under the proposed act, and to the books kept by them. They will have power to enter and search premises where there is cause to suspect illicit tices are being carried on. On reasonable suspicion-, they may stop and search vehicles or boats suspected of carrying wine npon which duty has not been paid. They may also seize and secure any wine which they have reason to believe is foris feited. In changing the incidence of taxation on wine, this bill has an important bearing on the wine industry. Previously wine-makers were much hampered in their operations on account, of the restrictions necessary to protect the revenue when fortified wine was manufactured in bond. The part of the winery where this was done had to be kept under lock. Every vat containing this wine had to be securely locked, and nothing could be done excepting in the presence of an officer. An excise duty on wine will give the winemaker absolute freedom in making and preparing wine for home consumption There will be no bonds or locks, the obligation of the wine-maker being the payment of duty on all the wine which it delivered for home consumption, and also properly accounting for the wine which is delivered for any other purpose. Then will be no nece33ity for the presence of an officer when wine is delivered, but thf department will be safeguarded by thtcntries in the wine-makers' books. The provision for duty to be paid weekly will suit the convenience of the wine-maker. Of course, the department will see tha: in this respect all transactions are sufficiently covered by a substantial security. Before proceeding with preparation of the proposals contained in this bill, tin views of representatives of the different interests of those engaged in the wine industry were obtained. In every instance the proposals have been approved, and wine-makers will find that the provision? of this bill are of the simplest kind, there being no unnecessary interference with the main essentials of their indu.siry",19
81,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Hav e the grower? approved of the provisions requiring tbt powers registration of persons who produce *,19
82,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"I have received no objection to the bill from grape-growers perI t is usual in Queensland for sugnrgrowers to register their names, and all tobacco-growers throughout the Commonwealth are required to do so. Similarly, pracgold-producers who benefit under the Gold Bounty Act are called upon to register, and every grape-grower who will benefit from a fixed price should have no objection to the practice; it will involve them in no expense. The wine industry of great importance to Australia, and, with its far-reaching ramifications, the Government would be loth to take any action that would prove injurious to the industry. I am taking this bill to the second-reading stage so that copies of it may be distributed among those concerned in the industry.",19
83,Mr MARRS,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Do they know anything about it?,20
84,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"The wine-makers know that the bill is under consideration. Deputations representing them have waited on me. They are aware of the report presented by the Hon. John Gunn, and our chief excise officer, Mr Gollan, to whom they made their representations. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) introduced a deputation a week ago from the wine-makers of the Western District of Victoria. The industry is familiar with the general principles of the bill, but not with the details, and I am submitting the second reading of the measure in order that the details may be placed before the wine congress, which assembles in Melbourne next Wednesday to consider the bill.",20
85,Mr HAWKER,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Does the Minister expect to pass it through all stages next week ?,20
86,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"It is doubtful if that can be done. There is no extreme urgency in the matter. This measure will make very little difference to the revenue, although it will mean a slight increase.",20
87,Mr HAWKER,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Some time will be required to enable those interested in the industry in parts of South Australia and Western Australia to consider the details of the measure. There would be hardly time for them to comment upon it if it were passed next week.,20
88,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"My present intention is not to push on with the bill next week if there is any desire to delay its passage so that the industry may bave more time to express its opinion on it. The Government does not wish to rush through Parliament a bill that may dislocate trade in some way; I do not think this hill will do so; the broad principles of the measure meet with the general approval of the trade. The only point on which there will be a difference of opinion is the rate of duty .to be charged. That matter is not dealt with in the bill; it merely provides the machinery for the collection of excise duty on wine on a flat rate basis instead of an excise duty on fortifying spirit. Dry wines are not fortified, and no excise is now paid on them.*",20
89,Mr GABB,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Is there any intention to refuse registration to growers? I hope that the object is to prevent new growers; from entering the industry.,20
90,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"There is no such intention at the present time. That matter will be considered when the bill reaches the committee stage. One of the difficulties of the industry is that there is over-production. The State Governments have assisted thousands of persons toproduce grapes for wine-making purposes, and the provision of an export bounty to enable the surplus to be marketed was necessitated. I do not consider it wise to put additional areas under vines for the production of wines that we have been unable to sell.",20
91,Mr GABB,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,I was wondering if the registration was intended to prevent further production. - Mr Forde - No . I am prepared to listen to any arguments that may be advanced in committee; this is not a party measure.,20
92,Mr JONES,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Was it not provided in the Wine Export Bounty Act that the bounty was not to be paid on wine made from grapes grown in vineyards planted after a specified date?,20
93,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"There was a provision to that effect, but in operation it was found almost impossible to police it. The effect of the bill will be to remove the necessity for drawback rebates or remissions, because all wine for export will be delivered free of duty.  must have spoken under a misapprehension when he said a few moments ago, in answer to my interjection, that excise would be collected on all wine, regardless of whether it was exported or not.",20
94,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"I must have misunderstood the honourable member. I can assure him that the standard of wine-making will be raised, because, in the past, the use of fortifying spirit has been restricted on account of the high duty. The use of spirit is necessary in the manufacture of high-class sweet wine of such types as port or muscat, and wine-makers, on account of the abolition of the duty on for t if y in g spirit, will be in a position use the proper quantity of spirit required to make a first quality wine. I i i this way it is considered that the industry will receive substantial benefit. Thore is a tendency today to avoid using for t if y in g spirit, or to use as little of it as possible, and to employ substitutes such a3 concentrated must. to a cheap class of wine, commonly known as "" p in k i e "" , being put on the market in order to avoid paying revenue charges to the Commonwealth. When there is a flat rate of duty at so much per gallon, it will apply to all wines, and there will 'be no inducement to put a cheap and inferior wine on the market in order to avoid the excise duty.",20
95,Mr JONES,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,Will this provision affect both dry and sweet wines?,21
96,Mr FORDE,EINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL,"Thos e details can be reported. considered in connection with the tariff schedule. At the present time there excise dnty on champagne, chablis, claret, sautcrne and porphrey, because there is no for t if y in g spirit in it .",21

It is largely produced in 1 the Hunter Eiver districts of New South Wales, and in the Great Western district of Victoria, and the imposition of a heavy duty per gallon on chablis, which is sold at as low as Is. 6d., and up to 4s. 6d. a for Trade and Customs) bottle, would increase the price substanmovetially. It has been pointed out to me by the growers in the Hunter Eiver district, and in. the Great Western district of Vioalter toria, that the light dry wines cannot carry the same excise duty as, f o example, sweet port, muscat and cham- ""combed."" pagne. It has been represented that that readsdifficulty might be overcome by exempting all dry wines with alcoholic content of 22 degrees and under, or by placing very low rate of excise duty upon them, and applying to dry wines of an alcoholic eontent of from 28 to 28 the same flat of ""the rate of duty as will be applied to sweet to wines. Those are matters that will be taken into consideration before the excise schedule is brought down. I hope that the wine industry will obtain copies of this measure and express opinions upon it . Sympathetic consideration will be given to any representations that may be made by the wine congress This has led that is to sit in Melbourne next week, or by any individual wine-maker, because the desire of the Government is to improvethe wine industry, not to dislocate the trade.  adjourned. NA BILL. . Message recommending appropriation In committee (Consideration of is no Governor General's message) : Motion, (by Mr Forde) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to amend the Flax and Linseed Bounties Act 1930. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, aud the cost resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Forde and Mr Scullin do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foreB ill brought up by Mr Forde, and read a first time. SECOND READING .",21
101,Mr FORDE,FLAX AND LINSEED BOUNTIES,"Capricornia-Minister [3.33] - I Tliat the bill be now read a second time. The sole purpose of this measure is to one word in the definition of "" flax "" in the original act; that is, to substitute r the word "" scutched"" for the word The present definition "" Flax"" means the cleaned combed fibre of the flax plant prepared by retting or by a mechanical or other processes. As proposed to be amended, it will readFlax"" means the cleaned scutched filrre flax plant, Ac. It hus been found that, as the definition now stands, bounty cannot be paid on flax fibre as actually produced in the Australian flax mills. This fibre is merely scutched, and not combed, combing being a process that is carried out in all flaxproducing countries by spinning factories after these factories have purchased scutched fibre from the flax mills. At the time that the Flax and Linseed Bounties Act was introduced, the department was under the impression that the Australian flax mills produced a combed fibre. This, however, has been found not to be the case. In the meantime, a considerable amount of fibre has been produced under the act, and the legal advice of the Attorney-General's Department is to the effect that the act should be amended as proposed, so as to enable the bounty, earned properly and in good faith by the mills, to be paid to thorn. To make the position quite clear, I may say that the fibre is produced by the flax mill from the stalk of the flax which in appearance is much the same as wheat or oats. The mill produces a scutched fibre, on which it was the intention of the Government and Parliament to pay the bounty. As one of the conditions of the bounty, the act prescribes that the mill must pay to the growers of flax plants such prices as the Minister for Trade and Customs considers reasonable. I have just nominated reasonable prices for flax plants for the coming season, commencing in January, 1932. Bope and twine makers, spinners, and factories who or which may manufacture other flax' products, purchase scutched fibre, which is used by them either in scutched form or after combing, according to the purpose of the purchaser. No good purpose would be served by compelling the mills themselves to perform the additional process of combing, so as to comply with the act. That would merely increase the market value of the product, as it would then be a more finished and valuable product. As the act provides that bounty shall be paid at ad valorem rates, calculated on the Australian market value of the fibre, the only result of compelling the mills to adopt the additional process of combing would be the actual amounts of bounty payable by the Government. Moreover, this innovation in the established practice of the trade would take away the process of combing from the twine, rope and spinning factories, and doubtless cause justifiable resentment. The bill is non-contentious, and I hope that it will be passed without delay.",21
102,Mr LATHAM,FLAX AND LINSEED BOUNTIES,"Kooyong) [3.38] - I find myself, in dealing with this measure, in a most unfortunate and regrettable position, and I can only request the sympathy of the House. I agree entirely with the bill, and must support the Minister. I do so.  It is necessary for this bill to be brought down in order that the wish of this House, which was registered when the act was passed nine or twelve months ago, should be given effect. That act provided for the payment of a diminishing bountya proposal that is quite unlike what we plant, are accustomed to in connection with customs duties, which rather have the habit of growing. The bounties were to be paid on a 15 per cent, ad valorem basis for last year and this year, 10 per cent, for next year and the year after, and 1 \ per cent, for the year 1935, when they wore to cease. But in view of the fact that this House, by other legislation, has reduced all bounties by 20 per cent,-the gold bounty to an even greater extent-actuall y the 15 per cent, is reduced to 12 per cent, on the market value of the.flax and linseed for last year and this year, the 10 per cent, to 8 per cent, on the market value for next year and the year after, and the 7-J per cent, to 6 per cent, on the market value for 1935. As the act stands at present, while the growers canobtain the hounty on the linseed itself, they cannot do so on the flax, because they are excluded from it by the presence of the word "" combed "" in the definition of ""flax,"" which makes it impossible to pay the bounty on flax that is not combed. This measure will put matters right, and I support it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without to increase amendment or debate.

103,Mr RIORDAN,FLAX AND LINSEED BOUNTIES,"Kennedy) [ 3 . 4 1 ] wish to direct attention to a matter that vitally affects the wool-growing industry. Tout, Yesterday, I and - some other honourable members, received a letter from a Mr . James Clark, of Brisbane, in which he brought under our notice the injustice which that is being done to this industry, which is contributing, and has contributed i the past, a large share of the taxation that is being, and that has been raised by the different governments of try. There has been a considerable outcry regarding the wages that are paid in the industry, and the press have continually urged that the shearing rates had to be reduced if costs were to be lowered; but not a word has been said about the freights that are charged by shipping companies. The Nationalist newspaper in Brisbane, the wool tops go from Australia. Courier, was sent a letter by Mr Clark, camouflage in which he pointed .out the injustice under which the wool industry was suffering, but that journal did not publish the letter in full . [Qitorum formed.] Mr Clark has been nominated by the Dnited Graziers Association to represent on "" wheat the wool-growers of Queensland on the Australian Overseas Transport AssociaKingdom, tion. In his letter to me, referring to the communication that he forwarded to the Representatives Association. Brisbane Courier, he says The letter in question was forwarded to the Brisbane Courier for publication without consulting me, expunged the paragraphs in black type, as shown in the letter. Evidently, any reference to such a high sonage as Lord Inchcape must not be made, although it is only since he appeared on the scene that our wool freights have increased from Jd. per lb. to 1 3-16d. plus Gd. per bale for weighing. He then goes on to sayWool freights at present rates amount four million pounds sterling yearly and this is the largest sum paid for outward cargo. Apart from this, wool bears a higher rate of freight than any other primary namely, 1 3-1 (id. per lb. Compare this with }d. per lb. charged on frozen meat, which : requires refrigerated space. We certainly have an Overseas Transport Association, consisting of ship-owners and operating under the Federal Government's sanction, but, in my opinion, this is a farce. We meet, and are told by the ship-owners what the rates of freight and what other conditions are, and that ie the end of it, and we must submit, just as under an act of Parliament. Although - wool is the principal item of - I freight only Mr Tout and I attend these conferences to represent the wool-growers. Mr. being chairman, is practically muzzled, so I am the only person there to put up a fight, and, unless I get your Parliament's help, it will be a losing fight, and Australia will continue to pay one and a half to two millions annually more than is a fair rate, we have been paying since Lord Inchcape formed his organization. Only a Parlian ment can deal with it, as the South African Parliament had to do on two occasions. 1 In the Sydney Sun of 28th August, the folthis counlowing notice nppears:8s. 4d. A BALE. WOOL FREIGHT DOWN. Australia-Europe. - "" Overseas ship-owners have announced a reduction of freight on wool tops from IJd. to ljfd. per rib. between Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe. The decrease is about the overseas 8s. 4d. per bale."" leading This reduction cuts no ice, as little or no It is only to hoodwink the Government and the people. In the same paper the following rates of freight are quoted by ship-owners:NA FREIGHT. OVERSEAS SHIPMENTS. A reduction of 5s. a ton in the freights shipped from Melbourne during September, October and November to the United the Continent nnd Colombo, was announced today by the Overseas Ship-owners The new September-October rate is 25s. a ton, and the new November rate 27s. Gd. a ton. Flour freights to the same destination have been reduced by 5s. a ton to ra.tea which arc 2s. 6d. a ton abovp and they, those fixed for wheat."" Now, sir, I want you to think for yourself on this matter, and I ask you why shipperowners voluntarily offer to carry flour to London during September-October for 25s. per ton while wool is 1. 3-16d. per lb. or £11 per ton? Surely something is wrong, which I want you to riprlit. Then again, why is wool carried by weight instead of by measurement. It is all placed in the same sized bales and dumped to the same measurements. Why are to RVrlney Harbour dues 9d. per ton on wheat, and on wool Od. per bale-seve n times more? And again, why have our wool freights gone np so much since Lord Inchcape started out to product, eater for our welfare? The matter i u the letter which the editor of the Courier expunged without Mr . Clark's permission, and which was published in another newspaper, contains the following:How has this been brought about-simpl y by Lord Inchcape getting control by merging a number of companies and acquiring dumping plants and wharfages wherever possible aud dictating terms to all and sundry to the detriment of all primary producers, not only in Australia, but probably all over the world. In Java the combine is working. 1 put £50,000 into a plantation, lost 75 per cent, of my capital in fifteen years, never had a dividend on account of high rates of freight (about £li pur ton on copra), whereas if 1 hail, put my money into a shipping company there, the K.V.M., I would have received 10 per cent, annually on my capital, viz., £5,000 a year,and would uot have lost 75 per cent, of my capital. Then turn to New Guinea and the Solomons. Your readers will remember that after the war many of our returned soldiers bought a lot of the confiscated German plantations, when copra was £24 per ton. Last"" Monday week the Courier reported copra at £11 2s. (id. per ton in London, and your readers will scarcely believe me when I say that out of this £11 2s. Gd. the freight is £7 per ton; yet I am assured by Captain Wm. Collin that he pays this rate of freight. years ago it was 35s. hy sailer. The Returned Saiiors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia is a very live body in Australia, and I invite their active co-operation in this scrap i am putting up trying to get their comrades a fair deal. It 13 my wish to draw the attention honourable members to the excessiv.0 freights being charged. We are told that a higher freight is generally charged for wool, yet wool is carried from Australia reductions. to Japan for 55 per cent, less than is charged from Australia to Great Britain We will be told that Japan is nearer to Australia than is Great Britain , but it is a fact that all the ships trading outside the ring are carrying goods cheaper than those inside the ring. Mr Clark asks why wheat and flour are share of the reduction ? carried cheaper than wool.",23
104,Mr HUGHES,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"The sea freight on wool between Australia and London must' be more than the cost of shearing and ing- . Mr R[ORDAN - Las t year the freight i>ri wool to London wa3 more than the wool was fetching per bale when it there, and this year the position is little better. In May, 1930, when II me mln i on I tn the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was being discussed, the following statement was made:The Dairy Produce Board here is in a position to control the whole of its exports, but it is unable to arrange a contract with the ship-owners owing to the existence of seetion 7A of. Ute industries Preservation Act. This agreement is not intended to cover wheat, flour, or cargo of that kind. The tramp steamers are allowed to carry wheat and flour, and produce other than wool aiid dairy produce, and are doing so at rates varying from 25s. to 27s. a ton. Wool is carried by weight, and a charge of Cd. a bale is made for weigh* ing. At seven bales to the ton, this amounts to 3s. 6d. per ton for weighing. Most goods are carried by measurement. It inny be objected that a ton of wool would take up a great deal more room than a ton of wheat. That is so, but, even allowing for four times the space, it should not be charged more than £5 or £5 10s. per ton, if the charges were computed on the same basis 'as are freight charges on flour. The excessive freight charges on wool are costing - the Fifty wool growers of Australia £2,000,000 a year more than they should have to pay. It costs the Australian growers £4,000,000 a year to send their wool overseas. The growers have been told that their great difficulty is wages; that if arbitration court awards were abolished, everything of would be all right. Shearing rates have already been cut by 22^ per cent., the station hands award has been suspended, and we will have more applications for The pastoral associations will tell the wool-grower that this is the . way out. The Prime Minister (Mr . Scullin) stated that there. had been a 22^ per cent, reduction all round to meet the depression. Why, then, are not the shipping companies, at this tiine of . ' national crisis, required to accept their Wool is, one of our chief primary products. It has provided a great deal of the national income for the last ten or fifteen years, and is entitled to some consideraclasstion. This is not the last word which I shall have to say on this matter. Next year there will he further applications to cut wages in the pastoral industry. got Kven under existing conditions, the very wages of station hands are back to prean harvosier award days. The majorit y of small wool growers do not wish to impose unfair conditions upon.their employees. No one regrets more than they do that the stress of economic circumstances have forced a reduction of Avages to employees in the industry. One or two small growers in my electorate who did not reduce the wages of their employees down to the award rate found when their wage sheets went to the banks, that the banker made a readjustment in accordance with the agreed pastoral companies' rate. In one case, the rate was reduced from 30s. to 2Qs. a week. It is strange that while conditions are so bad in the pastoral industry, this shipping ring should be allowed to exploit the people in this way. The fact that wool generally realizes more than wheat is no justification for a freight charge of £11 per ton as against 25s. per ton for wheat. Mi'. MORGAN (Darling Downs) [3.59]. - I associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) with regard to overseas freight on wool. This is a matter to which I have directed attention on more than one occasion in this House, but I regret to say that, up to the present, I have not been able to secure redress for our wool growers. Without traversing the statements of the honourable member for Kennedy, I wish to emphasize the urgent need for government action in the interests of our wool growers. The present freight charge was fixed at a time when wool prices were infinitely greater than they are today. The industry was then on a profitable basis. Latterly it has been passing through a period of depression, and there has beesi no corresponding downward trend in freights. It has been urged on several occasions that it is not possible for the Government to take action, until there is a united demand from the wool growers themselves.",24
105,Mr LEWIS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,Why were the Commotrwealth ships sold?,25
106,Mr MORGAN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"That transaction may be advanced in extenuation of the Government's inactivity, but it cannot be offered as an excuse. There must be some way in which government intervention is possible. Some time ago, a similar situation developed in South Africa, and as a result of government action shipping charges were substantially reduced. Action ou similar lines by the Commonwealth Government should result in much needed concessions being secured for our wool growers. M.r. RTORDAN - I think our difficulty is due to the fact that freight charges are fixed in the agreement, so that action by this Parliament would be necessary to rectify the position.",25
107,Mr MORGAN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"I recognize the difficulties arising out of the agreement with the Overseas Transport Association, but I. take the view that difficulties exist only to be overcome, and I am convinced that this Govermnent can surmount them if it has the mind and will to do so. This matter is of such serious import to the wool industry that the Government cannot any longer ignore it. I sincerely hope that some action will be taken immediately to afford relief to our wool growers.",25
108,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Corangamite) [4.3] I wish to refer to a matter raised this afternoon, but more particularly to an interjection made by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons) when I was speaking on the tariff the other day. On that occasion the honourable member for Wilmot said, in an interjectionThe honourable member for Corangamite is supporting n Government which somersaulted in .connection with an export duty on sheepskins. That decision was reached by the party nf which the honourable member is a member. I ii reply, I said that I was always against such a duty, and helped to secure its repeal. The only purpose of such an interjection by the Leader of the Oppdsition was to create an impression that I supported the-export duty on sheepskins. Mr E. RILEY - The honourable member ought to have supported it. . Mr CROUCH - But I did not. On tie contrary, I opposed it strongly, and I have the permission of the Prime Minister to say that, in caucus, I did all I could to defeat the proposal. The right honourable gentleman was present at the mooting of the party, before he went to England, and expressed his opposition to the proposed export duty. On the 17th December, 1930, when the honourable member for Wilmot was Acting Treasurer, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who was Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced a tariff schedule providing for an export duty of Is. 2d. per lb. ou sheepskins in wool. That was done by the Government of which the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons) was a member. As soon as the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) returned from abroad, and after the honourable member for Wilmot had ceased to-be Acting Treasurer, and ho and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) had left the Labour party, the right honourable the Prime Minister appointed the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) as Minister for Trade and Customs. On the 5th March, 1931-afte r he had been deserted by those two members of his party-h e announced the cancellation of the export duty on sheepskins, and intimated that the moneys that had already been collected would be refunded. I cannot remember the actual attitude of the honourable member for Wilmot on the occasion to which I have referred; I cannot remember him supporting or opposing that duty.",25
109,Mr GABB,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,He opposed it.,26
110,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"I know that the Acting Prime Minister stated at the time that the Government, of which the - Order ! honourable member for Wilmot was member, had considered the proposal, and intended to give effect to it. I did not know that such an export duty was to be collected. The point I wish to make is that the honourable tion. member for Wilmot has no right to infer that I was a party to the imposition of export duty on sheepskins.",26
111,Mr FENTON,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,The honourable member was silent in the matter.,26

114,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"If the honourable member says that I at any time supported an export duty on sheepskins, that I did not take every opportunity to it. oppose such a duty, he is making au incorrect statement. The honourable member for Wilmot now adopted a different attitude with respect to another matter. I do not know why I should be the victim of his misthe statements. Last Friday night he attended a community singing entertainment at Colac, in my constituency. I was uot invited to attend the gathering, probably because I am not a humourist. The honourable member for Wilmot, however,, took part in community singing, and later was given an opportunity to speak, to those present. The speech which he is said to have made was not actually that delivered, as I find that the report which, appeared in the press was handed in in typewritten form hy some one else on his behalf.",26

125,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Accordin g to the Colac press, the honourable member for has Wilmot (Mr Lyons) saidAbout twelve months ago when 1 was Acting Treasurer and during the absence of Prime Minister abroad, Mr Latham, as Leader of the Opposition, urged in Parliament that party arguments should he allowed to disappear in the light of the crisis which confronted us. These suggestions were rejected by a majority of the members of the federal Labour party, who chose to place tlieir own sectional interests above that of the nation. Because I supported the suggestion made by Mr Latham, I was subjected to every kind of misrepresentation by my own colleagues. What is the history of this mutter? I find that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition proposed in this House that wnai he termed a non-party ministry should be formed. He suggested the eo-operatiou of the Opposition in order to assist the Ministry. The honourable member for  then Acting Prime Minister, said that the matter would be considered. At that time, the honourable member for Wilmot was in the House. The following day the honourable member for Maribyrnong, as Acting Prime Minister, and when the honourable member for Wilmot was in the House, said, in reading from a pre-' pared statement, that the Government could not accept the suggestion. honourable member for Wilmot was in the House, and did not contradict the statement.",26

127,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"There are further points in connection with this matter Then which rather surprise me. The Leader of the Opposition submitted his proposition on the 9th December, a prepared statement was read by the Acting Prime Minister on the 10th December, and on the 11th December the honourable member for Wilmot made a personal explanation. elderly Tn doing so. he denied a statement in the Canberra Times aud the Labor early Daily, to the effect that he bad supported a national government, and that he had no knowledge of Mr Latham's proposal. He saidThe statements from beginning to end can only be described as a downright lie-abeo lurely aud emphatically a lie. All I ask is that the press will accept this absolute doubt! o; the trulli of the report. He deniod absolutely that he had anything to do with the proposal for a national government. He was working against the Acting Prime Minister, as he now is against the present Prime Miuister. At Colac, when he endeavoured to prejudice me in the eyes of my constituents, he is reported to have saidBecause I supported the suggestions made by Mr Latham, I was subjected to every kind of misrepresentation by my own colleagues. In the first place, he did not support Mr Latham or the Acting Prime Minister who expressed the decision of the Government. In a personal explanation, he said that the statement published was grossly inaccurate.",27
128,Mr MOBGAN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,Horrible !,27
129,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Jt is. I can appreciate the nauseating feelings of the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr .

Mr SPEAKER , - The honourable member must withdraw tlfe word "" u n t r u e "" . The Mr CROUCH - I .withdraw it . Prior to that meeting the big drum was beaten throughout Colac to announce the advent of the new political saviour.

Lyons will visit Colac today, and speak in the Victoria H all to-night"". we read "" sob-stuff "" of this description concerning the honourable member- ' The economic conditions of Tasmania during his boyhood were such that at the age of nine and a half years he was compelled to leave school and seek to earn something towards his sustenance. His thirst for knowledge was so evident, however, that two aunts contrived to enable him to return . to school and complete his studies. From very years lie showed an aptitude for imparting knowledge to others, and he was made a State school monitor. At seventeen years of age he had qualified as a teacher in the Education Department of Tasmania . . . His true interests, however, are his home and family . . . They have nine sturdy children . . .

Is, that fair politics ? Is it uot an attempt to obtain a personal sympathy that the honourable member's politics alone could never win for him ?

In no case have I departed from either the one course or the other. No honourable member has evinced so much annoyance over my visits as has the honourable member for Corangamite.",28
131,Mr GABB,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,It is getting near election time.,28
132,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"I am not worrying about that. I wish to deal briefly with the matter that the honourable member has raised in his wonderful contribution. He said that, when I interjected some days ago about somersaulting, I was endeavouring to show that he had supported the export duty on sheepskins. I deny that absolutely. I interjected because he first had made a statement charging me with somersaulting, and I throw the remark back at him, not suggesting that he has somersaulted, but that he is associated with a party that somersaulted iii regard to that 'duty.",28
133,Mr LEWIS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,So has the honourable member.,28
134,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,I have not. I suppose that I cannot obtain the permission of the Prime Minister to disclose what hap-' pened in caucus; the honourable member can do'that. No honourable member can give a single instance in which I supported such a proposition as the duty on sheepskins.,28
135,Mr MARTENS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,But the honourable memher was a member of the Government which submitted that proposal.,28
136,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"If any honourable member can show that I have ever supported such a proposal, I am prepared to resign my seat, provided that if such a member fails to disprove my statement, he also is prepared to resign. I did not charge the honourable member for Corangamite with somersaulting, and in spite of all his heat and bitterness, I do not lay that charge against him now. I simply claim the same right as honourable members opposite have to change my mind as they changed theirs on the subject of the duty by- on sheepskins. I was very glad, indeed, to know that the Government and the party supporting it ' had reversed its decision in the matter.' The duty was imposed during my absence from Canberra. I was here when the party and the the Government were opposed to it , but I was absent when the proposal was brought forward in this chamber, and I had no opportunity of protesting against it. as did the honourable member for Corangamite, who was present when the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) introduced the duty in this chamber.",28

148,Mr FENTON,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"The export duty is uot intended as a means of raising revenue, and the Government undertakes that the proceeds of the duty will be spent in assisting the sheep industry.

150,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"All that I am saying is that I was absent when this was done, while the honourable member for Corangamite was present and voted on the question. I do not say that he voted in favour of the duty. The vote was taken on the question, "" That progress be reported"", which was not the questiou actually at issue.  did not relate to the question whether there should or should not be imposed a duty on sheepskins.",29
151,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"I have not suggested that it did. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) also raised another point. He referred to my statement that an offer of co-operation had been made by the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) and that I had supported the proposition. I gave away no caucus secrets in making that statement? Unfortunately I was misrepresented at that time. From that misrepresentation I entirely exonerate my ex-colleagues in the Cabinet. If I have been understood as having said that they were responsible for it , I am sorry. No words of mine were ever intended to convey that impression. I was misrepresented by the press, and said so in this House. Honourable members may recall that when I made my personal explanation I asked was there any honourable member on the Government side who had heard me advocate a coalition government? I invited any honourable member opposite, who claimed to have done so, to rise and say that he had; but none did.",29
152,Mr MARTENS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,I do not believe that the honourable gentleman ever advocated a coalition.,29
153,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"It is true that I did nqt. The misrepresentation was published in the press, to whom information was supplied; they did not do it off their own bat. 1 stood up in . my place in this House and explained my position so as to justify myself. I then said that I had recommended the acceptance of the offer of co-operation that had been made by the honourable member for Kooyong, but that I had never advocated a coalition. I regret that the honourable member for Corangamite has gone to such lengths in what appears to me to be an effort to misrepresent my attitude.",29
154,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,I merely defended myself against your attacks.,29
155,Mr LYONS,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"I made no attack on the honourable member; I did not even mention him when I spoke publicly on the matter. The interjection that I made was in response to his, charge that I had somersaulted. Admittedly, I changed my attitude on a particular question, but in doing so I merely claimed the right which other honourable members have exercised to change their attitude on another question.",29
156,Mr CROUCH,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"B y way of personal explanation, as I have been misrepresented, I wish to say that I am absolutely certain that I was not in the chamber when the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fenton) introduced the resolution proposing the imposition of a duty on the export of sheepskins. When I heard that such action had been taken I was astounded, because it was contrary to what I had expected. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lyons) is acting unfairly towards me when he endeavours to make it appear that I was present on that occasion, because later I took part in a division on the question that progress be reported. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [4.29]. - I am somewhat surprised at the tone of this debate, and cannot understand why' any apology should be offered for what happened on the occasion under review. As I believe in the principle of an export duty on sheepskins, it is not my intention to apologize for that action. Had that duty been continued, thousands of men would have been employed in this country in the treatment of the skins. What has been the result of its discontinuance? Sheepskins have to be given away, because a price cannot be obtained for them on account of the absence of competition. Only the shipping companies who are carrying some of the skins overseas are deriving any advantage.",29
157,Mr GULLETT,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"The only time when they were given away was while the duty wasin operation, because they were then unsaleable. Mr E. RILEY - They have to be burned today because there are no buyers for them.",30
158,Mr GABB,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"They were being burned then. Mr E. RILEY - The honourable member will be burned politically before very long. We produce the raw material, but have to send it to France and other countries to be made into bags and gloves. It is a reflection on the people of Australia that it cannot be manufactured in this country. Why should honourable members apologize for what would provide employment for our people?",30
159,Mr BATLET,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"That is not the question. Mr E. RILEY - I say, shame on those who would deny the right of our people to be given employment!",30
160,Mr BAYLEY,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Oxley) [4.31] - Not withstanding the statement that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lyons), the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) is not prepared to accept responsibility for the vote which he gave. That vote was so recently taken, and had such serious import, that every honourable member is familiar with the conditions that surrounded it. Honourable members of the Opposition were considerably surprised to find that the then Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde), who up to that time had conducted all the business connected with the Department of Trade and Customs, did not table the resolution dealing with the export duty on sheepskins.",30
161,Mr GABB,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"There is a story behind that, too.",30
162,Mr BAYLEY,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"The then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton.) tabled it, but did so in his capacity of Acting Prime Minister. Although nothing was said, it was plain to honourable members on this side that, even within the Cabinet itself, there was not unity in regard to the matter. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs may not have actually refused to table the resolution, but he certainly declined to do so as he himself was not in agreement with it. There-is only one point that I wish to make. You, Mr Speaker, know that when the question, "" That progress be reported,"" is put from the Chair, ninety-nine times out of one hundred it is agreed to ou the voices, being regarded as a purely formal motion. Why did the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), who was Acting Leader of the Opposition at the time, and those who were associated with him, call for a division? It was because that was the only way in which we could object to the tabling of the resolution, and demonstrate that as a party we were opposed to it. The honourable member for Corangamite has said that, despite his participation in the division, he was not present when the resolution was tabled. Was he one of the sheep from whom these skins were taken? Did he march into the chamber and record his vote without knowing what the division was about? He cannot run away from his responsibilities in that manner. The position is clear-the division was in the nature of a protest by honourable members of the Opposition against the tabling of the resolution, and the division list proves conclusively that the honourable member for Corangamite was not prepared to vote with us, and thus insist upon the matter being then aud there discussed, so that members of the committee would have an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it. There can be no discussion. Once the Minister in charge moves that progress be reported, the question has to be put without discussion or dissent. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr. Crouch) voted for it, which was tantamount to saying that he was satisfied with what the Ministry had done. Had he uot been satisfied, he would have voted against progress being reported, and insisted that an opportunity be given to discuss the matter about which he is now so righteously indignant.",30
163,Mr LATHAM,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Kooyong) [4.36] - I rise, uot for the purpose of adding anything to the discussion, which I hope is now concluded, but to call attention to a matter arising out of two questions which were asked during question time t.his afternoon. ""With all respect to the"" 5 members concerned, and to you, Mr. Speaker, I take exception to the practice ol introducing propaganda into questions asked in the House. Every member of the House is a propagandist at some time. or other, but not, I hope, in an undesirable sense. Honourable members opposite' may disclaim that assertion if they think fit, but the propaganda indulged in on this side of the House is, I can assure honourable members, entirely desirable. 1 do uot wish to embark upon a party discussion-al l honourable members are interested in this-bu t merely to point out that this afternoon the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) read a statement, by a clergyman dealing with the subject of banking. He then asked whether the Government proposed to introduce legislation to amend our present banking system in a certain direction. He couid have asked that question without quoting the clergyman's statement, which had nothing to do with the question. The honourable member simply seized an opportunity for propaganda, for which there is a proper place'and time, but it is not question time. If this practice grows, it will become very difficult to conduct the business of the House. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) this afternoon asked about the possibility of refunding certain money paid in duties on petrol, and he indicated that, in regard to the duty on sheepskins, such a refund was made. He went on to inquire whether that procedure, or something approaching it, could not be followed in regard te> petrol. That was the substance of his question, but into i the introduced a statement that the duty on sheepskins was imposed at a time when the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons) was a member of the Government. We all know that that was so",31
164,Mr HOLLOWAY,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,That was brought out by way of interjection.,31
165,Mr LATHAM,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"No , it was incorporated in the question. That sort of thing should be discouraged in the interests of all of us. Whether the honourable member for Wilmot was^ or was not, in the Cabinet when the duty on sheepskins was introduced, is not relevant to the desirability or otherwise of refunding the duty paid on sheepskins or on petrol. The statement was introduced simply to score a point on a propagandist matter. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to consider- I do not ask that you make a statement today-whethe r it is not possible, in the interests of all honourable members of this House, to exclude obvious propaganda from questions, and to require honourable members to address themselves to Ministers only for the purpose of obtaining bona fide information.",31
166,Mr FENTON,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Maribyrnong) [4.40] There seems to be some misapprehension as to whether or not the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) ever made a suggestion that a coalition government should be formed. As a matter of fact, he did not. His suggestion was that if he and his party could in any way co-operate with the Government, of which I was at the time acting head, he would be prepared to do it. He made it clear that he had no desire to take office, but merely to co-operate with the Government. Naturally, I was called upon to reply to his suggestion, and I did so in very brief terms. I made my decision without, any consultation with Cabinet, knowing, as I did, the feeling of the party. I mentioned it the next day at the party meeting, and the matter was smiled out- I shall not say laughed out. On my own initiative I made a fuller statement next day. In regard to the statement that the honourable member for ""Wilmot was a member of - the Government when the duty on sheepskins was imposed, I may inform honourable members that, when that action was taken, the honourable member for Wilmot was in Tasmania. Parliament, He was called to Tasmania a week before the House adjourned, and it was during that week that the party decided finally, after considerable argument for and against, that an export duty on skins should bo imposed.",31

Let us wait until the elections are being fought, and then, when we are before the people, we can tell them the truth. I took it on myself, a3 Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Customs, to lay on the table the motion imposing a duty sheepskins, and I did it when the then monopolies. Acting Treasurer (Mr Lyons) was absent in Tasmania. He was not at the Cabinet meeting at which the matter was decided; he was not at the party meeting; he not even in the House. I wish to make that point clear. Those who look up the records will find that they bear me with this matter. out. I have"" no desire to wash dirty linen, and I hope that we shall always fight cleanly, both inside the House out. I do not want to accuse the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr. Crouch) of being unduly nervous or excitable, but on several occasions lately he has seemed to be very anxious for fight, and those who go around looking for fight, are bound to get something return.",32
170,Mr SCULLIN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Yarra-Prime Minisship-owners, ter) ['4.44] - The subject raised by honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Hi ord an) is a very important one. think nil honourable members in this House have received copies of the letter from Mr James Clark. In that letter Mr Clark refers to the increase in freights on wool since Lord Inchcape came into shipping. That is going back a good many years. I do not know of any increase in freight during recent years. As a matter of fact, shortly after this Government came into office, a proposal was made to increase outward freights by 10 per cent. We have no power, as a to control freights-althoug h Mr Clark says that only Parliament can deal with the matter-but , nevertheless, the Government did take a stand and made representations to see what sheepcould be done to prevent a rise in freights. Prior to the accession to office of this Government, delegations your representing overseas shipping commet representatives of shippers in goAustralia and discussed with them the proposed increase in freights, which, they contended, was inevitable unless sonievhing could be done to regulate shipping in Australia to prevent the overlapping was taking place, and to regulate space by means of an organization of shippers and ship-owners. When n decision was reached that there should be no increase in freights, if that could be doue. an unexpected difficulty arose in connection with certain legislation tha: on had been passed for the control ol Accordingly, they approached the Government with a requestto amend the legislation in question before they formed an association for the was regulation of shipping. That amending legislation was passed, and that is the only power which we have in connection",32
171,Mr HOLLOWAY,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,Hav e the shipping and companies violated that agreement?,32
172,Mr SCULLIN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"So far as I know, there has been no increase of freights since then. The writer of this letter refers to the Overseas Transport Asa sociation, of which he is a member, representing , the wool-growers. Mr: in Tout is chairman of this organization, which is representative of overseas Australian wool-growers, the the butter and fruit industries, and other sections of ""exporters. The writer I states that the association is operating under the Federal Government, That is not correct. It is an organization entirely of shippers aud ship-owners. The only action which the Federal Parliament took was to amend it3 legislation so as to enable the organization to operate, and I believe that it is doing good work. As we all know, wool freights have always been abnormally high as compared with freights on other exportable primary products from Australia. They have been higher because, in the overseas market, wool has always commanded a higher price than other primary products. Now that wool prices are down, these high shipping charges are a real hardship upon the industry. I have taken up this matter with the Transport Association, which is keeping me informed of every move or proposed move. At one of the conferences which I have had with Mr. Tout, it was pointed out that there was no guarantee in the agreement for the regulation of freights, and, on behalf of the Government, I refused to introduce the amending legislation unless that was provided for. After a good deal of negotiation it was included. I said that, as we had taken the responsibility of emending the legislation, if it would not prevent a rise in freights, we should have id consider what action could be taken. This question has been raised on more than one occasion by several honourable members, including, I think, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), and the Minister for Markets (Mr. .Parker Moloney) is giving it his attention. I now have an acknowledgment of my letter to the association, informing me that it is considering the position with a view to avoiding an increase in freights. I think that this is rather an important accomplishment, because we have to realise that a decline in the volume of shipping means an increase in the handling charges, so that freight increases are difficult to avoid. I agree that probably some re-adjustment of freights should be luade by ship-owners in view of the low prices now prevailing for wool. It is obvious that if wool prices are low, the industry cannot carry the burden of high freight charges. I think the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) has done good service in raising the matter this afternoon.",32
173,Mr MORGAN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,Can the Prime Minister explain why the Union Government in South Africa has been able to deal with this question? Mr Scullin.,33
174,Mr SCULLIN,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,The honourable member must know that the Union Government is not subject to the constitutional limitations that are imposed upon the Commonwealth Government.,33
175,Mr SPEAKER,REDUCTION IN WHEAT AND FLOUR,"Hon. Norman Makin). - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) has referred to the practice which has grown up of basing questions upon newspaper paragraphs and which he suggests may be equivalent to political propaganda. He said that he did not desire from me a statement on the matter today, but I feel that I should at once offer a few observations in regard to it. For some time questions based upon newspaper reports have occupied a good deal of the time during which questions to Ministers are asked, and it has been quite apparent that the majority of those questions were asked, not with the object of eliciting information as required by the Standing Order, but with the deliberate purpose of giving it. The Chair has sought to check this practice. If honourable members were deterred altogether from basing questions upon newspaper reports it might be regarded as an undue curtailment of their privileges and rights. However desirable it might be to restrict the practice, I am reluctant to give a decision that might be so construed. I am desirous of giving to honourable members the widest possible freedom, but I do feel at times that many of the newspaper statements quoted when asking questions should not be used. In some cases the press paragraphs, upon which questions are based, are inordinately long. The reading of them occupies considerable time, and they certainly are more in the nature of statements or speeches than of questions. I promise thp Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) that I shall go carefully into the matter, and if I decide that there should be any curtailment honourable members will be given the reasons for that decision. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.53 p.m.",33
