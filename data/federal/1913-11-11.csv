79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is a point of order which has not the slightest reference to this matter.

138,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Bourke is oufc of order in interrupting the Speaker when he is on his feet. Standing order 283 readsAny member may rise to speak "" to order"" or upon a matter of privilege suddenly arising. Standing order 284 readsAll questions of order and matters of privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. Standing order 285 readsAny member complaining to the House of a statement in a newspaper as a breach of privilege, shall produce a copy of the paper containing the statement in question, and be prepared to give the name of the printer or publisher, and also submit a substantive motion declaring the person in question to have been guilty of contempt.

So that a question of privilege in this case can be raised, apparently, without a motion having necessarily to be moved. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The statements made by the honourable member for Ballarat in that city on Sunday evening were to the effect that the Speaker had lost the confidence and respect of honourable members, that he had deliberately altered a Hansard proof, that he had acted in a biased manner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan.",17

144,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I desire to speak on the question of privilege which has been raised. I take it that one of the Throw privileges which, for some considerable time,-has been handed down to us, is that of discussing questions of privilege raised by honourable members. The Prime M in ister has taken exception to certain remarks which are alleged to have been made by the honourable member for Ballarat at some meeting in that city. In the first place, I submit that the Prime Minister should have come here armed with a copy of the newspapers in question, and should have given us the names of the printers or publishers, and thus have complied with standing order 285. But that is not the point that I desire to take in relation to this matter. I wish rather to know the position that the Prime M in ister himself occupies in this connection. He has done much more than has the honourable member for Ballarat. He has gone round the country telling the people that he can practically command your vote, sir.",17
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is that statement ?,17
146,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I say that the Prime Minister has practically gone about the country from time to time and told the people that, with the aid of Mr . Speaker's vote, the Government were going to do so and so.",17

151,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask honourable members on bcth sides to refrain from disorderly interjections.,17
152,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I was saying, when interrupted, that the Prime Minister, from time to time, had cast reflections on the Chair-reflection s which I regret very much. If there is one thing that is more degrading than another, it is the action of the Prime Minister in going about the country and telling the people, from time to time, that he has practically full and complete command of your vote, Mr . Speaker.",17
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point order. Is it in order for the honourable member to attribute to me statements tion? which I have not made and which, if I had made, would reflect upon me as the before the Chair. Leader of the House?

He has arrogated to himself the right to arrange the business of this House, a matter which should in Mr Speaker's hands. There are, for the Chair. instance, on the business-paper certain motions, the order of which it should the duty of you, sir, to arrange; but Prime Minister has told the country, b means of press interviews-interview s which appeared in Saturday's Herald, or the morning papers-that the Government are not going to allow the discussion of certain motions that have relation action which you, sir, are alleged to have taken. The Prime Minister has no right tion clearly to tell the people that he has full complete power to arrange the business of quired, by interjection, under the House.",18
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have never said that I have.,18
159,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable gentleman took up the position that could do so.,18
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I claim only right to arrange Government business.,18
161,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Yes ; but the honourable gentleman went further than that. He said, not merely that he was going to arrange the order of Government business, but that a certain motion, which is now on the business-paper  order, I wish to know, Mr Speaker, of whether the honourable member for Kennedy is in order in speaking to this mo",18

165,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"When the Prim© Minister rose, I asked him whether he rose to ask a question, or to a matter of privilege. He replied that he rose to a question of privilege. In the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that he has opened up a debate arising out of a matter of privilege in which I , as Speaker, have no power to intervene.",18
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On a point of order, sir, I submit that a debate cannot be proceed unless there is a motion before",18
167,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"This matter has be been sprung upon me suddenly, and I the have not had time to look into the posiy tion under the Standing Orders, but, so far as I am able to judge at present, it seems to me that, a question of privilege having been raised, honourable members are entitled to discuss it . I make that to some statement with some diffidence.",18
168,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Y o u put the questo the Prime Minand ister, Mr Speaker, and when I in what standing order he was proceeding to raise this question of privilege, the honourable gentleman said that it was standing order 285. If the honourable gentlemanhe doubts your word in the matter, may I invite him to look up references to be the found in the tenth edition of May, at pages 235, 244, and 258, or at pages 245-6, 257, and 270, in the eleventh edition. He will obtain from those references all the information he requires.",18

175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I direct your attention, Mr . Speaker, to May, eleventh edition, page 81.",19
176,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The eleventh edition has nothing to do with us.,19
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has it not?,19
178,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,No ; look at the Constitution ; it is the tenth edition with which we have to do.,19
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"May states at page I have given that on an occasion similar to this, in the House of CommonsAn accusation of partiality in Ihe administration of the closure A much milder offence than thisdirected against the Speaker by a member at a public meeting, was informally brought before the House by a question addressed to the chair. The Speaker, in his reply, explained the nature of the offence which had thus been committed against the House by the member's conduct towards the Speaker; and the member made, in consequence, an apology in terms that averted the consequences of the offence. Subsequently, however, the same member published in a newspaper a letter which contained a repetition of the same offence against the Speaker. House thereupon, having heard the member in his place, resolved that the letter was a gross libel upon Mr Speaker, deserving the severest condemnation of the House, and that the honourable member be suspended from the service of the House for the remainder of the session, or for one calendar month, whichever should first terminate. I submit that on fchis information being brought to your notice, Mr Speaker, the first step to be taken by you is to ask the honourable member concerned what is his attitude in the matter-to ascertain whether these statements have been accurately reported or not.",19
180,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Whaf c has this to do with a matter of privilege? honourable,19
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I , first of all, asked the Speaker's permission to put a do not you question, and he declined to let me proceed along those lines, and said I must in - fal l back on a matter of privilege.",19
182,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Prime Minister rose to a point of order.,19
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am on a point of order. I am asking Mr Speaker to direct the House as to the best method of procedure, since he will not permit the procedure I propose to adopt. There, so far as I am concerned, the matter has to end; I can do no more.",19
184,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The standing order requires that when a member rises to a point of order, the Speaker shall give a decision. Ifc is true that, in practice, a debate has sometimes been allowed if the Speaker has not made up his mind, but not when he is prepared fco give a decision. I wish fco point oub a misconception which I think exists in the mind of the Prime Minister in regard to what he actually did. When he rose he said, "" I the want to direct your attention "" to certain things. I asked the honourable member then whether he desired to raise a matter of privilege. At that moment several members were interjecting, and there was, as usual, unfortunately, some confusion. The Prime Minister later said, "" I propose to direct your attention "" to something in a paper. I asked the honourable gentleman once or twice whether he proposed to ask a question or raise a matter of privilege, and he distinctly stated that he desired to raise a question of privilege. I had already noticed what had appeared in the papers, and I was familiar with the proceedings under such conditions; The and it was my intention, had he put a question, to have asked the honourable member for Ballarat whether he had stated what was attributed to him. But the Prime Minister is mistaken, or I am - I am not sure which, but one of us is mistaken-as to whether or not he asked a question. According to my memory, he did not ask a question affecting privi lege, but raised a matter of privilege by directing my attention to some reflection on myself. In this case, may I point out that it is not for the Speaker to say what he will do, but for the Prime Minister himself to take what action he may think necessary, having regard to the reply of the honourable member who is personally involved.",19
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I desire to make a personal explanation.,20
186,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,An honourable member cannot make such an explanation in the middle of a speech' by another honourable member.,20
187,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kennedy was in possession of the chair when the point of order was raised, and he cannot be further interrupted for the purpose of a personal explanation.",20
188,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,It is evident that the time at my disposal will be largely taken up by points of order,20
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I must raise another point of order. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, under what standing order a debate can proceed in the House without there being some motion before us?",20
190,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"TJnde r standing order 283, which saysAny member may rise to speak "" to order,"" or upon a matter of privilege suddenly arising.",20
191,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"When I was interrupted, I was saying that if there is anybody to whose conduct exception can be taken for passing remarks outside, it is the Prime Minister himself. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I rise to a point of order. I submit that this is absolutely irregular on both sides of the House.",20
192,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That is a reflection on the Chair. Mr W. H . IRVTNI5 - No . I think that on both sides we are entering on a discussion which is practically impossible under the Standing Orders. The principles are set out in May, and you, Mr. Speaker, have already conditionally ruled in the matter. You have stated that, the point having suddenly arisen, you have not had full opportunity to consider it, and that you ruled with very grave doubt. I ask leave to draw your attention to the fact that, according to the Standing diately Orders, which affect both sides of the House, there can be no debate on a matsomething ter in regard to which there is no questhere tion before us to be decided. There be a question that can be decided, because the three standing orders have to be read on together. Standing order 283 isAny member may rise to speak "" to order,"" - or upon a matter of privilege suddenly arising. Standing order 284 saysA l l questions of order and matters of privi- ' lege at any time arising shall, unti! decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. It stands to reason-and the further standing orders point to the same thingthat anybody who rises to a question of privilege must put it in the shape of a motion of some sort. I think we are all getting into a wrangle about something which ought, in the interests of both sides, to be settled.",20
193,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is responsible for it . Mr W. H . IBVINE - It does not matter who is responsible for it . The honourable member will see that this is not a matter which will in any way affect the liberty of honourable members to speak on a question of privilege, but the question, whatever it may be, ought to be placed in a position in which we can debate it.",20
194,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,"The Attorney-General should remember that four honourable members on the Government side have spoken to each one on the Opposition side. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I have not said a word on tha merits of the question, and I do not intend to. What I say is that the matter ought to be placed in a position to give honourable members an opportunity to debate it ; if we debate it with nothing before the House, the dobate will be interminable, and there will be no rules available at all. If we look at May, l l t h edition, page 271, we find the widest statement in favour of bringing forward a question of privilegeA privilege matter may also be brought forward without notice",20
195,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I rise to a point of order.,20
196,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"A point of order cannot be taken while another point of order is under discussion. Mr W. H . IBVINE - The extract from May is as follows: A privilege matter may also be brought forward without notice, before the commencement of public business, and is considered immeWhat is considered ? We cannot consider in blank-somethin g to which is no end, without any resolution or must determination of the House) the assumption that the matter is bmu^ht forward without delav, and that its immediate consideration is essential to the dignity of the House; yet, though, in some respects",20
197,Mr ROBEETS,Unknown,Is this a point of order. I,20
198,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Hav e I said a single word in relation to the merits of the question before honourable members ? I am asking Mr Speaker to reconsider his ruling.,21
199,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I had some doubt in my mind at the moment in giving my ruling, which, as I stated, I gave with some hesitation at that time ; but it seems to me that the whole trouble has arisen from a wrong procedure in the beginning, or, at least, from what I believe to have been a wrong procedure. If this matter had been Drought up in the form of a question to the Speaker, everything would have been perfectly in order, but it was not brought forward in that way, according to my memory. The attention of the Speaker was directed to something that had appeared in the papers, and this was done as a matter of privilege. The only point, however, to decide now is whether this is a question of "" privilege suddenly arisi n g , "" as provided in standing order 283. I do not know that this is a matter of privilege that has suddenly arisen, but it is certainly a matter of privilege in regard to which this is the first opportunity any honourable member has had of bringing it under the notice of this House. B ut the proper procedure was to bring it under the notice of the House by a question addressed to the Speaker.",21
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,So I did .,21
201,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,If the honourable member assures me that he did so,21
202,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I say he did not.,21
203,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I distinctly understood the Prime Minister to say that he brought the matter forward as one of privilege.,21
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Afterward s only.,21
205,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister assures me that he asked a question on the subject. I cannot say that I heard him do so, owing to the numerous interjections, but I must take his assurance that he did ask me a question, though I may not have heard it . cumsfcances, any debate is irregular. The Prime Minister having asked me a question, I am bound to take notice of it .",21
206,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Le t us have the Mansard proof of the proceedings.,21
207,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Let me draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the Prime Minister said that he would conclude his remarks with a motion.",21
208,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is so. I certainly asked the Prime Minister when he rose if he was going to conclude with a motion.,21
209,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,And he lied.,21
210,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Bourke must withdraw that statement.,21
211,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,I apologize for having expressed the truth.,21
212,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I hope the House wil l not give concurrence to these continual abuses of the privileges of the House by certain honourable members. If they are proceeded with I must certainly ask the House fco take serious notice of them. I call on the honourable member for Bourke to again apologize for aggravating his offence.,21
213,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Yes , I do so. I am very sorry.",21
214,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member resume his seat?,21
215,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Yes ; I am seated.,21
216,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must keep silence when I am on my feet. I hope I shall be allowed to proceed in silence.,21
217,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Will you call for the shorthand report?,21
218,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Cook is out of order. The Prime Minister at one stage of his remarks cerfcainly did intimate that he intended to conclude with a motion, and he read standing order 285",21
219,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,May I ask a question ?,21
220,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! If the Prime Minister assures me that he did ask a question I have no option but to accept it as such.,21
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I assure you I did .. 1 I had not the slightest intention of raising the matter as a question of privilege; I only did so afterwards.,21
222,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister says that he raised the matter as one of.' privilege afterwards, bufc the procedurewas irregular. However, the Prime Minister has now asked me an important In those cir- question.",21
223,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Do I understand that I am to be deprived of my right to speak ?',21
224,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes; otherwise the whole proceedings would be irregular.,21
225,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"T rise to a point of order. I do not wish to traverse your ruling in any way, sir, but when you asked the Prime Minister whether he could bring forward this matter as a question of privilege, I interjected, "" TJnder standing order 1 1 1 , "" and the honourable member said "" No . """,21
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That was wards.,22
227,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not care when ib was. That is a matter of no moment. The Prime Minister said, "" No, I am raising it understanding order 285,"" aud the Speaker then pointed out thab the Prime Minister must conclude with a motion.",22
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thaf c was because I understood from the Speaker that I could not bring forward the matter in any other way.,22
229,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I cannot help what the honourable member understood from the Speaker. The honourable member was distinctly told that he musfc conclude with a motion, and he said that he would do so. Mr W . H . IRVINE - On whafc?",22
230,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not know. The point of order. I wish to take now is, that the Prime Minister having misled the Chair",22
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I object to that statement entirely.,22
232,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Owing to the remarks of the Prime Minister the was misled.,22
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I require that 'the honourable member's insulting statement be withdrawn.,22
234,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I withdraw the stateHouse ment, and I will try to put it in another way less offensive. I do not offensive, because it is not worthwhile being so. The Speaker informed the order ? honourable member that he must conclude with a motion, and the honourable memorder; ber said he would do so. I do not know whether the honourable member did. I do not think he did. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is an immarks ? portant point.",22

If the Prime Minister is not going to proceed with his motion, then it wil l be necessary for me fco take some action.",22
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Ver y good.,22
239,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,It will be necessary for me to take some action in relation to an utterance of the Prime Minister in which he reflected on the Chair of the House.,22
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On a point of order, 1 take advantage of this point of order to say what I did immediately I entered the House today. M f . J . H . CATTS - Is this a point of order ?",22

I make these remarks without special reference to any honourable member; but I say that if honourable members proceed in a regular manner, we shall get with the business much better.

This debate is irregular at this stage. may follow later if the Prime Minister in tends to take a certain course; but, before the matter proceeds to that length, I have to intervene in another way. The Prime Minister, having asked me if my attention has been drawn to a report which appeared in the newspapers this morning of a speech made by an honourable member at a public meeting, reflecting upon the Speaker",23
248,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I suggest, sir, that you have not distinctly and definitely set the matter aside yet?",23
249,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"So far as this debate is concerned, yes. I pointed out that the debate is irregular. I think it would be irregular in any case. There must be some sort of motion before the House, because standiug order 284 provides thatA l l questions of order and matters of privilege at any lime arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. Before a point of order can be decided, it must be stated, and before a question of privilege can be decided, a substantive motion must be submitted for the decision of the House. In this case, it has not been done, nor, in the circumstances, at this stage, unless a motion is made, can the matter be decided. Before a motion of that kind can be moved, an opportunity must be given to the honourable member for Ballarat to have his attention called to the matter, and to be heard.",23
250,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I submit, as a point of order, that an altogether irregular matter, brought up in an irregular way, cannot become a matter on which any honourable member can be interrogated. Before auy interrogation can be put tc any honourable member, there must be something regularly before the House. I submit, therefore, that you cannot proceed in the mathonorable ter until you have something regular before you, in accordance with the Standing Orders and proceedings of the House.",23
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit that I brought this matter before you in a reguHe has ac- lar, way. I cited the statements that the honourable member made, and directed your attention to the in; and concluded by asking you what you proposed to do in the circumstances.",23
252,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The honourable member rose to a question of privilege.,23
253,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister certainly did conclude, at a later Debate stage, by asking me what I proposed to do in the circumstances. The more correct form would have been for him to ask me if my attention had - been directed to the report, rather than to make a statement directing my attention to it ; but that is only a difference of form . I will now answer the Prime Minister's question about what I propose to do. My attention having been directed to a report of an alleged speech by the honourable member for Ballarat appearing in the newspapers this morning, I ask the honourable member if he has been correctly reported ?",23
254,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Is it incumbent upon you, as Speaker, to take notice of statements made outside?",23
255,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I should like to ask you, Mr Speaker, under what standing order or rule you have a right to interrogate me on the speech I made in Ballarat ?",23
256,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have the right of all parliamentary procedure in every Parliament and in every country. It is a matter of courtesy I am extending to the honourable member in asking him whether he has been correctly reported.,23
257,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"During certain proceedings last week, you were very emphatic that the Standing Orders guided us. I suppose the same Standing OrderB guide us today, and I want to know where in them you find any authority fco ask me such a question?",23

My point is that the Prime Minister move a motion only by leave of furthe House. He could move a motion on a question of privilege, but he has not said that he moved this motion as one of privilege. He moved it without making any statement of the kind. U n less he moves on a question of privilege, the motion cannot be dealt with now. Let him do the right thing. He first said that the matter to which he drew attention was one of privilege, and then he denied that it was. Now he is trying to take action in some other way.

341,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The point I take is fchafc the Prime Minister says that this is not a question of privilege, and that he does not move in it as a question of privilege.

I ask other honourable members to put themselves in the position of the honourable member for Ballarat. He stated that he cannot vouch for what is contained in a newspaper report, and you, Mr Speaker, accepted his statement, and gave the warning to honourable members generally that they musfc not make similar speeches, afc the same time tacitly admitting that there was no evidence implicating the honourable member for Ballarat.

Before the Government take drastic action, I appeal to honourable members who have any sense of fair play in their composition, whether any evidence has been adduced today to warrant this motion, especially in view of the Speaker's statement that he was perfectly satisfied with the explanation made. He merely warned lionorable members against uttering such things as had been alleged, but proved. Are they, in such circumstances, going to vote to suspend a representative of the people from the service of the House for the rest of the session? Let the Prime Minister, if he desires to take action, comply with the Standing Orders. Let the Government make a statement, produce evidence from the newspapers, and give the name of the editor and the printer, and then the matter can be dealt with at a later period. But to ask us to suspend a member without producing a scintilla of evidence in justification of the motion, is bordering on the ridiculous.

The Speaker may express his own view on the matter, and his own personal feeling, and the hope that the House will not take further action; but he cannot prevent the House taking action if it so desires. I did not direct the Clerk to read the statements, because I thought that the matter probably would be allowed to drop. Out of consideration for the honourable member for Ballarat, I preferred personally to take that course. The Prime Minister, however, has intimated that he, being in charge of the business of the House, is not prepared to let the matter go at that; and I have no power to prevent him from moving a motion; but, before it is submitted, I will direct the Clerk to read the report in the newspaper, and again ask the honourable member for Ballarat the question which I put to liim.

Ballarat, Monday - Speakin g in the Australian Workers' Union Hall last night, Mr. MCGRATH, M.H.R. (Labour), said that it was probable that Mr Thomas' motion that the Speaker no longer possessed the confidence of the House would not be allowed to come on for discussion, as the Government had the ordering of the business-sheet. Therefore, he wanted to say what he would not be allowed to say on the floor of the House.. The Speaker had lost the confidence of members. There was good reason for the motion. "" We have,"" he added, "" absolute proof that the Speaker has deliberately altered a ' Hansard ' proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his own words, and he altered the pre of to make it appear in ' Hansard * that it was carried."" The Speaker was acting in a biased manner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan.",29

For that reason the Speaker no longer possessed the respect and confidence of the House.",30

433,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask your ruling, sir, on the point which has been raised. submit that the standing order which you have just read does not confer upon you the authority you allege it does. I would direct your attention to the key words in standing order 111. It saysAn urgent motion, directly concerning the privileges of the House, shall take precedence of other motions. And for obvious reasons. precedence of Orders of the Day, of Sessional Orders, in short, of everything; because it is important that it should be brought forward. But the standing order Bays no more It says no more than that questions of privilege are of such a character that they must be dealt with before any other business. But it does not say that they shall override any other standing order in relation to motions.",33
434,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Look at standing order 284.,33
435,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Standing order 284 deals with questions of order and privilege. It readsA l l questions of order and matters of privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. That means that all such questions shall be decided r",33
436,Mr GROOM,Unknown,And everything shall be suspended pending their decision.,33
437,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I quite agree with the Minister of Trade and Customs that that standing order undoubtedly extends the [108]- 2 period for the decision of privilege motions coming before the House. In this instance, therefore, I think that it conforms to common sense; because, if a questiou of privilege arises it should take precedence of other business.",33
438,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Why have other matters of privilege been put at the end of the business-paper ?,33
439,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is a singular thing that matters of the gravest importance to the House have, by the action of the Government, been placed at the bottom of the business-paper. I am dealing now, however, only with the question of order.",33
440,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"W it h regard to the question raised by the honourable member I would for Kennedy, I would point out that the matter is governed by standing order 284, which provides that All questions of order and matters of privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. It will therefore be seen that under the I Standing Orders no other business can intervene until this matter has been settled.",33
441,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"May I ask, sir, why certain other questions of privilege on the notice-paper have been placed at the bottom of the list?",33
442,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in asking me that quesI t will take tion at the present juncture. To ask such a question would be to contravene the standing order which I have just read. I call on the honourable member for Gwydir to proceed.,33
443,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Whils t resting, I have been thinking of the manner in which this question of privilege has been engineered by the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman rose, first of all , to ask a question, but was informed that an honourable member, as we have frequently been told by Mr Speaker, is not i u order in asking a question referring to a newspaper report. He was then asked whether he proposed to raise the matter as a question of privilege, and he agreed to do so. But , having got in what he had to say, he did not conclude his statement, as the standing order requires, by submitting a motion. Subsequently, when the matter WAS debated, Mr Speaker said else that he understood the Prime Minister rose, not to ask a question, but to raise a question of privilege. The Prime Minister then reiterated his statement that he had raised it in the form of a question, and Mr Speaker had ultimately to take his assurance that he had not done what we knew he had done, and done more than once.",33
444,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I musfc ask the honourable member not to state that an honourable member has clone something which that honourable member says he has nob done. Ifc is the custom fco accept the assurance of an honourable member.,34
445,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"You , Mr Speaker, had to take the Prime Minister's assurance as to what he had done. The honourable gentleman raised the question as a matter of privilege, and it had ceased to exist when you, sir, advised the House to let it drop. Ifc was then resurrected without any definite motion or question of privilege being submitted. Ifc was resurrected as a new matter having nothing to do with the question of privilege. Ifc was brought before us by the submission of a bald motion, whereby the Prime M in ister sought to expel from this House a certain honourable member for a limited or an unlimited period, as the case may be. The whole procedure has stamped upon its face something more than fair play or justice to honourable members. It does not bear the imprin t of conduct such as we have a right to expect from a man holding the high and honourable position of Prime Minister offcheCommonwealth. The Attorney-General now tells me that he will explain why we should convict the honourable member for Ballarat on the meagre evidence that has been put against him.",34
446,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,There is not a tittle of evidence.,34
447,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It is only an alle- bitter partisan. gation. We have had ouly a newspaper report put before us, but I think I had better allow the Attorney-General-fch e lawyer, the man who ought to be able to tell us-fc o say why we should convict the honourable member without first having a thorough investigation of this question. I shall allow the Attorney-General now to explain why we should convict on such meagre evidence as has been submitted-o n the allegation, for it is only an allegation,fchafchas been made againsb the honourable member for Ballarat. Mr W . H . IRVINE (FlindersAttorney-General) [5.10] - I agree with the remark made a few minutes ago by the honourable member for Hunter that this is a grave matter, and one on which the House should not proceed without due consideration. I shall deal in a moment or two with the question of what evidence is necessary, and what evidence is possible in a matter of this sort. The charge that has been made is one which, if true, cannot well be minimized. It has been read from one newspaper-the Argus-and 1 propose to read once again, from the Age report, the important words",34
448,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"On what page does it appear? Mr i W. H . IRVINE - In the middle of page 7. This is what the honourable member is reported to have saidThe Speaker had lost the confidence and respect of members, and 'here was good reason for lhat motion. He had absolute proof that the Speaker had deliberately altered a Hansard proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried",34

453,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that fchis is not proof. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I shall deal with that point in a few moments. The Evening Echo reports the honourable member to have said I wish to make some reference to the motion moved by Mr Thomas that the Speaker no longer possesses the confidence of the House. It is probable now that that motion will not be allowed to come on for discussion, as the Government has the ordering of the businesssheet. Therefore, I want to say now what I or any other member would not be allowed to say on the floor of the House. Mr Thomas' motion is quite correct. The Speaker has lost the confidence and respect of members. There was good reason for that motion. We have absolute proof that the Speaker has deliberately altered a Hansard proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bil l was not carried, according t j his own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in Hansard that it was carried. Furthermore, the Speaker was acting in a biased manner. He was proving himself a bitter partisan. He then proceeded to deal with the details supvjorting that accusation. Honororable ahle members will, therefore, see that in these three newspaper reports, which, parently, are independent reports, in subrecords stance, although not in exactly similar dulent "" was mine. words, the statement reported to have been made is identical.",34

461,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"But supposing it were true? Mr W. H . IRVIN E - First of all, surely the House will consider whether a statement of this sort is libellous. I do not think any honourable member will dispute that on its face it is not only libellous, but a gross breach of the privileges of this House, as well as of the Speaker. Then tliere are the other words accusing Mr Speaker of being a bitter partisan. They are strong enough to be characterized in any way honourable members please. But the gravamen of the charge, as I put it, is that some one who presides over fchis House is said to have deliberately and fraudulently altered a Hansard proof.",35

I hold that no term but "" fraud,"" and ""the grossest fraud,"" could describe such an action if the accusation were true. No House, not to speak of any Government, could pass by such a statement and retain its self-respect for a moment.

We are told that the honourable member concerned was called uponfcomake a statement in the ordinary way from his place in the House, but that in the meantime he had made apology which averted the consequences of the offenceSubsequently, however, the same member published in a newspaper a letter which contained a repetition of the same offence against the Speaker. The House thereupon, having heard the member in his place I shall refer in a momentfcothe matter of procedure and proof. Having heard the member, whafc did the House of Commons do? Did it give him a further opportunity to withdraw and apologize or to retract the language that he had Did it do as does this motion, which gives dence the honourable member an opportunity any moment, after it is passed, to reinis, state himself in the House by withdrawnesses ing and apologizing ? Nothing kind. The House of Commons vindicated its own honour by declaring that the ber should be suspended for the remainder of the session, or for one calendar month.",35

What is the practice that has always been adopted in regard to proof ? Of course, if ths honourable member for Ballarat says that the words were uttered, but they are true, we shall know the how to deal with him . Honourable members say that there is no proof that the words were uttered; but the practice which we are following here is that which for has always been adopted by the House sooner of Commons, whose practice we are not him only allowed, but directed by the Standand ing Orders to adopt in cases for which own Standing Orders do not provide. The practice is that laid down by alMay, and it does not require, in any case, evidence on oath to be given in been the House, either by - affidavit or otherwise, in support of any statement made. Whafc is done in all cases of contempt is to call on the person who haa committed the contempt to appear at the of the House, if he is not a member, to call upon him , if he is a member, can in his place to admit or deny the allegamade against him.

Those quoted words were not in the original Hansard proof, but were added; and I criticised the position very severely, as I claim I had a perfect right to do, in view of the refusal to permit us to discuss it in Parliament, and of the fact that the motion of the honourable member for Barrier has been put lowest down on the business-paper. It was not a matter of going outside and criticising a gentleman whose hands, as the Speaker act said, are tied. I tried bo cribicise the posibion in this Chamber, bub I was denied the opporbuniby of dealing wibh the motion of which the honourable member for Barrier had given notice.

The honourable gentleman made the correction, and I in tended at that moment to draw the attention of the House to it , but the honourable member for Wide Bay asked to see the motion, and I handed it to him. Under these circumstances, the matter temporarily escaped my memory until I happened to overhear a question bearing on the matter. And then I remembered that it had been altered.

523,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is true that the Chairman of Committees sometimes makes a verbal alteration in a Bill , but where a question has been stated from the Chair, I think the proper procedure is-if the motion has been altered by the honourable member moving it-to inform the House of the alteration, and get the concurrence of the House to that alteration.",39
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do you this has been the practice of the House ?,39
525,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think it has been the practice of the House. At any rate, it seems to me that a very peculiar position could arise if , after a motion has been stated to the House, and the House 13 in possession of it , the honourable member moving it could make material alterations that might altogether alter the character of the motion. If an alteration is made in one case without the consent of the House, then in every case alterations could be made, and a motion, when put from the Chair after debate, might be entirely different from that submitted from the Chair at the outset.",39
526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It could only done with your connivance.,39
527,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"But if I could accept the alteration of one word in a motion, there would be just as much connivance if I consented to the alteration of a dozen words, and I do not think it is proper to put a Speaker in that position. The matter should be dealt with by amendment or by the consent of the House.",39
528,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Tim e after time it has been pointed out in the Chamber that those who produce newspaper clippings, or anything of the kind, musb vouch for interjecting, the accuracy of the reports they produce. I am nob troubling much about that particular point, but I ask where a position like the present will lead us if those who produce bhese reports are not asked for any evidence or proof? It simply means that if this practice is permitted to develop, the majority may expel, one after another, the whole of the minority. The old order of procedure has been entirely practice reversed; the practice has been entirely altered. It was the practice laid down that before any one could propose to act in the direction now suggested, they must furnish evidence of the accuracy of the reporbs they produced, but here today no one is asked to furnish the least proof of the accuracy of the statements contained in tliese newspaper clippings. Simply on the basis of a newspaper report, and without producing any evidence whatsoever of its truth , it is proposed to take certain action against an honourable member in this Chamber. There never has been a time in the history of bhis Parliamenb when, acting upon newspaper asserbions, half the members of this House could not have been expelled in the same way. rule that Mr W . H .

I venture bo say that he cannot produce any authority bo show bhat this power has ever been exercised in the House of Commons, except during a most corrupt period in ibs history. Certainly ib has never been exercised in normal times and uuder normal conditions. The honourable member for Ballarat has not covered himself by the privileges of Parliament in order to defame any person; but he mounted a platform and made a clear and be definite statement, which the Attorney General says is defamatory and libellous. If it be defamabory and libellous, bhen the Speaker, or any honourable member inside the Chamber or outside, can have recourse to the Courts of the country to secure a proper remedy. It is because they do not believe that the courts of law can provide a remedy, because they are not boo sure that there is anything defamatory or libellous in the matter, that they take action in the Chamber. In fact, they seek a remedy here because they bhink they cannot secure ib in the courts of the country. The honourable member for West Sydney asked the Attorney-General what proof Ministers and what it was upon which they their action. The reply was that it was in connection with the accusation that the Speaker had altered the Hansard The Attorney-General also said - o that the honourable member for Ballarat should not have said anything Speaker unless he was sure of his ground, that the honourable member ought to have had some facts or evidence saying anything against the integrity of Mr Speaker. Yet here the General has the audacity to take against the honourable member for Ballarat without a tittle of evidence. they do is to take a newspaper and present it to the honourable for Ballarat, and ask him to say or "" no "" as to its accuracy. him to say ""yes"" or ""no""? are sure of their ground-if sure that the honourable member for Ballarat has committed some offence the privileges of the Chamber, the need to ask him such a But they ask him the question they propose that he should become his own executioner, and give them justification for their action. reason for asking him the question was that they might get some assurance for the action they proposed to take, and which they would take against every member of the Opposition on the slightest tion. It is not the dignity, honour, nor the privileges of this Chamber that they propose to uphold; their majority they seek to What would have been thought sitting on those benches during the last Parliament, if we had seized on newspaper reports and taken the of the honourable member for and others-if we had - abused power and authority with were invested by the votes of the people of the country, and had accused able members of the then Opposition, one by one, on questions of privilege, and expelled them from the Chamber the slightest tittle of evidence or truth, simply acting on some newspaper - in which they were alleged to have said something which was an attack on the privileges of the House ? Why, the whole country would have howled with nation. I do not blame honourable bers on the Government side, but their Mr Anstey. good sense and good taste must behad, in revolt against this proceeding. hinged We have in the Chamber today what we had ten years ago, a resurrection of that spirit of hostility, report. coercion, subjection, and tyranny that, once invested with power, will brook noopposition. To honourable members sitting against the behind the Government I say, "" Beware! We live only for a day. The tables may be turned, and you may find that today before you are utilizing a weapon that may beto-morrow utilized to the in j u r y of every Attorney- member of the Chamber."" I hope the action honourable member for Ballarat will stand solidly to his position, and that he will be All charged distinctly on evidence. I hopereport that before he is expelled from his posimember tion as a member of the Chamber we shall ""yes"" know upon what evidence that action is Why ask taken. I appeal to honourable members If they sitting behind the Government not to let they are passion and prejudice carry them away.

540,Mr AHERN,Unknown,"Certainl y I withdraw it if the honourable member for Bourke - did not intend to threaten honourable members on this side. I accept his assurance that he did not. Members on this side should maintain the dignity and traditions of the House in every way, and we resent such charges as were made against us by the honourable member for Bourke, dancing about the floor as he has been for the last few minutes. The honourable member made the most extraordinary statements that I have ever listened to. He asked why the Attorney General suggested that the honourable member for Ballarat should be asked if the statements were correct. I take it that, in all fairness to the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member should be asked if he did, or did not, make the statements. He should not shelter himself in the way that he did. He said that, so far as he knew, there were no reporters of the Argus or Age present. What does it matter to this House whether there were reporters present or not ? If the honourable member for Ballarat made tliese statements believing there were no reporters present, and thinking that they would not come back to the House, his conduct is all the more reprehensible. The whole question is, "" Did he make those statements, or did he not?"" I hear the honourable member for Bendigo interject that there is no proof. I have been waiting with some interest on this very important questionthe procedure and practice on which in the House of Commons has been put before the House by the Attorney-General legal lore of the honourable member for Bendigo to assist the House; but all that he has, so far, contributed to the debate is an interjection which is not of much use to us. The honourable member for Bourke said that members on this side were dragooned into supporting the Government in this matter. He asked why the question was put to the honourable member for Ballarat. It is put to him, following the procedure of the House of Commons, and it is only a fair thing that it should be put to him, in order that he may have an opportunity of saying whether the report is correct or not. In his remarks, and the honourable member for Bourke has confirmed it , the honourable member for Ballarat said he did make certain statements. Apparently, the honourable member for Ballarat was speaking so wildly the other night that he did not know what statements he made, and now, when he is charged in this House, he will neither father them nor deuv them.",41
541,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Indi is misrepresenting me by saying that I made wild statements, and that I came to this House stating that I did not know what I had said.",41
542,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is not a point of order. Mr J. H. CATTS - Why not be a man ?,41
543,Mr AHERN,Unknown,"I can hardly expect the honourable member for Cook to be a man at any time. The honourable member for Ballarat does not seem to know, judging by the statements he has made to the House today, what he said at Ballarat the other night. If he believes that the reporb is substantially correct, let him tell the House so; if he does not agree with the statements as reported, then his plain duty is to tell the House that he does not approve of them, and that he did nob intend to reflect on the Speaker. As a matber of facb, I think that, in this case, the ordinary legal proof is not required. The honourable member has an opportuniby of saying whebher the statements which he is charged with making are correct or not. If they are correct, then the House knows how to deal with them. If they are not correct, let the honourable member say so, and that will be the end of them.",41
544,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [5.57] - It is distinctly refreshing - to hear the honourable member for Indi , who, I understand, is a member of the legal profession, assert that, in a case of such magnitude and importance, involving the question of whether an honourable member shall or shall not sit in this Chamber, and represent his constituents, as they desired that he should, when they elected him, legal proof is nob necessary before we eject that member from the Chamber. Really, one is astounded to find that that honourable member, despite his knowledge of the law, is prepared, without proof, to vobe wibh the Government to turn a member of this Chamber out of it , and refuse to allow him to represent his constituents. How would you cauterize such conduct, Mr . Speaker, were you on the floor of the House ! I venture to believe that your sarcastic reference to the honourable member would be such as to make him curl and hide himself for ever and a day. May I remind the honourable member, who seeks now to prove another honourable member guilby upon a newspaper that only a few weeks was my privilege to draw attention to a report that appeared Wangaratta newspaper, in which the honourable member himself was reported to have grossly misrepresented the Labour parby, notwithstanding that he had the proof to the contrary in his hand at the time. When I brought this forward and read it , the honourable member said he would neither deny nor acknowledge it . He sat in his seat over there and said, ' ' You have the newspaper, consequently you are responsible for bringing it forward; you can give the proof,"" meaning that if proof could not be given other than such as appeared in the newspaper, he consequently could not be deemed bo be guilby. The honourable member now speaks aboub traditions, and honour, and dignity, but when he was indicted for a gross misrepresentation he refused to allow a report in a newspaper to convict him. Why, then, does he now allow a report in a newspaper to convict an honourable member on this side of the House ? Surely that is a fair the Age for the moment. proposition to put to him 1 No doubt his little outburst was congenial to himself, but if he demands that a newspaper shall not convict himself, he is guilty of something underhand if he wants to convict another member on like evidence. Let me remind the House that ib is a most serious thing to eject a member from this Chamber, because by doing so you tell 16,000 bond fide electors of the Commonwealth that they shall not for the time being be represented here. You are, therefore, doing more than merely ejecting a member; you are practically insulting a whole constituency. I ask that this shall not be done for party motives, merely that one side or the other may have a greater majority than it has at present. I ask that before it is done they shall bring such proof as will be reasonable in the minds of every bond fide citizen, such proof as can be substantiated here, and also satisfy the court of public opinion. If we wait for that to be done, it seems to me that the honourable member will not be ejected. I heard an outburst from the honourable member for Indi about the honour, and dignity, and traditions of this Chamber. Let me bell the honourable member whab the traditions of the last three years were, when the Labour party had a substantial majority in both branches of the Legislature. We allowed report, every member of the Opposition the full ago it and free right of speech. We allowed every member to properly represent his in the consbibuency, and to give utterance to what he conscientiously believed was right. On no occasion did we seek to close the mouth of any honourable member, no matter what advantage he was taking, in our opinion, of the Standing Orders. Those were the traditions of the last three years, notwithstanding the majority we had in both branches of the Legislabure, and we were successful in that period in passing much legislation of national importance. If honourable members have any regard for the traditions of the House, it would be well for them to give the Opposition an opportunity to speak as they think fit, so long as they obey the Standing Orders. The Attorney-General occupies an extraordinary position. He has brought forward the Age newspaper to prove that something was said by the honourable member for Ballarat.",42
545,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thre e newspapers.,42

I refer to, a mendacious liar, but now that itsuits him to think otherwise it is a paper on the strength of a report in which he « is prepared to turn a member out of this Chamber. An honourable member on the other side is not guilty because of a report i u a newspaper, and an lionorable member on this side is guilty because of a report in the same newspaper. The Age is a mendacious liar when it refers to the Attorney-General, bu t today a report in that newspaper apparently justifies the honourable gentleman in an effort to expel an honourable member from this Chamber. Could we have greater inconsistency? To submit a report appearing in the Age or any other newspaper as a sufficient justification for turning a member out of this Chamber is going to an extreme which I am confident the people of this country will not submit to when they properly understand the position.",42

I would not for a moment reflect upon you, Mr . Speaker, but I am sure you will permit me to say that evidence is not wanting to show that this Chamber is becoming unworkable. The sooner we go to the country, and ask the people for another verdict, the better-that we may know which party is in a majority in this House, and that we may be able to place on the statute-book legislation of the character which the majority require.",43

554,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"In the case which has been referred to, the honourable member who had offended was permitted to explain his position.

We point out to honourable members opposite that they are unable to prove the honourable member guilty, and then, with charming innocence, they actually ask the honourable member to himself say that he is guilty. If he were to cry, "" Yes , I am g u i l t y ,"" then they would punish him, if they could, or force from him some abject apology. Before he has had an opportunity to explain, and in the face of the lionorable admission bf honourable members on the it other side that they have no proof of his sucguilt, the Governmenfc submit a motion which may result in his removal from this the Chamber. In the case quoted from the on . proceedings of the House of Commons, right the offending member was remove'd only be after he had repeated his offence, and after he had actually written the offenquessive words. He did not say them in the that heat of debate, and fchey were not due the excitement of the moment applied the when a man is making a big speech to prevented from expresshis constituents. The member in quesi m - tion sat down calmly in his office, or somewhere else, and wrote out, and published, his offence in the newspapers.

Let us consider the coursje which was followed in the House of Commons in the case which has been quoted.

567,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Apparently , in 1904, there was a case of a somewhat similar nature. In the case dealt with by the Attorney-General, and on which the Government base their action, an honourable member had accused the Sneaker of the House of Commons of partiality in administering the closure. H is offence was brought before the House; the Sneaker explained the nature of the offence whicr> had been committed against the H o l l and the offending member made an apology in terms which averted the consequences of his offence. He was evidently given an opportunity of speaking, aud of saying whether he had or had not been guilty of the offence. He must have admitted that; he was guilty in some way or another, and, subsequently apologizing, escaped the consequences of his offence. But the question of his suspension arose afterwards, when, after making his apology to the House, he repeated his offence in a letter to the party press. Here, before the honourable member for Ballarat admits that he has said anything, and before he is given an opportunity to discuss the matter in any way whatever, a resolution is submitted for liis expulsion for the session.",44
568,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable member for Ballarat was twice called upon to explain.,44
569,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Havin g heard the member in his place, and the member having, evidently, acknowledged the reHe has petition of the offence, and having refused to apologize in any way, the House of Commons then, and only then, proceeded to take the action which has been referred to. Is this House justified in taking the action now proposed on the first occasion, and without proof of any description? The reference to May seems to have been hurriedly read, and the procedure overlooked, when it is claimed that the case referred to was on all fours with the case that has arisen here. In the case referred to punishment was only meted out to the offending member when he had offended a second time, and had cheerf u l l y acknowledged his offence. There is no acknowledgment of offence on the part of the honourable member for Ballarat. As a matter of fact, the honourable member has not had a full opportunity to say whetlier the reports of his speech appearing in the newspapers are correct or otherwise. ",44
570,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"In the few moment* during which the honourable member referred to the matter, he emphatically stated that, so far as the reports appearing in the Argus and Age are concerned, there were no reporters present to represent those newspapers, and, so far as the Echo is concerned, the honourable member stated that he had not had an opportunity to read the report appearing in that newspaper.",44

Were the honourable member's statements true? If there be a reasonable ground for the honourable member making the statements, then I take it that the House will not be considering its own honour and dignity by removing the honourable member.",45
586,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,There are four specific charges.,45
587,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Which of the four charges is relied upon 1,45
588,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,They all reflect upon^ the Speaker.,45
589,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Is number 1, 2, 3, or 4 to be relied upon, and are any of them true ? Suppose an honourable member feels in his heart that he has some justification for making statements, we have uot to consider the particular words used, because he might have conveyed precisely the same meaning in different words. Each man chooses the words' with which he is most familiar, and does .not necessarily use them with a complete knowledge of their finer meaning. What may appear to some a comparatively mild statement may appear to others as being very pointed. Let us look at this question from the point of view, not of numbers, but of justice. This is the first statement in the report which forms the basis of the charges laid against the honourable member for Ballarat- Therefore, he wanted to say what he would not be allowed to say on the floor of the House. Although honourable members opposite may feel that they have the power to remove the honourable member for Ballarat from the Chamber, they must recollect that the public will say that he was sent here to speak his mind &3 the representative of his constituents. If, because of the application of the closure, he feels that he was not allowed to say what, in the interests of his constituents, he ought to have said, there was some justification for his telling the people so. it is they who ought to be, and who finallv will be, the masters of this Parliament.  ber thinks that the report is correct? Mr ROBERTS,-Eve n if the statement is correct, even if the honourable member for Ballarat said what he is reported to have said, it must be remembered that he said it when smarting under a sense of grave injustice, and feeling that he had been prevented from saying in this House what he should have been permitted to say. Mr JosEr-H COOK - Whaf c he would not have been allowed to say here.",45
590,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Thaf c is not so. Had he been allowed to speak to the motion of which notice was given, that Mr. Speaker does not possess the confidence of the House, he would have been able to say things reflecting on the Speaker. In discussing that motion, he could have made statements which could not be made in the ordinary course of debate. As to the remarks made at Ballaratsupposing the report to be correct-the honourable member made them when smartiug under a sense of injustice, because his rights and privileges as a member had been taken from him by an unprecedented use of the Standing Orders. To continue the quotation from the reportThere was good reason for the motion, namely, thai the Speaker had lost the confidence of members. We have absolute proof that the Speaker has deliberately .iltcrcd a Hansard proof. The proof showed thut the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his' own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in Hansard that it was carried. That is the charge reported to have been made agaiust the Speaker by the honourable member for Ballarat, to which the Attorney-General has added the word ""fraudulent."" If the right of free Speech was recognised in this Chamber,, and if there was opportunity to discuss the motion of want of confidence in the Speaker, of which notice has been given, might it not have been possible for the honourable member for Ballarat to bring proof of his assertion, and would honourable members say, if he proved it to the hilt, that he should be removed from the Chamber for having made it? Are they going to take the responsibility of removing from the Chamber a man who proves to the hilfc a charge that he has made ? Honourable members opposite will dare a greafc deal in fcheir sudden and temporary accession to power, bufc I doubt whether they will go so far as fco say that a member should be removed when he proves to the hilfc a charge that he has made. The Attorney-General presupposes that there is no proof, and is consequently prepared to condemn the honourable member, but we have the clearest proof that the Hansard report of Mr Speaker's remarks concerning the third reading of the Loan Bill was added to by someone. And the addition gives to the reporb a complexion differing from fchafc which it would otherwise have had. TJnder these circumstances, are honourable members prepared to vote for the suspension of the honourable member for Ballarat? Let them compare the original report as transcribed, not by the representatives of party newspapers, but by the official reporters, who have no party to serve, and no endsfcogain in this matter, with the report that was allowed to go forth to the public. If they do so, they willfindfchafc words were added to the remarks of the Speaker, and that those words give a different complexion to the report.",46
591,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Do they differ from the Clerk's record ?,46
592,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Clerk is a subordinate officer; that is as far as I care to go at the present moment in speaking of hi3 record. Bufc I repeat that words were added fco tli3 original Hansard report of Mr Speaker's remarks, and that fchey give to the report a different complexion.",46

600,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"When the House adjourned for dinner, I was endeavouring to deal with that phase of the motion which necessitates the bringing forward of proof, my contention being that honourable gentlemen on the Ministerial side will not be justified in voting for a motion which is based on a newspaper report, of whose accuracy they have absolutely no proof. I take it , at present, that honourable gentlemen are desirous of being fair. I take it that they will not lightly throw an honourable member out of his place; that they will not lightly disfranchise the Ballarat constituency; and I take it that, in general, they will agree that the representatives of constituencies should be given the right of expressing tlieir opinions to their electors, even though, in doing so, they should come near to dealing with the Speaker himself in that capacity. would be a serious matter if the conduct of the Speaker, being such as even a majority of the House desired, the minority were not to be permitted to express their opinion in respect thereof. I quite agree that it would not suffice for any honourable member to go outside the Chamber, and make serious reflections on the conduct of the Speaker, or even on that of honourable members, without notice being taken of his statements. same time, honourable members will not desire that the right ot criticism, fair and reasonable, and the right of expressing an opinion in keeping with conscientious beliefs, shall be denied. For that, indeed, would be creating a serious situation, and curtailing a liberty which Australians in the past have prided themselves upon. T submit respectfully, that it would be going much farther than the constituencies in general would really desire. For, if I understand my fellow countrymen aright, they will maintain, afc all costs, the right of free speech; and the right of any of their representatives to express in public the views that he honestly holds.  that they are true.",47
601,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"And it will not suffice for even this House, with all its traditions and all its powers and privileges, to takefchafcright away from any citizen. I was contending that this motion must turn on the question of whether there was any justification for the honourable member for Ballarat using expressions of the character he is reported to have used. I take the interjection of the honourable member for Hume as indicating his trend of thought-that if the statements alleged to have been made by the honourable member for Ballarat are true, or substantially true, then there was justification for the making of them. I ask the Attorney-General, I ask honourable members on the other side who have not yet made up their minds, whether, if those statements are substantially true, it must not follow, in keeping with the interjection made jusfc now, that the honourable member for Ballarafc had justification for making them. If he was justified i u using those expressions, will honourable members be justified in removing him from the Chamber? Will fcliey be justified in depriving his constituents of his services here, and depriving him of the right of criticising what is going on in connection with the It affairs of the country? Before we adjourned for dinner, I said that, as regards the first part of his alleged remarks, which read as follows, Therefore, he wanted to say what he would not be allowed lo say on the floor of the House. the honourable member had justification, because of the repeated applications of the closure, and because, in respect of the very motiou with which he was then dealing, the Government had taken an unA t the precedented course.",47
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Do you suggesfc that, if tliere had been no closure applied, he would have been permitted to say that?",47
603,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Because the Government had practically said to him, "" Y o u shall not discuss the motion,"" for they have put it afcfchebottom of the business paper. Every honourable member conversant with the ordinary procedure of Parliament knows that the placing of a motion there means that the Government did not intend the honourable member to discuss it . Consequently, having been prevented from discussing it here, where he should have been given the right to discuss it , and in the proper place, he had some justification, I put it to the honourable member for Hume, in taking the complaint to his constituents-to his masters.",47
604,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I rise to order. I submit, sir, that the motion is entirely out of order, according to a ruling given by you. I draw your attention to the fact that, when, on the 30th October, the honourable member for Maranoa proposed to read a statement from a newspaper, you saidThe honourable member will not be in order in founding a question upon a newspaper report and reading from a newspaper. . . . Anything contained in a newspaper report is outside the cognisance of the House, and cannot be taken notice of. I submit, sir, that on the ground you then stated, you must rule against this discussion taking place.",48
605,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would remind the honourable member for Bourke that the point of order he cited related to questions founded on newspaper statements, and that I ruled that a newspaper statement could not be read and then made the basis of a question. When the present question was raised, the newspaper report was not read, although it was a matter affecting the privileges of the House; but, subsequently, after a motion was moved, I directed the Clerk to read the words on which the motion before the House was founded.",48
606,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,May I raise a point of order ?,48
607,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may not traverse my ruling. I cannot allow him to again raise the point of order, because it refers to another matter altogether.",48
608,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Firs t of all, the honourable member for Ballarat had justification for taking the complaint to his constituents. That is charge No. 1 which is laid against him on a newspaper report. It goes on to allege that he used these wordsWe have absolute proof that the Speaker has deliberately altered a Hansard proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his own words, ind he altered the proof to make it appear in Hansard that it was carried.

I do not know who altered it.",48

622,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I say that the Speaker was the one man above all others on this earth who would appear to havesome reason for altering the report. ,48
623,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Because it was the report of what the Speaker is su noosed to have said. Honourable members haveasked me for the proof. Here it isHansard as it left the House, and as it those was submitted to honourable members. When the honourable member for Kennedy raised a point of order as to the proI cedure, pointing """"fc very clearly that the motion for the third reading of the Loan Bill had not been put, and in the circumstances could not then be put, and consequently the proceedings were not as subsequently it was desired to say they were, the Speaker replied as follows: Technically, the position is as the honourable member for Kennedy states. cision "" That the Bill be now read a third time"" was arrived at, the Bill was not read a third time; The Speaker admits that the Bill was not read a thir d time. but, under a misapprehension, I take it, the Prime Minister moved "" That the House do now adjourn.""

That is the charge which honourable members opposite make, but which they are unable The words are emphatic, if But, after all, the Minister himself in other words has to said precisely the same thing. He has intimated to the public that the Speaker is a partisan. He has intimated to the public that he knows how the Speaker is going to vote.

666,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memvote ber did not understand me to rule that generally. But this particular matter has already been decided in Committee.

Consequently, that matter cannot be raised again.",51
667,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. The question before the Chair is, first', whether the honourable member for Ballarat made certain statements in regard to yourself, and, secondly, whether he was justified in making them.

675,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"There is another matter to which I desire to call attention. When our present Speaker was nominated for the Chair, there was absolutely no opposition to his appointment. could have opposed him . There were 37 members on each side, and we could have demanded a division, with the result that the Speaker would have had to vote himself into the Chair. We refrained, however, from doing so. Quite apart from party considerations, honourable members of the Opposition unanimously said, "" The Speaker must go into the Chair in circumstances in keeping with the highest traditions of his office. As fa r as is humanly possible, we will free him from any atmosphere of partisanship. will refrain from taking any exception to his appointment."" We desired to clothe him with a strict and punctilious impartiality, and, as far as was humanly possible, we did so. The proceedings of the House have come now to this-that in certain circumstances, because of the state of parties, Mr Speaker is forced to vote. The very moment that Mr Speaker votes in Parliament, that moment he discloses his hand, and comes down, so to speak, from his exalted position of impartiality.",52
676,Mr BOYD,Unknown,What rubbish ! The Standing Orders provide for his voting. - Mr ROBERTS - I acknowledge that when the honourable member votes he does not disclose his hand.,52
677,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,52
678,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [8.19] We have been told during this debate that if this motion be carried, the electorate of Ballarat will be disfranchised. If it should be disfranchised, that, of course, would be a matter for regret, but That if it were disfranchised because of any act of its representative, that would be a matter for which this House would be in no way responsible. It would be for the honourable member himself to explain You, away that act. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat, like every other honourable member of the Opposition who has spoken, did not attempt to justify an accusation of this kind being made against Mr Speaker. That fact stands undoubted. The newspaper which has been handed in contains a report of what every one admits to he one of the most serious reflections that could possibly be made against a Speaker. The reflection is contained in the paragraphThere was good reason for the motion. "" We have,"" he added, ""absolute proof that the Speaker has deliberately altered a Hansard proof. The proof showed that the third readWe ing of the Loan bill was not carried, according to his own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in Hansard that it was carried.""

684,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member said that the Speaker ordered the "" proceedings "" to be read.",53
685,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I meant to say that he ordered the newspaper report to be read. The report was read, and the honourable member was asked whether he had anything to say. Points of order were then raised by several lionorable members of the Opposition, and, whilst these were being discussed, the honourable member for Ballarat, for some reason or other, left the chamber. He came back again, and his attention was once more called to this very matter. Mr Speaker said, "" I give the honourable member for Ballarat precedence over all others if he wishes to make a statement."" The honourable member made a statement. And what was the nature of it? He said, first of all, that no reporter from the Argus or the Age was present at the meeting in question; but he did not say that a reporter from the third newspaper quoted-the Ballarat Evening Echo-wa s not present. however, is not the point. The question to be determined is whether or not the honourable member used the words attributed to him. He was asked whether he did or did not; and to that question he had au opportunity to say "" Yes "" or ""No."" But we kuow what his answer was. He still has the right to state to this House whether or not he used the words complained of. It is, therefore, idle for honourable members opposite to try to evoke sympathy on his behalf on the ground that he has had no opportunity to explain. He has had two or three opportunities, and it is still open to him to be heard. Mr W . H . IRVINE - As long as mains silent, he is repeating the libel.",53

The honourable member for Ballar»*- -'-» a memter reflection ber of this House, and' every member is responsible to his fellow members for what he says. The House, in dealing with one of its own members, does not proceed upon the principle that he is a criminal. It rather proceeds upon the principle that he is an honourable man who, if he has made a statement, will have the manliness to rise in his place, and either stand by it or withdraw it . I u dealing with a case of this kind, we do not proceed on the principle followed by a Court in a case where a man is being prosecuted for larceny, or some petty offence. Then, again, honourable members opposite ask, "" Where is the proof that the honourable member has made this statement? He may be guilty, but you have to prove him g u i l t y .""",53
688,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,"And the honourable member says, "" He may be guilty; therefore he is g u i l t y . """,53
689,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I say nothing of the kind. The honourable member for Ballarat is alleged to have made a gross attack upon the Speaker of this House, and three different newspapers attribute to him substantially the same statement. That, He was asked i u this House whether or not he made it , and we all know what reply he has made. Honourable members of the Opposition now say, "" But you have to prove that he made this statement."" I propose to show that the procedure adopted in this case is the accepted procedure in the British Parliament, and the practice and procedure of the House of Commons are the prae'-ice and procedure of this House. Let me quote four cases, showing exactly the procedure followed in a matter of this kind in the House of Commons. On the 20th July, 1888",53
690,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,A Tory Government was then in power.,53
691,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"What an intelligent rehe remark to make. On 20th July, 1888, aa reported in the Commons JournalsComplaint made to the House by Lord Randolph Churchill, member for South Paddington, of a letter written by Mr Conybeare, member for the Camborne division of Cornwall, and pubin the Star newspaper of this evening, reflecting on the conduct of the Speaker of this The said paper was delivered in, and the complained of read. A motion was made on the question proposed, and the member was heard - in his place, and the suspension followed. the Then, again, on 13th March, 1893, com plaint was made of another case of a let the conduct of memberf: "" and of the Speaker of this House in the chair."" Then the report sets forth that "" The said newspaper was handed in, and the letter complained of read."" Mr W. H . IKVINE - The letter purported fco have heen written by a member of the House of Commons.",53
692,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is so. The honourable member was not called upon for an explanation, as the matter was passed over. On the 4th July, 1893, the same procedure was adopted in the House of Commons. The report states that "" The said paper was delivered in, and the letter complained of read."" In yefc another instance-7t h July, 1893-th newspaper was delivered in. The report states that "" whereupon the said letter,"" which appeared in the Daily Chronicle, "" was again read."" Tliere has never been, to my knowledge, a case in the House of Conimons where legal proof has been required, or where the procedure has been such as if the member were being prosecuted for a criminal offence. The House of Commons has in each case appealed to the member's honour, and has given him an opportunity to explain whether or not he did that which was alleged against him. That is the position of this House today. The House is appealing to the honourable member's honour, and is inviting him to say whether or not he used these words, which undoubtedly reflect seriously upon the position of Mr Speaker, and are of such a character as to compel the House to take action. I have quoted these instancesfcoshow that we have adopted the proper procedure.  ment in the cases referred to by the honness. orable member ?",54
693,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In one case the honour the motion, and I moveable member concerned admitted that he had written the letter complained of, but a That apologized, and the suspension was with- "" November."" drawn. In the case which occurred on 7th July, 1893, Mr Conybeare was heard in his place, after which he was ordered to withdraw from the Chamber, and the House proceeded to decide in absence.",54
694,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Did he withdraw the words ?,54
695,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No . Later on, howsent ever, he came into the House and exstate pressed his regret. He was again directed to withdraw, and the motion was then moved that he be suspended from the service of the House for one week. Thafc motion was withdrawn on the honourable member re-entering the House and expressing his contrition and regret. The motion submitted in this case isThat the honourable member for Ballarat be suspended from the service of this House for the remainder of the session, unless he sooner unreservedly retracts the words uttered by him at Ballarat on Sunday, the 9th October, and reflecting on the Speaker, and apologizes to the House. If the honourable member be suspended, his period of suspension will depend entirely e upon his own good judgment and common sense. If the motion be passed to-night, he will be able to come in tomorrow, to express his regret for having used the words complained of, and to apologize to the House for his conduct. If he does so, then, byfchevery terms of the mofcion,fchewhole matter will immediately lapse. I wish now to refer to only one other point. The lionorable member for Adelaide, in one of his moments of self-righteousness, said, '' What a magnificent precedent we set during the three years that we were in ofiice. There was no application of the closure, nor was any member suspended."" It was the conduct of the Opposition for those three years that made that record possible. I do not suppose that, in the history of responsible government, there ever was a Government that received such courtesy, attention, and assistance from the Opposition as did the late Administration. What I regret is that honourable members opposite do not adopt the traditions of that Opposition, because, if they did, it would be better for the dignity of House and the progress of public busiBefore I sit down, I desirefcomake a technical correction in the drafting of the word ""October"" be left out, with view to insert in lieu thereof the word",54
696,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [8.30]. - There are two most important principles afc stake; one is the freedom of speech, and the other the basis on which his our Constitution and liberties rest, namely, a fair trial for every person against whom any charge is levelled. In this House, and infchecountry at the pretime, there is a most extraordinary of affairs. The honourable member for Darling Downs, in reply to a statement by the honourable member for Adelaid© that the Labour party, during its three years of office, had never used the "" § g > "" ' d that no Government was ever as a confronted with an Opposition such as confronts the present Government-that in the history of responsible government there never was an Opposition like the present. W it h that observation I entirely agree. There never was au Opposition, which, in the face of such provocation, remained, as we have done so, supine. If we take the of responsible government, as made in the mother of Parliaments, and contrast the scenes that have occurred there with the proceedings in this place, under such provocation and disorder as we have had these last few days, we can compare with satisfaction this calm and orderly array witli thattumultuous and huddled mass of men, fighting and struggling, as they are borne out of the chamber. Such scenes have been known in the House of Commons on far less provocation than we have had. But, happily, we have never seen them here. However, I shall not waste time in dealing with what has been done in other Parliaments. I wish to say at once that nothing the Opposition have done in any way excuses what the Government have been guilty of. The Government have done what they have done without provocation, excuse, or justification. The charge levelled against the honourable member for Ballarat is that on Sunday last, in the course of a speech in his constituency, he made some statements in regard to Mr Speaker, including a criticism of the Speaker's fairness, to the effect that he was a biased Speaker, that he had altered Hansard, and that he did not possess the confidence of the House. For making those statements, it is proposed to expel the honourable member for Ballarat from House for the remainder of the session. That is to say, it is proposed to deprive substituted for "" October."" some 40,000 electors of this State of the privilege of being represented here at time when parties are evenly divided i the House, and in the country. What is proposed to be done to-night cannot be divorced from the consequences of the nnd from the circumstances that surround it , and give rise to it .

I think, however, that it is quite unnecessary to put the amendment now, because the amendment and the main question may very well be discussed together. The amendment is not in issue at all, and it is not proposed to have two debates-the matter is too important.

721,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member for West Sydney proceed?,56
722,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"As I was saying-, I have never made any reference to the previous occupants of your office outside the House other than I should make in side, and I ' have never criticised the Speaker in such fashion as to merit his censure. But, nevertheless, the Speaker, as such, is no more immune from criticism than anybody else. The honourable member for Ballarat has made some charges, and he was perfectly free to make them. The charge agaiust the honourable member is that he made statements against Mr . the Speaker. Whether his charges be well or ill founded-whethe r he has exercised his right of speech to a point degenerating into licence-is a matter of opinion and for consideration; but that he had a right to speak as he thought fit, there is no sort of doubt whatever. The honourable member for Ballarat, as a representative of the people, is entitled to say here what he thinks of the Government, of any public business, and of yourself, Mr . Speaker. But he has been denied the right to say here what he thinks; and, as reported, that is the reason he gave for saying what he did at Ballarat. It is asserted now that the honourable member had no right to say what it is alleged he said. Why? An y citizen could have said the same thing. There is not one citizen in Australia, other than a member of this Chamber, whose right to eo to understand Ballarat, or anywhere else, and say what the honourable member is reported to have said, would be called in question. It has come to this, then, that a represeutative of the people, privileged to enjoy rights aud opportunities that are not granted to the ordinary citizen, is not only denied those privileges that belong to hirn as a member of this House, but is also denied the ordinary rights and privileges of a citizen-amongs t them the right of free speech. Now, what did he say about you, Mr Speaker? He said that you were a "" b i as e d "" Speaker. That may give you offence; it may even arouse the ire of honourable members who sit on the Government side of the Chamber : but surely it is a charge that can be made ? What is there, in the very nature of the language, in a statement that the Speaker is biased that warrants the expulsion of an honourable member? Are we just hearing for the first time that there are persons occupying judicial or presidential chairs in this Parliament or elsewhere who are biased ? Have we not heard of biased Judiciaries? Has it not been declared by the supreme tribunal of this country that a citizen was at liberty to say with impunity that one of the High Court Judges was biased and a creature of the Labour party ? The High Court dismissed the point with contempt when its attention was directed to the fact that a newspaper had said something against Mr Justice Higgins much stronger than anything said by the honourable member for Ballarat against you, sir. The charge preferred against you, Mr . Speaker, by the honourable member for Ballarat, falls under three heads that you are biased; that you altered Ran sard; and that you had lost the confidence of the House. As to the charge-that you are biased-it is a matter of opinion, and you cannot control opinion. Nor, indeed, the expression of opinion. Are you going to say that if T think you are biased I may not say so ? Are you going to say that if I think that any decision of yours is wrong I may not criticise it , provided I do so in a personally inoffensive way? What does a charge of bias amount to? From the very nature of things man is prone to err and unconsciously lean in one direction or another? As to the second charge-that you deliberately altered Hansard-that , of course, is a question of fact, and it is susceptible of proof or disproof in the usual way. There is, on page 2789 of Hansard, a statement made by yourself that the t h i r d reading had not been carried, and you made a correction in Hansard, in which you said that you ordered the Clerk to correct the procedure because at the time there was such disorder as to warrant, in your opinion, a departure from the strict form necessary and proper in such circumstances. The statement made by the honourable member, therefore, was not technically inaccurate. As to the third charge-that you had lost the confidence of the House-wha t does that mean ? It is a mere matter of opinion. Only last week, the Leader of the Opposition said that the Government had lost the confidence of the House, and that was not regarded as an insult, though it was regarded as an excuse for an action which is without parallel in this Parliament, aud, so far as I know, in any other Parliament. Therefore, the charges made by the honourable member for Ballarat, if they were made against you, were charges that are to be met and treated in the way in which all charges are met and treated, first of all by having a statement of them, and then by requesting the person charged to say whether he admits having made the remarks complained of ; and whether, if so, he considers them true. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What are true?",56
723,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The reference to the honourable member for Ballarat was a belated one. The charge was levelled, and the whole force and vehemence of the criticism of honourable members were behind it long before it was considered desirable to submit the matter to the honourable member who was charged. But first why this startling departure from the settled practice? There are two persons now being tried in the House. The honourable member for Ballarat is being arraigned because he made a charge against the Speaker; and, with deference to you, Mr Speaker, you cannot escape from the tribunal either; because the charge alleged to have been made against you by the honourable member for Ballarat is being heard, is being tried, and will be tried. As to the General propriety of such motions, it is alleged that this is being done only because it has reference to a charge against the Speaker. We are told that if it had been a charge against any other honourable member no notice would have been taken of it . I submit it is a charge which only incidentally has relation to the Speaker, and that the real gravamen of the charge is that it is au attack upon a member of one party by the other party, where both sides are so evenly divided that the Speaker is carrying ou the government of the country. If , on the Government side of the House, there was an overwhelming majority, this charge would mean nothing-it could mean nothing in the very nature of it-it would be a mere personal attack on the Speaker that might properly be resented; but, when democratic government rests in the hands of one mau, he can never hope to escape criticism; nor should he escape it if he merits censure. In such circumstances such a charge takes on a very different complexion. This charge is one levelled at that freedom of speech and right of criticism which are the two great principles underlying representative government. If this motionis carried it will be competent for the Prime Minister to rise tomorrow or some other day and stop my mouth, or the mouth of some other honourable member, for saying some other thing to which he takes exception. In this country, and under this form of government, which we call Democracy, a man should be allowed to say anything he pleases providing it does not create disorder, is not blasphemous, and is not personally offensive, and is couched in decent language. Subject to that, speech is free, and the attempt to fetter speech by any other means must inevitably destroy the very base upon which democratic government rests. I come now to the attempt to bolster this charge by precedent. The Attorneya General says that the House of Commons is able to guide us in the matter, and the Minister of Trade and Customs quoted some cases in support of that, and we are told that in the House of Commons the honourable member charged was not even heard, but was condemned and suspended for the remainder of the session, the presumption being that conditions there were exactly the same as they are here. That is quite inaccurate. In one of the cases quoted, that in 1887, the member for the Camborne division of Cornwall, Mr. Conybeare had made a statement outside Parliament to which very strong exception was taken. It reflected upon the fairness of the Chair. It had to do, I understand, with the closuring of Mr. Conybeare. It was a very natural thing. Mr Hughes. The member had been closured, and he objected and went to his constituents and said that Mr Speaker was biased, and so on and so on. He was called upon in the House to apologize, and he did so in these wordsAnd, again, I say that if , at a public meeting, in the heat of the moment, I said anything that could possibly convey any erroneous impression lhat 1 intended to reflect on your conduct and authority in the chair, I can only say I am sorry for it, for I had no such intention. I spoke on Saturday with a full consciousness of the gravity of the situation. I felt it to be my duty to express my opinion, however inadequately, on, the present position of affairs; and, with the explanation which I have now offered, I humbly submit that I did not transgress my duty in saying what I did say on such a grave constitutional crisis. If you call that an apology and withdrawal, you must be very easily satisfied. Mr Conybeare said he was sorry if he offended the Speaker, but he saw no reason to regret what he had said, and that what he had said was fully justified in the circumstances. Mr W. H . IEVINB - The honourable member will not even say that.",57
724,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I come now to the following year, when the same gentleman was again charged with the same offence. Lord Randolph Churchill moved that he be suspended. I want to trace the procedure of the House of Commons that is used as a cover behind which honourable members are now taking shelter for the method pursued by them. There is a fundamental distinction to be drawn. First of all, Lord Randolph Churchill asked leave of the Speaker to address question to the honourable member who was charged with the offence. Having obtained leave, he then asked the honourable member charged whether he was the author of a letter complained of which had appeared in the press. The member charged admitted that he was the author of the letter. That was the foundation of the proceedings-firs t of all the proof that the charge was true, and was admitted to be true by the member charged. The letter was then read, and it certainly went very far beyond what the honourable member for Ballarat is alleged fco have said on Sunday last. Ifc accused the Speaker of being biased; it said that the member had been treated unfairly, and that he had only spoken for a quarter of an hour, when he was closured, &c. The next step after the reading of the letter was to move that the member be suspended from the service of the House. Remember that this was his second offence within one year. The member was asked if he had anything to say. When he had said what he liad to say, he was asked to withdraw. Then the Speaker explained the whole of the matter. He put his side before the House. note this, sir: The charge was made in Mr Conybeare's letter; Mr Conybeare was asked, "" Did you write that letter?"" He said, "" I did . "" He was then asked if he had anything to say in reply, and he made a statement. Then Mr Speaker was asked if he had anything to say. At any rate, Mr Speaker said something. He justified what he had done. Here we see a vitally important distinction between the two proceedings. In the one case the foundation was the admitted authorship of the article. The member was then charged. He pleaded to the charge. The Speaker, who was presumably offended, then made his case clear, and afterwards the House debated the matter. The Speaker said that he did not wish to speak with any heat nor to import any kind of passion into the controversy, and then he went on to relate the circumstances, after which the matter was discussed. During the discussion, Mr Gladstone, perhaps the greatest parliamentary authority of our time, said it was highly inconvenient to call in question the conduct of the Speaker except in a regular and formal manner. But Mr Gladstone, although he held, as I hope we all do, that it is very undesirable to have to criticise the Speaker at a recognised that, for proper cause, he may be criticised like any other person. This point needs special emphasis. - strongly protest against this gratuitous and wholly unwarranted assumption that the action, the conduct, and. utterances of the Speaker may not be criticised, discussed, or censured. The thing is absurd. The highest judicial tribunal in this land is, very properly, not beyond - criticism. Parliament itself, whose ceremonious and formal mouth-piece you are, - sir, is not beyond criticism; and the public may say of this Parliament collectively a hundred times more than it was alleged t l i at the honourable member for Ballarat - said against you, and the people cannot lie punished for so doing. You cannot formulate an indictment that will include a whole nation. It is alleged against the honourable member that he said you were biased; that is not by any means unusual in those holding judicial and presidential offices, as I have said; that you altered Hansard, technically, you admit it ; that you have lost the confidence of the House; I do not think it is saying too much to say that you have Please lost the confidence of half the House. In those circumstances, what has the honourable member for Ballarat said for which he is to be punished in this way ? Excepting that he has said it , perhaps, without those extenuating phrases that a man naturally weaves into his speech when he speaks at length, how has he offended ? They have taken three or four phrases out of the honourable member's speech. They have published the engraving without the frame. They have taken two or three things out of their context, and upon this the Prime Minister, because it has offended his nobility, because some one has dared to criticise him and his work, dared to criticise you, who were at one time his colleague, and are now the Speaker of the House, asks the House to take this most extraordinary action - You were the proper person to take notice of this, and, had you taken notice of it , I should have been one of the first to ask the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw it , because, after all, whatever opinions we may have, while you are the Speaker of this House, we mustalways endeavour to pay you that respect your position deserves. I have not the slightest quarrel l l , with you as an individual, but I claim my right, and shall exercise it to the last ditch, to criticise anything you do or any I most other person does,"" in this Parliament or out of it , in spite of all the endeavours honourable members on that side may make to close our mouths. They have, no doubt, seized upon this pretext to endeavour to persuade the public to overlook their action on Friday last, which will remain unforgotten to the end, in spite of all they do. Standing by itself, it is a monument for decent men to avoid. It is a pillar of flame which will light them to destruction. I recall the Fusion, and what they did, and I know what became of them.

If honourable members will try as far as possible to dissociate themselves from a party view, we may be able to come to some decision which will be acceptable to all parties. Every one who has been watching the proceedings in this House for the past month or so must sympathize very greatly with the Speaker. I very frankly confess that, in my opinion, you, sir, have tried to do your level best to be impartial. I am well aware of the difficulty that any occupant of the Chair is in, even when the predominant party in the House has a large majority; but the position of the Speaker when parties are evenly divided is difficult in the extreme. In my opinion, the honourable member for Ballarat had some reason for what he is reported to have said, AYES. if he did say it ; and I make that statement without in any way desiring to reflect on your conduct as Speaker.",62
753,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,How can the honourable member say such a thing without reflecting on the Speaker?,62
754,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In my opinion, you, Mr Speaker, have been put in an unfortunate position by honourable members such as the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. You have not yet voted for the closure, and it has been said outside that you desire not to be put in the position of having ""to do so. To put you in that position would be to put you in a position which no other Speaker NOES. or President, so far as 1 know, has been in, aud would be most unfair. The Speaker, President, or Chairman of an assembly is an umpire, and the rule is that he shall vote always for further consideration. But you, Mr Speaker, have been so worried by honourable members on the Ministerial side  side.",62
755,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Perhaps we have worried,62
756,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"perhap s I have worried him a little-bu t it was my intention not to worry him so much as to worry the Ministerialists. The Prime Minister took a most extraordinary course in regard to a PAIRS. motion of censure. Every other such motion moved in this House has been debated, from start to finish, without any interruption such as was made when your attention was drawn to standing order 119. Tliat standing order says that all motions not disposed of within two hours after the meeting of the House shall be interrupted, and Orders of the Day called on. It is the application of that standing order tnat has given rise to all the trouble. The Attorney-General and the Prime Minister approached you, and drew your attention to the standing order, asking you to interpret it literally, according to their reading of it . These are the words of the standing orderI f all motions shall not have been disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall be interrupted, and unless the House otherwise orders, the orders of the day shall be taken in rotation. You were asked to abandon all the traditions of parliamentary procedure, and to depart from the practice of the House, by making that standing order apply to a motion of censure, to which it had never before been applied. You decided to do that. You said "" I shall interpret the standing order l it e r a l you interpreted it literally as far as the word "" in t e r r up t e d "" ; the Leader of the Opposition asked you interpret the latter portion of the standrect, ing order literally, and allow the House to say whether the debate on the motion shorthand note ? of censure should be continued, you said, "" No ; I cannot agree to that, practice of the House is that the fixing of a day for the resumption of the consideraSpeaker tion of a motion, or the moving of motion for the continuance of its discusa sion, must take place within two hours after the meeting of the House."" If standing order means anything, it means that, after two hours have elapsed, House shall order what is to be done with the motion before it . I quite admit the practice, has been to deal with motions, other than censure motions, in one way or another within the two hours; but that on a public platform. is not required by a literal reading of standing order; and, in your interpretaway tion of the standing order you made, think, a mistake,",62
757,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That point has been raised, and has been decided.",63
758,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I do not mention these matters in order to reflect on you, because I honestly believe that you' have tried level best to do your duty impartially, and the trouble that has arisen has been due to the conduct of-honourable members on the one side or the other, and I include myself if you wish. The honourable memPrune ber for Ballarat, not having had exthe perience in the chair, may take another view; but I ask whether you ought not, under the circumstances, to give chance to modify or withdraw his statement. He said that you Mansard, or that Mansard had been altered at your direction. We have seen to-night how much importance you attach to the alteration of the wording of a motion. Y ou refused to allow the Prime Minister to substitute "" No v e m be r "" October "" in his motion until the House had given him leave to do so; but it has been proved, without question, that Mansard report of your remarks about the Loan Bill has. been altered.",63
759,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Adde d to.,63
760,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That is an alteration. I dare say that, for all practical purposes, you were justified in making an alteration; but it was a very dangerous, thing to do. [109] It was a very awkward thing to do, and l y , "" and establishes, perhaps, a precedent.",63

764,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Strictl y speaking, if the finds that a motion has not been a put, or that a Bill has not been read thir d time, he ought, even at the risk of delaying the proceedings, to mention the that fact, and let the House make the alteration. Possibly, sir, a serious thing the has not been done in your having that alteration made, but I do appeal to you that that when the honourable member for Ballarat found that the alteration had been made, he was justified in saying so And if he be the lieved that you were acting in a biased because you had taken an extraordiI nary action with regard to the motion of no confidence, I think he was entitled to say that ou a public platform, and should not be deprived of his seat in the House for the rest of the session. I want to come to another point, and that is with your regard to the newspaper. We are adopting to-night a practice which is quite contrary to your ruling. When the honourable member for Maranoa, the other evening, drew attention to the fact that the Minister had accused the Leader of Labour party of being guilty of a "" dirty t r i c k , "" you refused to allow the newspaper to be even read, and you gave him a this ruling, on page 2713Anything contained in a newspaper report is outside the cognisance of the House, and canhad altered not be taken notice of.",63

772,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,No ; I never did anyhow.,64
773,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I have no doubt that most honourable members, if they find have used an expression that is not perhaps quite parliamentary, and do not want their constituents to be made aware of the fact, alter that expression.

I also want to appeal to you to make that allowance which I think ought to be made for the statement reported to have been made at Ballarat, and one which I frankly admit, in the circumstances, I might have made myself. I again assure you, sir, of my belief that you have done your level best to act impartially in your position.",65
785,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Mr Speaker,65
786,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I think that at this stage the House might, perhaps, permit me-and I think it is due to myself-to say a few words, on account of the number of statements that have been made; otherwise I intend to call upon the honourable member for Werriwa. timated to him that I would like to have the opportunity of saying a few words to set a matter right which is wrong altogether, and which has formed the basis of a portion .of these accusations. The statement contained in the report whioh has been read, and which is, therefore, in the possession of the House, is thatThe Speaker had lost the confidence of members. There was a good reason for the motion. "" We have,"" he added, "" absolute proof lhat the Speaker has deliberately altered a Hansard proof."" Let me take that statement first. fact that the Speaker has altered au uncorrected Hansard proof is not an evidence that there is anything wrong. That is a right which belongs to, and is exercised by, every honourable member of this House. No uncorrected galley-proof of any honourable member's speech has any right to be quoted without the authority or consent of the member concerned. An uncorrected Hansard proof of one honourable member's speech should not be in the possession of any other honourable member without his consent. An uncorrected proof of the Speaker's decisions or remarks has no more right to be in the hands of a private member than has an uncorrected proof of any honourable member's speech to be in the hands of another private member. Indeed, it is more important that an uncorrected proof of the Speaker's decisions should not find its way into the hands of a private member, because those decisions are embodied in a permanent record for future reference, and [109]- 2 certainly will be quoted as precedents. Therefore, it is imperative that the Speaker should go carefully through his unrevised proofs and make necessary corrections in order to make his meaning clear, or even to make emendations and additions where omissions occur. This has been the right and the practice of Speakers in every Parliament that has ever existed. Not only has it beeu the practice of the presiding officer of the House, but of every private member of it . I do not know how an uncorrected proof of my remarks, which, I understand, had not even been seen by the Hansard staff themselves before it was quoted in this Chamber, came into the possession of an honourable member.",65
787,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It was sent tome in the ordinary course. Several members interjecting, I in- Mr SPEAKER - Order ! These interjections are disorderly. In this instauce, I am informed that an uncorrected proof of my remarks was in the hands of tomebody else, even before it had been corrected by the Hansard staff when it came from the Printing Office.",65
788,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The proof was sent to me in the ordinary course.,65
789,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I accept the honourable member's statement. The Speaker has a right to exercise the privilege of revising his Hansard proofs, just the same as has any other honourable member; and The if he is to be denied that right, then every other honourable member must be denied it ; and, in such circumstances, no honourable member would be permitted to receive an unrevised report of his own speech to enable him to make his own corrections. He would, also, be exposed to the risk of having errors i u his speech made the subject of subsequent accusations against himself. It will be seen, therefore, that, in exercising the right of emendation, I merely exercised a right which is exercised by every other honourable member. When I examined my proofs, I saw that certain words to which I had absolutely given utterance in this House, were not included in the report.",65
790,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,They were never heard.,65
791,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am not surprised that some honourable members did not hear them.

The honorno imable member has no right to say that. which with by anyIt is also borne out by the official I know well, because really my vocal chords were severely strained into bring members to At the time, the leaders upon proeither side of the House were engaged in a heated argument across the table, to. the House, "" That the Bill be. now read a third time."" I called out in the usual way, ""For the question say 'Aye'; against the question say ' No',"" and had i% That is what is meant by the Hansard report saying, "" Question resolved in the affirmative."" I did not tell the Hansard staff to put that in. They heard it. They must have taken notice that the question had been decided, and, as a matter of fact, an honourable member upon the Government side of the House, after it had been decided on the voices, interrupted .the argument between the leaders upon either side of the chamber, and said something to the Prime Minister, which I caught. That something was to the effect that the third reading had been carried, whereupon the Prime Minister rose immediately and moved, ""That the question be now put."" That is reported by Hansard. We have the statement in the Hansard proofMotion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Motion (by Mr KELLY) proposedTbat the question be now put. Hill read a third lime. It was here that the proceedings were interrupted, and my attention having been called to the fact that the Bill had not been read a third time, I interrupted the motion for the adjournment of the House, and directed the Clerk to read the Bill a third time, he having, meanwhile, drawn my attention to the fact that that formality had not been complied with. It was because I had directed him to read the Bill a third time that it was necessary for me to .make the alteration or addition in the words I have mentioned. In the circumstances, I directed the Clerk to carry out the decision of the House, and to read the Bill a third time before I put the motion. The uncorrected Hansard proof which I have in my hand shows that very clearly. Then, according to this proof, the honourable member for Kennedy, on a point of order, said I maintain that the only question before the House now is "" That the House do now adjourn "" ; but a totally different question has been put. The rest of the report does not affect the point at issue. The main point is that I did not alter a word-no t even a comma - of the report in regard to the question of putting the motion for the third reading to the House. The motion for the third reading of the Bill had been carried on the voices, but the formality of giving effect to the decision of the House "" That the Bill be now read a third time "" had not been carried out by the Clerk, and I directed him to repair that omission, as already explained. That fact had a right to be recorded in Hansard. But this is not the only charge contained in the :statememt. The further charge is made thatThe Speaker was acting in a biased manner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan. The proof of that was the Speaker's ruling on Mr Cook's point of order that the want of confidence motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition should be treated as private members' business. In regard to that charge, I wish to say that, so far as I was concerned, there was no question of partiality involved in the matter. I had simply to carry out the Standing Orders as I found them, and I acted conscientiously in the discharge of my duties. I would remind honourable members that the honourable member for West Sydney when speaking particularly emphasized the point that I had to carry out the Standing Orders as they were. If I had departed from the Standing Orders I sliould have laid myself open to justifiable attack in the House for having done so, but I did not. Motions of no confidence have not previously been interrupted in this House in a similar way because the point has not been raised, owing to the usual automatic suspension by the decision of the Govei'nment not to proceed with other business pending the decision of the House on the no-confidence motion. But, in this case, the Government intervened, and said they would go on with business. Then there is in this statement another implied chargeDuring the debate he left the chair, and Mr. MCGRATH had no doubt that he had a consultation with the Attorney-General. For that reason the Speaker no longer possessed the respect and confidence of the House. I wish to say at once that I did not leave the chair for the purpose of having any consultation with the Attorney-General as alleged, but that I asked the honourable member for Perth to relieve me for a little while on account of an urgent matter having arisen which required my attention, and which had nothing whatever to do with the question before the House.",66

It is a very wise provision that enables this House to sit as a Court on honourable members. The Labour party voted for a law which gave £700,000 odd to certain big sugar-planters and mill-owners; and, supposing I had gone about the country charging them with having been paid £100,000 to pass that law, ought I not to have been charged in this House?",69
836,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"On e of the honourable member's party did so charge us, so far as the Tobacco Trust is concerned; and the honourable member himself made worse charges than that during his election",69
837,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The honourable member will never find me making such charges. He may find me expressing a desire to know why honourable members act in such a way that, if they were in America, they would be charged with having been paid large sums for voting; but I have never said that honourable members have received money for doing such a thing. No authority but Parliament can call such statements in question. There has been attached to the statements of the honourable member for Ballarat an im portance that any one who knows the honourable member would not attach to them. We know that the Labour party have not attached much importance to what the honourable member said; and the honourable member fer West Sydney and the honourable member for Adelaide have made various explanations which tend to show, in the first place, that the honourable member was not responsible for what he said, and that, if he did say it , nobody ought to believe it or take any noticetherefore, that the House ought to take no notice.  correct. That is the honourable member's idea of truth .",69
838,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The honorablo member for Adelaide distinctly said so. ,69
839,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Adelaide said that the honourable member for Ballarat did not know who was responsible for the alterations, and made it perfectly clear that that honourable member was not correct in what he said; while the honourable member for West Sydney went so far as to say that he was quite sure the honourable member for Ballarat did not mean anything by his statements.",69
840,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I never said anything of the sort.,70
841,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I am very sorry I misunderstood the honourable member for West Sydney; and, while I wrote down the words when he spoke, I accept his assurance that he himself did not mean anything by what he said. If the proposed punishment appears to the honourable member for Ballarat rather severe, it is a matter which clearly rests with himself. If the honourable member will say that he did not make the statements, the House will at once accept his disclaimer, and solemnly "" wink the other eye,"" probably knowing that he did make them. Mr FrvAzEB - You ask him to lie in order to do that?",70
842,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is an admission by the honourable member that the honourable member for Ballarat did say it , which is one of the things, in other words, that I have endeavoured to show. If it is the case that the honourable member has been misreported, I hope that he will see that all the reports in the press are corrected immediately. If he now says that he did not say this, he is trying under false pretences to secure a sympathy which he does not deserve. honourable member has urged that it will strengthen the position of the honourable member for Ballarat, and put him back in Parliament for many years to come. By pretending something, the honourable member is striving to get the votes of the electors in Ballarat in years to come.",70
843,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in saying that an honourable member is striving to do something by pretending that something is the case which is not the case.,70
844,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I have no hesitation in withdrawing any such statement. What is the next position? If the honourable member for Ballarat admits that he did say this, but rises and apologizes to the House, and says that he was not aware it was contrary to parliamentary practice to have said such a thing, at once the honourable member tells us what is probably the truth , and gets out of the whole difficulty, aud prevents many honourable members of the House being put in the painful position of having to vote agaiust him.",70
845,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Suppos e he did sayi t , do you not think the punishment to exclude him for the whole of the session is too great? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It only excludes, the honourable member until he apologizes.",70
846,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"If the motion had been to exclude the honourable member for Ballarat for the whole of the session, without any hope for him to come in at any time and admit that he did say thia, I would not vote for it . But that is not the motion. It is open to the honourable member, even at the ' present moment, to say, "" Yes, I did say it , and I withdraw the statement, because I find! that it is unparliamentary, and I apologizeto the House."" Then the whole incident is ended, and no punishment falls on the. honourable member.  draw the statement if he believes it to be true?",70
847,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Liste n to those, rebels over tliere.",70
848,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Honourable member* on both sides must not interject.,70
849,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It certainly appears"" that honourable members on the Government side of the House are the guardians! of the honour of the House at the present time, because, judging from the remarks of one or two honourable members, all One sense of what is due to the honour of the. House seems to have been lost sight, of to a great extent by them. I urg» the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw his statement. If a member is named for using unparliamentary expressions, and persists in his conduct, and does not withdraw, practically the. whole of the House votes against him. It : is the same in this case. I consider that ,. if the ""honourable member for Ballarat. does not withdraw his statement now that it has been brought to the attention of ' the House, not only members on the Government side, but practically the members of the Opposition also should, vote against him, unless he adopts the usual parliamentary procedure, and apologizes- to the House for what he has said.  that.",70
850,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Then all I can say is that the honourable member is very badly advised, because, if he does not apologize today, why should he apologize tomorrow, now that the error has been > pointed oiit to him, and he has had the ». opportunity of seeing the records of Hansard, where, at least, two statements appear showing that there was no alteration?",70

Tf he does not follow that course, then I say honourable members opposite have no escape-if they have any consideration for the procedure and rules of the 'Housefrom voting with this side upon this ter.

861,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I said, "" How dare you say such a thing? """,71
862,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I was just pointing out that surely, in regard to two of 'statements made, the honourable mempraised ber for Ballarat had the assuring. ance of the Speaker himself. Speaker pointed out that in the noise certain words were not heard by sard staff. The Clerks of the House, who are close to the Speaker, were able hear, but the two Hansard men, were further away, did not hear them because of the yelling that was going on. we Surely those who were near the Speaker are permitted to say what they heard. suppose there are millions of people who have never heard anything said in the House, but it does not follow that i not been said. An honourable member who did not hear what was said fro m the Chair would not contradict the Clerks of the House, who noted on their reoords what was said.",71
863,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,No ; not the Clerks of the House.,71
864,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is what is put forward, and I know of nothing outside of that. I refer, further, to the action of the late Speaker of the House when he repeated- was reading some of the remarks he had made. Some of them had been put in .",71
865,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"If you say that, it is that exa deliberate falsehood.",71
866,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement,",71

But the honourable-member forBallarat made a further statement. He said there was a deliberate falsification of the records. Let us look into this. It is admitted that the only thing that happened was that the Clerk of the House did not read the title of the Bill . I am going to show what was omitted from the proceedings, if there was any omission. Instead of the Clerk jumping up and sayingA Bill for an Act to authorize the raising and expending of the &uin of Three million and eighty thousand pounds for certain purposes.",71
875,Mr FHAZER,Unknown,No .,72
876,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is the heading of the Bill , and that is all the Clerk had to read. To pretend that there was a falsification for other purposes, when the only question is whether these words were uttered or not, is to mislead the public into believing that something was done that was not done. The whole question turns on whether those words were read, and tliose were the only words that were necessary to complete the third reading.",72
877,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Ha d we not tunity to vote on that?,72
878,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"As the honourable member saw, the closure was being put on all these motions, and the vote would have been just the same as it was before -2 6 to 14. So that, again, the honourable member for Ballarat conveyed a wrong impression to the public when he led them to suppose that there was anything else involved but the matter of the reading of these For an honourable member to make charges against the Speaker the House itself in such circumstances is to make a grossly incorrect statement, and I cannot understand any man who has any belief in himself, or any respect for the House, pretending that what happened was a serious infringement of the rights of the House, It can only be done for purposes that I hardly care to describe in the House, but if I were outside on the platform, I should criticise them in a very marked manner. The honourable member for Adelaide said that the Labour party, when in power, allowed the right of free speech, but that was only because the forms of the House were never abused by honourable members of our party like they were to-night, when, although it was only a slip of a word .as between October and November, the Opposition actually divided the House, and wasted the time of the House.",72
879,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No .,72
880,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I appeal to the records of the House. Surely, lionorable members will not say they were not wasting time, and we may yet find the honourable member for Ballarat rising with his tongue in his cheek, and saying, "" I withdraw; I have wasted all the day on a thing of this sort. You thought I meant it , but I never meant to do anything but waste time.""",72
881,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw tlje accusation of wasting the time of the House, as applied to the honourable member for Ballarat.",72
882,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Of course, I have no hesitation in withdrawing it . One of the very first things that all lionorable members ought to learn to do is to withdraw unparliamentary expressions, otherwise any House of debate would become a beai garden, and the only man to be listened to with any respect would be Jack Johnson, or some other person of that sort. an opporI make one last appeal to the honourable member for Ballarat, and if he does not accede to it , I shall have no hesitation in voting for the motion, because his action will show at once that he intends to try to get an advertisement out of it , and I , for one, shall not attempt to prevent him.",72
883,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire to correct a possible misapprehension that may have arisen from my previous remarks. It might be inferred, when I spoke about words. having directed the Clerk to read the Bill a third time, that the Clerk had been or neglectful of his duties. I did not intend to convey that impression, because, as a matter of fact, it was the Clerk himself who called my attention to the omission of that formality.",72
884,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [10.36] The honourable member for Werriwa has made a speech of some importance, and containing a great deal of unintentional misrepresentation. On his misstatements he founded a declaration that the honourable member for Ballarat would be able to go to his constituents, and say that he had wasted a day. Does not the honourable member know that the statement on which he founded that assertion is an absolute error ?",72
885,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On a point of order, I submit that the right honourable member is not in order in referring to a statement that has been withdrawn by the honourable member for Werriwa.",72
886,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did not underthere stand the honourable member for Wide Bay to do so, bufc if he did refer to statement that has been withdrawn, he would not be in order.",73

The cords are quite the contrary, yet on that incorrect statement the honourable memthe ber for Werriwa founded a charge against the honourable member for Ballarat, on the same kind of statement this case has been maintained the whole night.

900,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On the merits of the recase, although I do not associate myself with all the language that has been used, honourable member for Ballarat acted and spoke in accordance with the record and appearing in a Hansard proof. Mr. Speaker inadvertently mentioned in his main statement that a proof copy of the report had got out that ought not to have got out. The impression was makleft on the minds of honourable members, ancl would be left on the minds of the abpublic from that statement, that the Opin position had secured their information in a surreptitious, and not in a direct, way. The lionorable member for Kennedy corbrushed that allegation on one side by showing that in the ordinary proof sent to him, as in the proof sent to every other was honourable member, there was contained the actual Hansard record of what Mr. was obSpeaker said on that occasion.",73
901,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Shoul d an honourable member make use of that proof before it,73
902,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member for Riverina has asked that question about nine times during this sitting.,73
903,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"No , I did not.",73
904,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I point out that Mr Speaker was again in error in his general statement in saying that proofs of rulings by Mr Speaker were never sent in this way before. The very opposite Until the receipt of not my last Hansard proof it was always the custom for a ruling of the Speaker, given in the course oT a speech of an honourable member, to be included in the proof of the speech sent to the honourable member who made it . That is a matter about which we need not argue at length. There is, I understand, among the records of this Parliament every proof that has been sent out and returned. The evidence is, therefore, awaiting inspection to determine whether my statement in this connection is correct or not. Honourable members know that it is correct. Until the receipt of my last Hansard proof it was invariably my experience that the rulings of Mr Speaker were included in the proof of the honourable member's speech in the course of which they were given. How would it be possible for any honourable member to correct his proof of a speech dealing with a point of order unless he saw the actual ruling of Mr Speaker or of the Chairman of Committees? Do honourable members deny that what I have stated has heen the practice up to last week? I am sure they do not. That is another special plea put forward to buttress the case against the honourable member for Ballarat, and it is not correct. The honourable member for Ballarat made only one charge.",73
905,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,May I ask the right honourable gentleman a question?,74

909,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do you concur in these statements by the honourable ber for Ballarat?,74
910,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I must ask charge ? the honourable member for Wide Bay to withdraw the words he used accusing an honourable member of making grossly inall, accurate statements.",74
911,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"So far as they remember ferred to myself, I know my statement be a fact; but, in accordance with the rules of the House, I courteously bow your ruling and withdraw it.",74
912,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,The Prime Minister' wishes the lionorable gentleman to answer his question so that he may throw him out also.,74
913,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not alarmed about that. That hardly enters into the question. When the Attorney-General was speaking he endeavoured, to the best of his ability, to arouse the passions of honourable members on his own side by suggesting the heiuousness of the offence committed by the honourable member for Ballarat. I asked the honourable gentleman if he would be good enough to say which of the three charges laid against the honourable member for Ballarat constituted the major offence. The Attorney-General said that the principal offence committed, by the honourable member for Ballarat was that he charged Mr Speaker with having fraudulently-the Attorney-General put that word in himself-bu t we may leave it out and say that he charged Mr. Speaker with having deliberately altered a Hansard proof.",74
914,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Wit h a view to making the proceedings appear to represent what had not taken place. Let the honourable gentleman look at the newspaper reports, and he will see what was said.",74
915,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I will deal with the newspaper report later on, but, on this point it states that the honourable member We have absolute proof that the Speaker has deliberately altered a Hansard proof. The showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his own and he altered the proof to make it in Hansard that it was carried. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Coul d the honorgentleman possibly have a more seri",74
916,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Ballarat had the evidence of the Hansard proof to support him in the membelief that his statement was a fact. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Whether it was true or not, could there be a more serious",74
917,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Attorney-General now says that that is the gravest charge of whether true or not. Does not the honourable gentleman see that the honourable for Ballarat acted on the only to evidence open to him, and that the Hansard proof regularly sent out in the ordito nary way justified him in making his statement ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It did not justify him in a single statement that he made.",74
918,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It was not u n t i l today that he could in any way qualify his statement, because the Hansard proof was the only evidence on which he could go, and if he believed it to contain a correct report he was entitled to say what he did say. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Absolutel y no, because that portion of the report contained no statement about the thir d reading being carried.",75
919,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It did not say anything about the t h i r d reading being carried. Mr Speaker's proof- a yellow proof, not known to honourable members - di d say something about it . But was the honourable member for Ballarat to know that? Mr W. H. IRVINE - Not thir d reading being carried, but about the Bill having been read at h i r d time by the Clerk.",75
920,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is not on the yellow sheet produced and read by Mr . Speaker today. I was present when the incident occurred, and was waiting for an opportunity to call for a division on the t h i r d reading of the Loan Bill , but I did not hear a word of the putting of the question for the thir d reading.",75
921,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,It never was Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes .,75
922,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Attorney-General says that he heard it put, and I am not here to contradict him, but I was sitting in my place intending to call for a division on the thir d reading, and I did not hear the question put. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is extremely likely, but it is hardly the question now.",75
923,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kennedy raised a question at the time, and Mr Speaker admitted that the honourable member's statement was quite correct, but the Hansard record was something different; that is the material point. When there is no difference between member and member, or party and party, a correction is of no importance, but when a Hansard proof is corrected in regard to a material statement of fact about which there is a difference of opinion, not merely between one member and another, but between one party and another, it is a serious thing-. Hansard is altered, it would be wise for the presiding officers to take the earliest opportunity to inform the House about it . How can you guarantee and protect one member against another if that is not done? There ought to be absolute good f a it h between the presiding officer and the House, and between one member and another, when error arises. My complaint at the present time is that the House was not taken into the full confidence of Mr Speaker. That has been the cause of all the trouble.. I do not think that the two charges made by the honourable member for Ballarat are material; they do not seriously reflect on you, Mr Speaker. There must be some amount of discussion of a free and open kind in the country. I do not care about reflections on presiding officers, because I do not think that it is wise to make them, even when there is justification for them. But on the main issue I say that no serious charge has been proved against the about the honourable member for Ballarat. He spoke on evidence that was before him, which he absolutely believed, and which Mr . Speaker has now pointed out was not absolute evidence. He had a proof in his possession in which he absolutely believed. Knowing him as I do, I know that, having been present when the incident occurred, he believed that he was stating the absolute truth regarding the facts.",75
924,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Every one is apologizing for what was said, except the honourable put. member who said it .",75
925,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In my twenty years of parliamentary experience, I have never known a case like this to be dealt with as it has been dealt with . The Government hurried; made a jump, plunged, if you will.",75
926,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The motion was not moved u n t i l they had got one of our men expelled.,75
927,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Thing s did not come off as they intended. They thought that the matter could be dealt with in a summary fashion, and that probably the honourable member for Ballarat would have no defence to make u n t il he was outside the House.",75
928,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Tlia t is an absolutelv incorrect statement.,75
929,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister fought strenuously to get out of the difficulty of moving on a question of privilege. Why? Because if he could have moved in another way there would have been no When open, free debate, in which the facts could be put before the country. ' Havingninetenths of the newspapers at their service to present their views of the case, they would have prejudiced the facts in the minds of the people. There will be a different story told tomorrow, if an honest report about the proceedings is published. The members of the Government have attempted too much. They have attempted to punish the honourable member for Ballarat with expulsion for an innocent offence.",75
930,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We shall apologize to him directly.,76
931,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,You ought to.,76
932,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member for West Sydney that it is a very serious thing to suspend a member for the remainder of the session, whether that session be long or short. In my mind, this action has malice behind it .",76
933,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is time that this language was stopped. The Leader of the Opposition is alleging now that we moved this motion with malice.,76
934,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member for Wide Bay not to impute improper motives.,76
935,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I withdraw the remark, though I do not think that "" malice "" is an unparliamentary word.",76
936,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The offensive.,76
937,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Then I withdraw it . If the Ministry moved the motion witli the hope of preserving the dignity of the House they did not, in my opinion, move it in the right way. for the suspension of the honourable member for the rest of the session they acted with an exaggerated idea of the necessities of the case, and made it absolutely impossible for the honourable member to get a reasonable opportunity of correcting any mistakes hehad made, or withdrawing any reflection he had cast on Mr Speaker.",76

944,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,A little while ago honourable members opposite wanted to jump him righ t but.,76
945,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"There is another phase of this question which has not been mentioned before, and that is that the newspaper on which the charge is based was not published on the day after the gathering at which the honourable member is reported to have made the statement. There are daily newspapers here which pride themselves on their early and accurate news. I think it is today's Argus which accepted as authoritative a report of part of an address made by the honourable member for Ballarat, and that is one of the large daily metropolitan newspapers. The honourable member for Adelaide dealt with what the Attorney-General thought about the reports in those newspapers. I am not dealing with that phase of the question. I am dealing with a phase which shows that it wa3 quite possible for a reporter to have produced an exaggerated reporthe had to do it-whic h would enable the Government, for party purposes, to make an unfair attack on the honourable member.",76

951,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The report in - the Argiis was handed to the Clerk to read, and that is the only evidence of publication on which the Government and the House can found a charge. If the honourable member for Wannon wishes to hit at the honourable member for Ballarat, not on evidence before him, but on the prejudice which is in his own mind, noone man body can prevent him. But no honest minded man would do such a thing even withto a criminal. Why did the Government choose the newspaper that came out with a report two days after the event? They who chose that newspaper, I presume, because the language of the report gave them the largest pull over the honourable member in their desire to humiliate him, to degrade him, and to oust him from the House for a particular period. Having said so much on that point I think that the Government would be well advised if they withdrew the motion.",76

958,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"W it h that exception, think that the honourable member can really plead that he was doing what he considered to be a public service in ing the statement he did. But , in my opinion, he had not evidence to warrant him in saying that the Speaker did soin and-so and so-and-so, any more than he had evidence to justif y him in saying that the Prime Minister did so-and-so and soterms were excised and-so. He had the evidence of the Hansard proof, and it would have his purpose equally well to say, "" It has been said aud reported so-and-so; it has in been reported otherwise later, and the report has been amended in such a way as to alter the whole position and misrepresent what took place."" Had he confined himself to that, I think that no exception could have been taken to his statements; aud, in that respect, he was distinctly in error. I think, too, that the error of attacking the Speaker, particularly in accusing him of doing certain things, is the only justification for a motion of this kind being moved.",77

That is not so. question which I asked earlier several times by way of interjection was whether the proof of Hansard, as corrected by Mr Speaker, did not accord with the records of Parliament as kept by the Clerks. To that question I received no reply. What I just now asked the honourable member for Wide Bay was whether it was a fair thing that an uncorrected Hansard proof should be utilized as a .weapon for an attack upon Mr Speaker, or any private member. I think that was a fair question to put.",77

Of course, honourable upon this side of the Chamber are not so much concerned with the alterations which may have been made in Hansard to bring *hat record into harmony with our Votes and Proceedings as we are with the reasons advanced by the honourable member for Ballarat as proof of the bitter partisanship of the Speaker. This House has a perfect right to bring the honourable member to book for having made such statements. I think he should look at the matter in a fair and manly way.",78

983,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [10.24]. I wish to preface my remarks by stating that I intend to follow a lead which you yourself, Mr Speaker, gave us last week. I desire to distinguish between the honourable member for Lang and Mr Speaker. Whatever I may have to say to-nightand I am sure the same thought is in the mind of every honourable member who has spoken, or who holds any opinion in regard to this matter- I wish it to be understood that, so far as the honourable member for Laug is concerned, we entertain for him personally the highest respect. Any remarks we may make are directed towards you in your official position as Speaker, and not in your private capacity as an individual. Every honourable member realizes what a serious thing it is to impugn the honour or to question the integrity or impartiality of the Speaker, because, after all, Mr. Speaker occupies a position that must appeal to the House generally. Every lionorable member must rely upon him to do that which is fair and reasonable. We on this side especially have to look to you, sir, to protect us, and to secure to us the full exercise of our privileges in the House. Honourable members on the other side, being in the majority, can well look after themselves. But unless Mr Speaker is going to protect the minority, to secure to every member of the Opposition his rights and privileges, and to secure to him also an opportunity to exercise those rights and privileges, without restriction, then we are in a very bad position indeed. I listened very carefully to your explanation to-night in regard to the charge of having altered the Hansard report, and I regret that you should have thought it necessary to make such a laboured statement. The fact that you did make such a long and heavy explanation unfortunately conveyed to my mind the idea that there was some support for the argument and the charge that had The been made against you. I confess that, until you spoke, sir, I did not think there was much in the charge. I was inclined to think that the honourable member for Ballarat had made an exaggerated and unnecessary charge against you. Your own explanation, however, convinces me that there was some ground for the statement which was made. I listened with something like amazement to your own admission to-night-a n admission which I find is corroborated by the Hansard report-that you put the motion that the Bill be read a third time while the House was i u a state of disorder and uproar. The Hansard report distinctly states that honourable members would not come to order, and then it goes on to say that the question was put while the House was in that condition. A more p it if u l admission of weakness on the part of a Speaker. I never heard publicly made. Speaker himself should admit-and I say this with great regret-that he put such a motion while honourable members would not come to order, is pitiable. Mr . Speaker has repeatedly refused-and I commend him for his action-to go on with business until honourable members have come to order. he not take up the same attitude on that occasion? I regret that I was unable to be here, and that, therefore, I cannot speak with any personal knowledge of the matter; but your own statement to-night, Mr Speaker, has convinced me that the honourable member for Ballarat had justification for his statement. I cannot imagine that the Hansard reporters could have neglected to hear or see that the Clerk had read the Bill a third time. The Clerk had to stand up in the ordinary way, and read the words, "" AB ill for - an Act to authorize the raising and expenditure of the sum of £3,080,000 for certain purposes."" are coolly asked to believe that the Clerk could stand up and read those words without the Hansard reporters either seeing him or hearing him. I decline to believe that. I decline, therefore, to believe that the Bill was read a third time, notwithstanding Mr Speaker's own statement to the contrary. I say that with very great regret.",79

989,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"T h a n k you, Mr . Speaker. As to the charge in regard to the partisanship of the Speaker, it is peculiarly fitting that the Prime Minister That the should be the man chosen to introduce such a motion; and this, because of two things particularly. The first is that the Prime Minister himself was the first in this House to degrade the Speakership by making it a political position. 1I have previously from my place here enter e i my protest, and expressed my obWh y did jection to the attitude of the Prime Minister, in the early stages of this Parliament, in going around to meetings, and on every public occasion, referring to the Speaker as a political partisan. He repeatedly referred to the fact that the Speaker was going to vote in a certain Way-that the Speaker's vote was a pocket vote that he held entirely at hia disposal. I do not know whether ib was because of the protests from this side, but it was very evident, or manifest, that some influence had been brought to bear on him , because these statements in regard to the Speaker's position suddenly ceased. Although the Prime We Minister has not referred to the matter since the probests were made, the fact that he himself- I do not know that any other member of his party did so-too k the position that the Speaker, whose fitness he proclaims, was going to be a party man- a political partisan",80

1047,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,1 was just about to draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that he will not be in order in ferring to the proceedings which took place before the motion for the adjournment was moved.,84
1048,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Ver y well, sir. There is a wide range of questions of public interest open to discussion on a motion for the adjournment. I think it is in the public interests that no Government who would attack an honourable member on a certain matter, which he honestly gave to the public in a clear and definite way",84
1049,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is now out of order.,84
1050,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to deal with a most important question, which concerns not this Parliament only but every Parliament. A representative of the people should, in my opinion, be dealt with fairly and reasonably, and should be given a proper opportunity",84
1051,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I rise to order. Honorable MEMBERS - Si t down !,84
1052,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I understood that the honourable member for Wide Bay was speaking to a point of order himself.,84
1053,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I hold that it is within the scope of the discussion permitted on a motion for the adjournment of the House to raise a general question as to whether an honourable member should not, before he is suspended, be given a fair opportunity to make any explanation he wishes to make upon a matter which is of public interest.",84
1054,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable the session. member had an opportunity to do that all night.,84
1055,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Prime Minister took good care that he got no further opportunity.,84
1056,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this in order ?,84
1057,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have already decided, and it is in accordance with our practice, and also with the StandingOrders, that, on the motion that the House do now adjourn, references cannot be made to a matter already dealt with.",84
1058,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am convinced now, against my best anticipations, that the Government are making every possible effort to create a majority for their purpose.",84
1059,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [12.2 a.m.] - Mr Speaker,84
1060,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Li e down!,84
1061,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have only to resay that the statement of the right honourable gentleman is absolutely incorrect.,84
1062,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,If c is absolutely true.,84
1063,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Is the Prime Ministerreplying ?,84
1064,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes ; I have been called.,84
1065,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I will not take the honourable gentleman's word. I wish to know from Mr Speaker whether the honourable gentleman's speech is in reply, and will close the debate.",84
1066,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member will resume his seat. Certainly. The Prime Minister has been called. No other honourable member rose in his place.,84
1067,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Yes ; I rose.,84
1068,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In the circumstances, though I did not see him, if the honourable member rose I give him priority.",84
1069,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Maribyrnong) [12.6 a.m.] - It is not very much that I wished to say when I did rise. T understand that the Prime Minister desired to speak to a point of order.,84
1070,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable member does not know what to say.,84
1071,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do, and I have a lot to say. I do not wish to say it now, but will say it at a more convenient time. It is now six minutes past 12 o'clock, and we have been kept this late after the "" gag "" was moved to expel a member from this House for the rest of",84
1072,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"In order that the Government may "" gag "" their measures through.",84
1073,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"They have started st movement, I may tell the Prime Minister",84
1074,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this in order?,85
1075,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Maribyrnong is not in - order ,85
1076,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Why not, on the journment ?",85
1077,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have pointed out that it is not in order to revive a matter which was decided 'by the House before the motion for the adjournment was moved.,85
1078,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do not wish to revive the matter, but I wish to say that - the. present Fusion Government have started a movement in Australia which will lead to their absolute political annihilation. I rejoice at it . I am looking into the faces of many honourable members opposite who, I am sure, are ashamed - of what they have done. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is this in order ?",85
1079,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member for Maribyrnong is now - distinctly referring to a matter which was dealt with in this House this evening, i Mr Fenton - All right. I do not desire to keep this House any longer. I did not have an opportunity to speak to the motion which was discussed this evening, and I have made use of this safety valve to let a little bile off.",85
1080,Mr BOYD,Unknown,What a lot we lost.,85
1081,Mr FENTON,Unknown,We did not lose much when the honourable member was outside. He will soon find himself in Federal politics where he was in State politics. There will be other opportunities to deal with this and kindred questions.,85
1082,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [12.8 a.m.] - So far as you and I , sir, are concerned, I do not think it necessary to say that personally I have the highest admiration for you, but I wish to say that the Government, or those who hold the reins of power at the present time in the Commonwealth by a fluke, are carrying on a course that can only reflect discredit upon themselves. That is a matter which I might hail with pleasure, but they are publishing to the world the fact that in Australia a Government that holds possession of the Treasury bench by one vote are willing to maintain their position by performing any atrocity that it is possible f politicians to perform.",85
1083,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw those - words.,85
1084,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I withdraw the atrocity. That puts me in miud of a d r ill instructor in the army whom I knew when a youngster. He was an old martinet, adsomething like the Prime Minister, and one of the men whom he was drilling asked already what would happen if he were called a scoundrel. He said that the man would get the cells. "" We l l , "" the man asked, "" what will happen if I think that you are one?"" I think it just the same. The people of Australia have to take their in formation of our proceedings from the reports appearing in the various newspapers, and I ask honourable members opposite if they think that it is a fair and square deal that the members of the Opposition should have to put up with onesided reports. We do not object to the criticism of the newspapers, but later today the newspapers will publish their accounts of what has taken place. They will inform the people of Australia that the Government have used their majoritv to insist that this Parliament shall be conducted as it ought to be conducted. They will fai l to tell the people that the Government, taking advantage of yourself, Mr Speaker, as the majority, have expelled a member from the House so that they can carry on any corruption they like, without calling on you to vote for that particular corruption.",85
1085,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is now again referring to a matter which has been the subject of a debate. He is not in order in doing that.,85
1086,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Is the honourable member in order in accusing this party of endeavouring to institute corruption ?,85
1087,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable member imputed improper motives to other honourable members, he is out of order, and I ask him to withdraw the imputation.",85
1088,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I withdraw the corruption.,85
1089,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the Attorney-General, while standing within the bar of the House, is addressing some one in the strangers' gallery.",85
1090,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I was sent into this o r House by the electors of my division to carry out certain promises that I made on the hustings. Finding here a Government who are reactionary in-every sense of the word, the members of which, at every tea meeting, pleasant Sunday afternoon, and other gatherings that they attend, endeavour to make it appear that we on this side are retarding legislation, I wish to place it on record that we are not doing so. The Government have only a chance majority, really no maj o r it y at all. Therefore, every effort of ours is legitimate when we try to prevent them, not from placing on the statute book legislation which would improve the condition of the people, but from wiping out legislation introduced by the Fisher Government to bring about a better state of affairs in Australia. We have done nothing to retard legislation of a beneficial character, but we have tried to prevent the Government from doing what is detrimental to the people of Australia. I feel that what we have done is warranted by the action of the Government, led by the Prime Minister, which will be a standing disgrace to them so long as Australia is a nation.",85
1091,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [12.17 a.m.] - Yesterday morning's newspapers contained reports of some very interesting speeches delivered at a civic function in Melbourne on Monday night. The Governor General favoured the gathering with one of his brilliant and interesting speeches, and, altogether, I read the account with considerable pleasure, especially the references to the great development here, and the futur e possibilities of the continent. In addition to the Governor General, H is Excellency the A d miral, and the Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Forces, made interesting speeches. When I read the newspaper accounts it occurred to me as peculiar that the representatives of the Navy and Army should have precedence of the Prime Minister. That I regarded as a reflection on the Parliament of the Commonwealth. I have no particular regard and love for naval and military preparations, which, as I have previously said, I look upon as an unfortunate and regretable necessity. But after what has taken posedplace during this sitting, I think that not only should the representatives of the Navy and A r m y take precedence of the Prime Minister, but that there are a large number of individuals in the country who, if honourable conduct and reasonable behaviour is to count, are entitled to take precedence of him.",86
1092,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I call your attention, Mr Speaker, to the insulting language the honourable member is using.",86
1093,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"My attention having been called to something which the honourable member said which is regarded of an insulting character, I ask him to withdraw it .",86
1094,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I withdraw it .,86
1095,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I rise to order. I do not know what words are complained of, but the proper course is for the Prime Minister to move that the words to which he takes objection be taken down.",86
1096,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Since I have been a member the practice has been, when objection has been taken to any words that have been used, for the presiding officer to ask that they be withdrawn, and they have been withdrawn as a matter of course. That has happened in innumerable cases, the records of which I have before me.",86
1097,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I was only expressing my personal opinion in regard to certain matters. I can assure you, sir, that it arouses the very strongest feeling in my breast when I read patriotic utterances delivered at functions similar to that which was held last night. There are some of us who, fortunately in some respects, have made this their adopted country, and there are others who have the honour of being Australian born. But, whether we are Australian born or have come from the older countries of the world, we all have an undiluted idea that Australia is the best country on earth; that Australia should be preserved to Australians; that its institutions should be developed in the best possible way; that every care should be taken to eliminate those established prejudices, customs, and methods of conducting business which have hindered, and to some extent spoiled, the reputation of older countries. For instance, if I may refer Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proThat the question be now put.",86
1098,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That is r i g h t - "" gag "" us. That is the proper way-put the "" g g "" on. a Question-That the question be now put-put . The bells for a division having been rung,",86
1099,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"This is the ""Lynch Family of Bell-ringers."" There is plenty of bell-ringing here.",87
1100,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ask honorablo members to refrain from disorderly interruptions while the division is being taken, because they have already seen the result of disorder.",87
1101,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,""" Gag "" them, bind them, hang them, and draw them! .",87

1105,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I cheerfully offer my assistance, sir.",87
1106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! As there appears to be a disinclination on the part of honourable members on one side to act,87
1107,Mr ARTHUB,Unknown,It is the only way in which we oan protest.,87
1108,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! pursue the same course as I have pursued in similar conditions. I appoint the honourable member for Wimmera and the honourable member for Wilmot tellers for the ""Woes.""",87
