1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. G. H . Mackay) took the chair nt 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. TOBACCO INDUSTRY. PERSONAL EXPLANATION-CUSTOM S DUTIES.  explanation. Last night, on the motion for the adjourmnent, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) made a perfervid and unfair attack on me by stating that I had made misleading statements regarding the tobacco-growing industry. That charge lies, not against me, but against the Minister and the tobacco company - to which he referred. The honourable gentleman stated that the company had written to a grower in Western Australia, "" We are not interested in the purchase of Australian-grown leaf,"" and he charged me with having made that passage the basis of an attack on the Government. The company's letter is in the possession.of the Minister, who should know that the complete sentence reads, "" We would advise that, at the present time, we are uot interested in the purchase of Australian-grown leaf."" In view of the company's subsequent statement to the Minister, that letter is misleading; had the company stated that at no time hod it heen interested in Australian-grown leaf, its meaning would hove been clear. The Minister has charged me with attempting to rake up something unfavorable to the Government; but the comment in the letter from my correspondent was very mild. He said",10
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The purpose of a personal explanation is to enable a.n honourable member to correct misrepresentations of which he believes himself to have been the victim. The honourable member for Porrest is really making a further statement in reply to the Minister for Trade and Customs. If that is his desire, he will have an opportunity on the motion for the adjournment of the House this afternoon.  already shown clear misrepresentation of my attitude by the Minister for Trade and Customs. If the company's letter is ambiguous, the fault is not mine. The letter is capable of the interpretation that has been placed upon it, as the Minister would recognize if ne were fair. I merely presented to the House the view expressed by a correspondent on behalf of other growers in Western Australia, and I asked the Government to investigate the matter. Surely a member is not to be attacked by Ministers for merely discharging the duty he owes to his constituents ! The honourable gentleman made another misleadiug statement",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I again remind the honourable member that the right of personal explanation is a privilege extended to honourable members to enable them to correct misrepresentation. The honourable member may not abuse that privilege in order to argue a subject.  mispresentations by the Minister, and as you, Mr Speaker, have cramped my style, I cannot pursue the matter further.",11
4,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,"On a personal explanation. The honourable member for  extract from a letter writtew by a tobacco company to a grower in Western Australia, in which the company stated that "" at the present time"" it was not interested in the purchase of Australian leaf. On the basis of that statement, the honourable member launched an attack on the Government, claiming that the letter was evidence that the Government's tariff policy in regard to tobacco was reducing the price to be paid this year to growers. Se said that the passage quoted by his correspondent indicated the disposition of manufacturers to' lower prices immediately. I explained last night that the company had never yet bought one pound of Australian tobacco, and that the words "" at the present time"" merely indicated that in future the company may be interested in the purchase of Australian leaf. That I believe to be the case. The honourable member's attack was without justification; before making such a statement to the House he might have had the courtesy to refer the matter to my department. Mr THOMPSON"" - To relieve the certainty and anxiety of tobacco-growers regarding their future, will the Prime Minister arrange for this House to reassemble immediately after Easter in order to decide what protection the industry shall have?",11
5,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"I have already given to the House the definite assurance that this industry will be further considered in the light of representations made during the debate on Tuesday last. Inquiries are being made into the circumstances of the industry, and the necessary information will not be available soon enough to enable us to call the House together to deal with the subject immediately after Easter. If this problem is to be considered thoroughly, ample time for investigation must be allowed. COTTON DUTIES.",11
6,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I have received the following letter from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce:I have the honour, by direction, to confirm telegram despatched you this afternoon, containing resolutions as follow:Cotton - That this chamber records its emphatic protest against the alteration of duties on cotton yarns at the present time owing to the damaging effect which this will have on primary producers engaged in the production of cotton. The direct effect of the change of duty is going to be a reduction in the already meagre returns received by cotton-growers. The industry is a big employer of labour, and for this reason alone deserves special consideration. Disorganization at the present time is most inopportune as the harvesting of the crop has just commenced.",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has had sufficient parliamentary experience to know that questions are intended to elicit, not to give, information, and that the making of statements by reading lengthy extracts from letters is not in order. If the honourable member desires to base a question upon a letter he must summarize its contents.",11
8,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, which is not noted for being a protectionist body, has transmitted a resolution protesting against the reduction of the duty on cotton yarn. In view of the fact that the gross return to cotton-growers last season %vas only about £8 an acre, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will extend^to that industry unthe .same courtesy as he-extended to Y tobacco-growers, and receive at Canberra a deputation from the cotton industry before the tariff schedule is discussed in this chamber?",11

13,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I appreciate the honourable member's tribute to the informative character of my previous statements on the trouble between China and Japan. According to reports in this morning's newspaper, the prospects in the Far East are more hopeful, but the Government has received no confirmatory cablegrams. NA RELIEF.",12

HARRISON - Havin g regard to the hostility shown by some members of the preseut Ministry, while in Opposition, to the super tax on property income imposed by the Scullin Government, I ask the Assistant Treasurer whether, when the state of the finances permits, he will repeal that impost, and so give relief to the suffering taxpayers ?",12
18,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH,"The whole subject of the incidence of taxation will be taken into account when the budget for the coming year is under consideration. I cannot promise relief from taxation generally, but alterations in incidence will have as the principle behind them the doing-of anything that will stimulate and assist in the recovery or development of industry in Australia. UNEMPLOYMENT. DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTHING.",12
19,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH,"I have received the following letter from Mr L. H . Story, of Victoria Barracks, Paddington :I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter 2nd Marcli, 1932, relative tn the supply of a tent to Mr L. MCCurry, of Swansea, and in reply have to advise that, while the names of several charitable organizations for the of unserviceable clothing, &c, have submitted, their activities are confined to the metropolitan area. The question of the to be adopted in regard to distribution country centres has been referred to Army to Head-quarters for direction. In view of the fact that the distribution of unserviceable clothing is confined to metropolitan area, what does the Prime Minister intend to do in respect of the provision of clothing and tents for people in the country areas who have been evicted from their homes ?",12
20,Mr LYONS,COMMONWEALTH,"A great deal of information has already heen given to honourable members in reply to questions on *his subject. The Government is entirely sympathetic' with the object that the honourable member has in view, and will do all within its power to make available surplus stores for the benefit of the unfortunate unemployed.

24,Mr FENTON,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"There have been numerous complaints from postal eontractors regarding the operation of the Transport Act of New South Wales. As those complaints come from so many quarters, and in many cases considerable hardship has been caused, the department will take into consideration, not only the case brought under my notice by the honourable member, but also any cases brought under notice by otber honourable members. I hope, in the near future, to be able to make a full statement on the subject. CANBERRA UNEMPLOYED:",13
25,Mr WARD,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,Is the Prime Minister aware that the New South Wales Labour Government has undertaken to feed - the unfortunate unemployed who were denied food relief by the Commonwealth Govern. ment? - Question not answered. UNEMPLOYMENT. FORMAL MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT.,13
26,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Hon. G. H. Mackay). - I have received from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this morning Tor the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" Unemployment "". Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",13
27,Mr SCULLIN,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Yarra) [10.51] - The moving of the adjournment of the House is an action which an honourable member is privileged to take to direct attention to a subject of great importance and urgency. I do not think that any honourable member will deny that-the problem of unemployment is important and should be treated with urgency. Therefore, I make no apology for asking honourable members to give their attention for some two hours to this problem, which, in my opinion, transcends in gravity and importance every other confronting us. . It is not to be expected, of course, that a debate, whether it last for two hours or two weeks, will solve this problem. We all have responsibilities in this matter. The Government pf the day-lik e other governments-ha s the greatest responsibility, but it is the responsibility of all honourable members to indicate where they stand, and the responsibility of the Opposition to show that it is prepared to support the Government and to encourage it in any sound action that it proposes to alleviate distress and remove unemployment. The States are spending millions of pounds on sustenance. There has been some expenditure on works, but so far as the relief of unemployment is concerned, the expenditure bas been confined practically to sustenance. Something like £1,000,000 a month is being expended in that direction. It is true .that it is the duty of a State to provide sustenance, and in that respect I agree with what was said by the Assistant Treasurer the other evening. It is also true, as has been stated in the Governor General's Speech, that the bulk of employment is furnished by private enterprise, and; therefore, it has responsibility in respect of unemployment. But I do not agree that this Commonwealth has no responsibility. We must play our part and give our quota towards the partial solution of this problem. Those associated with me in this Parliament are concerned because the Government, in making replies to questions, has indicated that practically no action to relieve unemployment is to be taken until after a conference of Premiers has met in May. I regret if I have misunderstood the Prime Minister and the Assistant Attorney-General, but the interpretation that I place on their answers to questions is that certain investigations are being made, a sub-committee has been appointed, and the matter will be discussed in a general way at the conference to be held in May. If there is no action to'precede that, it is obvious that we shall be in the depth of winter before anything is done. It will take some time to formulate'plans and to operate them. The position will be appalling this winter if unemployment continues to increase as it is increasing at present. The figures for the last quarter are not available, but reports that I have received are to the effect that during the last two months unemployment has increased. The position did improve"" during the quarter ending last December, and unemployment decreased from 28.30 per cent. to. 28 per cent. We are likely to revert to the position which obtained last September quarter, towards the end of the winter months. What is the position likely to be for this coming winter? It is obvious that, unless something is done,' we shall have a greater percentage of unemployment this winter than we have had before in any year in the history of Australia. I wish to stress two things that this Government should do. One is that it should push on with the conference, and not wait until May, and the second is that it should grapple with the whole problem, or as much of it as is possible. I am not ungenerous enough to suggest that this Government can solve the"" unemployment problem, or that any Commonwealth Government could solve it, but it can play its part towards its solution. I had too much experience of this dreadful nightmare, which hung over my head for the two years of my Prime Ministership, to .ask another Prime Minister or government to do the Mr Scullin. impossible. But surely if the Government has a plan, action could be taken to call the governments together now, and not wait until May. I ask, further, that in the meantime immediate action be taken to reduce unemployment. I shall anticipate the retort, "" You were in office for two years, and what did you do ? "" We did not solve the unemployment problem. No government in the world could have solved the problem in those two years. We took office in 1929, when unemployment was not half so great as it is today; but, at that time, there was chaos in this country, and the whole financial structure was falling about our heads. We were right in the centre of an economic and financial blizzard, and aio one in Australia could see the path that the Government should take. Yet, in spite of that, within two months of taking office, we made a grant to the States of £1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment. It has been said that the money belonged to the States because it came from the roads fund, but that is .not correct. It is true that we used funds that had accumulated for road purposes, but it was money that the States were unable, in ordinary circumstances, to accept, unless they were prepared to find £750,000 on their own account. They could not do that. We provided them with £1,000,000, and, at the same time, altered the Roads Agreement to prevent even one penny from being deducted from the moneys allotted to the States. It was a grant from the Commcnwealth to the States. The Prime Minister knows that, because he was a member of the Ministry at the time. That action depleted our cash resources by ""£1,000,000, and at that time we were unable to afford - it. The grant was made as a palliative, and as some contribution towards the partial solution of this problem. In 1929, just before Christmas, we provided that £1,000,000. Some nine months later we made a similar grant, but the States met ih conference and allotted a large portion of it to South Australia, which at that time was suffering more than any other State. That money was used to provide sustenance for the unemployed. Later, we provided £500,000, and that meant that we had made a direct grant to the States of £2,500,000. Apart from that, we expended £250,000 in the Commonwealth public departments, and provided £100,000 for relief work in our own territories. It was not a big contribution, but it was an indication that the last Government at least recognized that the ComBut monwealth had a responsibility, and did something towards facing it. This Gobarking, vernment, although it has held the reins of office for two months, has done nothing to relieve unemployment. Yet we were in office less than two months when we provided £1,000,000 for that purpose. Surely it is not unreasonable for ask the present Government to do as at least what we did when we ment, were in office. This Government should be able to do a good deal such more than we did, because the position of the Commonwealth is more secure now than it was twelve months ago, and more money should be available. We had then embarked upon an u.ucharted sea., and were making tremendous efforts to stem the tide which had set in against us. have now passed through the worse of storm. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr. Bruce) has himself truly said in the last few days that the position of Australia better now than it was eighteen months ago. We have corrected our adverse trade' balance, and have built up a surplus overwork seas, because we have been able to stop the flood of imports into this country. hope that nothing will be done to nullify the good work that has been accomplished in that direction. Having built up this credit overseas there is a greater of security, both at home and abroad, regard to Australian affairs. We shall probably balance our budget by the end of the year. I know that certain fortunate circumstances have arisen, at least our budget position is manageable, whereas twelve months ago it was un-. manageable. In the light of these facts, it is not unreasonable of us to ask vernment to take immediate action to provide some money for useful works. The State Governments are ready to undertake useful work; they were ready to do so last year when the Premiers ference carried a resolution asking banks to advance £5,000,000 for repromanently ductive works. It is not unreasonable, . therefore,- for us to ask that at least -- amount of money should now bej, made available. ,. '- rr",13
28,Mr LYONS,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,The banks financed last another year's transactions.,15
29,Mr SCULLIN,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"They financed only the programme of works then in hand. the States desired additional money for the purpose of clearing land, ringafforestation schemes, aud the like. Such work would not be reproductive immediately, but it would ultimately lift a number of unemployed permanently from the ranks of the unemployed. If the Commonwealth Bank requires us to some relief from what it regards the stringent legislation of this ParliaI assure the Prime Minister that we will give to him support in providing relief. We are not asking that wildcat schemes should be put in hand, or - that a policy of uncontrolled inflation shall be pursued; nor do we wish to return to the old policy of reckless borrowing and extravagant spending; but we do require some step to be taken immediately to We stimulate industry, and to provide work the for at least some of the unemployed. Many useful projects could be undertaken even under present conditions. I do not is think that our unemployment problem will be permanently solved until we can put many of the people who are out of on sma'll agricultural holdings. It may be said that that costs money. But I some of the States have already embarked upon activities of this kind. In Yictoria 100 small blocks were made available and 3,000 workless people applied for them. sense The unemployed who went on to these in holdings live in very humble dwellings. But while there is nothing whatever luxurious about their standard of life, but I believe that the majority of them are making good. They are clearing laud, and growing some ol the foodstuffs which they require. It is true that they wili the Goneed help for some time to come; but eventually they will be lifted beyond the need of any such assistance. It may be said that expenditure of this kind is not reproductive. It is true that no money can Conbe provided in this way to pay interest; the but if we can lift. 10,000 people peroff the unemployed list, the amount of money that would have been that spent-in providing them with-sustenance vtfould - meet,-interest and : sinking fund - charges on.i5,066yb00.' . That would be 'a valuable thing in itself;. but a much more valuable consideration would be that ihe morale of our working people was being restored. Life on a sustenance of a few nhillings a week is a poor thing, for men rind women who have been accus- i tomed to work for their living. V.Tge the Government, therefore, to do something of the kindthat I am suggesting. Such work would undoubtedly become valuable to the Commonwealth, for when the depression lifts throughout the world, and the prices of our products increase in the world's markets it would put us in. a far better position to take advantage of the improved conditions. It is of the highest importance that the manhood of our workers should be preserved, and not be allowed to deteriorate, as it will do if present conditions prevail much longer. The problem which faces us will not be solved unless we exert every effort to solve it. It is a paradox that today we have great tracts of land in this country untitled, labourers'idle and hungry; carpenters who are homeless; bootmakers who have no boots to wear; raw materials which are unsaleable; and skilled labour and machinery which is idle. When it is suggested that something should be done to remedy this state of affairs we are told that there is no money available for the purpose. What is money but a token: a medium of exchange, or credits? We have been told that credits will be expanded if wealth is produced; that wealth can be produced if markets are available; that good markets will be available if our workless people are employed; and that we could provide more work if more money or credit were available. So there is the vicious circle. Wages are down, costs are lower than they have been for a long while, the Government has been changed, and, if electioneering statements can be believed, confidence should be restored. We were told that all that was needed to restore confidence was a change of government. The change of government has occurred. I, therefore, feel justified in asking the Prime Minister to give us actions and not words. If the financiers have greater confidence in this Government than they had in the previous Government, let them - how it by providing additional money for works, and let the Government act. ilr. Sr.uUin. A grave responsibility rests upon this Government. I do not desire to raise any controversial questions in dealing with this vitally important subject. I could quote from placards, newspaper I articles, and election pamphlets by rhe dozen to indicate that the members of the present Government told the people that confidence would be j restored and work provided immediately if a. change of government were effected. I shall satisfy myself with quoting from the report of a meeting held by the present Prime Minister, in the Launceston Examiner of the 9th December, 1931. The paragraph to which I direct attention reads as follows:Mr Lyons referred, with impassioned sincerity, to the unemployment situation, and. condemned the Labour Government for having failed to do something for the solution of the problem. ""Tliat, above anything, forced ine to leave the party "", said Mr Lyons. Although the honourable gentleman said that the Labour party did nothing to cope with this problem, I have outlined briefly some of the effective steps we took to meet, the situation at least temporarily. In. addition to those things, we sacrificed £14,000,000 in customs revenue in order to protect Australian industries. There is no doubt that the hope was raised in the breasts of the suffering people of this country that if a change of government occurred their troubles would be alleviated. The people have looked with great confidence to this Government to take immediate action to cope with the situation. The time has arrived for the Government to do something. It should not wait until the meeting of the Premiers Conference in May, which will discuss larger financial issues; it should act at once, and I earnestly appeal to it to do so. Mr Forde rising to second the motion.",15
30,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"It . is not necessary for a member to second a motion of adjournment for the discussion of a matter of urgency, as the Standing Orders require that, before it can be stated by the Chair, at least five honourable members must rise i.n their places as indicating approval of the proposed discussion.",16
31,Mr LYONS,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.10] - The subject to which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) has directed attention is sufficiently grave and important to justify the action he has taken. Although I realise that the discussion of .this subject in this chamber for two hours or longer will not lead to the solution of our problembecause nothing that can be done by this Government and Parliament alone can solve it-ye t suggestions which honourable members may make may be helpful to the Government in dealing with the situation. I , therefore, welcome the discussion which the right honourable gentleman has introduced, and I have no fault whatever to find with his speech. Unemployment is confronting the whole nation and every parliament, and should not be regarded as the responsibility of any one government which happens to be in power. No matter what undertakings may, or may not, have been given by political parties on the hustings, we must realise that conditions are operating in Australia that arc tending to emphasize the seriousness of the position, and to increase the urgency of the problem. I also feel it unnecessary to remind honourable members that some of the conditions surrounding this problem are of a nature that we, in Australia, cannot of ourselves rectify. The Government is very much concerned about the seriousness of the position. Leader of the Opposition has said that, in reply to questions on the subject, I have indicated that practically no action has been taken by the Government to apply remedies^ and that we are simply waiting for the Premiers Conference to meet in May. I have, however, made it clear that tliere was' no necessity time for the conference to be held as as May, for there were other matters, such as the report of the Transport Conference, which would have justified the calling of the conference together at an earlier date. The chief work of the conference to be held in May is the consideration of the financial proposals for the coming year. The Government has, ever since its assumption of office, given close consideration to the subject of unemployment. As I indicated the other day, we have set up a special sub-committee of Cabinet, which has already consulted with the authorities which our predecessors in office consulted. Although we propose to carry this investigation much further, have already reached the point at which we recognize the extreme urgency of the problem. The sub-committee is about to submit to Cabinet certain propositions, which we will put to the Premiers, I hope much earlier than May. At present I shall not be quite definite in my undertaking, but the matter is so urgent and important, particularly in view of the approaching winter months, during which the unfortunate unemployed will have to endure much greater privations than in any other period of the year, that it may be necessary for me to defer the reassembling of Parliament after the Easter recess for a week or two longer tlian was intended at first, in order that a Premiers conference may be called to consider the proposals which we have to make, and other proposals which the State governments may bring forward, with the object of relieving unemployment.",16
32,Dr MALONEY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,Would that conference deal only with unemployment?,17
33,Mr LYONS,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Perhaps not only with that subject; but that subject is, of itself, sufficiently important to justify the calling of a Premiers conference. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that this is the The most important question which we have to deal with at present. We have given certain undertakings with regard to the balancing of budgets, the resuscitation of industry in Australia, and so on, but our success in carrying them out will depend entirely upon whether we can get our people back to work. Unemat any ployment is a problem of vital and late primary importance, which would, of itself, justify a conference. The Premiers will also consider the report of the committee which investigated our transport difficulties, and will make a preliminary investigation into the future financial position of the nation generally. Those matters are closely associated with our unemployment problem, and must be considered side by side. Prior to that conference, and while the Government itself is investigating these problems, we shall be only too pleased to receive suggestions from any section in the House, and from any individual member, whether of this chamber or another place. The right honourable the Leader we of the Opposition has pointed to the action that was taken by his Government during and after the time that I was associated with that administration, to relieve unemployment. I am aware that the grants be mentioned ""were made with the best intentions in the world. It may be that this Government will have to take similar action in the near future. But such a course will not provide any solution of our trouble. The position will remain as it was. It is merely temporizing. 1 agree that now, and during the winter months after the important conferences that will be held overseas-fro m which we hope some measure of relief will result to ourselves and to the world generally-w e shall have to give some impetus to industry in an endeavour to obtain financial buoyancy. It is with that object that the Government is convening the Premiers Conference at an early dare. It would be unwise merely to grant sums of money to carry on work which will not finally be of real value to the community. The Leader of the Opposition says that the position is more secure today than it was when his Government mad<i those grants. That may be, but this Government has obligations which had not then been imposed on the Scullin Government. At that time we were groping in the dark, and did not know exactly what course to fellow. I admit that the action then taken - was justified, as it at least temporarily relieved the suffering that existed. While the position may be better today-and I hope that it is so-the Government now shoulders the obligations imposed upon it by the Premiers plan. On the one hand it has to consider the advisability offinancinga grant to relieve unemployment, and on the other hand it realizes clearly that it has a duty, in accordance with the undertaking that the Leader of the Opposition himself gave, to keep its deficits within pertain bounds.",17
34,Mr SCULLIN,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,That would not prevent a special loan being raised for a special purpose.,18
35,Mr LYONS,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Perhaps not. It might be inferred from the right honourable member's speech that the banks were not so generous as they might have been when they refused'to advance an. additional £5,000,000 for the works programme Of tli° States and Commonwealth last vear. It may not be generally known that, excluding the £7,300,000 that was advanced for the State and Commonwealth works programme, the banks - agreed to provide £20,000,000 to cover the deficits and other requirements of the States and of the Commonwealth. At the difficult period of the year prior r.o the Commonwealth and States obtaining the full benefit of their revenues, the banks will have advanced a total of, - roughly, £33,000,000. I ask honourable members to compare that amount with the total borrowing programmes for works in other years. Had the banks not had the responsibility of finding that huge amount, the bulk of it to cover deficits, they would have been in an excellent position to make further moneys available for works. I am with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that we must not go back to the old period of borrow and burst. I am aware that we could nol at present, borrow money if we desired to do so. Although the Leader of the Opposition declares that the position today is more secure than it was, I remind him that the governments arc now borrowing more money to meet deficits than they did in the past to cover their works programme, and that interest has to be paid on every penny that is made available by the banks for this purpose. It will, therefore, be realized how difficult it is for the governments and the banks to meet the situation this year. Without doubt, the orgy of borrowing in which governments of every political brand indulged in the past is one of the greatest causes of the troubles that now confront us. We have all erred, and I hope that we have learned a lesson. If we, in desperation, again started out on the same track, the community would suffer as the result of our action. Whatever we do must receive very careful consideration, and we must lose no time in acting, because the matter is urgent."" Any money that we borrow for the relief of unemployment must be spent on works of a reproductive character, or works that will be of real value when prosperity is restored, otherwise the position will be .worse than it. is now. - - ' I appreciate the way in which the ; Leader, of the Opposition brought this matter forward. It is a problem which should receive our united attention. Honourable members on this side of the House are co-operating in an effort to save the situation, and we shall be only too pleased to receive practical suggestions from honourable members who sit in any other part of the House. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that no time will be lost in endeavouring to relieve the sufferings of our people. As soon as it is determined, the Government will notify the House when the Premiers Conference will meet.",18
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Cowper) [11.24]. - There is no question but that the most pressing problem in Australia today is how to place in profitable occupation the hundreds of thousands of our men and women who are anxious to work, but who cannot find employment. We must be careful not to adopt temporary means of relieving the situation which will eventually make the problem more difficult. There can be no solution of it in the expenditure of more money on unproductive public works, or even by an extension of the system of food relief. By some means we must make it possible for private enterprise to absorb in profitable occupation the great masses of our unemployed. Despite the fact that there has been a great extension of governmental activities in Australia, it is a fact that at least 85 per cent, of the employment that is provided in this country emanates from private sources. It is in that direction that we must look for relief. An examination of the great depression in the 'nineties shows us that the unemployment problem was then solved-as 1 believe it will be on this occasion-by making our land industries profitable; by placing in employment on the land those who were out of work in the cities. The figures for the decade 1890 to 1900 indicate that no fewer than 116,000 persons, who had previously worked in the cities, were placed in profitable employment on the land, and, as a result of the subsequent development, it was possible to absorb additional men and women in the shops and factories in the towns. The ratio of unemployment fell to 3 per cent. To-day it stands at 30 per cent. I am pleased to know the conference of Premiers is to take place at an early date, because, afterall, our difficulties ean be overcome only by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. At that gathering an effort should be made to divert the millions of pounds that are now spent on food relief, and other unproductive purposes, to the stimulation of private enterprise, so that more people may be absorbed in employment. There is no question that the country districts, with which I am familiar in the north of New South Wales, could give opportunity to place a further 100,000 persons in satisfactory and permanent employment during the next five years if only half of the money that is now used for the unproductive purposes to which I have referred were made available in the form of loans to farmers. Men on the land would, improve their, properties so that these would double their carrying capacity a.nd increase their production. Immediately, our railways would benefit by additional freights; more commodities would be marketed, and, generally, industry would be stimulated. It would be possible for our galvanized iron industry to develop to the output of 70,000 to 80,000 tons per annum that is contemplated instead of the present 25,000 to 30,000 tons.",19
37,Mr HOLLOWAY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"The right honourable gentleman has been telling this story for twenty years, and unfortunate people have been dying from privation in the meantime.",19
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"I shall say it for another twenty years, if necessary. That is the way in which the problem was solved in the nineties, and it is the way in which our present difficulties may be overcome. I know that short cuts to prosperity and to the millennium will be suggested . by my honourable friends on my right. They have been tried in Russia, and the workmen of that country are now in a worse position than when the experiment began. The method that I suggest has been proved to be satisfactory. It was in the country districts that credits first froze, because of the low prices of products and the inability to market the output. It is in the country that the first thaw must take place. When the Government is consulting with the State Governments on this matter it should ask them to put up practical schemes which will provide permanent employment in country districts. If this were done, the men would be paid wages which they' could spend in any way they liked, instead of, as at present, receiving dole tickets which provide them only with a few stipulated articles. It is necessary that the unemployed should be given an opportunity to work, and I trust that the conference will devise means of doing that.",19
39,Mr WATSON,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Fremantle) [11.32] - ' Recently I received two letters, which have an important bearing on this subject. The first letter statesWhnt are you doing-over tlwre* pected much better things from yon. 1 expected the same myself. The letter continuesDifficulties are increasing: here daily. More, and still more, breadwinners are being thrown out of work, and for thousands of families the prospect is black indeed. We are. all approaching the coming winter with grave forebodings. In so many cases the little stock of clothing, and other small assets accumulated in better times, liavu been used up; hence the coming winter has developed into a nightmare, especially for mothers and fathers. One great trouble is that the little money these poor people do get by way of dole or CHSinil work will buy so little. Surely something ean be done to reduce the cost of necessaries. Surely these wretched combines that are exploiting the people can be made illegal. Surely the price-fixing monopolists battening on the life-blood of the citizens can be treated as criminals. Surely these bounties, bonuses, subsidies, sugar agreements, control boards, &c, can be abolished. We were expecting great things from the uniting of all parties, but so far matters are going decidedly from bad to worse. . . As sure as tlic sun shines, if something is uot done to unshackle the people, and allow them to work out their own salvation in this land of opportunity, something serious will happen. That letter was written by a lady. The next is from a fairly large employer of labour. Dealing with the unemployment situation, he saysI t is hard to forecast the future commercially, financially, or industrially, and we can onlyhope for the best. I am inclined to think that there are many rocks ahead, and, steering our present course, we will surely hit them; just how haTd and whether we can got o(T again is hard to say. I am afraid that our present system will ultimately result in sinking the ship. We seem to have it, wonderful country, a population of cranky people, und tyrants for leaders and politicians. "" Both people and leaders are living in hope of sometliMis turning up. Loafing, talking, and scheming constitute the only occupation for those who have a spark of energy left in tlmm. mul ih'eving for those who happen to know how without getting caught. The poor folk who work have to pay for those who won't, so the sooner the whole thing breaks up the better. I do not intend to dwell on these letters, because they speak for themselves. We have to ask ourselves whether we as leaders are striking at the root of this problem. Are we going the right way to solve it? I doubt that we are. Costs arc being continually piled up; the last. Goveniment did good work in some directions, particularly in reducing our adverse overseas trade balance; but'when it. Wc ex- reduced Public Service salaries ancl interest rates by 22£ per cent., it clapped on a sales tax which increased commodity prices. Wc have to ask ourselves whether we are not placing too high a value on all we have and all we do? We in this House place too much value on 'words, and pay insufficient attention to the need for action. Would it not be better to repeal many of the restrictive laws now on. the statute-book, rather than continue passing still more hampering legislation? .At present, people are shackled, and cannot work out tlieir own salvation. We would not expect any one to win a race who was hobbled. Let the people be freed, and they will get back to work, and pull the country out of it difficulties. We should employ every means at. our disposal so to reduce basic values, and to bring down costs to meet the lessened value of our exDorts on the world's market's. This would enable our people to get back to work on the production of those commodities necessary to meet our overseas obligations. What is the use of piling up more costs and increasing taxation when, staring us in the face, are our overseas obligations, which constitute our real difficulties. It is not legislation that we want today, but inspiration for our leaders, aspiration for our people, and nothing will be achieved without a good deal of perspiration as well.",20
40,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"West Sydney) [1.1.37]. - I support this motion, and hope thus to focus public attention upon-the policy of this Government, whose Ministers and supporters promised at the general election to relieve unemployment, but whose administrative acts have all, up to date, tended in the opposite direction. Undoubtedly, thousands of electors supported the United Australia party candidates-at. the last election, because they believed that the party opposite, if turned to power, would relieve unemployment.",20
41,Mr HOLLOWAY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,They promised lo do it immediately.,21
42,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"That is so. During the election campaign full-page advertisements appeared in the newspapers of New South Wales urging the people to vote for the United Australia party, because that party, if returned, would solve the unemployment problem. I have here a poster, designed in striking fashion, which bears the legend- "" Mates help me to get a job."" I heard many honourable members on the other side of the House making election speeches. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Jennings) promised the electors that if his party was successful, those in the unemployment camps at La Perouse and Maroubra would be found work, as would also the unemployed at Redfern, where conditions are extraordinarily bad. Similar promises were made at Coogee and Bondi, which are residential rather than industrial suburbs, and at Marrickville, in the Lang division, and throughout the Barton division. We on this side of the House now demand that the Government shall honour the promises then made, and we propose to expose the trickery in by honourable members opposite in order to win the support of the electors. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), speaking before the election, stated that he could solve the unemployment problem immediately. As a member of a previous Government, he had for over more than twelve months every opportunity of studying the problem in all its aspects. I remember accompanying him on one occasion to hear a deputation of postal workers from Melbourne. Unemployment was there discussed, and the honourable gentleman said that a position might arise in which it would be necessary to take over the whole resources of the country to feed the people. The honourable gentleman; therefore, was in a position, at the time of the elections, to know the facts, and knowing them, he promised the electors ""that if he were placed in power he would immediately solve this problem. . On the strength of that promise he received a great deal of support. Speaking at .Peterboroughbeforetbe re-election, the right honourable gentleman asked: "".Why does not the present Ministry go out and raise on the open market the money necessary for the services of the Commonwealth and the relief of unemployment?"" He went on to say that the Scullin Government could not raise money on the open market, because the people did not trust it. The suggestion was, of course, that if the Scullin Government were removed, a government led by the honourable member would be able to go on the open market, obtain money, and immediately solve the unemployment problem. Now the Prime Minister says that unemployment is the result of world conditions. That was not the statement made during the election campaign. As a matter of fact, much of the blame for unemployment was then laid at the door of the Premier of New South Wales (Mr Lang). It was alleged that he was responsible for hundreds of thousands of persons being out of work. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) made a pertinent suggestion to the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) when he asked that gentleman to get into touch with President Hoover of the United indulged States of America with a view to learning whether Mr Lang was responsible for the unemployment of 8,000,000 persons in the United States of America. According to some honourable members opposite, Mr Lang is to blame for the 'fact that in 1931 unemployment in Great.Britain increased by 7 per cent.., in Australia by 13 per cent., in Canada by 25 per cent., in the Irish Eree States by 18 per cent., in Germany by 34 per cent., in Italy by 32 per cent, and in the United States of America by 5 per cent. Of course, unemployment is a world, problem. We have always maintained that, though honourable members opposite have been reluctant to admit it. The Government claimed at the last election that it could devise means to correct thosituation: hut unemployment is world, wide, .and the world's financial system has everywhere broken down. I venture, therefore, to say that the problem will not he solved by the conferences held here and - e^ewhere, unless the financial system .of ""the world undergoes, a-.radical! change. The last Government held no fewer than half a dozen conferences with the Premiers and others. It appointed all kinds of committees, and the last committee, for instance, made a suggestion for the revival of the paper pulp industry in Tasmania. This proposal sliould be of particular interest to the Prime Minister, ing that he represents a Tasmanian electorate. Other proposals put forward for the absorption of the unemployed related to re-afforestation, irrigation works, and similar undertakings. But what has been the final result? All those proposals had to be referred to another authority before anything at all could be done. I predict that the same result r.vll follow the coming conference with the Premiers on the unemployment problem. Any honourable member could in half an hour devise schemes for providing employment for thousands which would afford relief if he were permitted to give effect to them. But in finally determining what works shall be done we have to turn our attention to the provision of the necessary credit, and this matter is controlled by an authority over which Parliament has no control. What is the use of a Parliament if it cannot determine the question whether the people shall live or die, which, after all, is the issue which the unemployment problem raises. If this Parliament truly represents the people it should be able to deal definitely with this vital subject.",21
43,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member's time has expired.,22
44,Mr HUTCHIN,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Denison) [11.47] - I hope to advance one or two suggestions which may be of service to the Government, and in accord with the views of the Prime Minister. A certain amount of agreement has already been reached by members in this chamber as to the grave responsibility resting on the Government, the supreme importance of the problem which faces us, and the united efforts necessary to make any impression upon it. As was indicated by the last speaker, this is a world problem. If the present depression has served any useful purpose, that has been done in leading the people of Australia to realise that they live in the world, and not to themselves. The mere fact that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) recognizes this surely suggests that in any action taken we should adjust our ideas to world conditions, because failure to do so is largely a contributing cause of our present condition. I deny the general impeachment of honourable members on this side of the seechamber regarding promises made during the election campaign. So far as I am concerned, I promised nobody a job, but I did say that with the restoration of confidence which we believed would follow the necessary political change that we recommended, there was a hope of alleviating the unemployment position. I am not without hope that that will yet hapforthpen. I say to the Government, however, that the implication in the policy speech of the Prime Minister, which was the sole directionary basis on which I contested the seat which I won, was that a change of Government would bring about a substantial improvement, by restoring confidence, and that good results might be expected to follow. If confidence is to be restored more definitely than some of us think it has been up to the present time, T consider that the Government must takp positive action in regard to vested or private interests which have the capacity to assist in the solution of this problem. The Government alone cannot solve it, nor can private enterprise, acting on its own account; but the Government, with the cooperation of private enterprise, surely can make some impression on the problem. If they cannot, we are in a hopeless pass. I therefore urge the Government to take the strongest possible action, and say to private enterprise, "" What are you going to do about it?"" Private enterprise always has undertakings in operation, and others in contemplation, and it is for it to show that under the changed conditions of today, compared with last year, it is prepared to do its utmost to extend the field of employment, relying on the Government for the utmost assistance in that direction. I picture the Government, in this matter, as a kind of self-starter, and if it can prove a selfstarter to the big interests in which our principal hope lies, it will have done a good work. In my opinion, the paper pulp industry offers prospects of making a large contribution to the solution of the unemployment problem, and the Government should do its utmost, in a sensible way, to act as a self-starter to the industry. Its success would benefit, not only Tasmania, but also other States, because a large quantity of the equipment that would be required would have to be purchased in other States. But in endeavouring to set an undertaking of that character going-anc l I am speaking of an industry with which in a measure I have been associated-regard must be had to world conditions. It must be realized that whereas some little t time ago, newsprint was fetching £20 a ton, it is now worth only £14 per ton. We cannot expect industry to thrive or even to exist with a 44-hour week, with extended holidays for employees, and all kinds, of restrictions such as those which became fashionable in Australia at a time when, by reason of the high price of our export commodities, and lavish borrowing by various governments, the abnormal conditions created expensive tastes. If industry is to succeed in the near future, regard must be paid to world conditions, and prospective employers ancl employees must come together in a common-sense way, with a full recognition of the economic circumstances of Australia. I have no desire to indulge in recriminashould tions; but lot me indicate one or two fields which might well be investigated, and, in which, if common sense were shown, employment might be widely increased. The honourable member, for Hunter (Mr James) frequently refers in this chamber to the possibilities of extracting power fuel from oil shale. I suppose that one of ' the sorriest sights attendant on unemployment may be seen in his elector-ate. I have nessed that spectacle myself; it is a tragedy. It will be agreed by anybody who can take a fair view of the matter that the present position of the coal mining industry in Australia is attributable to three factors. One is the fight that the industry has had to make against other competitive industries which have provided the services which coal usually furnishes; the second factor is the lack of vision on the part of employers in the coal.industry of Australia; and the. third is.the->lack of, other, qualities in ithe ployees in the industry. I put it to the honourable member for Huuter lhat if the coal industry is to absorb some ®f its unemployed-and he knows how desirable that is, and how unwilling the coal miners are to take up other lines of work - the industry must realise that we live in the world. It is of no use coming to this Parliament for an export bounty of Ss. per ton on coal. That cannot be given, nor should anything of the kind be done until the coal industry is prepared to recognize world conditions. The shale oil industry is one with which I am familiar, and I know the Newnes field fairly well. The shale-oil industry, born during the period of the late war, struggled on more or less interruptedly until 1924, when it finally collapsed owing to the fact that shale which should have been put into the retorts at 12s. or 12s. 6d per ton, cost 53s. per ton. The plant at Newnes, therefore, went out of use, and lay rusting on the hillside. I visited the field, and looked over the proposition with a party that hoped to revive the industry, which I believe has every prospect of ultimate success. The richness of its resources cannot be doubted. It can be made technically efficient, and the advance made since 192-4 in the treatment of shale enable oil to be produced on an economic basis. But, again, it must be realized that we live in the world, ancl must recognize world conditions. With shale being put into the bins at 53s. per ton, or at any figure like that, there is no prospect of the shale industry absorbing its unemployed. During good times, we saddled ourselves with all sorts of conditions which told heavily as factors in the costs of wit- production. While those costs could be passed on, the wheels of industry could be kept moving, owing to the high prices obtained for our export products, and the ability of governments to.borrow. Butto-day the position has totally changed. I suggest that honourable members opposite, who have influence with industrial organizations, should use it in the direction of making a contribution towards the alleviation of the unemployment problem in the manner that - I have indicated-; that, - employers and employees emshould forget about qjtiarrqls in the Arbitration Oourt, and, jby agreement, come to mutually satisfactory working arrangements as to the hours, rates of pay, &c, that are within the capacity of their in*dus tries.",22
45,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member's time has expired.,24
46,Mr FORDE,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Capricornia) [11.58] I support the motion ably submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin), and I agree with all honourable gentlemen who have said that a grave responsibility rests on the shoulders of this Government. Since the inception of federation, no Liberal, Nationalist or Tory government has been elected with such a large support from the unemployed workers of Australia as that received by the Lyons Administration, and, consequently, a great deal is expected of it. If people are looking for more than they can get from this Government, it is the fault of its present leader and his campaign directors, because of the extravagant promises made by them as to the results that would follow their return to power.",24
47,Mr CAMERON,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,Do not make political capital out of it.,24
48,Mr FORDE,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"This subject transcends party politics. It is well to bear in mind certain assurances given to the people, before we determine at whose door lies the blame for the present position of this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) said that millions of pounds were being made available by the banks today to meet government deficits. Much of that money is being expended ou doles today. The recipients do not want charity; tney want employment, and are looking to the Government to cooperate with private enterprise in providing jobs for them. The Prime Minister said that he will welcome suggestions from any section of the House. I advise him to get into touch with those departments that will play an important part in Australian development during the next few years. The Development Eranch is capable of making very helpf u l suggestions. We cannot absorb at once the 200,000 persons who for years were engaged on public work, while past administrations were borrowing overseas at the rate of £40,000,000 per annum. Xoan expenditure on unproductive public - works has come to an end, and the workers who have been displaced must be absorbed in primary and secondary industries. I warn the Government against the free trade tendencies of some supporters, who urge that the best way to restore people to employment is to pull down the protective tariff wall raised by the last. Government. I received a telegram this, morning, that on the 31st January last. 30,769 persons were unemployed in' Queensland-30,76 9 of a total population of about 1,000,000! It can be taken for granted that there are many thousands more who would not have reported. The primary industries of that State are cajiable of develo2Dment, but those engaged in them are in a highly nervous state of apprehension as to the future, because the present Government has robbed them of the protection given by the Scullin Ministry; I refer particularly to the growing of tobacco and cotton. Cotton cultivation gives seasonal employment to 6,000 people, whilst the tobacco-growers throughout Australia number between 6,000 and 7,000. Persons who were formerly on the labour market are clearing land, erecting fences and curing barns, and cultivating the soil; instead of living on doles they are producing wealth, and are self-supporting. Unfortunately, their industry is in serious jeopardy, because the present Government has whittled down the protection which assured the growers a market for their product. Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",24
49,Mr FORDE,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"I am not attempting to discuss the tariff schedule generally, but so far as the Standing Orders will permit, I am responding to the Prime Minister's invitation to honourable members to make helpful suggestions. In the cotton-growing industry in Queensland, additional areas are being prepared, but the farmers are unable to get advances from the zVgricultural Bank for further cropping, because it lacks funds. Probably the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the Commonwealth Bank, could make additional moneys available to the Agricultural Bank on reasonable terms and conditions to enable the growers to develop their properties and increase their production. The demand by the spinners is now for 20,000 bales of Australian lint as compared with only 1,500 bales when the Scullin Ministry assumed office. During the last twelve months many of the ""unemployed in Queensland have engaged in the production of tobacco. So rapidly has this industry developed that in some - districts there is no unemployment, but it , ""too, is endangered by the attitude of the Ministry. The Development Branch - of the Prime Minister's Department reported to the Bruce-Page and Scullin Governments that a good deal of employment could be provided in ring-barking, and otherwise improving pastoral properties to increase their carrying capacity. Unfortunately, the last Government could not make funds available for the purpose. The gentlemen who now occupy the tieasury bench stated on the hustings that with a change of government confidence would be restored, and the ""banks would make available more money. Ministers now have the opportunity to prove their prediction. The extraction of oil from coal and shale and national afforestation are other problems that should be tackled by the Administration. Of course these schemes will require money, but that surely will be forthcoming if the Government's pre-election assurances were genuine. The people were told that the banks could not .make money available last year, because they had no confidence in the Labour Administration, but that with a change of government all would he well. The paper pulp industry also might be helped. Many public works await completion, but are held up through lack of funds. The capital invested in them is dead, but if they are completed they will become revenue producing and provide employment. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson) criticized the Scullin Government for its administration of the sales tax, which, be said, had increased the cost of foodstuffs. I remind the House, however, that - of annual sales of a total value of .£500,000,000 at least £300,000,000 worth are not subject to sales tax, and that all ""basic foodstuffs are exempt. If the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) believes that too much is expected of the Ministry, he can llame only himself and the members of his party, for he is reported in the Melbourne Argus on the 13th April, 1931 as baving saidBefore you can put the people back industry you must have real money If confidence is restored there is no doubt money will be available' for Australia in London . . . with a return of the United Australia Party to power, things will begin to improve at once.",24

76,Mr GABB,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes , at a price. Australian governments are expending £13,000,000 a year ou doles, and have nothing to show for the money. If some of it were applied to make good the loss on the export of primary products, the net cost to the Australian people would While we are concerned to meet our oversea commitments, the labour of thousands of our young men is being wasted. The only way to meet ourliabilities is by the production of goods. I shall be told that 1 want men to be employed at half rates. We must put this country in a position, which will permit every person to derive some benefit. We must get rid of the hide-bound ideas of the past. We must place our young men oil group settlements, so that they may develop their brain and muscle, instead of hanging round street corners wasting their substance. Another suggestion which I shall make is really a State matter, but the Prime Minister is meeting the Premiers in conference shortly, and he could have it discussed there. Is it .not possible to arrange with the land-holders of .this >- country to employ men clearing, lands that are not af present being put to full use? Even between Canberra and Goulburn one sees dead wood lying all over the country. I'n other places the land is infested with fern, bosthorn, bracken and other noxious weed, which prevents it from being put into production. I suggest that the landholder should provide the men with food and lodging, and that the Government should pay them wages for two days' work, and that the men should work a further two days for their food and lodging. That would bring this country to greater production, and the money that is now expended in providing sustenance would be used in helping our land-owners to grow products for sale overseas. Surely there is some way of solving this pressing problem. Why .should we stay here discussing the bills that are placed before us?",26

80,Mr JAMES,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Hunter) [12.17] - I regret that only two members of the GoTernment side are sufficiently interested in this subject to speak upon it, and of the New South Wales members opposite, only two have been present during this discussion. I refer to the honourable members for Martin (Mr. Holman) and Lang (Mr Dein). They bave not yet spoken. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has asked for suggestions for relieving unemployment, and it is my intention to place a few before him. My first suggestion is that the Government stop the waste of time which is at present taking place in discussing legislation which is aimed solely at the persecution of the State Government in New South Wales, a government which is endeavouring to relieve the lot of the unfortunate unemployed people of that State. I further' suggest that the Government alter the policy that it has adopted in the Federal Capital Territory, of refusing to provide food-relief for the unemployed. This problem is world-wide, and we are faced with the task of finding a solution of it. Certain works, such as water services and the clearing of land, can be put in hand only when we change our monetary system to allow of the utilization of national credit. We are in a state of national emergency, and nothing but the release of national credit will suffice to meet the position. We had a national emergency at the time of the war, and in that case the national credit of this country was utilized. This is no new precedent. If it is good enough to release national credit for war purposes, which involves the killing of people, it is good enough to release national credit to provide useful reproductive employment so that people may live. Various works could be put in hand, but they are too numerous for me to detail during the time at my disposal. At the recent elections, many promises were made. Every hoarding throughout Australia displayed the words, "" Vote for the United Australia party and the Lyons party, and ensure yourself a job and steady wages"". The only person who has been given a job by this Government is the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce). He is to be paid £5,000 a year in salary and perquisites as resident Minister in London. Speaking at the Millions - Club recently, the Prime Minister said that unemployment must be relieved by an attack upon wages and hours of labour. He suggested that the fact that New South Wales had adopted a 44-hour week was unfair to the other States, which had adopted a 48-hour week. He also stated that the basic wage was in New South Wales £4 2s. 6d., and in South Australia £3 3s. He said that the basic wage rate was unfair and industry could not stand it. Let me say that an increase in the working hours per week would create more unemployment. Let m& give a simple illustration. An industry employing twelve men under the system of 44 hours a week would, under the system of 48 hours a week, be able to dispense with the services of one man in every twelve men employed, and still not interfere with its ordinary production. What firm would employ twelve men when its work could be carried out by eleven men ? If New South Wales reverted to the 48-hours system, oue mau in every - twelve - would be retrenched from industry, or eight and a half out of every 100 men employed. Yet that suggestion has been put forward by the Prime Minister as a solution of the problem.' ' There' is no doubt, that the Government's proihises on the hustings tickled the ears of a lot of unfortunate people. Some of them have'lost practically all their life's savings, and many have lost their homes, but they are still striving to live, in the hope that the Government will redeem its promises. Another section of the community is tickling the ears of the unemployed by asking them to subscribe to the ungodly doctrine of bloodthirsty revolution known as communism, and it is likely that the unfortunate people may be stampeded into revolution if something is not done by the Government to give iheni relief. Our workless people have been betrayed once again by a lot of spineless political tricksters. I apply those terms not only to this Government but also to the previous Government, which made similar promises on the hustings in 1929. When.it took office, it fell down its job in just the same way as this Government has done. Because of the lamentable inaction of the Scullin Government, I fell out with it, and I shall fall out with this Government unless it makes ^ some attempt to relieve the unemployed. Why should honourable members be permitted to use the unemployed as political propaganda? It is a tragedy for any honourable member to use the sufferings of the unemployed for his own political aggrandisement; he would be cowardly indeed to stoop to such an action, and, after his return to Parliament, callously to desert them. The honourable member for Denison Hutchin) has suggested that to provide employment, the mining industry should adopt world conditions and .prices. Let nie inform him that other countries, some of which maintain a coolie standard in the mining industry,, have a percentage of unemployment similar to ours."" A reduction in wages and'an increase in hours will not solve the unemployment problem. It can be solved only-by having uniform conditions throughput the world, and by, reducing the hours of labour to Mr James. half of what they are today. Under the existing decayed monetary system, we shall always have unemployment with us'. We should utilize the credits'of this country, and commence such works as water conservation, uuiform railway gauges, and the provision of sewerage systems throughout the country areas.",27
81,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member's time has expired.,28
82,Mr MCBRIDE,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Grey) [12.27] - I am glad to take the opportunity which has been made for us by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) to discuss the jjroblem of unemployment. As a candidate of the Emergency Committee of South Australia, I contested the last election.. I made certain statements on the hustings, but on no occasion did I offer a job to any man. What I said was that the policy of the United Australia party' was to assist and encourage private enterprise, to enable it to employ the bulk of our workless people. Even in the past, when governments were borrowing ancl spending t.o a great extent, private on enterprise employed 85 per cent, of our workers, so that it is perfectly obvious that, in the circumstances existing today, when loan money is unavailable, an additional burden must be thrown on that avenue of employment. It is gratifying to me, as the representative of a primary producing constituency, and as a primary producer, to know that honourable members, generally, realise that the prosperity Qf this country depends mainly on primary industry. That has been contended by advocates of primary industries for many years, but, unfortunately, has not gained much' ground among the populace. But, at present, practically every (Mr section of the community has agreed that it is to the primary industry that we must look for the return of prosperity. Mucb has been said regarding our inability to sell our primary products. .Although I agree that during the last two years many of our products have been sold below the cost of production, yet generally we have been able to get a ready sale for our commodities, and the prices that have been realized overseas have brought additional wealth - to this conn tiy. Our exports of. primary products have undoubtedly made, credits - available-.overseas to meet our commitments. It is to our primary industries that we must look for the restoration of the prosperity which is so much desired. I suggest to the Government that in adopting methods of absorbing the unemployed it should grant assistance to those industries which are producing commodities for which there is an assured sale. We have an assured market only for our primary products, and, therefore, everything possible should be done to help the primary-producing industries. Ways and means should be devised for undertaking the intensive cultu :e of primary products. The great difficulty is, of course, the cost of production. While we are able to sell our primary product? overseas, we have to face the fact that it costs us more to produce them, in some cases, than we can get for them. Some people in Australia have not yet realized that we cannot live to ourselves alone,' and that in dealing with primary. products we must consider world conditions. We cannot base our costs on a fictitious standard. I say definitely that the primary producers of Australia have contributed their fair share to the welfare of the nation by reducing the cost of production to the lowest point that is possible for them. Many of our primary producers are now living under conditions very little better than those of unemployed. It is time that other sections of the community recognized their obligations to the Commonwealth, and made a contribution which would also result in n lowering of the cost of production. If all sections would adopt this policy, everybody would share equitably in the losses which we must face, and they would, at the same time, do something which would enable us, gradually to restore prosperity. I suggest, therefore, that the Government in considering the provision of schemes for absorbing the unemployed should not forget the possibilities of intensive culture in primary production; that it should ensure that only those things are produced which can be sold, and that it should adopt a policy which will equitably spread the loss which must be incurred in bringing production costs down to a profitable figure.",28
83,Mr BLAKELEY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"Darling) [12.39] I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) has introduced this discussion. Honourable members opposite may think that there has not been sufficient time for the Government to determine its policy and programme for the relief of unemployment; but, unfortunately, time has been found to do things which must inevitably result in additional unemployment. It appears as though the energies of the Opposition may need to be directed to the prevention of additional unemployment rather than to the decreasing of the number of people already out of work. The previous Government, during its term of office, made more than £1,000,000 a year available for the relief of unemployment. I do not suggest that the problem can be solved by the granting of that degree of assistance; but at least the sufferings of the people were alleviated by our action. In addition to those grants, the Scullin Government also made available 300,000 articles, or 300 tons, of clothing. While I was Minister for Home Affairs I was able also to provide the Victorian Government with a number of cubicles for use in its land settlement sell erne for the unemployed. As a matter of fact, the previous Government did everything possible to relieve unemployment. After having unsuccessfully tried every alternative in order to obtain money to provide work for the people, it introthe duced a fiduciary notes bill, which the members of another place refused to pass. In all sincerity, I urge upon the Government not to refuse to consider the possibility of a fiduciary notes issue as a means of relieving unemployment. The only alternative to that method of obtaining money is for the banks to make money available. They refused to assist the previous Government in that way, and it was only then that the Fiduciary Notes Bill was introduced. It was said during the election campaign that the banks would not trust a Labour government, but would trust an anti-Labour government, and provide it with money for public works. Although I accept the word of honourable members opposite, who have spoken this afternoon, that they did not personally promise that work would be found for the unemployed if a change of government occurred, I notice that no honourable member has had the temerity to suggest that the United Australia party did not make such promises. In the last week of the campaign £300 a day was spent in advertising in two Sydney newspapers that if the United Australia party were returned to power jobs would be found for the jobless, and unemployment would cease. But the Government is not pursuing a policy which will have that result. Its tampering with the tobacco duties alone will, probably, result in no fewer than 3,000 tobacco-growers being pushed out of that industry. This, in turn, will mean that another 10,000 people who look to that industry as the basis for their employment will be thrown on the unemployment market. The Scullin Government during the two and. a half years it was in office adopted a policy of tariff prohibitions and surcharges which had the effect of reducing our imports by £120,000,000. I do not suggest that goods to that value were manufactured and sold in Australia; but I say, unhesitatingly, that our policy compelled many people to buy Australian goods who, in other circumstances, would not have done so. If the tariff schedule which this Government tabled a week or two ago is a fair sample of what we are to expect, many thousands of our fellow citizens will be thrown on the dole. Let me give an illustration of what is trouble. happening. One of the first actions of this Government was to make it impossible for a company which was manufacturing pearl buttons in Australia to continue its. operations, with the result that 60 persons will be thrown out employment. Mr E. J. HARBISON - When I visited the factory only 22 persons were employed - concerned. there.",29
84,Mr BLAKELEY,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"I was there four months ago, and saw 50 employees at and work, and I was told that 66 were pendent upon the industry for their lihood.. If all the buttons of this that Ave require in Australia were factured here, employment would be vided for 200 people. Take another case. Peek, Frean, and Company Limited were induced, through the policy of the presaying vious Government, to establish their operations in Australia. But this Go the cost of living. vernment has already interfered with the duty on biscuits, with the result that the value of the investment of Peek, Frean and Company Limited's capital here has been nullified. Fifty-eight articles were adversely affected by the first tariff schedule tabled by this Government, and we have been told by the Minister for Trade and Customs that that schedule is only a small instalment of what is to come. It appears to me, therefore, that the time of the Opposition will be fully occupied in trying to preserve such employment as there is in Australia at the present in our secondary industries; and that we shall have very little time to urge upon the Government the imperative necessity for opening up new avenues of employment. The free trade propensities of this Government are-likely to have a disastrous effect upon the industries of this country and the employment of our people. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.42] - Most of us are in accord with the statement that has been made that the unemployment problem is world wide in its incidence. A review of the whole position forces us to realise that the gravity of the position has been increased by the failure of governments to take appropriate action to minimize the conditions that have caused this world-wide",30
85,Mr WARD,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"All governments. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Seeing that the honourable member has interjected, of i will refer particularly to the New South Wales Government. Our secondary industries have been hit harder than any others in so far as employment is But the conditions which have brought about the present state of affairs in our secondary industries are due entirely to the pin-pricking methods restrictive policies of the differentdeState Governments. The solving of the liveunemployment problem must be achieved class by the restoration of the purchasing manupower of the community as a whole- I prodo not mean by a decrease in the standard of living, for the Australian standard of living must be maintained. In this, I ask honourable members not to confuse the'standard 'of living with",30
86,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"The usual hour for the suspension of the sitting has arrived; but as the time allowed by the Standing Orders for this debate will expire in five minutes, the honourable member may continue his speech unless objection is raised.",31
87,Mr EF HARRISON,TRANSPORT ACT OF NEW SOUTH,"We must not confuse nominal wages with real wages, that is, purchasing power. As employers are quick to realise real wages in a rising market, so employees must be quick to realise real wages in a falling market. While employers have done this, employees have failed to do so in many cases, especially where Labour has control of the State legislatures, which impose restrictions causing irritation employers, to the great detriment of industry. While these governments interfere with private enterprise, private enterprise cannot give the desired measure of employment to those who are out of work. We must get back to fundamentals, and see that these restrictions are removed, so that private enterprise may be enabled to develop industries and provide additional employment. I suggest that we should evolve a common basic wage and similar hours and conditions for Australia. That would do much to restore confidence to private enterprise, and allow it to tackle this task in no uncertain manner. The problem is ' a national one. Let us consider it as such. There is a duty upon the Federal Government to take action to restrict State Governments from interfering with industry. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hutchin) spoke of government interference with Newnes. That and mauy other industries have failed to develop because of the action of the present Government of New South Wales. It is the avowed intention of that Government to absorb private industry, and to endeavour in every way to expel prosperity and peace from New South Wales. That State, containing as it does two-fifths of the population of Australia, is the most important in the union, and it is inevitable that the Lang legislation will react to the detriment of our unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. I entertain the hope that the problem may be' partially''solved by the Ottawa Conference, which may determine that we shall concentrate upon certain industries that are peculiarly adapted to Australia. That, of course, would relieve our unemployment. I should like for a moment to touch upon the scheme of sustenance farms that already has been dealt with by some honourable members. If available lands were cut into small blocks and our unemployed placed upon them, we should find that, instead of having the manhood of our people destroyed by a system of doles, our country would be rehabilitated financially and morally. These men would develop their holdings as our pioneer fathers did in the past. They would make sufficient to live upon, and thrust aside the desire to for the false conditions of luxury that are so attractively dangled before them by the labour agitators of the country.",31

Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the foregoing message be taken into consideration in committee forthwith. Mr BEASLEY West Sydney [1.7] The Senate's amendments to this bill were made available to members only this morning. This measure affects in a particular way the State of New South Wales, and I should like more time to study the amendments and their effect. There are in all 22 amendments, some of which, it is true, do not appear to be of much consequence, but others may have, so far as. ,In can judge, ; a most far-reaching effect, and if agreed to, might encroach on the liberty of OFFICERS. individuals, and the right of free speech. Amendments providing for alterations of that kind cannot be treated lightly by this House. As this matter particularly concerns the people whom I represent, I am not prepared to allow the amendments to be considered before I have had an opportunity of perusing them. If some of them are as drastic in their effect as I believe them to be, honourable members should be permitted to consider them over the as week-end. We have not all the advantage of a legal training, and the precise purport of amendments is not always immediately apparent to laymen. I trust that other honourable members will support me in my request for further time.",35

The House meets again on Tuesday, and, if necessary, the consideration pf the amendments could be postponed until then.",35
115,Mr LYONS,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [1.11] - The Government desires to get this bill through as quickly as it can, but it does not wish to be unreasonable. Most of the amendments are of only minor importance. However, if honourable members opposite, after hearing the Minister's explanation, still want further time, the Government will do what it can to meet them. Honourable members will have to demonstrate that they are unable to grasp the effect of the amendments before the Government can consider a postponement. Motion agreed tp^ 'j ' ; Sitting suspended fmm 1.18 to 2.15 p.m. In committee (Consideration Senate's amendments.) Amendment No. 1. Clause 4. i 1. In this act . . "" Specified revenue"" means such revenue . . . as is specified . . . in a resolution passed by each House of the Parliament in pursuance of this act. Senate's amendment - Leave out ""as is"" in the definition of ""specified revenue.""",35
116,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [2.15] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. Tiiis is purely a drafting amendment, but the next amendment makes an alteration in the definition of "" specified revenue."" The purpose of this alteration is to provide for a situation that is more fully dealt with by an amendment of clause 7. Under the clause as it stood, the proclamation therein provided for applied to the whole of the revenues of a State; but if the amendment is made, the proclamation, notwithstanding that certain revenues are mentioned in the resolution of both Houses, may not include them all. It will not be necessary, if the amendment is made, to enforce the rights of the Commonwealth - with respect to them all, but only with regard to those enumerated in the proclamation.",36
117,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [2.17]. - This amendment, we are told, provides that the Commonwealth Government may exercise its rights under the proclamation in such a manner that it need not attach all the revenues that would be required to furnish the sums owing by a State. The Minister,, pointed out that it was competent for this Government to issue a proclamation covering all the revenues of a State.",36
118,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"That course would have to be authorized by resolutions of the Parliament,",36
119,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"But , if the next amendment were made the proclamation need cover only one class of revenue.",36
120,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"I prefer to be guided by the remarks of the Minister. Portions of the revenues of a State are allocated for specific purposes. The State Government has obligations to the people of the State. Revenues are required for the maintenance of hospitals, police organizations, transport services, and a dozen and one other services that a State Governof ment is called upou to maintain. Most important at the present time are the revenues for the sustenance of the . . unemployed. For instance, thirty unemployed were recently forced to leave the Federal Capital Territory because the Commonwealth Government refused to provide food for them. Therefore, they had to go elsewhere, and part of the revenue of the 1 State of New South Wales must now be used for their sustenance. I am not prepared to accept the amendment, if it will enable the Commonwealth to attach revenues that are allocated by a State for the purposes to which I have referred. I am sure that no honourable member associated with me would agree to an amendment that would make that possible. It is strange that this amendment was not found necessary in the first place. I understand that the Government has had Sir Harrison Moore here "" in smoke"" for several days, and he has probably been considering the best means of making it easy for the Commonwealth Government to attach certain State revenues in order, as much as possible, to embarrass a State .Government. The State Government might finally decide that certain taxation could be levied for the purpose 1 of meeting its commitments, and this taxation might affect a section in New South Wales which has had a good deal to say about the necessity for that Government discharging its debts. But if this amendment were accepted, the Commonwealth Government might be in a position to say that it would not attach revenue derived from the source that I have just indicated, but would attach some other revenue. The other revenue might be revenue intended to provide the wages of railway ancl tramway employees. This possibility has already been indicated by the Loan Council through the right hon- orable gentleman in charge of this bill. It is reported that he stated that the amounts owing to oversea bondholders could be taken from the wages paid to the men employed in the railway and tramway services, and by that process to meet the commitments of the Government of New South Wales. The maintenance of the services that are necessary for the well-being of the people of a State is a matter of the utmost importance, and the party with which I am associated has no desire to assist in giving the Commonwealth Government, overriding: authority to embarrass the Government of New South Wales in the provision of such services.",36
121,Mr MAXWELL,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,All this difficulty could be obviated by not defaulting.,37
122,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"I hope that the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) may never want for anything, and that he will never experience the misery that is the portion of large numbers of people in New South Wales; but, apparently, the honourable member is not prepared to regard this matter in the light of the consideration due to others. The State Government, I claim, is entitled to allocate its revenues as it finds necessary in these strenuous times, and no other authority unacquainted with its difficulties and needs should have power to interfere with the funds required for the maintenance of State services. The Commonwealth Government should have no right to say by proclamation that certain revenue would be taken and other revenue left.",37
123,Mr BEUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistan Treasurer) [2.27] - It is difficult to the discussion to the amendment before the chair when we are dealing with a definition clause which relates to clauses in the bill; but I point out to the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) that none of the Senate's amend to ments gives the Commonwealth Governwealth. ment a new power to attach the revenues of the State of New South Wales. The particular amendment under considerarevenue, tion is really to the advantage of State. The Commonwealth will have power, after passing a resolution through cerned. both Houses, to issue a proclamation attaching the revenues of the State of New South Wales, and it will be necesment sary to mention in the proclamabe tion the revenues that wo.uld supply ment of one. the amount needed; but under the bill as it stands, it would be necessary to include in the proclamation revenues that we had taken power to attach. Obviously that would cause a certain amount of dislocation and emrevenues barrassment to the State Government, whereas it might be necessary to attach r=i«i only one or two revenues. This amendment merely gives power to the Commonwealth to enforce its rights with respect to such revenues as may be stated in the proclamation, and are necessary to meet the commitments due. Whatever objection opponents of the bill may take to some of the amendments, this alteration of the definition of "" specified revenue"", and that in clause 7 relating to the proclamation of specified revenue, are obviously more favourable to the States than the original provisions.",37
124,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Yarra) [2.31] - The amendment now under consideration is in effect consequential upon one proposed to be made on clause 7. That is the clause to which members of the Opposition most strenuously objected, and the amendment does at least make it less objectionable. Clause 7 gives power to the Commonwealth to attach the revenues of a State by resolutions of the Parliament. These might relate to, say, income tax, estate duties, and licence-fees. If the proposed amendment be not made, the proclamation following the resolutions will require to attach all three classes of revenue, but if the clause be amended as t proposed, the proclamation need, perhaps, limit apply to only one of those classes.",37
125,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,What would be the purpose of including two or three classes of various revenue in the resolutions?,37
126,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,To make sure tin.: the resolutions attached sufficient revenue meet the demands of the Comracin,37

130,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"I am, of course, opposed to the principle <rf attaching the of a State, but we shall be frustrating our own desires if by making this legislation more general we creata greater embarrassment t'o the State. cannot see how we can reasonably oppose an amendment which will make the application of a very drastic clause less objectionable. The Government seems to be determined to follow the course regard it as valid. arranged for by this bill, regardless of consequences; probably we all shal^ be wiser six months hence. The resolutions for the attachment of any particular classes of revenue will have to come before Parliament, and we shall then have ther opportunities to express our opposiamendment tion to the principle involved.",37
131,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"East Sydney) [2.35] The speeches .of the Assistant Treasurer (i l r . Bruce), and the Leader Opposition (Mr Scullin) have not convinced me that the amendments proposed will make clause 7 less objecthe tionable. It appears to having been induced to sanction the attachment of certain revenues, thus creating the impression that any distress caused to the people of New South Wales will be spread equally over the community, the Government will be able to omit from the proclamation the revenue derived from those interests which ministerialists represent this Parliament. The Government might allow its own friends to resolution escape by attaching only the revenues the interests which Ministers controlling the State's affairs might desire to apply for the purpose of relieving distress among the unemsuch ployed. The Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) said that if honourable members were in doubt regarding auy of these amendments further time for their conmember sideration would be allowed. Upon the amendment now before the committee and that proposed on clause 7 we do require to the amendment. further information that cannot tained from Commonwealth Ministers, but may be obtainable from members of the New South Wales Government. hope that the Assistant Treasurer will postpone the consideration of these amendment*. amendments so that we may consult those in New South Wales, whom we represent.",38
132,Mr HOLLOWAY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Melbourne Ports) [2.36] - This - amendment relates to the most coercive and punitive clause in bill. Whilst I agree that it makes the clause less drastic, the objectionable I ciple involved remains, and as I am opposed to the whole bill, I must logically vote against the amendment. The dragnet nature of clause 7 increases the posto sibility that the High Court will not",38
133,Mr HOLMAN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member entitled on this amendment to discuss clause 7 which is not now before the committee ?,38
134,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Because this amendfurment is really consequential upon an to clause 7, it cannot be discussed intelligently,.unless we can assess its effects on that clause and decide whether it will lighten or increase the of the burden on the State.",38
135,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,When the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce) was explaining amendment he referred to clause 7 in me that answer to a comment by me.,38
136,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"I have no desire to limit legitimate discussion'on the amendment, but the committee is not entitled to review de novo the proposal for attaching the revenues.of a State. .The only issue raised by the amendment to clause 7, is whether the bill shall be modified,' so that instead of the Commonwealth being in compelled to take action by proclamation against all the revenues mentioned in the of Parliament, it may proqf claim only cue revenue.",38
137,The CHAIRMAN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"It is difficult to prescribe the limits of discussion on the amendment when there is a difference of opinion as to whether it will make the clause to which it relates more or less objectionable.

SCULLIN - The resolution must specify the revenues to be attached.",38
139,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,That is so.,39
140,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"But this amendment that will add a second barrel to the Commonits wealth gun. In the first place the resolusome tion of Parliament may specify four or five classes of revenue, but the amendment would enable the Government subwealth. sequently to discriminate. For instance if the resolution attached six classes revenue, the Government would be obliged under the original clause to proclaim all six, and the State concerned would know what to expect. But the amendment will enable the Government to use a comprewould hensive resolution as a smokescreen, of the revenues covered by it, choose one or more that most suited its purpose. intention of the Government should be terribly. made known i.n this House. The Parliament should declare what State revenues are to be confiscated, and the Executive should not have an opportunity to depart from that decision. I am not prepared to give to the Government any discreallow tionary power. I want to know from outset on what revenues it proposes to its predatory hands. The Government should not have the power to make debill cisions unknown to Parliament, and of which nothing will be known until the bailiffs are put into the State Treasury, and hardship is caused to the Governbill ment and people concerned. After all the State would not be in a position to change it requires. its sources of taxation. For instance, the revenue derived from licence fees might be seized. "" In that event it be difficult to carry on the work connected with licencing, and other revenues would have to be taken in order that the departthat ment might continue to function. The Country party is at present much congive cerned about the encroachment 'of the cattle tick on the north of Wales. The State has to obtain revenue in order to combat that pest.

The dagger may strike from any angle, and the general conduct of the State's affairs may be seriously interfered with.

147,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"That removes any objection to the amendment. The orable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) has made a good point. He considers that the Government compelled to show its hand to this Parliament, and not to take action by clamation, which is an executive act. agree with him entirely. But under this provision the Government has to show its hand. The revenue to be received must be specified. The power under clause 7 has already been given to the vernment by both Houses of Parliament, certainly against my vote and against vote of the party which the honourable meinber for West Sydney represents. That power might be used in a way most embarrassing to'a State, because the vernment could attach a whole series revenues. But unless this amendment accepted I foresee chaos in New South Wales.

The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) has indicated that if we vote against the amendment, we shall bring chaos to New South Wales. In any case, the member application of this legislation to South Wales will bring about a state chaos there. All we are asking is that Government should disclose its intention to this Parliament;. It should not have the right to discriminate between various dogsources of taxation. The Government of New South Wales probably intends to meadevise means to raise the necessary revenue with which to meet its obligations, if this Government has the right to Godiscriminate between certain forms of it will be able to relieve a section of its supporters in that State from the effects of this measure. This Parliament would have no control over that. The Government itself, by issuing a proclamation, would be able to seize any class of revenue.

175,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"East Sydney) [3.14] Although the Assistant Treasurer has said that this is merely an alteration in verbiage, designed merely to improve the reading of the bill, I assure him, as a representative of a New South Wales constituency, that I am not prepared to accept' the assurances given hy honourable gentlemen opposite. realise that the Government's object in forcing this measure through this chamber without adequate consideration is to enable it to get at the throat of the Government and people of that State. I have not had the long parliamentary experience of the right honourable gentleman, and I feel that I should be given time to sit down quietly to consider exactly what these alterations mean. If we do not understand the amendments clearly, we certainly do understand clearly the object of the Government in introducing this bill. I realise that there are some honourable members, including the honourable member for Martin (Mr Holman) who are anxious to catch the afternoon train to Sydney. My desire is to do the work that I was sent here to perform, and, even if the full discussion of this bill entails our remaining here days on end, I insist that the Minister in charge of the measure shall supply us with explanations that can be understood.",42
176,Mr BHUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant - Treasurer) [3.16] - The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) made a gross and most offensive reference to myself, but I did not draw your attention to it, Mr Chairman, because I did not think that it was worthwhile my doing so. The honourable member has now said that he does not understand that which I have assured the committee is purely a drafting alteration, that he intends to vote against it and to hold up the business of Parliament. If that is his intention, he will force the Government to show him no consideration. I suggest that I have been reasonably patient during the last hour and a quarter in connection with this measure. The Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) stated this morning that if the amendment to any clause was of such a character that it would be fair and reasonable to postpone it in order that honourable members might give it their attention, the Government would do so. The Government will abide by that undertaking. In the amendment now before the committee there is no alteration that cannot readily be understood by honourable members, although they may disagree with some of them. The Government must insist upon this measure going through today, unless it can be shown We that that procedure is an unfair one.",43
177,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"East Sydney) [3.17] I assure the Acting Treasurer (Mr. Bruce) that I want no special consider a^ tion from the Government.

178,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistan Treasurer) [3.31] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. The object of the amendment is to make New South Wales. it perfectly clear that, so far as specified revenue is concerned, the definition ""the State"" applies in clauses 5 and 6 as well as the clauses which are already mentioned. Behind this amendment is a fairly big principle, which received cona sideration when the bill was before this chamber. I can understand that honour the able members opposite may object to the amendment, because it will have the effect of preventing a State from defeating the object of the measure by diverting its revenue to semi-governmental institunarrow AYES. tions. The Government insists upon the amendment.",44
179,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [3.32]. C - So far as I have been able to understand the explanation of the Minister, it appears that, under this measure as amended, the Commonwealth Government will have power to seize funds standing to the credit of semi-governmental institutions engaged in providing service to the public. The explanation seemed to indicate that such revenue' could be seized even without the assistance of this amendment, but evidently the Government desires to make certain. The Government is prepared to go to any length to seize the funds of a Slate so that these may be sent abroad to satisfy NOES. the claims of bondholders. Even the Rosevear, J. S. money necessary for the upkeep of hospitals and the relief of the indigent may be attached by the Commonwealth. With the winter approaching, this is a very serious matter for many citizens of New PAIBS . South Wales, and I am compelled to enter an emphatic protest against it. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Gullett) chooses to laugh, and I only hope that he will never find himself in the position of absolute want, as many persons in New South Wales are today. This proposal to rob a State of its last penny of revenue is something to which I can never agree. Honourable members . . . opposite, who regard this measure with such enthusiasm, should remember that subbefore very long the same conditions as obto tain in New South Wales may exist in the other States of the Commonwealth as well. t As bad as the bill was when it left this chamber, the amendments of the Senate have made it worse, and appear to be designed to destroy entirely the State of",44
180,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Yarra) [3.35] - This of amendment widens the application of clause 6, which is the most objectionable of all the clauses in the measure, because it gives power to attach the revenues of State without even recourse to the High Court. The amendment proposes to make provisions of clause 6 applicable to State institutions other than the Government. I am opposed to it for the same reason that I supported the previous amendment, the effect of which was to the application of the bill. Question-That the amendment be agreed to-put .

The Auditor-General shall, as soon as possible after the close of each financial year, and whenever requested by the Treasurer so to do, give to the Treasurer a certificate. Semite's amendment-Leave out "" whenever,"" sub-clause 1, insert "" at any other time when "".",44
181,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [3.45] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. The obvious intention under this clause was that the Auditor-General, whenever N requested by the Treasurer, should consider whether there was, or was not, a sum owing by a defaulting State,' and should then give a certificate stating the amount; but the clause might conceivably be read as meaning that the Auditor General should furnish his certificate only after the close of each financial year, 37 when requested by the Treasurer to 14 do so. That would make it necessary to wait till the end of the financial year for 23 the Auditor-General's certificate, and he' would then give it whenever the Treasurer AYES. asked him to do so. Of course, that was not the intention, and we are now putting the matter beyond doubt.",45
182,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Yarra) ['3.47] - There is, apparently, no doubt as to what was the original intention, but there is grave doubt whether the clause, as drafted, gave effect to that intention. Since I am opposed to the principle of the clause, I also object to the amendment.",45
183,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [3.48]. - I share the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin). We have tried to delay the passage of this bill, realizing that if circumstances change, New South Wales may be able to emerge from its present difficulties NA without the financial chaos which this measure would involve.* Time is an important factor with governments as with private individuals. A government may be able to do tomorrow what it cannot do today.",45
184,Mr WARD,NOES,"East Sydney) ['3.49] PAIRS. The consideration of this amendment, particularly, ought to be postponed. There is no disguising the intention of the Government to give immediate effect to the bill. Important decisions will be reached by the Privy Council with respect to the powers of the New South Wales Government, and in the near future that Government will probably have an opportunity of doing what is necessary to meet its overseas obligations without placing undue hardship upon the people of that State. This Government has brought down this bill because it knows that the New South Wales Government made an attempt to place the financial burden on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. If the supporters of the Commonwealth Government approached their friends in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, and urged them to assist the Labour Government in that State to legislate in the best interests of the people; the financial difficulty of New South Wales would be overcome. If the TJpper House in New South Wales withdrew its objection to the financial policy of the Lang Government, that Ministry would be able to meet all its commitments overseas, and also discharge its obligations to the people of the State., Therefore, I am not prepared to assist the Government in giving immediate effect to this measure. If a reasonable time had to elapse before it could be put into operation, it would probably not be necessary to put it into effect at all. Question put. The committee divided. (CHAIRMAN-ME . BELL.)

As was indicated by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) this morning, if NOES. any important principle emerges as the result of their consideration, it will be only fair and reasonable to give a further opportunity of discussing it. The Prime Minister said that if the amendments could be shown to go beyond the principles of the original measure, which PAIRS. was fully discussed in this chamber, he would consider the granting of time over the week-end for their further consideration, but up to now, no new principle has emerged, and a close study of the amendments shows that no such principle will emerge. The Auditor-General gives his certificate, and on that the resolution of the House is framed. If it is proposed to deal in the resolution with an amount smaller than that mentioned in the certificate, under this amendment provision is the made for itemizing the part of the certificate with regard to which it is proposed to",46
188,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"West Sydney) [4.0]. - This amendment, like that relating to the proclamation, gives to the Government discretionary power. I again assert that whatever amounts are to be obtained should be declared and sanctioned by Parliament.",47
189,Mr BRUCE,NOES,This provision is in no way similar to that relating to the proclamation.,47
190,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce) has at his disposal a staff of draftsmen to prepare amendments and supply to him ful l information as to their effect. When that information is not given to the committee, we are justified in believing that Government is trying to force the amendments through without letting honourable members know their meaning and effect. I want the fullest record of such explanations, so that later, when the validity of this legislation is tested, we shall be able to expose to the world the worth of the opinion of that great constitutional lawyer who is assisting the Government. If the Assistant Minister is just throwing to us half-explanations, he cannot blame us if we draw our own conclusions as to his motives. The amendment seems to be in keeping with the general purpose of the bill to make easier the onslaught on the revenues of a State, so that if the Commonwealth is challenged on one point it can retreat to another. I shall vote against the amendment.",47
191,Mr BBTJCE,NOES,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [4.3] - The clause provides that the certificate of the Auditor General, having been given, and that amount, or some smaller amount, having been embodied in a resolution of this Parliament, clauses 7 to 13, prescribing the subsequent procedure, shall apply. The amendment has the same effect, but provides that where a smaller amount than the total which the Auditor-General has certified is included in the resolution, the item or items comprised in that amount shall be stated. It in no way resembles the amendment relating to the proclamation, as the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) has declared. The Government has no power to vary items after they have been included in the resolution of Parliament.",47
192,Mr WARD,NOES,"East Sydney) [4.5] The Prime Minister's promise that amendments of which honourable members had doubts would be postponed, has been interpreted by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce) in a manner different from my understanding of it. The Government is able to obtain the advice of an eminent legal authority who is now in Canberra, but the members of my party have not that advantage. The honourable member for Martin (Mr Holmau) stated a few days ago that a court had regard not to what Parliament intended, but to the language of the statute. Unless we have an opportunity to obtain legal advice we may allow to pass amend the ments whose effect is very different from what the Government intends. What is the urgent need for dealing today with the 22 amendments made by the Senate? If we are allowed to consult our advisers in New South Wales at the week-end we shall be able to vote more intelligently on the amendments on Tuesday. As the Assistant Treasurer is giving vague explanations that merely confuse the issue, I shall vote against all the amendments. Question-That amendment be agreed to-put . The committee divided.

195,Mr BRUCE,NOES,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [4.21] - This amendment relates to clause 7 which we discussed when the definition clause was before us, and we were dealing with specified revenue.

In view 'of the previous discussion on the definition clause, it is unnecessary for me to say anything further. I move30 That the amendment be agreed to.",48
196,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"West-Sydney) [4.22]. 19 - This amendment is likely to bring about chaos beyond expression in an alleged. defaulting State. It provides for the passing by both Houses of the Parliament of a resolution in which all the revenues of a State may he named. It is possible that the revenues - named may be more than sufficient for the purposes of the Commonwealth, and if that occurred the so-called defaulting State would be placed in a serious position. The Government, after passing a resolution through both Houses of the Parliament, could go into recess indefinitely, and still retain the power to name and collect the revenues of an alleged defaulting State. We cannot look into the future, but it may happen that within the next eighteen months or two years we shall have falling revenues and increasing unemployment. It may be exceedingly difficult to meet our commitments overseas, and if the Commonwealth is financially embarrassed, itmay, under the power which is now being given to it, seize revenues that are necessary for the maintenance of vital State services, such as health. If , in two years' time, the whole of the Governments of Australia were financially embarrassed, and the Commonwealth Government before seizing certain revenue of the defaulting States,' were compelled to obtain the sanction of this Parliament, I assert that it would be refused. We should not give a free hand to this Government when it is humanly impossible to determine what the future is likely to bave in store for us. The Government and its supporters seem to be prepared to go to any lengths to save their faces, and to gloss over their past utterances. This is a brazen attempt on the part of the Government to try to sneak this measure through.",48

It is an attitude that has condemned by prominent men overseas.

199,Mr SCTJLLIN,NOES,"Yarra) [4.29] - The point which the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) has taken on this amendment will become a real issue when the resolution is before us. It haa nothing whatever to do with the amendment. When the resolution is brought down, I shall be with the honourable member in fighting it, and particularly fighting against any resolution-which specifies more than one source of revenue. I submit to the honourable member that this amendment does not empower the Government to specify any revenues, or even to issue a proclamation. All ""it does is to enable the Government after a resolution has been passed by this House to separate the classes of revenue in different pro clamations.",49
200,Mr WARD,NOES,Does this amendment mean that after a resolution has been passed by the Parliament the Government may for an indefinite period issue proclamations pursuant to it?,49
201,Mr SCTJLLIN,NOES,"The course will be, I presume, that the Government will request :, the Parliament to pass a resolution covering more than one class of revenue. If that is done any proclamation that is issued will, if this amendment is not - agreed to, have to cover every class of revenue mentioned in the resolution; but if the amendment is passed, it will cover only the classes of revenue specified in it. We have already dealt with one amendment which widened the scope of the bill, and I opposed it ; this amendment narrows the scope of the measure . to some extent and I shall vote for it.",49

204,Mr BRUCE,NOES,"As the bill left this House it provided that a resolution attaching the revenues of any State which was in default would remain in force until the default had been corrected. A later amendment on this schedule provides that a proclamation which has been issued against the defaulting State may be withdrawn before the full amount of the default is repaid by the State, provided that the Commonwealth Government is satisfied that the State concerned is making every effort to meet its obligations. This amendment provides that a proclamation may specify only part of the revenues referred to in the resolution. To that extent it reduces the possible severity of the legislation. Motion agreed to.

The purpose of the first amendment is undoubtedly to widen the scope of the clause, which already provides that any Minister of a State, or officer or person, employed by a State, shall, in certain circumstances, be liable to an offence. It is quite possible, however, that some person not employed by a State may advise or cause a State employee or a Miuister of a State to receive money in contravention of this act, or give or offer an indemnity in respect of moneys paid in contravention of the measure. It is only just that such persons should be equally guilty, with a Minister or State employee, who does similar things.",50
206,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"West Sydney) [4.35]. - I am opposed to this amendment, which shows clearly the lengths to which the members of another place were prepared to go in order to enable the Government to give effect to the. provisions of this bill. As I understand the clause, it will, if agreed to, enable action to be taken against any person who resists the enforcement of this legislation. In this respect it may fairly be compared with a certain measure passed recently by the Irish Free State Parliament. A change of government has, however, nullified that legislation, as a change of government here may soon nullify this measure. It is quite feasible that persons who are State employees feel that they owe allegiance to their State, and may act in such _ - a way as to resist the operation of this proposed law. Surely employees of a State are entitled to their own opinions as to the laws of the country in which they live. [Quorum formed.'] It has happened more than once, that parliaments have passed laws which have been a distinct infringement of the liberties of the people. Not many years ago, a New South Wales Government passed a law which a large section of the people regarded as a direct infringement of their liberties, and steps were taken to organize active' resistance to it. Fortunately, a the word change of government occurred about that time, and the proposed action was rendered unnecessary. Freedom of speech and the liberty of the subject have always been jealously guarded rights of the people of British communities; but if t I interpret this clause correctly, it is a direct contravention of those principles. It appears to me that if this amendment is agreed to, any person who p""ublicly pror tests against the operation of this - proposed law, or who advises other persons to resist the application of it, will be guilty of an offence. To pass such a law would be 'to bring the power and authority of this Parliament into contempt. Those who are prepared to avoid compliance with this law may establish an organization to resist it. Personally, I have always been against the setting up of such organizations if it can be avoided for I realise that though they may serve an immediate purpose, they may not, after that purpose has been fulfilled, readily accept any further direction that their organizers desire. I have always considered that Parliament should safeguard the right of the people to express themselves freely on public questions, and this Parliament has protected that right hitherto. I again remind the Government that we are passing through an abnormal period. Things are happening in these days which are unprecedented in our history, and actions are being taken which, in ordinary circumstances, would not be contemplated for a moment. While some honourable members may be prepared to go to any lengths, in order to impose the will of this Parliament upon the people of New South Wales, it must be remembered that coercive legislation of this description has always proved to be futile. The Assistant Treasurer, when he was Prime Minister of this country, caused Parliament to pass an act which entirely failed to achieve the objects which he had in mind. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway.) is well aware of the measure to which I refer, because its provisions were put in operation against him. The Government may rest assured that this measure will also prove futile, for the all-sufficient reason that the human factor has been left out of account'. I strongly object to any restriction of the recognized rights of citizenship, and I intend to do everything I can to preserve my. right to express such disapproval publicly in the strongest possible terms. It is not properly within the province of this Parliament to take away from our citizens the .right to express their opinions on the laws of this country, and to protest against harsh and unjust legislation. The Government may rest assured that the human factor will make itself felt if ever this law is put into operation, and the result may be very different from what the Government thinks it will be.",50
207,Mr BRUCE,NOES,"Plinders-Assistant Treasurer)' [4.43] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) .has quite misunderstood both the object of this clause and the object of the amendment. It surely is apparent to him that the words "" and any person,"" which it is now proposed to insert in the clause, will apply'only to those persons who do the acts which are made an offence by the provision of the clause. No attempt is being made to interfere with freedom of speech or the liberty of the subject, in the way suggested by the honourable member. All that is desired is that those who contravene the provisions of the clause shall be liable to punishment.",51
208,Mr SCTJLLIN,NOES,"Yarra) [4.45] - The amendment really widens the application of the measure, and because of that I am against it. As the same issues are involved in amendments 13 and 14, I suggest they should be dealt ""with together.",51
209,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,West Sydney) [4.46]. - I approve of the suggestion. I take it that if a State makes provision to protect its subjects for their loyalty to it this clause will render such action null and void.,51
210,Mr WARD,NOES,"East Sydney) [4.47] The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) intimated that the provisions of this clause involve the principle of freedom of speech. I should like the Minister in charge of the bill to indicate whether it will be an offence under this legislation for anybody to address the people of New South Wales, and advise them not to allow themselves to be used as the tools of the Commonwealth Government in its attack against the Lang administration. I am particularly interested, because I candidly confess that if the action I have referred to will be an infringement of the law, I shall be one of those guilty of it.

Nothing contained in this act shall impair or diminish the control of the High Court over the execution or enforcement of any judgment of the Court.""",51
211,Mr BRUCE,NOES,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [4.53] - Earlier provisions of the bill enact that a declaration as to an amount being due and owing is the equivalent of a judgment of the High Court to that effect. This pmendment is inserted because nothing in this measure is intended to cut across any of the powers of the judiciary, or the enforcement of its judgments. move That the amendment be agreed to.",52
212,Mr BEASLET,NOES,"West Sydney) [4.54]. --If I read this clause correctly, it indicates that if there is a measure of doubt concerning the action contemplated by the Federal Government, the clause is for the purpose that that doubt may be overruled when it suits the Government. It seems strange to me that a clause of that nature can be inserted in our legislation. This amendment, gives the Government a let-out if certain aspects of the bill are open to question in their general application. It certainly does not appear to me to do what the Minister indicates that it will do. It merely restricts the powers of the defendants in a case instituted by the Commonwealth. The measure is a maze of legal technicalities, and while I do not profess to have much legal knowledge, I do think it remarkable a clause that is so advantageous to the plaintiff, should be inserted in this legislation. The Government is attempting to save its face, both NOES. coming and going. No doubt those who are advising it feel that a-dragnet clause of this description will bevery helpful to overcome the weaknesses of the measure. Of course, the amendment will be passed, as nobody appears to be interPAIRS. ested except the members of my party.",52
213,Mr KOSEVEAK,NOES,"The New South Wales "" Labour "" men have gone home. Riley, E. C. Mr BEASLEY - Yes , they seem to think that the interests of the labour movement, of New South Wales can be left entirely in the hands of those who are advising the Government, and they do not worry further about it. Perhaps their turn will come later. I object to the nature of this clause. . Motion agreed to. Amendment No. 22-S'cwi.fe's <i»MiM</iHCii(« - After clause 22, insert the following clause:22A. The expiry of this act, or the cessation (whether by virtue of the issue of a.

214,Mr BRUCE,NOES,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [4.58] - This provision is similar to one that is incorporated in the Acts Interpretation Act. On the expiration of the operation of an act or proclamation, there may be some things which arose during the currency of the act or proclamation which are not finalized. If such a provision as this did not exist, there would be a complete cessation of the that powers of the Commonwealth in regard to those matters. This amendment will enable the provisions of the act or proclamation to operate until the situation, has been cleared up.",52
215,Mr SCTJLLIN,NOES,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 0 ] agreed with the general principles of the bill, we should take little exception to this amendment, but as we oppose the bill generally we cannot agree to the amendment. The effect of this amendment, if passed, would be that after the period for which this legislation was to have effect had expired, action taken under it could be continued until everything was cleaned up to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government. In order to meet the objections of honourable members, the term of this proposed legislation was deliberately limited to two years, and I object to that term being extended under any pretext whatever.",53
216,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"If the Government desires to keep the act in force longer than that, it should do so by bringing in fresh legislation.",53
217,Mr SCTJLLIN,NOES,"Yes . This amendment also provides for the period in which a proclamation has been issued, but that matter is in the hands of the Government.",53
218,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"West Sydney) [5.21. - The life of this measure was determined after its provisions had been made public. The period was fixed in response to criticism from the States, particularly from Tasmania. The Attor.ney-General of that State declared that he would use all his power and authority to defeat the bill unless the period of its operation limited.",53

The Premier of Tasmania, when objecting to the measure, merely voiced the feeling of the majority of the people of that State. He said that he was prepared to join with other objecting States to protest against the legislation. The idea seemed to be that his party hopes to change after the expiration of two years, the government in New South Wales, and the present Commonwealth Government does not desire the., provisions of this measure to be used against a State Government of which it approves. But should the present Government be returned, the Commonwealth Government desires to have power to heap up obligations against it, so that it may be embarrassed for an indefinite period. B y inserting the two years limitation, the Government has sought to placate those State Governments which are alleged to be meeting their obligations, but by this dragnet amendment it will still retain power to harass the New South Wales Government, even after the expiration of two years. If the Commonwealth Government has confidence in this measure, it should leave the period of two years ivichaii£rcd.

223,Mr LYONS,NOES,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.17] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I desire to notify honourable members that the Government intends prior to the Easter adjournment to dispose of the Bill , the War Service purHomes Bill , and the Lands Acquisition ill . Those measures will be taken in conthat order. Possibly at an earlier stage the House will be asked to deal with proresolutions consequent upon the passage public of the Einancial Agreements Enforcement Bill . It may be necessary to have a late sitting on one night next week, but and the Government desires to avoid that if possible. When the time . expired for the disof the formal adjournment motion and this morning, the Government was comanxious to proceed with the consideration Bepreof the Senate's amendments to the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill ; sit there was no wish to curtail the discussion on the subject of unemployment, and be I promised that the extra couple of hours that might have been obtained today by extending the time allowed for the debate would be made available to honourable the members at a later stage. The Government will do everything possible to make two hours, or even a longer period, available to honourable members next week. This may involve a late sitting, but we shall endeavour to Garry out our promise prior to the Easter adjournment. It is proposed to l i m it the time for which each honourable member will be permitted to speak on the subject of unemployment; comas it was limited this morning by the and Standing Orders, the object being, not to prevent discussion, but to provide an opportunity for as many members as sible to participate in the debate rather week. than have the time monopolized by a few honourable members. It is intended to adjourn on Thursday for the Easter recess.",54
224,Mr HUGIIKS,NOES,"Will the House sit the morning? Mr LYON'S - That may be necessary. The Government is willing to meet convenience of honourable members. bad beeuiu tended to have a recess three weeks, but in view of the possibility of a meeting of the State Premiers diseuiss the unemployment problem, may ""bo necessary to have an adjournment of a month.

227,Mr HOLLOWAY,NOES,"Melbourne Ports) [5.21] - I was anxious this morning join in the debate on the unemployment problem, in order to impress-upon the House the imperative necessity for imtime miidiatc action. Being shut out, under the Standing Orders. I intended to speak on the motion for the adjournment this afternoon; but if the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) assures us that two hours will be allowed next week for the distage cussion of the matter, and that the time allotted will not be in the late hours of Thursday afternoon",55
228,Mr LYONS,NOES,Th c Government underHindmarsh takes to - allot a proper time for the cussion of the inatter.,55
229,Mr HOLLOWAY,NOES,"On that promise, posI shall reserve my remarks until next",55
230,Mr JENNINGS,NOES,"South Sydney) [5.23] - During the debate on the unemployment problem this morning, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. in Beasley) said that at the time of the last election I had promised jobs to the men in an unemployment camp at the Maroubra. At that time, there was no It such camp at Maroubra. But no such of statement as was alleged by the honourable member to have heen made by mr to was made at any place in my electorate. it The only statements made by me in regard to the provision of employment were keeping with the policy speech of the Leader of the United Australia party (Mr Lyons) in the Sydney town hall. "" It was said by an honourable member opposite that of the New Soutli Wales representatives on this side of the House the only members present during the the debate were the honourable members for Lang (Mr Dein) and Martin (Mr. ; Holman). The honourable member for Weutworth (Mr E. J"" Harrison), and myself were in the House when this statein ment was made, and remained in the House during the discussion. I regret that there is a tendency in this House to make party capital of unemployment. I that in futuro, instead of doing this, will honourable members opposite will cooperate with the Government in assisting and the to solve this problem.",55
231,Mr BEASLEY,NOES,"West Sydney) [5.25 |. - No doubt the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for South Sydney to (Mr Jennings) go down well with the party of which he is a member. Nevertheless, what I have said is true; at the of the last election the unemployment situation was exploited by the present Ministers and their supporters to a degree previously unknown in the history of Australia. Members opposite used evei-y means at their disposal to take advanof it. Full-paged advertisements appeared from day to day in the leading newspapers; literature of an unprecedented character was distributed among the people. The honourable member for (Mr Makin) has shown me disa series of pamphlets distributed in a Victorian electorate, in publishing which the pany opposite descended to the lowest level. It is all very well for members site to talk now about the need for that no party capital is made over this value. problem. They are comfortably in office, but to get on to the ministerial benches they endeavoured to blacken as much as possible the characters of honourable bers now sitting with me on this side the chamber. Tlieir present talk will go down with me for a moment. In remarks about the camp at Maroubra, honourable member for South Sydney only splitting hairs. The people of South Sydney electorate know that wns an unemployed camp at La Perouse long before the last election, and it that camp, known as the "" Happy Valley "" camp that I referred. Similar promises to those made in the South ney electorate were made by the United Australia party in other electorates. desire the reminder to go back - to Happy Valley, Redfern, and other thickly popuas lated centres in South Sydney and neighbouring electorates that promises were made by the honourable member and others of his party, and that now is the time for giving eifect to The Leader of the United Australia (Mr Lyons) stated in the Sydney town hall that prosperity would be restored immediately a change of government took place; and I intend to see that members opposite now stand up to their responsibilities in that regard. It is not a question of taking political advantages, but of compelling members to do the job for which they were elected. It is my intention to take care that the present Government does not neglect the claims of - the unemployed. The policy of my party is therefore to focus attention on the many pre-election promises made by the Goveniment - This should 'be done in the interests of those unfortunates who are now without employment, whose - welfare depends on the provision of work, aud the resumption of normal commercial activities. The Commonwealth Government controls the credit resources of this country, and therefore it has more power than the State Governments to restore normal conditions. In this matter, the State Governments are practically powerless. These gentlemen knew that, bnt they did not say that at the general election. I, and my colleagues, will therefore Ur. Beasleu. take every opportunity of exposing them oppoin their true light, so that the people of seeing New South Wales may know their real",55
232,Mr EIORDAN,NOES,"Kennedy) [5.28J The people were undoubtedly led to believe at the last election that if the United memAustralia party were returned to power, of employment would be found for the worknot less, and money would flow intp Aushis tralia as the result of the change of the government. Although a confidence trick is was played upon the-people by the party the now in power, a large number of thinkthere ing people in the Commonwealth were under the impression that the advent of was to that party to power would result in money being made available for the provision of employment. At the last State Sydelectiou in Queensland, the Nationalist party used the placard ""£2,000,000 for 1 10,000 - jobs""; but unemployment has never been so widespread in Queensland it has since the return of the Nationalist Government in that State. They these baulked the efforts of the Scullin Government to relieve unemployment. Now they have power and responsibility, and them. some genuine effort to cope with this party pressing problem is due from them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.30 p.m.",56
