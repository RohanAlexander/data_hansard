7,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Corinella);- I suppose that we are all agreed that a measure of this kind, affecting as it does the representation of the States in this House of the Federal. Parliament, is not only of interest to hon1 orable members, but of interest and considerable, importance; to the public at large. - I do not agree with the view which has been expressed that it is immaterial from what States representation comes, because On many large questions differences of opinion will inevitably be caused by the differences pf opinion in the Stated from which members come, since electors will select as their Re- representatives men who hold their views. I had not the pleasure of hearing the speech delivered by the Minister of Home Affairs in moving the second reading of the Bill, but, thanks to his courtesy, I had an early opportunity to peruse the official report of it, and perhaps I may be permitted, without presumption, to express my disappointment with it, for two reasons First, because-wit h every respect to the honourable and learned gentleman-h e seems to me to have passed by, rather than to have met, the main legal difficulties connected with this subject; and', secondly, because he refrained from giving the House any information whatever as to what the practical working out of the Government proposals would mean. Both those matters seem to me of great importance, as to which the House had a right to hear from the Minister, and I regret that he did not think fit to deal with them. As a representative of Victoria. I feel that I have a somewhat more special interest in this measure than have the representatives of other States, because Victoria is threatened with a diminished representation as. the result of its operation. As one of the three Victorian Ministers in the last Cabinet, which was concerned in coming to a decision of some importance with regard to redistribution, and was subjected to very severe criticism in consequence of the action it proposed to take, I feel it my duty in discussing this measure to place some of the facts connected with the situation before House; and I hope that I may be so far favoured as to haw the substance of my remarks placed before the country, in order that the public may know what the facts were which the late Government, and this Government, too,"" have had to deal with in considering the question. I use the word ""facts"" advisedly, in contrast with some of the words of vaguer meaning which have been employed in connection with this matter during the last month or two.",12
8,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,""" Guesses "" the Argus calls them this morning.",13
9,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"- Yes. I shall refer to facts. I should like, in the first place, to remind honourable members very briefly of the history of section 24 of the Constitution, under which the Bill is introduced. The Minister of Home Affairs, in quoting what purport to be precedents in the draft Constitution Bill of 1891, the Canadian Constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, appeared to have lost sight of the fundamental difference between those provisions and the section in the Constitution under which we are living,"" and under which he has taken action. The draft Constitution Bill prepared by the Convention of 1891 very specifically laid down the periods at which : redistribution was to take place. It provided that a fresh apportionment of representatives to the States should be made after each census of the people of the Commonwealth, which should be taken at intervals not longer than ten years. The Canadian Constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, in like manner provide for the ascertainment of the population for the purpose of altering representation on a census. But the Convention which framed the Constitution under which we aire now living departed from the form of phraseology used in those Constitutions, and did so deliberately. It provided that the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people, and determined in a . certain manner, involving the ascertainment, not of the number of the people determined by a census, but of the number of the people determined by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. I propose to refer briefly, a little later on, to what may be meant by the words "" the lateststatistics of the Commonwealth,"" and the merely point out in passing the great difference in phraseology between our Constitution and those to which the Minister has alluded.",13
10,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,We can alter the arrangement by this very Bill.,13
11,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am not at all sure that we can; but I shall come to that matter later on. Our Constitution uses the words, ""latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" instead of the word "" census,"" which has. a definite and ascertained meaning. In 1903, a redistribution of seats was proposed in this House, and last year it was still recognised, not only by the Government of the day, but by all parties, that r in view of the great disparity between the actual numbers of electors in the various electorates, and the limits allowed by the Electoral Act, a redistribution of seats was necessary at an early date, and certainly before the next general election. The Electoral Act allows a margin of one-fifth either way, though, as I have stated on previous occasions, I should have preferred a margin of at least one-fourth. Knowing that the electorates, so far from differing only in the: maximum proportion of six to four, differ in some cases in the proportion of more than two to one, Parliament thought that a redistribution must, in fairness, take place.",13
12,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,In some cases the difference is three to one.,14
13,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"At any rate, it is more than two to one. First, the Bartoni Government, and then the Reid-MCLean Government, undertook to arrange for a redistribution. This redistribution was pressed for last session by a number of those who sat in opposition to the ReidMCLean Administration. That Government, with the approval of the House, undertook definitely'-as it tmdeVtook a - number of things definitely, though it had not had an opportunity to carry them into effect-to be ready with a redistribution proposal when Parliament met this session. During the recess, in pursuance of their promise, they took steps towards proceeding with the redistribution. The first duty they had to perform was to ascertain the respective positions of the States. They had to look into legal questions, and into facts, in order to be able to direct the Commissioners of thei various States as to how many electorates each State should be divided into. Through making these inquiries, the late Government became cognizant of certain facts. They became cognizant of the fact that the population of Victoria had not been increasing in the same ratio, so far as the .statisticians' estimates guided us, as the population of the other States-that while the quota to determine the number of members was increasing, the population of Victoria was not increasing in the same ratio, and, consequently, if the statisticians' figures were to be accepted as correct, Victoria's representation was diminishing. Then the Government had to con-sider the question how to deal with this fact. It was pressed by the knowledge that it was bound to be in a reasonable state of preparedness when it met Parliament, and accordingly an Order in Council was passed, and a Gazette notice was published, declaring that the population of the various States, as on 31st December, 1904, consisted of certain numbers, and that those numbers were to be the basis upon which were to Le determined the number of representatives of the States. That action of the late Administration, in declaring these figures by Executive act to be the basis of calculation, was most seriously challenged in many quarters. That Government had not, however, acted without precedent. In the Commonwealth Gazette of 1.3th June, 1903- a few months prior to the distribution of the seats under the last distribution schemes, and the presentation to the House of those schemes, whirihi were for the most part rejected, and during the administration of the Barton Government, in which the present Prime Minister was Attorney-General, the present Minister of Trade and Customs was Minister of Home Affairs, and of which the Treasurer was also a member the following Order in Council appeared: Official return of the population of the Commonwealth upon which to determine the number of members of the House of Representatives to be returned by each State. His Excellency the Governor General in and over the Commonwealth of Australia, by and with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, has been pleased to approve that, for the purpose of determining the quota upon which to base the number of members to be returned by each State to the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in accordance with section 24 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, the return of population as stated hereunder be recognised as the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. Population of the six States of the Commonwealth, according to the latest official statistics (31st December, 1Q02). Then followed the figures, and the order was signed by "" Wm. John Lyne. Minister of State for Home Affairs."" That was the precedent, and, more than that, it was a precedent with which not a soul in this House or outside of it quarrelled. It could not be pretended that honourable members had no knowledge of the matter.",14
14,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Was an election pending then?,14
15,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Yes , in December of that year.",14
16,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Then the fact that it was passed without any observation becomes all the worse.,14
17,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"More than that, there was a debate in this House when the whole matter was brought up.",14
18,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Upon what question?,14
19,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Ir n connection with the question of the exclusion of certain aliens from the calculation of the population of Queensland.,14
20,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The discussion took place on that question only.,14
21,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I propose to quote certain remarks that were made during that debate by the present Minister of Home Affairs, who in his speech referred to the - ascertainment of the figures by the States Statisticians, and asked the then Minister of Home Affairs whether the figures supplied by the various States were calculated on the same basis.",15
22,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That is correct.,15
23,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"At page 2952 of vol. XV. of Hansard the present Minister of Home Affairs said If the Minister of Home Affairs, upon investigation, discovers that, in making their computation, the statisticians have not adopted a uniform basis, I think that he should instruct them to with a view to definitely settling the matter out delay. That referred to all the figures used and to the calculations which were challenged on the ground that certain aliens were wrongly counted in some cases. The whole matter came under consideration, and the then Minister of Home Affairs made the position perfectly clear in the remarks which I am about to quote. He was followed by the present Prime Minister, then Attorney-General, who did not raise any question as to the propriety of the figures, although the then Minister of Home Afmember fairs dealt with them specifically. At page 2957 the present Minister of Trade and Customs is reported as having saidThe figures given in it must be regarded State, but as Commonwealth, figures I am now speaking upon a technical point, which was brought under my notice by the much-abused electoral officer, Mr Lewis, that sub-section section 24 of the Commonwealth Act required the statistics used should be the statistics of Commonwealth. I informed hrm that these figures were prepared by a statistician who was acting for the Commonwealth, and that they were vides thattherefore officially compiled for our purposes. No one took exception to that statement. posed At page 2959 he went on to sayI have acted carefully and upon the best advice that could be obtained. I presume that that was the advice of the then Attorney-General. He continuedI have adopted the figures relating to population which were supplied to the Department of Home Affairs by the statisticians of the States. These figures were accepted and were submitted to the Cabinet, and gazetted, and not a word of objection was raised. Further on, the present Minister of Trade and Customs said I cannot do other than rely upon the figures supplied by the statisticians. On the very figures which are now called mere estimates and guesses, and stated to be absolutely unreliable, the Barton Government proposed a redistribution of seats in this House.",15
24,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,They did not propose to take any action-non e was necessary.,15
25,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The figures showed that there was no necessity for any alteration in the number of representatives of the States, but that does not alter the fact that they were adopted as the basis upon which the number of members was to be calculated, and that they were gazetted before the redistribution was entered upon. Does the Minister mean to say that we are not to do so, quarrel with the figures so long as they do with- not require us to make an alteration ? Xo 1 alteration in the number of representatives was proposed, because the statistics showed that none was required; but the Government did not retain the old number of representatives irrespective of the figures supplied by the statistician's. On the other hand, they accepted the figures, and based their calculations upon them. Therefore, so far as precedent is concerned, the late Administration had the best precedent.",15
26,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The honourable and learned might call it the worse precedent.,15
27,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Perhaps I shall arrive in time at the point which the honourable and learned member has in his mind. There not as was more than that to consider. The existence of a precedent was not a sufficient justification for any Administration in pur1 of suing a course which it thought to be that wrong, and the then Government, like the the present one, had to consider the legal position. Section 24 of the Constitution proThe House of Representatives shall be comof members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twicethe number of senators. The number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their peopleThat cannot be altered by (Parliament. There is no "" until Parliament otherwise provides"" preceding that provision. It is. distinctly' provided that the number of members chosen shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people. Then the section proceedsand shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined whenever necessary in the following manneTThat manner requires the ascertainment 1 of the number of people of the Commonwealth, "" as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth."" The section be-: gins by providing that the number of members chosen - that means at an election1 shall be in proportion to the people of the' States. That is an absolute direction that cannot be altered by this Parliament. But we are told that we can provide a method other than that set forth in the Constitution for determining the number of the people in the States, and the number of members by a mere arithmetical calculation based on the number of people in the States. It is provided that until that is done-and that is the present position-the number shall be determined whenever necessary. One has to ask the meaning of the words "" whenever necessary."" Do they mean whenever Parliament thinks necessary ? That is one view taken of this section. I cannot agree with that view. My opinion may not be a solid or a sound one, but that is the conclusion at which I have arrived. I doubt whether, upon the mere! construction of the wordfsi ""whenever necessary,"" they meao anything else, but "" whenever the actual number of the people renders the operation necessary."" That is to say, whenever the numbers of the people vary so as to require variations in the number of representatives. It is urged by Quick and Garran, and it is hinted, although not stated, by the Minister of Home Affairs, that these words "" whenever necessary "" mean whenever it is convenient in the view of the Parliament. I trust that that is the correct view, because wise I am afraid the Bill now before us may be challenged as being in contravention of the Constitution. But my own opinion is that the words mean whenever the number of members is not in proportion to the number of people, in accordance with the earlier provision in the section. Therefore, it appears to me-and it appeared to the members of the late Government in the same way-that under a strict interpretation of the Constitution this provision is almost automatic in its operation; that as the population varies the number of members ought to vary also. Parliament can, of course, refrain from performing its duty, but if it discharges its full responsibility it will have to vary the number of members as the number of people in the States vary. If that is what is meant by the section it Mr MCCay. will prove highly inconvenient. The fixing of periodic dates seems to be the only convenient method of proceeding, and a very strong argument against the view I have been stating may be advanced on the ground that the Constitution could not mean anything so inconvenient as what I have suggested. In order to uphold that objection, however, a Court would have to come to the conclusion that the Constitution did not say what it meant, and did not mean what it said. That is practically the position that Courts sometimes have to assume, in the interpretation of statutes, but it is a position that they take up only as a last resort. Then the Government had to decide what were the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, because, even if the number of people in the States had actually varied, their number could not be determined according to the Constitution if the latest statistics oif the Commonwealth were not ascertainable. I should like to point out, in passing, that it does not suggest that the matter should be determined by Parliament-that it should not be an Executive Act-whic h was the view taken by the Barton 'Government when by Executive act it determined the number of members. The next question is: "" What are the latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" because if no numbers are ascertained, according to these "" latest statistics ''-it does not matter what are the actual numbers-ther e can be no re-allotment of members. Roughly speaking, I may say that the view put forward by those who criticise the action of the late Government was that the "" latest statistics of the otherCommonwealth"" meant the latest, statistics ascertained by the Commonwealth. That, however, is not what, the Constitution says. My own opinion is ' that those words taiean the latest statistics relating to the Commonwealth, and, in proof of my contention, I venture to submit one or two arguments which might not be admissible in a court of law, but which are nevertheless proper arguments to submit in this House. In the first place, the Constitution Bill of 1891, the Canadian Constitution, and the United States Constitution all specifically refer to "" census"" as contrasted with "" statistics"" in this section. In the second place, I find that clause 26 of the Commonwealth Constitution Bill, in the form in which it went to England to be adopted by the Imperial Parliament, instead of setting out the numbers of members as the)' now appear in our Constitution Act, contained a few words in brackets and ""in italics to the effect that they were to be determined "" according to the - latest returns at the passing of the Act."" There were some interesting references made to this matter in the Convention debates. From the official report of the debates in the Adelaide Convention, I find that Sir Edmund Barton saidThe number of members to be State shall be as follows :-that is, to be determined according to latest statistical returns at the passing of the Act. Throughout the Convention discussions the right honourable member for Balaclava and aware the present Attorney-General time after my time drew attention to what would happen words in that to a State like Victoria owing tion of this provision. They directed atshow the way in many tention to the fact that its inevitable sult would be that unless the population cumstance to which I have that of Victoria grew to an extent equal to the average growth of Australia, its represenfrom tation would dwindle and dwindle.",15
28,Mr ISAACS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"We tried to alter that vision. . Mr MCCAY - Ye s ; but the honourable and learned gentleman and those who suptorney-General, ported him did not succeed. That is point. At the Melbourne Convention, as will be seen by reference to page 1838 of the official report, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, discussing what is now section 26 of the - Constitution is reported to have saidAt what stage is it proposed to have the gap of filled up? Is it before this Bill is sent afterwards?",17
29,Mr OCONNOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It is to be filled up accordall ing to the latest statistical returns, at the date of the passing of the Act by the Imperial ment.",17
30,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,You leave it for the Imperial Parliament to fill in the gap?,17
31,Mr OCONNOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Undoubtedly . may change in the meantimeThe words ""statistical returns"" are used there, and the word ""statistics"" is emmitted ployed in section 24, whereas the term "" census "" is used in the draft Constitution Bill of 1891, in the Canadian Act, and also in the United States Constitution. venture to say without any hesitation whatever the term "" Commonwealth statisfined tics "" in section 24 may mean, it means something more than the word "" census - somethin g less definite, less certain, honourable members choose-bu t something different from the word "" census,"" with its well-ascertained meaning. Consequently, I hold that the "" latest statistics of the Commonwealth"" are not synonymous merely with the census returns. The word ""census"" was deliberately abandoned by the framers of our Constitution. Under sub-section n of section 51 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth is empowered, amongst other subjects, to make laws in regard to ""census and statistics."" In that provision "" census "" is again differentiated chosen by each from "" statistics.""",17
32,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Because we .may have statistics which relate to goods as well as to men.,17
33,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am perfectly well of that. I do not base the whole of argument upon the meaning of those sub-section.. That is to the operamerely one of the straws which which the current reis flowing. i ' contend the cirreferred shows that ""statistics"" are. something different an actual enumeration of the people. The present Government entertains the prosame view as did the recent Administration. When we recollect all that was said by some honourable members, including the Atin regard to the Bill which my the late Government intended to submit, I say that the action of that Administration finds complete justification in the measure which is now under consideration. The in Attorney-General finds salvation in an Act of Parliament, as contrasted with an Executive act. If the thing be done by Act Parliament, his contention is that home or the figures are all right, but if it be done by Executive act, they are wrong. This Bill is intended Parliato accomplish two things. First of all, it deals with the present position, and in the second place, it deals with future matters. The late Administration recognised, The figures just as well as does the present Government, that as regards the future, it was desirable to pass some Act-if 'the law perit-in order to arrange for periodical revisions, rather than for revisions which"" might take place at any time. They were dealing with the present situation as well. I As to the present, I hold that the stathat tistics of the Commonwealth are not conto the census returns. The variations of language afford a strong argument in "" that direction. What is the meaning of the if term ""statistics of the Commonwealth""? Does it mean "" statistics ascertained by the Commonwealth "" ? With every respect I say that that seems to me an unworthy argument. It suggests that the. signature of the Chief Electoral Officer attached to returns of population under the provisions of a Commonwealth statute will make the figures which they contain right when they are not right. It evidences a trust in the signature of that officer as a miracle worker - a trust which I do not possess. Either the figures are right or they are wrong. If they are wrong, the signature of the Chief Electoral Officer will not make them right. In the remarks which I have quoted in regard to section 26 of the Constitution Mr O'Connor pointed out that the figures might change between the periods of the passing of the Bill by the Convention and its being passed by the Imperial Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Statisticians' "" guesses,"" as they are called, were accepted for the original representation of the States.",17
34,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,They were not embodied in the Constitution.,18
35,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The figures with which some honourable members have quarrelled were those which were used in connection with the first Federal election. judgment, the term, "" statistics of the Commonwealth,"" does not mean statistics ascertained by the Commonwealth, but actual figures of Commonwealth population. In other words, it means statistics relating to the Commonwealth. The word "" of "" is ambiguous-it may mean half-adozen things. I freely admit that it is a question which is open to argument. But presuming that the late Government were wrong in their view, and that a Bill was necessary to validate the whole matter, surely it was entitled to assume that the necessary legal authotitv would be given by this Parliament. I take the view, however, that no legal authority is necessary to meet the present situation. The matter was very f u l ly considered, and, rightly or wrongly, we came to that conclusion. I now wish to deal with the facts, as they are at present, relating to the representation of the States, and in this connection I propose to give some figures. I shall give the figures which faced the recent Administration and those which confront the present Government in dealing with the matter. In the first place, I say that, so far as this Bil l deals with the immediate necessities of the situation-wit h the redistribution that it proposes shall take place before the next general election-ther e is not a figure or a fact different from the figures and facts which were used by the late Government. The present Administration, in submitting this Bill , and in declaring, in paragraph 2 of clause 3,. thatThe first enumeration day shall be appointed as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act, (admit that they are going to accept those figures. In effect, they say, "" We aregoing to accept the Statisticians' estimates, with the possibilities of error-indeed, , everything which ouif predecessors proposed to accept."" If we turn to ScheduleA, and look at all the calculations, and' the allowances for unrecorded arrivals and departures, which require to be made, it will be seen that every one of those are allowances actually being made at the present time by the Statistician of every State Government. Indeed, the provisionhas been adopted verbatim from the report of the conference of the Statisticians of the States which met in 1903. They are better figures than those upon which theBarton Government, acted, because thelatter were not uniform. In my",18
36,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,In 1903 it was want of uniformity which gave rise to the criticism which was indulged in by honourable members of this House.,18
37,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It was much more than> that. Let the Minister of Home Affairs read the speech delivered by his present colleague, the Minister of Trade and? Customs, and the Gazette notice. , Hedeliberately accepted the Statisticians' figures. If the only thing to which objection was raised in 1903 was. want of uniformity, why was the action of the last Government, in basing their action upon uniformity, challenged? I repeat that the very allowances set out in? the schedule are those upon which all the States Statisticians proceeded, and in accordance with which they ""have revised the whole of their figures since the census of"" 1901. I say at once as a Victorian member that I scrutinized the proposals of the late Government with' jealous suspicion. If I could honestly have found any reasonable causeto object to those proposals, which meant depriving Victoria of one representative, Imost certainly should have objected to them. It was not until an overwhelming and i r resistible mass of facts confronted us that the honourable member for Gippslan'd, the right honourable member, for Balaclava, myself gave way. We. could not help ourwished selves any more than the present Governvernment expert on the point. ment can help themselves. The Minister face - of Home Affairs, the Attorney-General, the Prime Minister know perfectly well - that if this Bill becomes law and an enupon umeration day is appointed, Victoria will .have only twenty-two representatives in this House. I am very sorry that it is so.",18
38,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Why should the honour the - able an'd learned member be sorry ?,19
39,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I am sorry that Victoria Melbourne. is to lose any of her representation. Mr 'HIGGINS -'Victori - one representative.,19
40,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I regret that the State of Victoria is not progressing as fast as are the other States.,19
41,Mr ISAACS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The honourable and learned member is sorry that the State of Victoria is not progressing more rapidly.,19
42,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I amsorry that Victoria is not progressing rapidly enough to able her to retain her representation. I upon the facts presented to me, any reasonwas able ground for questioning the accuracy of the figures existed, or if there had any reasonable doubt as to whether toria should, or should not, retain twentypressed three representatives in this House, I should have given this State the benefit the doubt. But the Victorian members of the late Government exercised all the care that they could. First of all, the question arose as to whether' the estimates were based upon this uniform scheme. Then - relied upon the Victorian Statistician for all our figures and references. Before we consented to the proposal to duce Victoria's representation to twentycontention. two members, the then Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava, put specific question to the Victorian GovernStates ment Statistician, as to whether any error, likely to have occurred, could place toria in the position of being entitled to twenty-three members. The Government mate. Statistician replied, however, in even emphatic way than that in which the questhe tion was put. On the 20th March of this year, in a letter to the then Treasurer, wroteI do not think that any error-there is no question of its being any error likely to occur ""-which may have occurred will entitle Victoria to it\venty-three members. The facts before us showed that that was and so, but. we desired something, more-w e to obtain the assurance of the GoIn the of this letter, and having regard to the and figures which we had worked out for ourselves, we felt that we were honestly called to give effect to the proper facts, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. I wish now to refer ""to remarks made in the course of press interviews by present Attorney-General and the honourable and learned member for Northern On ""the 6th April last, the Age newspaper opened the ball with the a ought to 'lose statement thatIn proposing, on the strength of mere statistical - guesswork, to deprive Victoria of a seat in the House of Representatives, the Federal Ministry is exposing itself to the certainty of being rebuked by the Federal Parliament. It went on to declare that the section of the Constitution governing the question meant that the decennial census returns enshould be taken. I do not know whether f , . the sudden defeat of the late Government really the rebuke prophesied by the Age, but the question was revived in May been last, when Mir. Irvine - a distinguished, Vicmember of the State Parliament - exthe opinion that the only basis of calculation, was an enumeration of the popuof taken-in other words, that there must be a "" census,"" in the ordinary acceptation of the word. The present Attorney-General., the honourable and learned member for Indi, also gave an opinion which was characterwe ized by his usual caution. He said that first of all Parliament had to determine whenever a redistribution was necessary. reI beg leave to doubt the accuracy of that He went on to say that, as. regards that section of the Constitution a which deals with the taking over of the debts in proportion to the "" population statistics of the Commonwealth,"" the Vicwords "" Statistics of the Commonwealth.'' could not refer to some hazy indefinite estiBut the words "" Statistics of the a more Commonwealth"" must have been used in same sense in the finance clause of the Constitution, as they were in section 24, he which relates to the question now before us. The present Attorney-General described the figures which his Government have now accepted as a merehazy, indefinite estimate made at the request of the Minister of some Department, and wholly unprovided for by law. The estimates are made regularly by the Statisticians of the States, and are supplied at the request of the Minister; but it cannot be said that they are ""made"" at the request of a Minister, and are wholly unprovided for by law - It seems that the magic of an Act of Parliament is to change wrong figures into rightfigures-is to transform "" hazy, indefinite estimates '' into accurate figures on which the representation of the States is to be determined. The Attorney-General went on to say that until Commonwealth officers are "" authorized to obtain, and do obtain, proper information,"" this cannot be done. What is "" proper information""? Here, again, we have the aegis of an Act of Parliament. The figures for our guidance will be the same after this measure has been passed as they were before. We shall have the same figures collected by the same persons on the same basis, and subject to the same allowances as before. The Attorney General continuedWhat has Mr Topp to turn to as "" latest tics""? They are merely estimates by the Statisticians-apparentl y under State laws-and afterwards adopted by the Federal Executive Council. To paraphrase the words of the honourable and learned gentleman, I shall say that figures dealt with by thils measure are merely estimates of the States Statisticians, apparently under State laws, and that they are now to be adopted by the. Federal liament. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they are still mere estimates by States Statisticians - that they are absowere lutely the same as before. I come now the opinion expressed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who. to use a vulgarism, "" went the whole hog,"" declaring that the term "" statistics the Commonwealth "" meant a census.",19
43,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I did not say so.,20
44,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The honourable and the learned member said that it meant a sysment dealt with the matter. tematic enumeration of the inhabitants the Commonwealth.,20
45,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Exactly .,20
46,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Then what did the hongested orable and learned member mean if he did not intend to convey that an actual count should be made?,20
47,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I did not speak of a census, and I would ask the honourable learned member to keep to the expression that he first used.",20
48,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I have - used the word "" census"" all through in the sense of an actual count. I notice that in giving the opinion to which I have referred, the honourable and learned member looked up the dictionary . for the definition of the word "" statistics."" I should like him to tell us what is the meaning of the word ""enumeration."" When heused that word, did he refer to an estimate, or an actual count? If he meant an actual count, then he was really referring to a census in the sense that I have been using that word. If , on the other hand, he was referring to a calculation, and thinks that figures are good when authorized by a Federal law, but bad when authorized only by an act of the Federal Executive, I repeat that here again he is sacrificing the substance for the shadow. He is assuming that bad figures may be made good by an Act of Parliament.",20
49,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,They may be wrong; but the Bill is simply introduced to make them right.,20
50,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I was referring, not to statisthe terms of the Bill, but to the opinion State expressed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who holds that the latest statistics mean the latest systematic enumeration of the inhabitants the of the Commonwealth. He does not say that that enumeration shall be authorized by Federal law. I come now to certain figures that I desire to lay before the ParHouse. Let me begin by quoting those relating to the estimated population of Austhe tralia on 31st December, 1904. These the latest that could be obtained by tc the Government of the day in March last, when they entered upon the consideration of this question. The present Attorney-General, in the course of a press interview, asked why of the late Government selected thefiguresfor the 31st December, 1904, and went on to say, "" There must have been some reason for it . "" The reason was that they were latest available when the late GovernWe had to of begin to consider the matter before May, in order that it might be settled by that date. The present Attorney-General sugthat there must have been some occult reason for selecting the figures for 31st December last, and apparently the inference was that Victoria was to suffer by their adoption, in preference to the selecand tion of those for March, 1905. I shall show whether or not there is any warrant for that implication. On 31st December, 1904, the effective population of the Commonwealth-and by "" effective population,"" I mean the population excluding full-blooded aborigines and aliens disqualified under certain sections of the Commonwealth Constitution Act-accordin g to the estimates of the Statisticians, was 3,951,829. Dividing that total by 72, we get as the quota, 54,886, and the half quota is thus 27.443. Dividing the population of New South Wales, which was estimated at 1,457,246, by the quota, it was found to be entitled to twentysix full members, and to have a balance of 30,210 persons, or 2,767 more than half the quota, so that she was thus entitled to twenty-seven members. I may say, in passing, that the fact that New South Wales was to gain a representative had nothing to do with the fact that Victoria was to lose one. Victoria might lose a representative without New South Wales gaining one, and New South might lose a representative without Victoria gaining one. Victoria's population of 1,210,304, divided by the quota, gave her twenty-two members, with a balance of 2,812 persons, or 24,631 short of the half quota that would entitle her to a twentythird member. But even if Victoria had had 24,631 more than she was shown by this estimate to have, she still would have been entitled to only twenty-two members, unless the population of the other States had been over-estimated to that extent, because, by adding 24,631 persons to the total population of the Commonwealth, we should thereby increase the quota,: making the remainder, after dividing by the quota, less than half the quota. toria had had the additional 24,631 persons, she would not have been entitled to more than 22*30 representatives. Assuming that the population of the other States was correct, and that that of Victoria alone was under-estimated, in order to have twentythree members she would have required to have, in addition to her estimated population, no less than 35,836 people These were the facts that faced the late Administration when they dealt with this matter. No member of the late Government rejoiced at the prospect of Victoria losing one of its representatives-I do not think that any one would do so-bu t that was the fact that faced us. What possible errors could creep into lead us to suppose that the estimate was so far out as has been suggested? The Statisticians of Victoria and New South Wales were wrong in [75] their estimates between 189.1 and 1901-.. But to what extent? The New South' Wales census of 1901 showed that her Statistician had over-estimated her population by 12,000, while the Victorian census of that year showed that the population of this State had been under-estimated by 10,000. If between. April, 1901, and December, 1-904- a period of three and a half years-the Statisticians were as far out in their calculations as they were in respect of the whole of the preceding ten years, thepopulation of Victoria would still have been 20,000 less than the number entitling her totwenty-three representatives. We must not forget, however, that during the three and' a half years which I have mentioned, the Statisticians in question had adopted a new allowance, based on the errors disclosed by the preceding census, so that their estimates Wales were more likely to be correct.",20
51,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I hope that' the honourable and learned member has not made a mistake.,21
52,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I certainly have not. The next point which the late Government had to consider was as to the allowances made. It was thought that possibly the errors in regard to the three and a half years period, which I have named, were larger than were ithose for the preceding ten years, and, having regard to that possibility, I took the actual reported departures from Victoria. There' is an allowance for unrecorded departures of 10 per cent, on actual recorded departures by land and 9 per cent, on actual recorded departures by If Vicsea, from Victoria. These were added on to the actual recorded departures, and they still further reduce the net population.",21
53,Mr CHANTER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,-What system is adopted for recording the arrivals and departures ?,21
54,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Surely the honourable member is aware of the system adopted by the Department of Trade and Customs and the Railway Department. - Mr CHANTER - I have seen thousands travelling by rail who were not counted.,21
55,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Possibly . I am pointing out that the Statisticians of Victoria and New South Wales between them were only 22,000 out in ten years, and if that 22,6.00 had been given to Victoria, it would have not have made any difference to her position. It is not a question of a difference of a few thousands, but of a difference of 35,000, or of 24,000 each way, a total of 48,000. If the total of the actually recorded departures from Victoria by land and sea were taken as correct, ancl no deduction made, that is to say, if we assumed that not a single departure from Victoria has been unrecorded, and the State was credited with o per cent, for unrecorded arrivals by sea, and 10 per cent, for unrecorded arrivals by land, and not charged for a single unrecorded departure by either land or sea, she would not have a sufficiently large population to entitle her to a representation of twentythree members. No Minister, and no member, whatever may be the State he represents, can close his eyes to facts of that kind. I would have acted differently if [ could have fairly done so, but it was impossible. As the late Government have suffered a good deal of adverse criticism in this connection, I trust that, in fairness to us, the facts which I have given to the House will be made public, so that our side of the question, as well as the other side, may be known. So far as this matter is concerned, the present Bill does not in any way alter the facts. On the 31st December last, Oueensland was entitled to nine representatives, with a surplus population of 5,010, which was a long way short of the number required to give her a tenth representative.",21
56,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"But Victoria South Wales count their aliens, while we exclude them from our statistics.",22
57,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If Queensland were credited with her 22,000 excluded: aliens, and the aliens in the other States were not taken into account, shei would still not have a sufficient population to entitle her to a tenth member.",22
58,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I admit that.,22
59,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"On the 31st December, 1904, if the 22,671 aliens in Queensland, which are not now taken into account, had been included in her population, she would have been entitled to only nine representatives, and would have had a surplus of 24,846 people, or 2,754 people short of Ihe number entitling her to a tenth representative. South * Australia on the same date had a population entitling her to six representatives, and a surplus of 40,665 people, or 13,222 more than were required for a seventh representative. Both Western Australia and Tasmania send five representatives to this House under the provisions of the Constitution, though their populations do not entitle them to that representation; but when Western Australia has obtained another 10,000 people, if her population continues to increase at the present rate, she will be entitled to her present representation on her statistics as well as under the Constitution.",22
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,There is very little justification for any alteration in the case of Western Australia.,22
61,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It is not proposed to make any. On the 31st December, 1904, Victoria was nearer to twenty-three members than to twenty-one, having a population sufficient to entitle her to twenty-two members, and a little more. I also remembered what the tendency of population was, and found that the population of the other States is increasing more rapidly than is that of Victoria. If anything would justify that forecast, the figures for the 31st March and the 30th June of this year do so. They do not cover a long period of time, but the trend is very marked in the six months. On the 31st March of this year the effective population of the Commonwealth was 3,967,388, and the quota 55,1.02, entitling New South Wales to twenty-six representatives, with a surplus of 32,981 people, or a balance in excess of the requirement for a twentyseventh representative of 5,430, which was and New twice as many as the State had three months before. The Victorian population on that date was 1,210,530, which, divided by the quota entitled that State to twenty-bne representatives, with a surplus of 53,388 persons, or an excess over the half quota of 25,837, giving her a total representation of twenty-two representatives. She was 29,465 persons short of the population that would have entitled her to a representation of twenty-three members, and only 25,837 in excess of the representation entitling her to twenty-one members.",22
62,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,If we wait until next year the figures may be different.,22
63,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am coming to that. On the 30th June of this year the effective population of the Commonwealth-and all the figures with which I have been supplied were supplied to me by the Department of Home Affairs, and obtained by that Department from the Government Statistician of Victoria-wa s 3,982,188. The population of Victoria was 1,211,003, which, divided by the quota of 55,308, entitled Victoria to a representation of twenty-one members, with a surplus of 49,535, or 21,881. over the half quota, so that the State had then 21,881 more than were necessary to give her a representation of twenty-one members, but was short by 33,327 of the population necessary to entitle her to a representation of twenty-three members. Victoria could not have had a representation of twenty-three members on the 30th June of this year, unless she had possessed 33,327 more people than she is estimated to have, and the other States between them had had that number less than they are estimated to have. In other words, the estimates must have been wrong to the extent of 66,654, and it is inconceivable that they could be wrong to that extent. If the figures for the other States were right, and on the 30th June of this year the population of Victoria alone had been und_erestimated, she would have required, owing to the increase of the quota by the increase of her own population, 48,614 persons more than she was estimated to have, to entitle her to a representation of twenty-three members. What can one do in the face of figures like that? How can one say that any estimate, however open to challenge on the ground of inaccuracy, could be wrong to that extent, in view of the fact that in no previous decennial period, as gauged by the census, have the figures been wrong to that extent? As regards Queensland, the position was the same on the 30th June last as it was on the 31st December. Giving her the excluded aliens, she was 2,049 short of the number which would have entitled her to a tenth representative. On the 30th December Victoria, however, was 24,600 short of the number that would have entitled her to a representation of twentythree members, while on the 31st March of this year she was 29,400 short, and on the 30th June 33,300 short, assuming that the other States were over-estimated to the same extent. But assuming that the other States were rightly estimated, and that only Victoria was under-estimated, she was 35,836 short on the 31st December of last year, 42,606 short on the 31st March last, and 48,614 short on the 30th June last. I quote these figures to show that if any founded charge in connection with this matter is to be brought against the late A d ministration, the only one that could be justified would be that, in the interests of Victoria, they did not hurry matters sufficiently to enable things to be fixed up before her population became too small to entitle the State to a representation of twenty-two members. Unless a - [ 7 5 ] -* change takes place within twelve months, from this date, Victoria will be entitled to a representation of only twenty-one members, because her population is increasing at a smaller rate than are the populations of the ortler States. It is not that it is diminishing.",22
64,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"In the country districts the population of Victoria has been diminishing for the last thirty years, although it has been increasing in the towns.",23
65,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"He r population, as a whole, is increasing slowly, but at a lesser rate than are the populations of the other States. The criticisms passed - on the preceding Administration must be admitted, in the face of the facts I have mentioned, to have been unfounded. Apart from the legal question raised, we had no option but to do what was done. We had pledged ourselves to be ready with a scheme of redistribution when we met Parliament again, and, as we believed that the legal position was what we had stated it to be, we had no option to do other than what we did. Neither has this Government the option to do other than what it is doing, if it wishes to act fairly. They provide, first of all, as regards the future for fiveyearly periods, and for the present that, as soon as possible after the passing of the measure, an enumeration day shall be fixed, which is saying, in other words, that the figures which were taken by the last Government will be taken by them. I should have preferred decennial to quinquennial periods for the future, for reasons which are obvious.",23
66,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Decennia l periods are too long.,23
67,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am aware that the representatives of other States would quarrel with a proposal to fix decennial periods. There are cases in which the estimates are pretty near the border line. For instance, we are comparatively near the border line in regard to the figures entitling New South Wales to a twenty-seventh well- member. On the 31st December last, she had a margin of only .^,767. On the 31st March, it had increased to 5,430, and on the 30th June to 8,311, so that it is tapidly growing. New South Wales is increasing in actual numbers more rapidly than any of the other States. In six months her population has increased by if.000 .persons, while that of Western Australia has increased by 9,000 persons.",23
68,Mr FISI,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"IER - But her percentage inupon, crease is not so large as that of Western Australia.",24
69,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No . However, the margin over what entitles her to a twentj^seventh member as rapidly growing. With regard Victoria, if it were a margin of only 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 we might have said, "" will not deprive a State of a member on such a small difference "" ; but since it 35,000, if the other States estimates - correct, and 24,000, if the population the other States as over-estimated to the - same extent, it is very serious. The Bill proposes quinquennial estimates of populaarrivals tion, and a decennial census. As I have said, I would prefer decennial periods, but the late Government would have promembers. posed something for regulating the enumeration in a manner similar to that now proposed, if they could have thought constitutionally correct. That, however, quite a different matter. The preparations for the future made by this Bill are quite another matter from its recognition of present position. If the Bill is to become 'law, the sooner it does so, and State.

I must apologize for having detained the House so long, but, as a Victorian Minister in the late Administration, I felt entitled to put before honourable members the facts which influenced us, and compelled us to do to what we did. I do not care how much the accuracy of the estimates may be disputed, We they cannot be wrong to an extent which will disprove the facts which I have stated. was If Victoria was not debited with a single are unrecorded departure since the last census of - and some 399,000, departures have been recorded since the last census-but , on the other hand, was credited with unrecorded to the extent of 10 per cent, on the arrivals actually recorded, still, she could not establish h'er (Claim .to twenty-three Struggle gallantly as we might - and we pestered the .Minister of Home Affairs to verify his figures, and we chalit lenged the calculations in every possible is way - we found that the figures were against us, and we had to give way, and I think that we were justified in doing so. the Honourable members will find full particulars of thefiguresto which I have referred is acted in the following tables: Population, deducting excluded Number ot Members to which State Quota and Half Aliens, &a. entitled.

But, if the present trend of affairs be any guide, I am afraid that she will have .for years to come to face the possibility of a loss of representation. I believe the people of Victoria, when they come to know the facts, will, as fair-minded folk, recognise-as I believe that their representatives in this House will also recognise-that there is no option but to submit to a reduction in the representation of the State. legal objections have been against the Bil l by distinguished lawyers, but the Government is concerned with the facts upon which justice is established, and this Government, like any other, has to recognise that the facts are such that they cannot stand against them. Even though the Prime Minister is a Victorian, they have to leave the Constitution to its reasonable operation. I think that, apart from ail legal objections, the Bill should become law, and that it should be promptly brought into operation. If promptly acted, upon it will have the same effect as if the legal question, had not been raised; but if it is not promptly brought into operation, the effect upon Victoria will be worse than ever.",24
70,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Northern Melbourne). - The only difference between myself and the honourable and learned member for Corinella is that he supports the Bil l and abuses the Minister; whereas I support the Minister and abuse the Bill .,25
71,Mr MCCAV,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I do not remember abusing the Minister.,25
72,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honourable and learned member commenced by attacking the Minister in respect to his previous Utterances, and he also taunted him with - having followed the lead of the previous Government. At all events, I think the Bill is a mistake, and as my name has been mentioned by the honourable and learned member, I wish to explain why I regard the measure as opposed to the provisions of the Constitution. I think that the question of the reduction of the number of representatives of Victoria is a very small one. Australia will not lose anything, so long as good representatives are returned from all parts of Australia in reasonable proportion to the population. The position I take up is a simple one, namely, that it was never intended that the proportion of members for each State should be altered upon the estimate of any statist, however eminent. That is the whole position, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella did not, in the course of his able speech, discuss the guestion as to the meaning of the term used in the Constitution, "" The latest statistics of the Commonwealth."" If the honourable and learned member's view is right, any Ministry, as soon as it thinks there has been a movement of population, will be justified in bringing down a new Representation Bill . That Certain might happen once a year or once in two raised or three years, and we should be liable at any time to have a Representation-Bill brought forward to the exclusion of practical business. This measure provides that the Chief Electoral Officer's certificate shall, for the purposes of the Bill, be accepted as evidence as to the number of the people of the Commonwealth. That certificate must be based upon the statements of the Statisticians, and, therefore, in essence we have to rely upon the Statisticians' statements, and to assume that the numbers of the people in the various States are as the Statisticians estimate them. Personally, I have not the least doubt that Victoria has lost a sufficient number of people in proportion to the other States to reduce her representation in this House. I have not the least doubt as to the trend of population in Victoria as compared with the other States. The honourable and learned member for Corinella stated that he had taken into account the trend of population. That is the very thing he had - no right to do. His only consideration should haw been the actual population, having regard, not to the Statisticians' statements, but to the latest statistics. Therefore, the honourable and learned member has gone quite beyond his duty in looking at the trend of population. He had no right to do that. If the late Government did that they were wrong, as also is the present Government if it has been influenced by the same consideration. The more we rely upon the actual simple words of Lhe Constitution, the better we shall be able to judge as to the attitude we should assume now and hereafter, because the Bill will be used hereafter as a precedent for making other changes in the representation, when other States will be prejudicially affected. I warned the Minister for Home Affairs that he was wrong with regard to a section of the Judiciary Act, but he did not take heed of my advice, and afterwards in the Courts it was found that I was right. I say without hesitation that in this case he is going wrong with regard to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, because Statisticians' guesses are not the latest statistics.",25
73,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Does the honourable and learned member suggest that the latest census is referred to?,26
74,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I do not confine myself to the latest census, but to the latest systematic enumeration.",26
75,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"B v the Commonwealth ? Mr HIGGINS'-That may be a debatable matter, but, at all events there must be a systematic enumeration.",26
76,Sir PHILIP FYSH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,A progressive statistical return ?,26
77,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I do not think that that is necessarilya systematic enumeration.,26
78,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Does the honourable and learned member mean an actual count of heads ?,26
79,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I mean an actual count of heads in some fashion which may reasonably be called an enumeration, and not a mere estimate. If one looks at section 24 of the Constitution, he will see that it is clear that the number of members chosen in the several States is to be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people. That is all very well, supposing that the number of the people can be ascertained. But the section afterwards describes how the number of members is to be ascertained. It proceedsAnd shall, until Parliament otherwise provides, be determined whenever necessary in the following mannerI see no difficulty in regard to the meaning of the words "" whenever necessary."" They mean simply whenever it is necessary to determine the number-that the number shall be determined whenever it is necessary. Now let us see how that number is to be determined. The section providesA quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of the people of the Commonwealth, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by twice the number of the senators. At the time the Constitution was framed all the States had a census taken at least once in ten years, and we dealt with the state of affairs as it then existed. The idea was obviously that we should rely upon the census, and that we should not be affected by the trend of population, as the honourable and learned member for Corinella would have it, or by the calculations or estimates of statisticians. It was intended that the number of the people should be ascertained by the latest statistics; as matters stood then, by the last census.",26
80,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Does the honourable and learned member mean to say that the draftsman did not understand the difference between ""census"" and ""statistics "" ?",26
81,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No . But I say that the draftsman had in his mind a systematic enumeration, and that if he had intended the numbers to be ascertained by any other means than an enumeration he would have specified it. The draftsman did not know exactly what method of enumeration might be followed in the various States, and therefore he used the term "" latest statistics."". No doubt he had mainly in his mind the last census. If it were at all material the honourable and learned member for Corinella has shown that the population of Victoria has not been advancing in the same ratio as those of the other States. With all respect to the honourable and learned member, I do not think that that has anything fo do with the question. It might on certain occasions justify a certain enumeration, or the taking of a census more frequently than every ten years; but at the same time it has nothing to do with the question of our being guided by the latest statistics. If honourable members will look at the meaning of the word ""statistics"" in any dictionary, they will find that it means a systematic enumeration, and not a! series of ingenious guesses. I do not object to the reduction of the number of Victorian representatives, because I think that that is a matter of very little importance. As Victorians, I think we are all well protected by our having representatives from the other States here, who will take care that np injustice is done to us. It is not on that ground that I take objection to the Bill. When I was asked whether the proposed mode of changing the representation was constitutional, I stated that we were bound to abide by the statistics as they appeared in the last actual count. Take the case of China, for instance. There have been grave questions as to the actual population of that country. Suppose any one spoke of the latest population statistics with regard to China, we should say there were no such statistics. While persons have estimated the population.of China with very great care, their estimates do not constitute statistics. Therefore, I think that the honourable and learned member for Corinella has absolutely missed the point at issue. Having regard to the fact that the best statisticians make serious errors, those who framed our Constitution decided .that "" the latest statistics of the Commonwealth "" should form the basis of the representation of the States, and not the estimates of States Statisticians. An attempt has been made to show that the words ""the latest statistics of the Commonwealth "" mean the latest statistical estimates of the Commonwealth. I attach very little importance to the reduction in the number of Victorian representatives in this House. But I say that hereafter other changes 'will be recommended upon the faith of this procedure. I hold that we are going the wrong way to work. We are asked to break the constitutional prescription by bringing in a number of matters which we have no right to. introduce, such as the supposed trend of population, which might alter tomorrow, as the result of a gold rush, for which contingency provision is made in the Constitution.",26
82,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The able and exhaustive address of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, in which he gave figures which I had intended to use in the debate upon this Bill, renders it unnecessary for me to enter into many considerations that otherwise I would have felt myself justified in debating. As the Minister who was primarily responsible for the proposal which was accepted by the late Cabinet, I endeavoured to approach the matter of the representation of the States with an independent mind, and with an unbiased judgment, such as I am sure any member of this House placed in - a similar position would have sought to exhibit. When it was decided that a redistribution of seats should take place, I was asked by the officers of the Department whether the representation of the States was to be taken into account. I replied that, as the Constitution declared that "" whenever necessary "" the representation of the individual States should be taken into account, surely it was necessary - if it would ever be necessary-whe n we were adjusting the inequalities between electorate and electorate that we should adjust those between State and State. In regard to the steps which were to be taken to make that adjustment, I instructed the electoral officers that unless they saw reason to depart from the procedure adopted by another Ministry, when the same problem was under consideration, that procedure was to be followed in its entirety. That was done. I saw no reason to depart from it, and the action taken by a previous Ministry was consequently followed by the late Government. To me it is rather strange that some of those who have taken exception to the action of the late Government were members of this Parliament at the time the Barton Administration accepted the statistics furnished by the States Statisticians, gazetted them as .the statistics of the Commonwealth, and determined-as they showed no necessity for altering the - representation of the States-that there should be no alteration in that representation. That process was adopted by the Barton Government. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the present Attorney-General were members of this House at the time. Upon that occasion allusion was made to the method which was being adopted, but neither they, nor any other member of. the House, offered one word of objection to the procedure of that Government",27
83,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Politica l issues were not affected.,27
84,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honourable member for Wide Bay has made an interjection which partakes of the nature of a suggestion. I do not say for a moment that honourable members remained quiet, although a wrong course was being followed, simply because their State representation was not affected. I wouid rather put it the other way, and say that, as their State representation was not affected, their attention was not sufficiently directed to the procedure which was being adopted, and consequently they accepted it without that greater deliberation which they gave to the matter when they saw that rb-ir State's representation was to be decreased. Mr HIGGINS. - I should not have observed it but for the fact that I was asked a question.",27
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If the Barton Government took a wrong course upon that occasion, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, as well as every other member of this House, was equally responsible.",27
86,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,At that time attention was drawn to the want of uniformity in the method of taking the returns.,28
87,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,-Some attention was drawn to the omission of a large number of aliens in the case of Queensland.,28
88,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,And to the uncertainty as to whether a uniform rule was being applied.,28
89,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne states that when the Federal Convention decided upon section 24 of the Constitution, the delegates had in mind the census returns as the basis of State representation. Is it not surprising-as was put by the honourable and learned member for Corinella-that the Bill which formed the basis of our Clonstitutionthat is, the draft Bill of 1891-actuall y declared that the consideration of the necessity for an alteration in the representation of the States should take place after a census.",28
90,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The word ""statistics"" is larger than the word ""census.""",28
91,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If ithe word "" statistics"" has a larger meaning than the word "" census,"" it was adopted in order that something more than census might be adopted for the official returns. The clause in the draft Bill framed by the Convention of 1891, which bears upon this matter, statesA fresh apportionment of the representation of the States shall be made after each census of the people of the Commonwealth, which shall be taken at intervals not longer than ten years, but a fresh apportionment shall not take effect until the next general election. That provision was deliberately abandoned by the Conventions which met prior to the establishment of Federation. The honourable and learned member for. Northern Melbourne had every reason to know that it had been abandoned, because it was abandoned not only in regard to the Constitution Act, but also Tn regard to the first representation of the States in this House. Surely, if there was ever an occasion upon which the census returns should have been taken to determine the exact representation of the States, that occasion was when the number of representatives to which the various States were originally entitled in this Parliament was fixed. Surely that was the most important epoch in the history of this question. At that time the 1901 census could easily have been ante-dated. The Commonwealth could have taken the census a year earlier. Instead of that, the Convention deliberately adopted the figures of the Statisticians.",28
92,Mr KENNEDY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Did not the subsequent census prove that those figures were considerably out in the totals?,28
93,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"They did not affect the representation. The subsequent figures did prove' that there were some, 10,000 or 12,000 persons in one State less than was estimated, and about as many more in another. But to meet the error which the Statisticians saw had crept in during that period, they adopted certain allowances, which have been embodied in the Bill under consideration. \",28
94,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"How does that affect the question of the meaning of the words "" the latest statistics "" ?",28
95,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I intend to show that, so far from determining that the statistics should-be those of a census, the Convention decided that the original representation of the States should be based upon the figures of the Statisticians.",28
96,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The States had nothing to go on.,28
97,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The Commonwealth could have readily anticipated the 1901 census by taking a census in 1900.,28
98,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The States do not all take their census at the same time.,28
99,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"But the Commonwealth could have arranged that the census should anticipate the fixing of the representation. Here is what Mr. O'Connor moved in connection with the fixing of. the original representation of the States:Notwithstanding anything in section 24, the number of members to be chosen by each State at the first election shall be as follows :-To be determined according to the latest statistical returns at the date of the passing of the Act, and in relation to the quota referred to in previoussections. The following is an extract from the report:",28
100,Mr OCONNOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I beg to move-That the words ""section 24"" (line 2} be struck out, and that the words "" the last preceding section"" be substituted.",28
101,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I see in this clause that there is a gap after the words "" as follows.""' At what stage is it proposed to have that gap filled up? Is it before this Bill is sent Home, or afterwards?",28
102,Mr OCONNOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It is to be filled up according to the latest statistical returns, at the date of the passing, of the Act, by the Imperial Parliament. MrHIGCINS - You leave it for the Imperial Parliament to fill in the gap?",29
103,Mr OCONNOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Undoubtedly . The figures may change in the meantime. The amendment was agreed to. This absolutely shows what was the intention of the Convention-subsequentl y endorsed by the Imperial Act-as to the first representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. We see that the Convention deliberately substituted for the word ""census"" the words ""the latest statistics of the Commonwealth.""",29
104,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"They omitted all reference to "" statistics "" f rOm clause 26.",29
105,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But they deliberately left out of clause 24 the reference to the census contained in the draft Bill.,29
106,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The more significant point is that they never inserted those words in clause 26.,29
107,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,It is provided that the latest statistics of the Commonwealth are to be taken for the purpose of establishing the representation.,29
108,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No ; the ""statistical returns.""",29
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,What is the difference?,29
110,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,There is a material difference.,29
111,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The action of the present Ministry shows that the late Government could not have taken any other course than they did. We find that when they are face to face with the situation that we had confronting us they are prepared to take the same statistics. Even census returns are far from being absolutely correct.,29
112,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"They are the best that we can obtain, and why should we not go - for the best?",29
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I repeat that the census returns are not absolutely correct; that the States having larger areas and more scattered populations invariably suffer. This is proven by the electoral returns.' I have before me some figures, which I prepared for another purpose, that Illustrate the point I am now making. They show what is the actual proportion of the - elective population of each State to the whole population, and I may say, in passing, that I compared them, after the electoral lists had been collected, with the proportion of the electors in each State. I"" shall merely quote the figures relating to four of the States, as showing that it is quite impossible to accept the census returns as fully in the case of the larger States, where the population is scattered, as in the case of the smaller States. In New South Wales, for instance, the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 52 per cent., while the proportion of electors was only 46 per cent., or a difference of 6 per cent. In Victoria, with its circumscribed area and closer settlement, the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 54 per cent., and the proportion of electors' to the total population was 51 per cent., or a difference of only 3 per cent. In Queensland, on the other hand, .the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 52 per cent., whereas the proportion of electors to the, whole population was 44 per cent., a difference of 8 per cent. In Tasmania, again, the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 50 per cent., and the proportion of electors to the total population was 47 per cent., or a difference of 3 per cent. - exactl y the same as in the case of Victoria. These figures illustrate the effect of concentration; and also prove that a censuswhich is called for in connection with this matter, because it is supposed to be almost absolutely correct-ma y be very far out in the case of the larger States. I admit, after all, that the census must be. the basis of our calculation; but I hold that, having regard to the movements of our population-to the fact that large numbers are attracted from one State to another by developments such as have occurred in Western Australia-it would be highly undesirable to deal with the question of representation only once in ten years. I agree that the provision in the Bill , providing for a re-arrangement every five years, is sufficient. As regards the loss of a representative by Victoria, which, as the honourable and learned member for Corinella has said, has nothing whatever to do with the gain of a member by New South Wales, I personally regret, as much as does any representative of this State, the fact that Victoria, for some considerable time, has failed to keep step with the other States in the matter of population. No State can suffer in this respect without some reflective action on another, ""and, if it were possible, it would be well, only for Victoria, but for the whole of Commonwealth, that there should be gress along the whole line. We have recognise, however, that the population, only of Victoria, but of Australia, is ing from the pressure of the closely-settled parts to the more open areas of the Confurther tinent, and that it is probable that the crease in the States possessing the larger areas will be for many years out of prothoroughly portion to the increase of population Victoria,",29
114,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"But it is our country tricts that are losing population. Mr DUGA^LD; THOMSON - I am fied sorry to hear that. A loss in the rural districts is one of the worse features assothey ciated with a reduction of population. honourable and learned member for Northsponsible ern Melboune has said that the honourable and learned member for (Corinella, and colleagues in the late Ministry, had no right to take into consideration the trend population. I assert, however, that we had a right to take into account every circumcede stance that would tend to show the correctfirst ness, or incorrectness, of the figures with which we were dealing. Our sole object was to ascertain whether thosefiguresreally represented the actual facts, and, in tice to the State of Victoria, every point was taken into account, in order that might be ascertained whether or not any serious error had been committed. That was only what ought to have been done, It was recognised that the whole trend population since 1891 supported the figures presented to us by trie Statisticians. the Federation been in existence in 1891, Victoria would have been entitled, on census returns of that year, to twenty-six representatives, and New South Wales would have also been entitled to twentyas six. But everv enumeration that has been taken since then shows the trend of poputics lation to be in ""the direction in the case of Victoria, and an increase particularly in the case of New South Wales pened since then. and some of the other States, although that increase has not been quite sufficient in the of course explanations. latter to call for an addition to their sentation ",30
115,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The trend of population has been towards the north.,30
116,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"And also action towards the west. So far as Western tralia is concerned, however, any increase that has occurred is covered by the not representation which, it is allowed under the the Constitution.. I am not going to repeat prothe figures quoted by the honourable and to learned member for Corinella, but I would not remind the House that even the returns shiftfor the last two quarters show that the trend of population is further and in the same direction. In these cirincumstances, I think that the representatives of Victoria in the late Ministry were justified in the decision at which in they arrived, in common with their colleagues who represented other States. As dishonest representatives of the Commonwealth as a whole, they were fully justiin arriving at the'decision that the only course open to them was that which adopted. It was for this reason that, The although I was the Minister primarily refor the proposal, I was very pleased to allow the honourable and learned his member for Corinella, as one of the representatives of Victoria in the late Ministry, of who was. attacked by the press of his own State for his action in this regard, to preme. in order that, he might have the opportunity to put forward the figures on which we relied, and to explain the reasons for the decision arrived at by the late Cabinet. The present Attorney-General, juswhen the proposals of the late Government were made public, seemed to consider that it that Government were acting unfairly to Victoria, and that they had no right to accept the Statisticians' figures as determining the basis of representation. He apof peared to hold the view that the census should alone be adopted as the basis of reHad presentation; but as soon as he and his colleagues are faced with the responsibility the which every member has to bear when acting, not for a section, but'for the whole of the Commonwealth, we find them accepting the basis of the representation of the States in the near future, the very statiswhich their predecessors were blamed of a reduction for adopting.",30
117,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But a great deal has hap,30
118,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"There are I hope that in reprethis connection, the Minister of Home Affairs will see that the very considerable expense incurred by' the late Government in this direction will not be lost-that will be taken at a sufficiently early Ausdate to make use of the figures, and, as far as possible, of the divisions special that were adopted by the Commissioners appointed by the late Government. Otherwise there would be, not only a great deal of confusion, but large additional pense. I think that, now that it has been determined that the figures of the Statisat ticians are to be taken, the sooner we proliament gress with the previous scheme of redistribution the better it will be for the Parliament and for thefinancesof the Federation.  tween the scheme provided for in the Bill and that which the honourable member's Gois vernment introduced?",30
119,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I have said that there is none. We for our evil acts, and attacked for our unconstitutional proceedings; but our succeshad sors are now faced with the same facts. I do not say that it is to their discredit that they are doing what we did. I would separate measure. have thought it to their discredit if order to enable some of their members act consistently with their previous they had adopted something which was not fair and just. Having been faced by the facts and circumstances with which we were faced, the present Ministry have had to come to the same conclusion.",31
120,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Does not the honourable member think it an advantage to have staciple is the same. tutory provision for quinquennial enumerations.,31
121,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honof the orable member will understand that the late Government had to take action during recess. We had promised Parliament that action would be taken for a redistributhere tion during the recess, so that everything would be ready when Parliasay every five years. ment met. We could not redistribute the electorates until we had determined what the representation of the States enumerations. should be. That was the first question which faced me as the Minister who indetermining quired into this matter. A decision as what the representation of the States necessary. should be had to precede redistribution. Unless I could get the machinery work in time to have matters ready for Parliament when it met, 1 should have broken my promise to the House, which had no intention of doing, or should have had to' postpone the putting forward of proposals to so late a period of the session that they would probably not have been on carried into effect. Therefore, the Gointerest vernment decided to act in this matter just as the Barton Ministry had acted. But that did not prevent us from further dealtative ing with it so that future distributions should not be left to the mere whim or exwill of the Ministry, and I had a proposal to bring that about.

130,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,A suggestion as to that is to contained in the Electoral Bill.,31
131,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I put a suggestion of that kind into the Electoral I Bill which I prepared. It is highly improper that these matters should be left my to Ministers. Sometimes it leads to perhaps unfounded charges against Ministers, the score that they are acting in their own or in that of their party. Moreover, this is not a question for a Ministry alone. Every State and every represenof a State has a right in this respect. I think that the members who represent States should determine, not merely when a readjustment of representation shall take rule of right. place, but when redistributions shall take place. That may easily be .provided for, either at certain periods, or when a certain proportion of the electorates are beyond the margin allowed.",31
132,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That proposal is contained in the Electoral Bill which has been culated today.,32
133,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No doubt with the Minister would have made such proVictoria. vision of his own accord, but he has flattered me by adopting the proposal I put into my Electoral Bill . I shall not detain the House longer. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has the facts and figures which I , as well he, had collected, exceedingly fairly and very ably before the House. He has, I think, shown the people of Victoria that the Victorian members of the late Ministry, so fa r from neglecting the interests of State, fought every inch along the line, until they found that justice and honesty were against any other position than which they agreed to adopt.",32

138,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," You, Mr . Speaker, must recognise the courage and critical faculty of the honourable and learned member for Corinella in reference to this matter. So powerful was his criticism of the measure that, contrary to my cirordinary behaviour, I was compelled to make an unwilling exclamation. I agree him in lamenting the depopulation of",32
139,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Not depopulation, but which less rapid increase of population.",32
140,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I will qualify my stateput ment in that way. I do not rejoice or as gloat over this fact, and I sympathize with the honourable and learned member in being compelled to point out the great disparity which now exists between the various electorates. Bad as we have always considered that the position to be, the honourable and learned member's close examination of the facts has shown it to be even worse than that we expected. But honourable members as a whole will, I am certain, take an Australian view of this matter. They will a not be influenced by the fact that New South Wales will gain a representative by a readjustment of the representation of the or Commonwealth. In a few years Queensland may be in a similar position, because the tendency of our population is to inthey crease more rapidly in the eastern and north-eastern coastal districts than elsewhere. The present Government are doing what the late Government were reviled for to do. If Victoria were in the same position which New South Wales occupies, the press and public of this State would be clamouring for a readjustment of But although the Reid disGovernment were reviled for what they proposed, the only difference between their proposal and that of this Government is that"" they wished to do by an Order in times, Council what this Government wishes to we do by an Act of Parliament.

It is no test of the of their desire to have a rePossibly the introduction of this measure mav delay readjustment. All that the Bill does is to empower the Chief Electoral Officer to obtain certain figures from the Statisbut Che Minister of Home Affairs could have obtained the same information without the passing of the measure. The Barton Ministry evaded the position altogether, the Reid Ministry were prevented from recognising it , and what reason have we to believe that the Deakin Ministry will not also evade it?",32
141,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Surely we must take their word ?,33
142,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"That is like asking a child to shut its eyes, open its mouth, and take what is given to it. The honourable member for Wide Bay is not a child, and he is not so - unsophisticated as to suppose that the measure now before us will in. itself suffice to bring about a redistribution of seats. I would ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is the intention of the Government as soon as this measure is passed to take the steps necessary to bring about a redistribution of seats before the present session closes?",33
143,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"As soon as the Bill is passed, its provisions will be acted upon, and as soon as a redistribution is shown to be necessary, provision will be made for it .",33
144,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,There is no authority for making such a redistribution under this Bill. Mr _GROOM - Provisio n is made under the Electoral Bill which is being circulated in the Senate. That measure provides that a redistribution shall be made whenever it is shown to be necessary.,33
145,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The present measure does not make a redistribution necessary, although the honourable and learned member for Corinella quoted certain figures which showedl that ft phoiild place at the earliest possible moment. Several members of the present Ministry were opposed to a redistribution of seats on a former occasion. Some of them said that the States statistics could not be relied upon, and yet they have under the present Bill accepted the same means of information that were then available. The Barton Government baulked at one hurdle, and how are we to know that the present Government will not baulk at some other obstacle? How are we to know that a redistribution of seats will place unless some guarantee is afforded that the certificate of the Electoral Officer will be acted upon? Judging from previous experience, we have every reason to entertain doubts as to the practical results likely to follow from this measure. It was very gratifying to find the honourable and learned member for Corinella giving his strong support to the measure, and acknowledging that it was necessary in order to do full justice to the other States. I think, however, thai we shall not satisfactorily deal with this; matter until some authority outside of Parliament is empowered to carry out the intentions o¥ the Constitution. We know that certain delays may take place, becausccertain regulations are required to be laid before Parliament, and I can foresee that ample means would be available to those who desired to prevent a redistribution of seats from being brought about. The figures presented to us by the honourable and learned member for ' Corinella with regard to the disparity in the number of electors were realty astonishing. If such figures had been submitted by representatives of New South Wales they would have been discredited; but now there can be no doubt as to their correctness, and I hope that the Government, in view of the necessities of the case, will do everything they can to facilitate a redistribution of seats. We all regret that one State is losing population, but that is not a matter of parliamentary concern. Parliament should have no control over the redistribution of the electorates. That is a question solelv affecting theinterests of the electors, and therefore should be placed entirely beyond parliamentary control. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne raised a mere quibble when he spoke of. the necessity for a systematic enumeration. He was not so much concerned about a systematic enumerations take as a systematic evasion of the Constitution. The assurance given by the Minister of Home Affairs, that as soon as. the Electoral Officer has obtained sufficient information ,to justify a redistribution of seats, the electorates in the various States will be distributed upon an equitable basis, is satisfactory so far as it goes, but I should like to feel as sure of winning .£10,000 as I do that obstacles will be raised to the redistribution of seats, which will result in our going to our constituents next_ year under the same conditions that take obtained at the last election. I am satisfied that the forces in Victoria in opposition to Chief the Bill are strong enough to create almost insuperable obstacles to its being carried into practical effect. I do not suggest that the Ministry have brought forward the Bill as a subterfuge, but I feel confident that it will be so used as a consequence of sentations which will be made by the Vicbasis torian press and others. I do not consider that the interests of the electors will - safeguarded until the whole question of the redistribution of seats"" is taken out of hands of Parliament.",33
146,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I think that mistake was made by the first Federal liament in not making provision for the compilation of Commonwealth statistics. tliink it is fairly clear that the intention was that, as soon as possible after the Parliament was returned, statistics should be prepared for the purpose of ascertaining the number of representatives to which each State was entitled. Although the Constistifution contemplates. tution declares that members are to be turned in proportion to the number of people in each State, it does not follow that we should be continually changing the four years ago. representation. The wording of our Constltution is not the same as in the United States Constitution, but the effect is the same. In the latter case, proposes, vision is made that the representation of various States shall be according to respective numbers of the people, but no provision is made for an enumeration every year for .the purpose of ascertaining wheof ther the proportion of representation of various States is to be varied. They have had a census every ten years, but, as a matter of fact, they are not obliged to wait for that period to elapse. At the outset provision was made in Article I . , section 3, for. a. certain number'of members for each State until an Act could be passed, to provide for specifically ascertaining actual population. That was what was done under our own Constitution, those The American Constitution went on to say that the actual enumeration should be P made within three years after the first meeting of Congress! In other words, it statistics was distinctly stated in the Constitution that the first Congress must pass an Act to provide, not for the adoption of Constitution says., existing statistics, but for ascertaining by a special enumeration the number of people within the Federation, 1 in order that the number of members to which each State was entitled might be determined. Constitution goes on to say that an enumeration shall take place within the. every subsequent period of ten years, We are attempting to accomplish the same by any Convention delegate. result, but by somewhat different words, Our Constitution does not provide for the represtatistics of the States being made the of their representation in this Parliament. Instead, the framers of our Constibe .tution left it to be understood that the blanks, which appear in section 26, were to the be filled up by taking the statistics of the States pro tern., and ascertaining by the apa plication of the quota the number of memParbers to which they were entitled. Practically what the Convention did was to deI clare that the number of representatives to which each State is entitled shall be ascerfirst tained by Commonwealth statistics. I do not believe that we ought to adopt the statistics of the States for that purpose. We are doing that, but it is not what the Con-That charter of regovernment contemplates that we should, not sleep upon this matter-that we should have made some provision in this connection",34
147,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But there was a census .that adopted taken four years ago.,34
148,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"For Commonwealth purthe Constitution ignores State sta'tisthe tics. Those statistics are absolutely good the for State purposes until we pass an Act dealing with statistics and abrogate State legislation upon the subject. The powers the States extend only to the collection the of statistics for State purposes. When we pass an Act relating to statistics and census we can alter the method of collecting statistics within the various States, because that method must be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, if we so prescribe it. The States have no concurrent power to declare that their statistics shall affect the' reprethe sentation of the Commonwealth, Mr - CONROY - They 'can declare what statistics are, and we can adopt them. M - GLYNN - That is so. But I would f o l n t 0 l l t that our Constitution does not contemplate that we should really adopt the of the States for the purposes of a first redistribution. Mr -. MCCAY - Surely that is what the",34
149,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honourable and learned member commenced his argument by introducing the opinions of various delegates, as expressed in the Federal ConvenThe tion. I quite agree that it is a very vicious principle to attempt to interpret Constitution, or its presumed intention, merely by quoting the words employed I do not quote the opinions expressed by delegates Representation [13 SEPTEMBER, 1905.] I rely upon the spirit of the Constitution. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, however, went further than that. He sought to justify the action of the late Government in following the precedent of the Barton Administration-whic h declared the existing statistics of the States to be valid without - a Commonwealth Actby showing that a similar mistake was made by delegates to the Convention. What appears to have been contemplated was, that we should follow the American example. Consequently, that we should put it out of the power of the States to determine what ought to be the basis of representation in this House. The Commonwealth ought to deal with this matter. If we rely upon States statistics, one State may very easily obtain a far bigger representation than that to which it is entitled. Hence the power from the very outset was deliberately taken from the States. But now, owing to the delay which has taken place, we are obliged to adopt what has been done by the States.",34
150,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Why are we obliged to do that ?,35
151,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Because it seems fairly clear upon the statistics of the States that thatVictoria will lose one representative, whilst New South Wales will gain one ; and, as the cost of taking a census would be State, £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 , the late Ministry declaredand the present Government entertain the same view-that it vypuld be a pity to take a special census for the purpose of giving NPW South Wales its proper share sentation. At the same time, we are not obliged to do that. We ought in future to 'adopt a specific enumeration for CommonStates. wealth purposes. We ought not to rely upon the statistics of the States.",35
152,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Coul d not our statistical officer refuse to adopt the statistics of States if he thought that they were ""cooked ""?",35

154,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Unde r this Bill the statis10 tics of the States may be rejected.,35
155,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No doubt they may be. reaches Committee. We have the power to declare that in future a specific enumeration shall be the basis of the parliamentary representation of the States. Under sections 24 and of* the Constitution we have that power. The method of ascertaining the population of the States for the purposes of section Bill. 2215 24 may be determined by Parliament. Under section 51 statistics may also be collected, but the manner in which we are to obtain statistics for the purposes of representation is a matter for our own option. I would suggest that, as we have power to postpone a redistribution for a period of ten years, we ought to say that at the end of every ten years the census returns collected by the Commonwealth shall form the basis of the representation of the States. We do not desire frequent I say changes. They are bad in principle, and are practised nowhere. ' Even democratic countries are not continually redistributing their electorates, although representation in some States is based as far as possible upon their population. The Bill itself is intended to make temporary provision in this respect by adopting the census returns of the States as the basis of representation. Upon a glance at its provisions, I confess that to me they appear to be somewnat inconsistent. For instance, clause 3 provides that an enumeration day shall be appointed at the expiration of every fifth year after the taking of the then last preceding census, whereas clause 4 declares Until the census is taken pursuant to any law of the Commonwealth, the census taken pursuant to the law of any State shall, as regards that be the census for the purposes of this Act. It seems to me that one State may take a census return during one year, and another of repreState during a different year.",35
156,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I think that the census taking is now uniform throughout the,35
157,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If that be so, my objection falls to the ground.",35
158,Mr FISHER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Speakin g from memory, I think that the census returns are now taken the at a uniform .time throughout the States.",35
159,Mr GB EDWARDS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Nearl y all communities compile their census returns duryears ending with the figure ""one""enumeraas, for example, in 190.1.",35
160,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I doubt whether clause is constitutional, but upon that question I shall defer my remarks until the Bill",35
161,Mr KNOX,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I listened with very great pleasure to the speech delivered by the honourable and learned member for 51 Corinella, but I have consistently held that it is undesirable to accept mere statistics as the basis for determining so important a matter as that which is involved in this Bill. When I was in London, some time ago, I heard Lord Rosebery deliver a speech, in the course of which, in commenting on' certain figures which had been presented, he referred to the various degrees of unreliability by saying, "" There are lies, condemnable lies, and statistics."" Whilst I think that our State statistics are compiled with care, and that they are the result of years of experience, I cannot imagine that our Constitution intended anything else than that there should have been some general compilation of the population of the entire Commonwealth. As far as I can understand, the Constitution does not declare that'the Commonwealth must of necessity accept the statistics of the States in any shape or form. We have the power to do so if we choose, but surely as a general principle it is desirable that there should be some means, of ascertaining, for Commonwealth purposes, what is the population of the Commonwealth - individual We can only arrive at an accurate knowledge of what our population is, for the purposes of State representation, by taking a census. Honourable members admit that it is an unimportant matter whether New South Wales gains an additional representative and Victoria loses one. If that be so, why should we change the existing state of things with such haste, and before we have obtained accurate figures as to the population of the Commonwealth.",35
162,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Because aRedistribution, of Seats Bill has been promised. Under the circumstances referred to by the honourable member, we should'be again called upon, within a very short period, to effect another redistribution.",36
163,Mr KNOX,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That would not be a very expensive proceeding. It would merely involve the appointment of a Commissioner,36
164,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,It would also mean the printing of new rolls.,36
165,Mr KNOX,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Surely the rolls would have to be revised every year, in order to meet the movements in population.",36
166,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,They would have to be redistributed.,36
167,Mr KNOX,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I feel that, in view of all these facts, I shall be justified in adhering to the opinion I have formed that we shall act wisely in refraining from making any alteration in the representation of the States until we have the census returns before us. If we are to. have changes of representation at intervals of less than ten years, we shall have a state of uncertainty which is highly undesirable. The disadvantages of making a change at the present time would overwhelm any of the suggested advantages to be derived from this measure, and I think that we ought to wait until we have the actual census figures before us. I shall not venture to discuss the question of what is the meaning of the words ""the-latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" as used in the section of the Constitution governing this matter. That is a question that must be left fo the lawyers. All that I have to do is to consider the question from a common sense point of view, and I have arrived at the conclusion that the only satisfactory statistics that we can adopt are those obtained as the result of an elaborate, proper, and systematic enumeration, taken either directly for Commonwealth purposes, or in the ordinary course of events by the States. I think I shall be acting in the best interests of the Commonwealth, as well as of the State of which I am a representative, in voting against the second reading of the Bill.",36
168,Mr SOLMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I desire to refer briefly to this question, which is one of the gravest importance, and may have a serious bearing on the State of which I have the honour to be a representative. I deeply regret that the honourable member for Dalley should have made a comparison which is dot fair to any State, and is particularly unfair to Victoria. The honourable member said that he viewed with feelings of astonishment the fact that the honourable and learned member for Corinella, although a representative of Victoria, should have been able to summon sufficient courage to make the exhaustive statement that he did regarding the question of representation as adversely affecting this State. I sincerely hope that one's views on this question will not be held' to be entirely coloured and conHJrolJed by the fact that one is a representative of a particular State - It is well that we should recognise that we are here as the representatives, not of any particular State, but of the whole Commonwealth. It should be our desire to do justice to every part of the Commonwealth, and not to secure advantages for one State at the expense of the rest. That is the view which I take in approaching this question. The honourable and learned member for Corinella was enabled to make an elaborate statement because of the fact that, as a member of the late Government, he had access to documents and records which are not readily obtainable by private members - He had also had an opportunity 'to discuss the question with his colleagues in the late Government, and, knowing the loyalty to their State of the three members of that Cabinet who represented Victoria, I am sure .that that discussion was a very full One. In these circumstances the honourable and learned member has been able to. deal more completely with the whole question than an honourable member in ordinary circumstances could hope to do. It seemed to me that he was more anxious«to excuse the act of the late Government",36
169,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I did not wish to excuse anything; there was nothing requiring an excuse.,37
170,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am« referring only to the impression which his speech made on my mind, and am not going to ascribe to the honourable and .learned member any motive that he would not care to have attributed to him. The feeling that was engendered by the statement that he made to the House was that he was more anxious to explain and to excuse the action of the Government of which he was a member",37
171,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Not excuse, please.",37
172,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am speaking only of the opinion that I formed'. I may have misapprehended the honourable and learned member's intention, but that is my misfortune rather than his fault.",37
173,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,He was seeking to justify the action of the late Government.,37
174,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"At all events, that was the impression which I formed from his speech, and it is one which, notwithstanding his disclaimer, is still firmly fixed in my mind. It is a misfortune that we have to view the matter of the representation of the States in the House and that of the actual electoral representation from two different stand-points. In 24 of the Constitution the expression ""the people of the Commonwealth"" is used, apparently with the intention that the re- of a State? presentatives shall be chosen by the electors of the whole Commonwealth. In the same section, however, the words ""the people"" are used in quite a different sense, the intention there being to refer to the whole of the population of the Commonwealth. It is a misfortune that the Constitution is not more explicit with regard to this point. It is also unfortunate that the numbers of those who are to constitute the State representation are to be different from those who are to provide the electoral representation. I am not going to discuss the alleged loss of population, because I do not beljeve that any loss has actually occurred. The fact remains, however, that for some reason or other Victoria has not progressed so rapidly in the matter of population as have the other States. We have some solace in the fact that the latest electoral rolls show that Victoria has not gone back in the matter of her electoral representation. We have now on the rolls for Victoria 2,260 more electors than there were at the time of the election in 1903; but the rolls for New South Wales show that she has 21,071 less than she had at the election in question. I quote thesefiguresin order to give point to the argument that it is to be regretted that ' population, and population alone, should be the governing factor in the matter of representation. To my mind, the framers of the Constitution would have shown greater forethought had they provided that the electoral strength of a State should have some bearing on any alteration so far as its representation in this Chamber was concerned. If the Bill now before us be carried, and the estimates which have been quoted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella be adopted, what will be the position? We shall have a representative of New South Wales representing on the average 20,947 electors, while every representative of Victoria will represent 27,969.",37
175,Mr DEAKIN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Hear , hear.",37
176,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That is a disparity which I feel sure was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.,37
177,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"As the Prime Minister cheers this remark, he ought to withdraw the Bill. .",37
178,Mr DEAKIN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Is that the honourable and section learned member's idea of logic?,37
179,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Surely some consideration should be given to the electoral strength,37
180,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honourable member's figures are wrong, for the average numbet represented by a member from New South Wales would be not 20,947, but 24,666.",37
181,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I did not know that these figures were available until a few moments ago, when I obtained them from the Minister of Home Affairs, and I am prepared to accept the honourable and learned member's correction.",37
182,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The disparity to which the honourable member has rea ferred is due largely to the impossibility effecting a complete collection in the larger States, where the population is scattered.",38
183,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I would point out to the honourable member that we. have the same system of collection in Victoria that is operation in New South Wales, and that would be just as fair to assume that those making the enumeration in Victoria were remiss in their duty as it would be to that assumption concerning those carrying out the work in New South Wales.",38
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I have shown that the difference between the total population and the proportion of toria was only 3 per cent., whereas in case of New South Wales, it was 6 per cent.",38
185,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"That , after all, is difference of only 3 per cent. The figures tions. I have quoted are substantially correct, and have been issued, I understand, by the partment of Home Affairs.",38
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I am not questioning them; I am simply referring to the causes of the difference.,38
187,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I do not think cept a small percentage. that we are at present concerned with the causes of the difference. The fact stares us in the face that are controlled and governed by figures compiled by officers acting the same instructions. These going to govern our representation in the future. They will not take into account another. causes; they will give us the actual When we have a remarkable disparity, as has been shown to 'exist between the figures compiled by the Statisticians and ridicule. the census returns, we have reason to say that more consideration should be given to this matter. I feel sure that no honyears' count. orable member representing New South Wales would feel justified, in sitting in this House if he knew that he represented considerablv smaller number of electors than were represented by the members returned by other States. I urge that before step is taken under this Bill , some vision should be made to give weight the) facts which I Wave stated, so that a procedure, which I feel sure must be distasteful to all, will not be carried - I speak, not of a State not being titled to another member, but of a. State him to get over. being deprived of a member. In conclusion, just a word with regard to the compilation of these figures. Ten years is very short term indeed in the life of a of nation, and we should guard against the tremendous upheavals which, in a young country like this, where so large a proportion of the population moves from place to place, may occur with too frequent alterain tions of the representation of the States. it We must remember that those who move from place to place still remain electors of the Commonwealth, and their interests make are Commonwealth interests. We should not, therefore, alter the basis of representation unless we have indisputable evidence that the alteration is warranted.",38

Those enfigures will make a. very big fence for If he is prepared to accept the system of guesswork followed by the States for many years past, and call that an enumeration, 1 ;ai not. The census enumeration is the only method which we should adopt. With regard to elecpiled toral representation, I know that that mattaking ter is not now under consideration; but, incidentally, I should like to say that should be regulated as circumstances arise to make that necessary. With regard to the; greater and larger question, the States representation should, in my opinion, be-altered at this time, because it depends on an entirely different system. Electoral representation depends on the collection electoral rolls; but the representation the States, if we adopt the system now posed, will depend very largely on figures which are the result of guesswork, and not on figures which have been properly compass piled. You cannot say that you have asshall certained the facts, if you accept figures which have been guessed at. In order to ascertain that a thing exists, its existence division to return a member. must be proved, and the various changes our population cannot be ascertained by accepting mere estimates. I recognise that it is of hardly any use to speak against Government measure, but I feel certain Parliament, by passing this Bill, will commit an act which it will have cause subsequently to regret. I feel that a mistake is being made, and that the tremendous interests at stake are being jeopardized to secure a very small gain to one particular State. I think, too, thabthe'good feeling which we should endeavour to promote between the States f will not be assisted by the events which must follow in the train of this measure. should have very much preferred the Government to say that they were not preterest pared to accept the position laid down their predecessors, and to take the estito mates of population as ascertained informa- . tion; but that they would propose a rearrangement of the electorates, and leave the representation of the States as it is unref til the end of the decennial period.",38
195,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I am very acting glad that the Bill has been introduced, cause it provides for representation on a fairer basis than we have at present. At the same time, I hold that all that was needed was to'put into effect the provisions of the Electoial Act of 1902. Owing to a cause into which it is unnecessary for me to enter now, the representation of'three of the States of the Commonwealth is . based upon statistics compiled nine years after the census of 1891 iwas taken, and since we were content to accept such figures for the first Federal Parliament, I think we need hardly quarrel with figures eomonly four years subseauent to the of a census, especially in view of the fact that the Statisticians of the States have it met together, and agreed to make certain additions and corrections,-which the figures of the census showed to be necessary. The error in our statistics under the former not method of compilation amounted to less than \ per cent., I believe, when compared with the census, and in future it will be of still less. With regard to my statement of that it would have been sufficient to put prointo effect the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, I would urge, in the first place, that we had certainly power to that Act. It provides that each State be distributed into electoral divisions, equal in number to the number of the members of the House of Representatives, each Commisin sioners were to be appointed for the purposes of this distribution-unde r the Bill, the Chief Electoral Officer is so appointed, a Then a quota was laid down, as deterthat mined by the Constitution. The trouble f m which we are at present suffering arose r 0 in connection with the distribution of the States into divisions, because, unfortunately, it was left to Parliament to determine whether it would or would not accept the proposals of the Commissioners,. and the Bill has a similar provision. Thereo r e j t h interests of individual members e w e r e brought into conflict with their judgI ent. and the experience of last Parliam - ment' proved that when that happens, inwill generally prevail over judgment, by The suggestions which were made in regard the proposed redistribution of the three t S t at e s prese n t e d even greater "" diffic u M e s t h a n the d is t r i but i o n s proposed by the Commissioners, showing clearly that, in u s in g t 0 a c c e p t the distributions of the Commissioners, honourable members were contrarily to their judgment * because beeir interests had been brdught into play, th T n e r e s u l t h as o e e n that o n e S t at e h as be e n a b l e t 0 r e t a in a representative to which it 1 8 not entitled, and another State has been deprived of a representative ,to which it is entitled, which is by 'far the greater evil, To my mind, the only need for bringing in Bill of this kind is to declare certain staa tistics Commonwealth statistics. _ However, I shall not quarrel with the introduction of the measure. I regret that it was not brought in long ago, or advantage taken of the'Electoral Act, and, therefore, I shall give it my hearty support. I am not certain, however,, that the period of ten years is too long to allow to elapse between the readjustment of the representation of the States. I would ask the Minister of Home Affairs to insert a clause providing that when States are distributed into divisions by the Electoral Commissioner appointed for that purpose, this Parliament shall not have the right to say whether his redistribution shall be accepted.",39
196,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The honourable and learned member will have an opportunity of discussing that question when the Electoral Bill comes before us.,40
197,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If some such provision is not made, we shall experience the same difficulty that was met with when the last distribution scheme was before us. Oh that occasion members' interests conflicted with their judgment to such an extent that, upon one pretext or another, the distributions proposed were rejected. I prophesied that that would be the result, and my forecast proved so accurate that I am almost justified in saying that, unless we provide proper safeguards in connection with the present measure, it will probably fai l to achieve the results expected, and we shall have again to go to the country upon the same conditions as previously. We shall not advance the cause of redistribution as thoroughly as we ought to do unless the Minister determines - to make its provisions of an automatic character, by insuring that the Commissioner's decision should be final. The provision in the Electoral Act, that objections may be lodged against the distribution proposed by the Commissioner within thirty days of its publication, is quite sufficient.",40
198,Mr CHANTER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Suppos e the Commissioner takes no notice of objections ? Mr C.ONROY - Bu the is bound to take some notice of them. It is highly undesirable that honourable members should be able to sit in judgment upon proposed alterations that may affect their seats. support the Bill, in the hope that some provision will be made to guard against the difficulties which arose in connection with the Electoral Act. If that course is not taken, some difficulty may crop up at the last minute which will prevent a redistribution of seats being made prior to the next general election, and the work we are now doing will thus be entirely lost.",40
199,Mr WILS ON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I think it is to be regretted that we are not able to redistribute the electoral divisions upon the basis of the decennial census. When we consider, however, the disparities that exist between the electorates, both in Victoria and other States, we must recognise the necessity for some change before the next election. It appears to me that we have no other recourse than to follow the provisions of the Constitution, and make a redistribution of seats according to the numbers of people in the various States. I am sorry that the State of Victoria has ceased to progress in the matter of population in the same ratio as have the other States - I must congratulate the representatives of New South Wales upon the fact that the population of that State has largely increased, and I should like to direct their attention to the fact that .that increase has taken place during the operation of a protective Tariff.",40
200,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that question.,40
201,Mr WILSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"We are dealing with the increase of population in some of the States, and I think that it is perfectly relevant to discuss the causes which have led to such increases.",40
202,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It . is perfectly in order for honourable members to refer to the relative increases, or decreases which have taken place in the populations of - the various States, but if honourable members were permitted to discuss the reasons for any such increases or decreases, 'it would be competent for them to debate the whole of the questions mentioned in section 51 of the Constitution.",40
203,Mr WILSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I must bow to vour ruling, Mr Speaker, and content myself bysaying that the fact I have stated is a most interesting one. I should like to direct the attention of the House to the fact already noted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. that the Attorney-General, before he became a member of the Government, condemned the I'shal l principles embodied in the measure, whereas it is to be assumed that he now accepts them in their entirety. I should like very muchto follow the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable and learned member for Angas, but I think that owing to the immediate necessity for a redistribution of seats we cannot wait for the next, decennial census. Therefore, I shall support the Bill .",40
204,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," In connection with this question, we have had a very striking proof of the fact that lawyers, like doctors, may differ. I confess that I have been in a very confused state of mind with regard to this question for some time past. Until recently I was disposed to follow those constitutional authorities who have taken up an attitude in opposition to the principles of the measure before us, but in view of the fact that the present Attorney-General has to a great extent backed down from the ,position he formerly took up",41
205,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,He has not said so. M i . GROOM - He declared that parliamentary action was necessary.,41
206,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I assume that the Atnevertheless, torney-General is*in accord with this B i which, so far as I can see, is upon actly the same lines as the proposal made by the previous Government to which objected.",41
207,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The Attorney-General has not stated that he has changed his opinion.,41
208,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If he has not changed his opinion, he has adopted a different attitude. Matters must have been pretty well muddled from the first if we have to be dependent for our statistical information entirely upon the decennial census returns. If the seats had been distributed in the first instance upon the basis of the census returns, I should have had no hesitation in continuing to rely upon them, but as they were distributed upon statistical returns such as it is now suggested shall be used, and as the disparities between the electorates are now so serious, I think we should proceed at once to remove the existing anomalies. One point strikes with considerable force, namely, that whilst the population of Victoria is smaller than tljat of New South Wales, the number of voters in the mother State is proportionately less than in Victoria. However, I do> not regard that as affording anv ground for cavilling at the proposed redistribution of seats, as the Constitution lays it down distinctly that the distribution must be on a population basis, and not on the number of yoters.",41
209,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"That is accounted for by the fact that there are 2 per cent, more persons over the age of twenty-one than in New South Wales.",41
210,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"In view of the fact that we adopted the latest statistics available to us for the purpose of distributing the seats in the first instance, we cannot reasonably object to adopt a similar course now. I c'annot understand how the returns are worked out. According to the evidence given before the Old-Age Pensions Commission there is in Victoria a much greater number of persons between the ages of sixty and sixty-five than in New South Wales. Why that should be so I do not, know, but that seems to me to throw some doubt upon the accuracy of our statistical information.",41
211,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Thos e figures are taken from the census.,41
212,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I fancy they are; but, the results appear to me to l l , work out-very curiously. In view of the exfact that New South Wales is an older State, one would imagine that within it he there would be a larger proportion of persons between the ages of sixty and sixty-five.",41
213,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But the influx of population into New South Wales consists of younger people.,41
214,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"This is not a matter of percentage. It is a mere question of whether there are more people between sixty and sixty-five years of age in New South Wales than there are in Victoria. The figures which have been placed before the Old-Age Pensions Commission certainly show that there are more in the latter State. I should be very glad indeed if I could see my way to prevent the loss of a representative to Victoria. In that respect I occupy a similar position to the honourable and learned member for Corinella. Seeing, however, that there is such a large discrepancy between our own elecme torates-that some of those electorates contain, double the number of voters to be found in others-ther e is certain reason for a redistribution of seats, and therefore I feel that I must vote with the Government upon this Bill .",41
215,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,This is not a Bill to effect a redistribution of seats.,41
216,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Practicall y it is.,41
217,Mr KELLY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,It is a Bill to decide the redistribution in each State.,41
218,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That is what is at the in Victoria bottom of the measure.,41
219,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,There must be a redistribution of seats before the next general election.,42
220,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I quite realise that that is so.,42
221,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,If this Bill were not carried it would still be possible to effect a redistribution of seats.,42
222,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The first which the Government would have to give its Commissioner would be with reterence to the number of seats.,42
223,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Seeing that upon a former occasion the representation ;of the States was determined upon the basis of the statistical returns, it is only right that the proposed redistribution should be based upon the latest similar returns.",42
224,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,As between the States we must have resort to the latest statistics.,42
225,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"There are later statistics than those upon which the original distribution of seats was based. Upon a tormer occasion I objected very strongly to any redistribution, because of the abnormal condition of things which had obtained consequent upon the drought. I honestly. believed that a great many people left the country districts and crowded into the towns, and. therefore I opposed the scheme submitted by a previous Government. That position of affairs, however, is now past. People have returned to their homes, and matters have resumed their normal condition. The objection which I then raised cannot be honestly urged now. . In spite of an inclination to lean a little towards my own State, I feel that the figures are against me, and that consequently I must vote in favour of the Bill.",42
226,Mr KENNEDY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," It is not my intention to speak at length upon this measure. It is generally admitted that, prior to the first general election for this Parliament, we had not accurate figures as to the population of the various States. That position, to my mind, is about to be accentuated by the deliberate act of this House. Instead of obtaining reliable statistics of population, we are about to resort to mere estimates. What was condemned as an improper act on the part of the late Government is now about to be regarded as a very proper act. I contend that if it was wrong for the late Government to propose the redistribution of seats upon mere estimates, it is equally wrong for the present Ministry to do so. The last census returns compiled by the States proved that the estimates upon which the first Commonwealth Parliament was elected were to some extent inaccurate; The same condition of affairs obtains today. Surely in laying down a new procedure it is desirable that we should have a reliable basis! I do not feel disposed to vote against the Bill , knowing that it is absolutely necessary that we should provide information some machinery to meet .the exigencies of the present situation. I do not find fault with those who say that, under the operation of the measure, it is probable that Victoria will lose a representative in this House. If the figures show that she is not entitled to that representative, I shall offer no objection. If , on the contrary, New South Wales is entitled to an additional representative, I say that her right should not be denied to her. Before proceeding, however, to redistribute the seats, I claim that we should have the most reliable data upon which to act. In Committee, I shall make a determined effort to incorporate that mode of procedure in the Bill .",42
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I only wish to say a few words, and those not in derogation of the Bill, which I hope to see passed as speedily as possible. I quite agree with the honourable member for Moira, that this measure affords the most complete justification of the action taken by the late Government. Now that the present Ministry are taking precisely the same course as that adopted by their predecessors-now that they are crystallizing into a statute what the Reid-MCLean Government did by Executive act, there is no ground for complaint, although the Bill does not take us very much further forward in regard to the work of redistributing the electorates. In itself, the measure seems to me to be incomplete. I should have liked to see the Government carry the matter further, or else incorporate the provisions of this Bill in a section of the Electoral Act, and place it upon the statute-book as such. The measure does not in reality declare that there shall be a redistribution of seats, that the electorates shall be recast, so as to more accurately represent the basis of our democracy - namely, the adult vote of the Commonwealth. It merely provides for the enumeration of the voting power of the Commonwealth, and leaves the matter there. When the Commonwealth officer has furnished his certificate, and the matter has received the approval of the Executive, and been published in .the Commonwealth Gazette, there it ends. Unless the House or the Government take the initiative, this Bill will be valueless, so far as any practical purpose is concerned. I understood the Minister of Home Affairs to say that he intends to introduce another Bill, which contemplates action in the way of giving effect to what is achieved by this Bill . That is all I am concerned about. I trust that the Government will make it clear that they intend to lose no more time in dallying with this great subject of the redistribution of the electoral power of the Commonwealth. It is high time that that work was carried out. We have been here for five years, working upon a basis which is unsatisfactory from every point of view.",42
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That remark does legislation. not apply to every State.,43
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It applies to every State, with the exception of Western Australia, where these anomalies have been rectified. I hope that this Bill represents opposed to their proposal. only a prelude to action, which will take to the completion of the matter, and out which all our legislative arrangements will be vitiated by reason of the continued unequal distribution of the electoral power Irvine, M . L . A . of the Commonwealth. There are one or two points connected with this measure to attention may profitably be given in mittee, and, therefore, I do not intend deal with them now. I am glad that the views.

231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The late Going vernment proposed to submit the whole scheme definitely to the House. honourable member has, mentioned that point, I confess that I fail to see any necessity for this Bill . The question could as effectively discussed if it were embodied in a scheme for redistributing the electoral power of the Commonwealth as it can when it is dealt with in a separate measure. We are only doing sectionally and pieceThat meal what the late Government proposed do completely. I submit that the posals of the Reid-MCLean Administration were very much in advance of those contained in this Bill. Indeed, without some such proposal as was made by the late Administration to bring about a redistribution scheme, this measure would represent so much waste paper. It is strange that the Bill should proceed from a Government, some of whose members bitterly denounced the former proposal. However, it does not matter to me where proposals originate, so long as they are in accord wicn the opinion of the House, that as soon as possible a revolution should be made in our electoral system, which now drags so heavily on the Commonwealth, and which, so far, has done nothing but vitiate our",43
232,Mr ROBINSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," When the late Government, through the press, announced their intention to submit a Redistribution of Seats Bill , I was very much I followed us with some interest the opinions expressed in with the newspapers by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the present Attorney-General, and Mr . I must say, however, that the most convincing and elaborate arwhich gument which has been adduced by the Comhonorable and learned member for Corinto ella, has effected a great change in my I feel that, although the loss of a to Victoria is a very serious one, Victorians would not be justified in opposing this measure upon that ground alone. It must not be forgotten that the present the electorates in Victoria and New South Wales were, to a very large extent, formed It was never anticipated by the. Parliaments of those States, which defined the electorates, that the Commonwealth Legislature would continue to maintain them for any length' of For instance, the constituency which I represent was created by combinthree or four State electorates, and by restricting the boundaries of the CommonAs the wealth electorate to those of the State, irrespective of anv alteration in the franchise which this Parliament might adopt. be just The Federal Parliament has adopted a totally different franchise, and that means that the number of electors in the different be constituencies varies much more than is contemplated by the Federal Electoral Act. being so. it is only a question of to time when the Federal Parliament must reproarrange the constituencies in each State. When we do that we shall have to inquire into the question of the total representation of that State, as compared with that of the others. We come now to the basis on which the representation of the States should be calculated. I have listened with interest to the remarks made by the honourable and .learned member for Northern Melbourne, and, so far as If o llowed him- I trust that I am not doing him an injustice-h e appeared to be of opinion that the words ""the latest statistics,"" in the section of the Constitution governing this matter, must refer to a census enumeration.",43
233,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Not necessarily; but principal mode of obtaining statistics is way of the census. So f ar as the Commonsentation wealth is concerned, I think statistics available are those of 1901.",44
234,Mr ROBINSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"That is a matter upon which different opinions are held, the honourable and learned member for Cocourse. rinella has already explained to the House the reason why he differs from the honorto able and learned member in this respect. It seems to me that there is one aspect the question which is of some and which relates to the fact that the new expenditure of the Commonwealth is dispurpose. tributed upon a per capita basis. It is rather incongruous that we should distrithe point. bute the new expenditure upon a per capita basis, according to certain figures, yet rearrange our representation upon a totally different set of statistics. adopt the latest returns in the one case we ought to do so in the other. It must be admitted that there is a certain amount guesswork in the matter of the Statisticians' returns; but the more experience these officers gain the less will be their liability to make errors in their calculations. census of 1901 enabled them to recast their methods of checking errors, and I have doubt that the possibility of mistakes has been very considerably reduced. It must not be forgotten, however, that even the country. census cannot give us accuracy, and that there must be, comparatively speaking, large number of persons who are omitted from the returns. We cannot, under any method, obtain mathematical accuracy, and effect. it seems to me that although the basis of the calculation which is fo be followed in this case is injurious to Victoria, it is one which we cannot object. I was, at first, correct. very much opposed to it, but after hearing the arguments that have been advanced favour of it , and having regard to the fact that the first Parliament practically endorsed a proposal by a totally different Government to adopt the same method of procedure, I feel it my duty not to oppose the second reading of the Bill .",44

If the other view be taken, and it is said that we are to be guided only the census, I must reply that, in my opinion, such a contention is not warranted by the Constitution. I quite agree with the honourable and learned member for when he says that a clear distinction is drawn between the words ""census"" and ""statistics""; but I think that little consideration will show that, if we provided in the Bill that there should be a redistribution as between the States only after a census, it might lead to a very great wrong being done.",45

261,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Has the honourable and gentleman ever heard of the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee?,45

The Parliament has it in its power to say what shall be deemed statistics and what shall not be so regarded. It is not in the power of a Government to determine that matter. When the Constitution gives Parliament certain powers, it does not say that those powers shall be exercised at the will of the Executive. Therefore we say that, inasmuch as we could never allow the Parliament to be elected on the bare figures of a censuswhich might be declared, perhaps, for all we might know, a week after it was elected - and not take into consideration the great changes which might take place within the next three years, there is no other course open to us than that of coming down to Parliament with these proposals, leaving the Parliament to say what shall be declared statistics.",45

273,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The honourable and learned gentleman knows now that the figures were ascertained in a certain way.,46
274,Mr ISAACS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"1 accept my honourable and learned friend's word. But that does not take us away from the position that the course proposed by the late Government was absolutely unwarranted, because the Constitution does not place it in the hands of any seven or eight members sitting round the Council table to declare what shall be the law for this country. If the Parliament chooses to say that statistics shall be gathered in a certain way-it may or may not be by enumeration-w e may thus secure the statistics of the Commonwealth. We accept statistics relating, for example, to grain, but we do not count the grains in or weigh every bushel. There is a great distinction between a "" census"" and ""statistics,"" and consequently when two 'different words are used in the Constitution, it remains for the Parliament to say what, in its opinion, shall be declared, by way of legislation, to be the statistics of the Commonwealth. When the Parliament has declared what shall be re garded as Commonwealth statistics, the words of the Constitution are satisfied. If honourable members can find a. more accurate wav of arriving at the population of the Commonwealth, I shall be very glad to hear of it ; and if any State which fears that its representation may be affected chooses to declare its own census-becaus e under this Bill provision is made for the census of any State being taken, pending the taking of a Commonwealth census- I shall also be very pleased. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I have not changed my views. On the contrary, I have expressed the opinion before, and express it again, I say that it is necessary to arrive at the population on a legal basis, as provjded by the Constitution, and the Government has taken that course. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause i agreed to. Clause 2For the purpose of determining the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen from time to time in the several States, the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth shall, at the times and in the manner prescribed by this Act, ascertain the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, and the numbers of the people of the several States.",46
275,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Northern Melbourne). - I did not like to take the extreme step of calling for a division against the second reading of the Bill, but the Prime Minister has agreed that this clause affords a convenient opportunity to test the question whether the Committee approves of the substitution of the certificate of the Chief. Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth as to the numbers of the people for the statistics provided for in this case by the Constitution. I need hardly say that no argument was adduced during the second-reading debate in justification of the position that the certificate of the Chief Electoral Officer should be the same thing as the""latest statistics of the Commonwealth."" Clause 2, and so much of the Bill as is consequent upon, or incidental to it, must be void if it is in contradiction of the Constitution, no matter what honourable members may think, or how they may vote, although, as it is hard to conceive how any Court can come to deal with the question, it is improbable that it will ever be tested. There was evident, however, during the second-reading debate, a good deal of misunderstanding in regard fo the purpose of the Bill. For, instance, the honourable member for Grampians seemed to think that in voting for it he was voting for the redistribution of the Victorian electorates. Of course, it is clear, from clause 10, that if the Bill be carried into law, it will have to be followed by a measure for the redistribution of the electorates of the States.",46
276,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,All that will be necessary will be a proclamation under the Electoral Act.,47
277,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Assumin g that the number of members to be chosen in each State is fixed at twenty-two for Victoria, there will have to be a redistribution of electorates in this State.",47
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The Electoral will cover that.,47
279,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Yes ; but my point is that we are not now making provision the redistribution of the electorates of State. This is a Bill ""relating to the presentation of the several States of the House of Representatives,""- and clause provides for an inquiry as to the population of the several Statesfor the purpose of determining the number members of the House of Representatives'to chosen from time to time in the several States. I adhere still more strongly now than I originally to the position which I took when first I understood the scheme now proposed to take the certificate of the Chief Electoral Officer as the latest statistics. may be difficult to say what would be the latest statistics, and indeed all sorts difficulties might be raised, but I am contest fident that the certificate of the Chief this clause. Electoral Officer is not the latest statistics.",47
280,Mr BAMFORD,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The latest available staelaboratebe tistics.,47
281,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The words of the stitution are ""the latest statistics."" Of cojrse they must be available. The language of clause 9 is taken almost for word from section 24 of the Constituwould tion, but paragraphs a and b contain a significant change of words. Paragraph says thatA quota shall be ascertained by dividing number of people of the Commonwealth, shown by the certificate (for the time being in force) of the Chief Electoral Officer, by twice the number of senators, while the Constitution says that a quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of people of the Commonwealth ""as shown by the latest statistics."" The words in paragraph b are the same as those in the Constitution, except for a similar substitution. Therefore an attempt is being made to amend the Constitution by a mere Act of Parliament. I warned honourable members in connection with the Judiciary Bill that they were going wrong, and it has been determined by the Court that they did go wrong, and, so far as one can, without presumption, speak confidently on a matter of this sort, I say that this provision is absolutely void. In my opinion, the correct course, since there has been no enumeration since the census of 1901, is to act on the basis of that census, though I am strongly of opinion that we should have an enumeration or census as often as we can consistently with the keeping down of exAct pense, and I am glad that the Government proposes to take a census at least once in every five years. Another point I for would suggest for consideration is this: any There is no Commonwealth collection of restatistics, and, although the Statisticians of the States are at present in agreement, 2 it does not follow that they will always be so. It might happen that there would be differences between the figures of the of Statist of New South Wales and those of be the Statist of Victoria or Queensland, so that one would criticise the returns of andid other, and we should have no solid basis up of certainty to act on. Where, then, should we find the "" latest statistics? "" I do not wish to argue the question at length, since it It was discussed very fully on the second reading, but I am anxious, and so I understand of are several others, to enter a decided proagainst the proposal, by voting against That, I think, is a better course to adopt than to seek to insert an amendment. Of course, we must beaten, because when a Government adopts the proposals of its predecessors it Conis bound to win. This Government has chosen that path as the way of least resistance, and I have no doubt will carry its .word proposals into effect. But some of us like to be allowed to enter as emvery phatic a protest as we can make against a what we regard as a mistake. The question whether Victoria will, or will not, the lose a member is not of importance, as but I do not wish to be a party to what « I regard as an illegal and unconstitutional act which is being proposed in defiance of constitutional. opinions expressed by Ministers themselves.",47

With all respect, I must differ from that! point. In the first place, Parliament was empowered by paragraph x i . of secmy tion 51 of the Constitution to legislate with respect to census and statistics, that is, we possess an inherent power to declare what are and what are not statistics, or, rather, to provide how our statistics shall be ascertained, collected, gathered; or piled.",48

289,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"In every statistical dehow partment certain allowances are made for possibilities of error, and by the law averages, these errors are brought down an irreducible minimum. Even in the case of an enumeration, there are omissions. Therefore, I do not think that this posal can be regarded as unconstitutional.",48
290,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But I say that it is un,48
291,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It cannot be urged that r the whole of it is unconstitutional. The honourable and learned member will admit the census is constitutional, and that the returns relating to the registration of births and deaths would be statistical.",48
292,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Not for the purposes of,48
293,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I submit that if we adopt the latest statistical information we,48
294,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It must be the latest statistical information obtainable for the him on Commonwealth, as a whole.",48
295,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Wit h all due respect to honourable and learned friend, I submit that we are exercising power we undoubtedly possess, to declare that certain State returns, which are furnished in accordance with certain prescribed methods, shall be regarded as Commonwealth statiscomtics for any purpose we may deem fit. I join issue with the honourable and learned demember when he says that we are endeavouring'to avoid friction. We are endeavouring to work out a fair and equitable the principle for the period between each In the first place, we say that the decennial period is too long, and that it is necessary to split up that interval. We are adopting the census as a guide whenever it is available to us, but in the intervals .we propose to rely upon the statistics collected by the methods prescribed by the Bill. We contend that it would be too to have a census taken every fifth year, at a cost of £117,000, or upwards. we should keep ourselves as in touch with the distrithe Commonrepresenta",48
296,Mr WEBSTER,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"In ten years hence, New South Wales will probably be entitled to are refive more representatives.",48
297,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Then they should be granted to her. The position which New South Wales now occupies mav be filled by Victoria or Queensland on the occasion of some future redistribution. No one can tell far the population of Victoria may be increased, if certain irrigation schemes are of carried out, and land now regarded as useto less is brought under cultivation. I submit that we are not attempting to avoid friction, or to win support, but are endeavourproing to lay down fixed principles upon which the redistribution shall take place.",48
298,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I think the Government felt themselves bound by the promise that there would be a redistribution.,49
299,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"We felt bound by the provision in the Constitution that, whenever necessary, there shall be a determination of the proportion of the representatives of the States. We also felt bound to lay down certain definite lines upon which such proportion should be determined, and when. There is nothing specific in the Constitution to define when a redistribution shall or shall not be necessary; the only inference is that, as soon as the returns obtained from various sources, show that the representation fs not proportionate, action shall be taken. The Constitution does not specify that action shall be taken at any fixed period, but we desire to lay down rules which will put an end to all uncertainty on that subject. There is nothing in the Constitution as to the period at which the redistribution shall take place, but we are told that we should rely, for the purposes of our calculation, on the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. It appears to me that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has taken a very narrow view of the construction to be placed upon the words "" latest statistics.""",49
300,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I say that they must be statistics and not estimates.,49
301,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I admit that there may be*a dispute as to what constitute statistics, but our desire is to place the matter beyond all dispute.",49
302,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But I contend that that cannot be done.,49
303,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,- I claim that we are exercising the undoubted power of the Commonwealth Parliament to lay down rules.,49
304,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The wording of the Constitution cannot be altered.,49
305,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Sectio n 24 providesThe number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people, ancl shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined whenever necessaryin a certain manner. Parliament is now being asked under the authority of this section to "" provide"" that the population of the States shall be ascertained at one period from the census and at another period by the methods prescribed in the Bill.",49
306,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"But Parliament cannot alter the meaning of the word "" statistics."" \",49
307,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"We are not attempting to do so, but we are recognising the statistics of the various States, and are making them Commonwealth statistics for the purpose of determining the representation of the people.",49
308,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," If I rightly understand the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, he takes up the position that no alteration should be made in the representation of the States unless the lateststatistics of the Commonwealth show that it ought to take place. He contends, further, that the latest statistics referred to must take the form of a systematic enumeration of - the people of the Commonwealth. Do I understand the honourable and learned member to mean that there must be an enumeration of the whole of the people?",49
309,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Yes .,49
310,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Then I would put this position to him. If it is ascertained by counting that there are 100 persons in a room,' and tellers are placed at the various entrances or exits to count those going in and out, and it is afterwards found that twenty people enter the room and ten leave the room, would the honourable and learned member regard as statistics the net total of n o persons arrived at by a process of addition and subtraction?",49
311,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,They would not be statistics within the meaning of the Constitution.,49
312,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I understand the honor- , able and learned member to say that the 110 people must be counted over again in order to produce statistics which would be recognised within the meaning of the Constitution.",49
313,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,All I sav is that the returns which are to be relied UDon under the Bill are not statistics. I am not bound to say what would be statistics.,49
314,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I will put another case. In 1901, we counted the people actually in Australia, and stationed tellers at all our entrances and exits to count all the people coming in and going out - We have also kept a record of births and' deaths, and by a process of addition and subtraction we have arrived at a computation as to our present population. It seems to me that the results are statistics within the fullest meaning of the term. Further, it seems to me that the position taken up by the honourable and learned member is that if the Bill made no allowances for error, the calculations referred to would be statistics, but because it does make allowances for error, and thus brings about >a closer approach to accuracy, the returns proposed to be used are not statistics. words, the honourable and learned member says that because the figures may be wrong they are not statistics. But I venture to say that they are statistics, even though they may be wrong. Our experience has shown that there are actual .exits and entrances for which no provision has been made, and I prefer figures which are subject to certain allowances for unrecorded arrivals and departures, rather than figures which are compiled upon arbitrary lines. I think that the Minister placed himself upon the horns of a dilemma, because he said in the first place thiat the number of persons to be chosen should be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people, and at the same time he implied that the moment any change of population occurred we must arrange for a change of representation accordingly.",49
315,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I said that a strict construction of the words "" whenever necessary "" might lead to that conclusion.",50
316,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Then the Minister said that as it would be only fair to alter the representation as the population changed, he would refrain from ascertaining whether 'there was any alteration in the population except at fixed periods. he says that we should refrain from obtaining knowledge upon that point except at certain dates, and yet we know that the same means of knowledge are available every quarter in the Statisticians' returns. This Bill declares that the number of the representatives of the different States shall change in proportion to the population, but that we shall refrain from ascertaining what changes have taken place in that population except at fixed dates. That is so necessary a working rule that I do not intend to quarrel with it, although I still entertain doubts as to whether it is constitutional. If we deliberately refrain from knowledge, except at the five or ten year periods, we are omitting to add up when changes have taken place so as to ascertain the nature of those changes. I now come to the question of what is the meaning of the words "" whenever necessary."" The honourable and learned member for Angas said, in effect, that they are meaningless-that they mean that the number of members in this House shall be determined whenever it is necessary to determine them.",50
317,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"They mean that whenever we know that a thing is so, we must take In other steps to find out that it is so. 1",50
318,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If that is the interpretation of the words, certainly they are meaningless^ But I have always understood that the Courts do not construe an Act of Parliament so as to render it meaningless, if they .can avoid doing so. With every respect, I submit that those words mean that the number of members shall be determined whenever the changes in our population alter the proportion so as to make it necessary to effect an alteration. I think that the words "" whenever necessary "" refer to the change in population which will cause a change in representation, if the arithmetical ratio is to be preserved. But the words "" until the Parliament otherwise provides"" precede the words "" be determined whenever necessary."" To my mind the words ""until the Parliament otherwise provides "" govern the method of determination to be provided, either with or without the wbrds ""''whenever necessary."" Consequently, Parliament can substitute for the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, figures ascertained in any manner that it inky' prescribe. That, however, does not get rid of the obligation on the part of the Parliament to alter the In effect, number of members as the number of the population alters, because the power * of Parliament is limited to a certain arithmetical calculation. I claim that the words ""the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people "" are imperative, and are subject to no parliamentary alteration whatever. Parliament cannot declare by legislation that it is not necessary to alter the number of members, when it is necessary under the earlier words of the section. However,. I have raised the point; the difficulty is here, and has to be met. I do not see the necessity for providing for a five years' enumeration. I think that an enumeration every ten vears would be sufficient. I repeat that tfie words "" until the .Parliament otherwise provides "" control sub-clauses i and 2, and therefore the words "" the latest statistics of the Commonwealth."" I think that the figures to which reference has been made are statistics in every reasonable sense of the term. Indeed, everything except the allowances for unrecorded arrivals and departures are statistics, and those matters have been tacked on in order to bring the statistics which may be wrong more in accordance with the actual facts. The small extent to which they proved to be wrong upon a previous occasion justifies us in assuming that the results arrived at under the proposals of the Government will be pretty nearly correct.",50
319,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Because there is only a small difference between the figures and "" statistics,"" therefore they are statistics.",51
320,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No . We are merely accepting something which is nearer to the true facts than is the actual count itself. My doubt all along has been as to the words in the clause which are not controlled by the words, "" until the Parliament otherwise provides."" I do not think that our action is likely to be challenged, and if I were arguing the matter before the High Court, I should be strongly tempted to urge that that tribunal must strain the language of the Constitution, because of the extreme inconvenience which would result from a literal interpretation of it.",51
321,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,We ask for no straining at all.,51
322,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I fear that this Bill is unconstitutional upon one ground, and I say that in order to defend the measure we have to strain the Constitution. Consequently, I think that the proposal is one which we ought to risk in the interests of the convenience of government. - Mr Glynn (Angas) - I fail to see that the objection taken to this Bill by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is well-founded. It is true that the certificate of the Electoral Officer is to be evidence, but it is only to be evidence of what the enumeration discloses. The Bill prescribes how the enumeration shall be made, and it only makes it evidence for the purposes of revision. I quite agree that what was intended was that there should be a Commonwealth enumeration of the population. In other words, instead of relying upon the statistics of the States by adopting them in an Act of Parliament, it was intended that we should specifically enumerate the population of the Commonwealth for the purpose of ascertaining the representation to which the States were entitled. At the same time, we have the power to adopt the statistics of the States, if we choose to do so. That is what the Government propose to do, and what I conceive is bad policy. I think that we should follow the American example, by having a Commonwealth enumeration, for the purpose of ascertaining the true share of representation to which the various States are entitled. To continue the present method indefinitely is certainly objectionable. That, however, is what the Bill does. A specific enumeration by the Commonwealth would not involve us in anyextra expense. We are now asked to pass a Bill dealing with census returns and statistics. We can prescribe in this measure that a census shall be taken for the Commonwealth every ten years. The Bill proposes to adopt the statistics of the States which may or may not be correct, instead of relying utpon the enumeration which, according to the spirit of the Constitution, we ought to make. Section 24 of the Constitution is undoubtedly very loosely drafted. Under it we could, if we so chose, abolish the quota system. That system was simply an experiment. It was Mr. Justice O'Connor who was responsible for the suggestion. He pressed it on the Convention, and pointed out that under the words, "" until the Parliament otherwise provides,"" if it were found that the .quota system did not work well, it could be abolished. Hence, after declaring that the basis of representation should be the population, we made provision for varying the method of ascertaining the number of members that should represent each State. We provided that each State should have representation on the basis of its population, but how were we to ascertain when that representation was to be varied? It was because of this difficulty that it was provided that the Parliament might abolish the quota system, and that, further, we might declare that the statistics to be relied upon should not be the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. At present the prescription is that the latest statistics of the Commonwealth must be taken. There is nothing, however, to prevent us from declaring that those adopted for this purpose shall not be the latest. We might declare that the earlier statistics-'of the'Commonwealth were those which truly defined the basis of representation. That would be an absurd position to take up, but it would be open to us under the section as it stands. I therefore consider that, although it would be better, if we could afford it, to take a particular enumeration of the people for the purposes of the first distribution, it will be quite competent for us to declare that the statistics already collected by the States are sufficient for the purpose.",51
323,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING, The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and several other honourable members desire to challenge the principle as to the taking of an enumeration during the period intervening between the census which is prescribed in the Bill.,52
324,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The Prime Minister promised that the division on this clause should be taken as a test.,52
325,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,It is to be taken as a test as to the principle of departing from the census. That is the only issue.,52
326,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Northern Melbourne). - I had a conversation with the Prime Minister, who was good enough to say that the most convenient method to decide the question whether the Committee regarded the estimates of the Statisticians as being the "" latest statistics "" within the meaning of the Constitution would be by dividing on clause 2. I admit that if the clause were struck out it would be inconvenient so far as the machinery of the Bill is concerned, but it is obvious that it will be carried. There are several honourable members, however, who wish to show emphatically that they disapprove of the Government proposal, and it is our desire that the division upon clause 2 should be taken as a test.",52
327,Mr LONSDALE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING, A m I to understand that the object of dividing on this clause is to settle the question whether we are to have a redistribution of seats only once in ten years?,52
328,Mr KENNEDY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,No .,52
329,Mr LONSDALE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"At present the centaken sus is taken every ten years, and the point that I wish to ascertain is, whether rejection of this clause would render it impossible to have an intermediate enumeexpediency, ration, so as to enable a redistribution of seats to take place every five years? I appears to me that the object .which the honourable . and . learned member Northern Melbourne has in view is to bring about a re-adjustment only once in ten years. I am opposed to that proBill. posal, and will vote against any amendment of the Bill in that direction. seems to me that the Constitution should be strictly adhered to. and that should receive its true measure of representation, according to the latest statistics. We have a shifting population, and we should be careful to see that each State, as its population increases, or decreases, has its proper representation in this House. We certainly ought not to seek to prevent that by determining that there shall be only a decennial redistribution. If any change of population can be approximately ascertained every five years, as proposed by this Bill, there ought certainly to be a quinquennial redistribution. In my opinion the intention of the Constitution is that the people of the several States shall have their proper representation in this House, and that any movement"" of population shall be taken into account. I shall therefore oppose the amendment.",52
330,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I should like to know whether the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne proposes that the first enumeration shall be by way of a census, or that there shall not be a redistribution of seats before the next decennial census is taken?",52
331,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Northern Melbourne). - The position may be briefly stated. If there be a redistribution under present conditions it must be on - the basis of the census of 1901, inasmuch as no statistics have been collected since then. If , however, a census were taken, say, 'in 1906, the redistribution which followed would be upon the basis of that census.",52
332,Mr SKENE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Would that be in accordance with the Constitution?,52
333,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,So far as I can see it would.,52
334,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The proposal means either that a redistribution of seats shall not take place until 1.911, or that a census shall be in 1906, at a cost of about £120,000 to the Commonwealth, in order to ascertain the what we practically know already.",52
335,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It is a question, not of but of constitutional right.",52
336,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I have t listened to the legal arguments, but have not gathered from them what is really the for constitutional principle involved.",52
337,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,We could hardly expect the honourable member to oppose his own,52
338,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,This is It not my own Bill.,52
339,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But it embodies the honevery State orable member's scheme.,52
340,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I may replv to the honourable member by saying he takes up his position now because it is that which he assumed in public some months ago.,52
341,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I was not then a responsible Minister.,53
342,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I hope that the honourable and learned member would ° t have expressed a different n opinion had he been in office; but that he recognised his full responsibility as a member of this Parliament for the course which he then advocated. Another of his proposals is to act upon the census of 1901.,53
343,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,On that alone?,53
344,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The proposal that we should effect a re-adjustment by reverting to the census of 1901 is an extraordinary one. There has been no redistribution since the passing of a very portant measure by which the number of persons exercising the Commonwealth' franchise was increased by 100 per cent., and it is surely time, therefore, that one took place. In making the redistribution we ought to ascertain what should be the representation of each State, so that we may start with a basis of State equality, and also endeavour to establish by it the basis of electoral equality.",53
345,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"That may be veiy expedient, but what of it?",53
346,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The honourable member says that it is not constitutional, but other members of the legal profession, who are quite as capable of expressing an opinion on the subject, differ entirely from him. I do not accept his interpretation of the Constitution.",53
347,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,L do not ask the honourable member to accept it.,53
348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"In the opinion of myself and others more capable than I am of determining the legal aspect of the question, the honourable and learned member has not shown that it would be unconstitutional to adopt the course objected to by him. The honourable and learned member hasi not convinced me.",53
349,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I have,not tried to.",53
350,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I mav have to admit that I am very dense, but I understood the honourable and learned member to argue that it is unconstitutional to take anything but a census.",53
351,Mr HIGGINS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I did not say so.,53
352,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,He said an actual count.,53
353,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"What is an actual count but a census? The honourable and learned member for Corinella spoke by way of illustration of tallying the [76] persons leaving or entering a room. Would the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne accept such a tally in connection with a count of the people as a census? To go back to the census of 1901 would be to abandon the whole position., by. going back five yeais to make an adjustment meant to meet our present conditions, whereas, if Ave wait for the census of 1911, we shall have to continue to take no recognition of the passing of the Women's Franchise Act, and either not redistribute, or, if we redistribute, take no notice of the relative representation of the States. The other proposal is to take a census in 1906. I have already pointed out the enormous imexpense that that would entail. We should spend £120,000 to arrive at figures which would almost beyond question be practically the same as those which we at present pos sess- a course which I do not think the people of Australia would like to see taken.",53
354,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne apparently wants to go back to the census of 1901, so that Victoria may continue to have a representation pf twentythree members, to which she is not entitled. You, Mr Chairman, have to-night witnessed a great display of legal gymnastics, in the endeavour of honourable gentlemen to prove that statistics are not statistics, and similar difficult propositions. With regard to the proposal to take a census next year, I endorse what the honourable member for North Svdney has said about the expense, but I would further point out that if it were taken in December, Parliament would then have expired by effluxion of time, and on the results being presented after the general election, it would be contended by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne and others that we could not agree to a redistribution of seats then, because if we did so we should have to hold another general election on the new basis, and the Commonwealth could not afford the expense. The position would be pretty much the same if the census were taken in June next. We know that in connection with the taking of a State census it is generally four or five months before the returns have all been got in, made up, and checked, and we could not expect to learn the result of the Commonwealth census until the end of the year. The proposal that we shall wait for the census of 1911 makes it evident, that the honourable member for Northern Melbourne is not actuated by the Federal, spirit this matter. The Minister of Home Afdesirous fairs is one of the representatives of vertisement Queensland, and he, no doubt, recognises that what applies to New South Wales to time. day will probably apply to Queensland or three years hence, and is showing a good deal of sagacity in pushing the Bill through. As the right honourable member for Swan has pointed out, if the Committee agreed to the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the Bill against the clause. would practically have to be dropped, and the redistribution of seats postponed. put.Question-tha There will always be difficulties in the way of the redistribution of seats so long as the matter is left to Parliament to deal with. Technical and legal objections, such as those which have been put forward by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, will always be raised. Bamford, F. W.

The State of Wes1. tern Australia has at present a representaof tion of five members by virtue of a. special concession made by the Constitution, but other the time is arriving when she will be entitled to five, and perhaps more members, on a population basis. When that time arrives, the difficulties of re-adjustment will be accentuated. I trust that the Committee will not listen to the un-Federal arguments of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. As he has not thought it worth his while to move in amendment, he must be regarded as merely of erecting a placard for the adof a certain State, and certainly lays himself open to the charge of wasting Seeing that the. greatest relative two loser of population among the States is Tasmania, the honourable member for Bass, and the other representatives of that State, should be the first to assist the members from other States in securing just representation, and I trust that he will not vote t the clause be agreed toThe Committee divided.

The Chief Electoral Officer shall appoint Enumeration Days as follows :(a) The first Enumeration Day shall be appointed as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act; (4) Thereafter an Enumeration Day shall be appointed at the expiration of every fifth year after the taking of the then last preceding census.",54
357,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," Many honoran able members who voted in favour of the preceding clause will, I am sure, be averse to the adoption of a system that will entail a redistribution of the whole of the electorate's of the Commonwealth every five years. Any such arrangement would be attended with the greatest inconvenience. Although we may agree as to the necessity for some statutory provision relating to the statistics which are to be adopted as the basis for determining the representation of the various States, it should not be necessary to disturb the whole of the electoral divisions every five years. It is already difficult enough for the electors to accustom themselves to the electoral boundaries, and if changes are made in* the manner contemplated, some honourable members wiil be called upon to devote their attention to an entirely new set of electors every few years. The ""United States Act makes provision for a redistribution after each decennial census, and a similar provision is"" contained in the Canadian Statute.",54
358,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"This clause does not refer to the redistribution 'of seats, but to the readjustment of the States representation.",55
359,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"But the readjustment referred to will almost necessarily involve a redistribution of seats, at least in the States whose representation is either increased or decreased.",55
360,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,If the constituencies are kept near the quota there will be no necessity for a redistribution of seats every five years.,55
361,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I am very sorry to say that, up to date, the number of electors in the metropolitan constituencies have been kept as high as.they can be, whereas the number of voters in country electorates have been kept as low as they can be.",55
362,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,That was a mistake.,55
363,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Unti l the honourable member can assure me with authority that the contrary will be the case I must presume that that system will be continued. I move That the word "" an,"" line 2, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu, thereof the word ""the."" Subsequently, I shall move that sub-clause 2 foe omitted.",55
364,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If sub-clause 2 be struck out the whole Bill will go by the board. Mr LONSDALE CNew England) - I understand that the honourable and learned member for Corio imagines that the word[ 6 ] -2 7 ing of this clause renders it imperative that there shall be a redistribution of seats every, five years. I do not agree with him. 1 take it that the meaning of the sub-clause is that the five-year period will be calculated from the taking of the next census. Under the Bill , an enumeration will be made five years after the next census is taken. Hence the objection of the honourable and learned member falls entirely to the ground.",55
365,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I do not think that the honourable and learned member for Corio should attempt to accomplish his object by the amendment which he has submitted. We ought to have some means of immediately ascertaining the population of the Commonwealth. I would suggest that he should amend paragraph b by omitting the word "" fifth,"" line n , with a view to insert the word "" tenth "" in lieu thereof. Then the first enumeration would take place as soon as was convenient after the passing of the Act, and subsequent enumerations at the expiration of every tenth year after the taking of the last preceding census. At the present time, it rests with the Government to determine when the census shall be taken. I understand that they suggest' that it should be taken every ten years.",55
366,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The provision has been left in its present form to enable us to cooperate with the States.,55
367,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"If we provide for an enumeration every ten years we ought to see that a census is taken every ten years, and not leave it to an Executive act. We can make the enumeration f all upon the census day, after the first enumeration has taken place. By so doing, we should certainly comply with the spirit of the Constitution, which is that there ought to be a particular enumeration for Commonwealth purposes, and that we ought not to deal with this matter upon mere estimates. Otherwise we shall have to trust to the accuracy of the States statistics, and it was never contemplated that those statistics should be used for the purposes of the Commonwealth.",55
368,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Does the honourable and learned member think that it is possible that the States would present inaccurate statistics for the purpose of getting a larger representation ?,55
369,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"All things are possible. I do not think that, what I have suggested is likely to happen, but still all these things must be contemplated. The framers of our Constitution did not think it wise to leave to the States matters of this sort, in which self-interest may be very strong. If the honourable and learned - member for Corio will withdraw his amendment so as not to prevent a special enumeration being made, subject to the allowances prescribed in the schedule for the (first . redistribution, I shall support him.",55
370,Mr BAMFORD,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," It seems, to me that there is a good deal of makeinto believe in regard to this Bill . So I have been unable to ascertain when the measure will commence to operate. The Minister of Home Affairs made some rethe marks about an enumeration taking place in 1906-that is, five years from the time the compilation of the last census in 1901. If an enumeration be made in 1906, redistribution of seats has to follow, will be the result? Past experience teaches that we shall not be able to get redistribution scheme prepared and passed by this House in time for the election which will take place at the end of next year. Consequently I should like to whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the redistribution scheme framed by the various officers of the States within the past few months, whether we are to have an entirely fresh redistribution. Mr GROOM. (Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) - I can assure the honourable member for Herbert that this Bill is not intended to be a sham, but serious piece of legislation to be acted upon. It distinctly provides that immewill diately after the passing of the Act enumeration day shall be fixed. The be affected. Ministry hope that the Bill will be by ' this Parliament very soon. measure becomes law this month, an enusarily meration day will beappointed in October. Upon that enumeration clay fixed the Chief Electoral Officer will ascertain from the Statisticians population of the respective States. According to past experience, it takes also be necessary. two or three months to obtain that information. When it has been furnished, a certificate will be issued, and the Governhis ment will then order a redistribution of seats. They will appoint the same officers vision. to make the redistribution, so as to comply with the provisions of the Electoral and in order that their reports may laid on the table of the House at the earliest possible date. Parliament will way that I did not anticipate. then be able to adopt them, so as to bring the redistribution scheme into operation for the next general election.",56
371,Mr BAMFORD,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,There will be no time to do that.,56
372,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I can assure the honourable member that, administratively, I have had the matter worked out by the officers of the Department. There will be ample time to have the whole scheme brought operation, so that the next general far election may take place in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, and so that the quotas will comply with the provisions of Electoral Act itself. That is the intention of the Government, and that is why of we are endeavouring to get this measure passed at the earliest possible moment. and a The honourable and learned member for what Corio has expressed a fear that because we have made provision for an enumeraa tion every fifth year, there will of necessity be a redistribution of seats in all the States every five years. That is not so.",56
373,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But there must be a count know of all the people every five years.,56
374,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"There must be a count every five ytears in order to ascertain what are the rights of the States. For example, or if a count were taken in the year 1916, five years after that of 1911, Western Australia-if she continues to progress as she - has been doing-woul d probably be entitled to an additional representative. The honourable and learned member for Corio a need entertain no fear that there will be a redistribution of seats every five years. It only be necessary to redistribute seats an in the particular States which happen to Let us suppose that passed Victoria's proportion is not affected; If the in that case there will not necesbe a redistribution in Victoria. If Western Australia or Queensland were being entitled to an additional member there would' of necessity have to be a redistrithe bution, or if a representative were taken away from a State a redistribution would These are the points raised by the honourable and learned member for Corio, and I ask him not to press amendment, inasmuch as in substance the question was decided on a previous di",56
375,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The honourable Act, and learned member for Angas, who said be that we should not deal with mere estimates, has supported my contention in a I would point out that there is another reason in addition to that which I have mentioned to him whyi I do not wish to accept the amendment which he suggested, and that is that in my opinion "" enumeration day"" and "" census day "" should be synonymous terms. The question of the constitutionality of the Government proposal has been dealt with, hut we have yet to say whether it is wise for us to act upon mere estimates of the population in determining the measure of representation which each State should enjoy in this House. I have before me a statement made by Senator Styles that I was talking only the other day to Mr. MCLean, the Victorian Statistician, who said that .although he had supplied statistics, they were not - sufficiently reliable for the representation of any State to be altered upon their basis.",56
376,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Mr MCLean, in an official letter to the late Treasurer in March last, said that no allowance for error could entitle Victoria to twenty-three members.",57
377,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"The statement in question was made by Senator Styles as recently as the 7th July'last. I hold that if any reduction is to be made in the representation of a State in this House, it should be based upon thoroughly reliable statistics, - and not upon mere estimates of population. To make a redistribution on the estimates of the Statisticians would be to - depart entirely from the course proposed some, time ago by certain very prominent members of the House. Senator Styles went on to say on the occasion in question that "" Mr Coghlan also thinks it is a good and sound principle,"" that no alteration should be made until a census has taken place. The representation of the States in this Chamber was originally determined, not upon the census, but upon the estimates of the Statisticians, and when nine months later the census returns were published it was found that the population of New 'South Wales was 2,000 below the estimate, while that of Victoria was from 36,000 to 38,000 in excess of the figures supplied by the' Statisticians.",57
378,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The census - figures left the representation just as before.,57
379,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,If the honourable member refers to Coghlan he will find that my - statement is correct.,57
380,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I have the - figures.,57
381,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"There can be no doubt 4hat the census of 190T showed that the estimates made nine months before by the Statisticians were grievously wrong. In view of this fact, and the fact that the Government Statisticians of New South Wales and Victoria have said that they prefer to work on the census rather than on mere estimates, it will be a huge farce for the Committee to pass the Bill as introduced. It would be unfair to reduce the representation of any State on the mere estimates of Statisticians. Even if it was the fault of the Government of the day that action was not taken to alter the representation of New South Wales immediately upon the publication of the census returns for 1901, that is no reason why any honourable member should have his constituency wiped out on estimates that have proved to be inaccurate. We should have reliable information instead of mere misleading estimates to work upon. The Minister has said that the Government do not desire to expend £120,000 on taking^ a census for this purpose. It is not my wish that that expenditure should be incurred. I should be better pleased if the redistribution were allowed to remain in abeyance until the next decennial census were taken, but I feel that it would be better to have a census taken in 1906-and in that way to secure reliable information-tha n it would be to make a redistribution of seats on estimates that are not to be relied upon.

384,Mr CULPIN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It is essentially a matter in which calculations should be made, and I trust that the Committee will agree to the amendment. Amendment negatived.",57
385,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The point upon which I wish to lay stress is that an expenditure of £120,000 every five years: in ascertaining the number of the populaif tion would be altogether unwarranted. ought to know from the Minister whether this enumeration practically means the ing of a census every five .years.",57
386,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"It ought to mean'that, but it does not mean it in the Bill.",58
387,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I put aside all techthat nical and legal complications, and wish get down to the simple method to be sued in making this enumeration. What desire to know is what it will cost; not. care whether it be called a census or an enumeration.",58
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,What did the last enumeration cost?,58
389,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I understand that the last enumeration was the last census.,58
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,No . The last Government took an enumeration.,58
391,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The census costs about .£120,000 for collection and compilation; but the ascertainment of the population the manner here prescribed has not hitherto cost the Commonwealth anything, the in-anything of the sort. formation being furnished by the States gratuitously.",58
392,Mr RONALD,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Southern Melbourne) I object to the proposed enumeration. I is not only a clumsy and slipshod way ascertaining the number of the population, but, as the Minister has shown, also cheap and nasty way. The census is a and semi-scientific method of getting at truth, and provides the only reliable data that we can go on. Both an enumeration and a census will be unnecessary. It seems to me that it will be sufficient take a census every ten years, and I enter my protest, not only against the taking a quinquennial census, but also against taking of an enumeration, which is merely a vague guessing., whereby it is impossible to do justice. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That after the word "" taken,"" line 8, words "" after the commencement of this A c be inserted.",58
393,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I wish to incurate, form the honourable member for North Sydof ney, who has the support of the honourable and learned member for .Corinella, whonames said that he had a letter from the Governa ment Statist of Victoria, in which it stated that there was no difference of sort between Mr Coghlan's estimate",58
394,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I did not say anything the kind. I said that there was a letter from the Victorian Government Statistthe honourable and learned member will We allow me to explain?,58
395,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I do not know that I takwill just now. My recollection of what the honourable and learned member said is that he had a letter from the Government Statist ""of Victoria, in which it was stated' there was no difference between the* to census returns and the estimate upon which purthe representation of this House wasI framed. Will the honourable and"" learned I do member withdraw that statement?",58
396,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I will not withdraw what I did not say.,58
397,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"When I was speaking: the honourable member for North Sydney left the Chamber, and was going to get Coghlan's book.",58
398,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"No , I was not..",58
399,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The honourable memr ber was going to show that thefigureson which the representation of this Housewas first based were similar to the returnsin of the census of 1901.,58
400,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I did not say I said that therepresentation was not affected by the difference.,58
401,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I will show the Comt mittee what the difference was. Coghlan, of at page 250 of his issue of the SevenColonies for 1899-1900, estimates the popua lation of New South Wales at 1,356,650, the population of Victoria at 1,163,400the - a difference in favour of New South. Wales of 193,250. In the issue for 1901-2, however, at page 531, Coghlan states theresult of the census of 1901 as New South to Wales 1,354,846, and Victoria 1,201,070a difference of 153,776 in favour of New of South Wales, so that in two years New the South Wales had lost 1,804 people, whileVictoria had gained 37,670. Mr Coghlan on a later page acknowledges that he had made a mistake. For us to base the representation of the Commonwealth on such the estimates is unfair to all the States, and t "" the Bill itself recognises that the figuresfurnished by the Statisticians are inacbecause it provides for the adding 9 per cent., 12 per cent., and so on. In December, 1903, there were 612,472on the Victorian electoral rolls*; but statement of the results of a recent canwas vass, published by the Department of : any Home Affairs while the honourable member for North Sydney was Minister, showed"" of an increase in the number of Victorian voters of 5,542. In December, 1903, the number of names on the New South Wales' noils was 687,049, and the same statement showed the real number of electors - to be 669,500- a decrease of i ,549almost immediately afterwards the ReidMCLean Government were ready to pro-claim certain figures, which would have - caused Victoria to lose a member. At the time when, according to the Statisticians, New South Wales was gaining population, that State really lost nearly 2,000 persons, while Victoria gained 37,670; yet the ReidMCLean Administration proposed to make a proclamation as to the respective numbers of the States without coming to this House at all.",58
402,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,We should have had to - come to Parliament.,59
403,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"They wanted to do it by Executive act, and not by a Bill.",59
404,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,To do what by Executive act?,59
405,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,To proclaim the - statistics of the population of the two States without coming to Parliament.,59
406,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,We should have had to - come to Parliament with any proposed re-distribution.,59
407,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I did not say that they would not. What I said was that the dispute about the figures was going to be settled by them by proclamation and an Executive act, instead of the matter being brought before Parliament. At the time that the Reid-MCLean Administration were ready to do this, the adult electors of Victoria, male and female, had increased by 5,542, while those of New South Wales had decreased by 17,549. I did not wish to refer to this matter, but the statements of honourable members have made it necessary for me to support with"" details my - original assertions. It would be very dangerous indeed to rely on the estimates of the Statisticians. Personally I have sufficient confidence in the people of the other States to be prepared to trust Victoria to their government, but as the Constitution provides for the representation of the [States, I shall not permit this State to be - deprived of its fair representation by any - system based on what is proved to be stupid guesswork. With regard to the proposal to redistribute the constituencies every five years, it seems to me that it will cause great inconvenience. In one instance it is proposed to make up a constituency of parts of four of the present constituencies. I think that it is unfair that the constituencies should be cut up every five years. Instead of preserving community of interests, such as the Electoral Act contem7 Y e t plated, we shall throw the constituencies into a state of confusion at very short intervals, and"" I believe that honourable members will have cause to regret the course they have adopted to-night.",59
408,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I desire to correct a misapprehension under which the honourable and learned member for Corio appears to be labouring with regard to an interjection I made whilst he was speaking. I interjected that the Government Statistician of Victoria stated, in writing, hi March of this year, to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in reference to the estimates published on the 31st December, 1904, "" I do not think that any error which may have occurred will entitle Victoria to twentythree members.""",59
409,Mr CROUCH,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,We shall see what Hansard records as having been stated by the honourable and learned member.,59
410,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I do not care what the honourable and learned member thinks, but I wish to make matters quite plain to the members of the Committee.",59
411,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I see that in schedule A, provision is made for certain percentages of allowance for unrecorded arrivals and departures by sea and land. It is stated thatIn the case of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia, 10 per centum'shall be added to the numbers of people arriving and departing as shown by the information received from the Railway Departments, to allow for unrecorded arrivals and departures by rail and road. I should like to know how that allowance of 10 per cent, has been' arrived at. Then I notice that in paragraph 5 certain percentages are to be added to the numbers of - persons departing by sea to allow for unrecorded departures. In New South Wales and Victoria 9 per cent., in Queensland 10 per cent., in South Australia 7 per cent., in Western Australia 5 per cent, and in Tasmania 12*5 per cent, is to be allowed. It appears to me that the variation in the percentages requires some explanation. The figures for Tasmania are so very exact that I presume they must have been based upon reliable information. At the same time, it occurs to me that a larger percentage might very well be allowed in the case of Western Australia, because, although the principal traffic passes through three or four ports, a considerable number of persons arrive and depart from the north-western ports of that State. For instance, a large number of pearlers come and go from Broome, on the north-western coast, and depart thence, but I presume that the majority of those would be coloured aliens, who would not be included in the count for the purpose of determining the representation of the State. Still are many others who arrive at or depart from Wyndham, Broome, Derby, and other places. Moreover, a number of persons use Esperance as a point of arrival and departure. I should like to have some explanation from the Minister.",59
412,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I am not quite sure that I understand the full effect. of the amendment proposed by the Minister. It appears to me that if the words "" a f t e r the commencement of this Act "" are inserted after the word ""taken,"" as he proposes, they will have the effect of postponing the second enumeration day until five years after the next census is taken. That would be five years after 1911. Under clause 3 I understand that there is to be an enumeration every census day, and that there is to be a special enumeration day midway between the census days. All I desire to know is whether it is the intention of the Minister to fix the second enumeration day five years after the next census is taken.",60
413,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," With respect to the question asked by the honourable member for Coolgardie, I may explain that the percentages were supplied by the States Statisticians, who met in conference. After deliberation and consultation, and after the revision of all their figures for the three years following the census taken in 1901, they worked out the percentages embodied in the Bill . They regarded 10 per cent, as a fair allowance to make for unrecorded arrivals and departures by land. as arrivals and departures by sea are concerned, the Statisticians worked out the records of the departments, and then made a comparison with the census statements with a view to arrive at an absolutely reliable percentage. Western Australia is to a certain extent like an island, and the returns of population generally can, therefore, be compiled with a fair degree of accuracy. The same remarks apply to Tasmania, and it is only in the eastern States that any difficulty arises. gard to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Angas, I would point out that clause 3 provides that the day on which any census of the people of the Commonwealth is taken shall be an enumeration day. That is a fixed day. The intentionof the clause is to enable us to fix an enumeration day as early as possible after the passing of the Bill . The next enumeration day would be a census day, and after there that, assuming that a decennial census istaken regularly, we should at alternating periods have census and enumeration days, which are not census days.",60
414,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,I know that that is what is intended; but I am afraid that the amendment proposed-by the Minister will not have the desired effect.,60
415,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I shall consult the Parliamentary Draftsman, and take care that the intention is clearly expressed.",60
416,Mr KNOX,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," Althoug h the. Committee has decided by an overwhelming majority to accept the enumeration days as. involving a possible readjustment of the representation of the States, I still adhere to the belief that it would have beenr far better to fix census periods for effecting a change of representation. Under existing circumstances, I feel that we must agree' to an enumeration beings made every fifth year, and to the censusreturns being collected every tenth year. In order that the information thus derived may be as accurate as possible, it seems to me that a special arrangement will require to be made with the States under which the enumeration shall be conducted upon definite lines. It should be specifically set out in the Bill that no changeshall be made in the boundaries of electorates unless there is a sufficient alteration in the number of voters to justify a change in the representation of the various States. My object is to avoid expense. If we makethese changes every ten years, in my judgment, we shall accomplish all that is necesSo far sary. Although I voted in favour of obtaining accurate information, I cannot persist in objections to the recommendations of* the Government.",60
417,Mr LONSDALE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The honourable and learned member for Coriospoke of the reduction in the population? of New South Wales, with a view to showing that no enumeration should be made apart from the actual taking of the census. But I ' would point out to him that the reduction in the voting strength of the elecWith re- torates there is due to the fact that it is-very much more difficult to collect statistics-in New South Wales than it is in Victoria. In the latter State the population is very much denser. The people in New South) Wales are scattered over a much larger area,. and consequently it is more 'difficult to secure an accurate enumeration there. Concerning the question of the percentages to be added to the numbers of persons departing by sea, to allow for unrecorded departures by sea, I take it that the State Statisticians, in conference assembled, found that they had not previously made a fair allowance, and consequently agreed to the percentages which have been embodied in this Bill. In so acting their object was to get as accurate an enumeration as possible. In the case of Western Australia, it seems to me that the allowance of 5 per cent, is rather an advantage than otherwise to that .State. I think it is proper that we should make an enumeration of the population, especially if the work can be undertaken without incurring any very great expenditure. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6-(Certificat e of Chief Electoral Officer).",60
418,Mr LONSDALE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING, I presume that the regulations mentioned in this provision will be laid upon the table of the House?,61
419,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,Yes .,61
420,Mr LONSDALE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,The adoption of that course will involve delay.,61
421,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,No ; not in bringing the Act into operation. I can give the honourable member my assurance on that point. Clause agreed to. Clauses 7 to 9 agreed to. Clause 10When in pursuance of a certificate under this Act an alteration takes place in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in any State the alteration shall not take effectfa) at any election held before the State has been redistributed into electoral sions pursuant to the certificate; nor (i) at any election to fill a vacancy in a House of Representatives elected before such redistribution.,61
422,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I am somewhat doubtful as to'whether we have power to pass this clause. It provides that after we have ascertained what the number of members ought to be for each State, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, we shall not put the law into force. In other words, when we have determined the number of members to which each State is entitled, we need not apply this Act to any .jy-election which takes place immediately afterwards, or any election which has not been preceded by a Redistribution of Seats Act. I quite recognise the difficulty in which the Ministry find themselves, but it seems to me that they are endeavouring to overcome it by adopting an unconstitutional method*",61
423,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The section is intended to meet two contingencies. The honourable member must see that it may happen that an enumeration is ordered practically within two or three days of the time for a dissolution of Parliament. That being so, it would be utterly impossible. by any conceivable electoral machinery to give effect to the alteration. Take the case of a dissolution which may occur during the currency of a Parliament before it is possible to redistribute the electorates so as to enable the elections to be held on the redistributed basis. Again, in the event of a vacancy arising after an alteration of members and before a dissolution, we could not redistribute the whole of the electorates which are 'represented by members who constitute an existing House.",61
424,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,But the Constitution provides that we must do that.,61
425,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"An alteration can only be effected in the manner, provided by the Bill. I submit that it is for Parliament to determine whenever it is necessary to change the proportion. In this Bill we are laying down a definite course of procedure, so that we may know exactly how we are to act.",61
426,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I think that this clause requires to be amended if the Bill is to fulfil the intention of the Minister. He has declared that it is desirable that the decision as to when an adjustment of representation shall take place should be taken out of the hands diviof the Government, and placed by Act of Parliament beyond question. Whilst I see that the Bill contains provision for the method) by which an enumeration of the population shall be made, and for the time of making such an enumeration, it seems to me that no provision is made to insure a re-adjustment of representation, apart altogether from the will of the Ministrv. That is to say, all these steps may be taken, but nothing may ensue. Consequently, I move That the following words be added to paragraph (*)-""bu t shall jtake effect at the first general election after such redistribution."" I do not think that such an amendment would operate in any way against the 4 Representation [REPRESENTATIVES.] intention of the Bill. It would make it absolutely clear that ine readjustment is not to be left to the will of the Minister; but that after certain steps have been taken under the provisions of this measure, a final step is to follow.",61
427,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The Government are prepared to accept the principle of the amendment, and if it be necessary to put it in technical form, it will be open to us to have the provision re-drafted.",62
428,Mr LONSDALE,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," Pre suming that an enumeration shows that a redistribution of seats should at once take place, I think that the necessary Bill - should be immediately brought in, so that the redistribution may apply to the next general election. I should like to know whether that is the intention.",62
429,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"I promise the honourable member that I will look into the whole question. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause II (Power to make regulations).",62
430,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," I have a technical objection to offer to the clause. I think that in the Acts Interpretation Amendment Act, we provide that regulations that have to be laid before Parliament, may be disapproved of by resolution of which notice has been given within the period named, and I fail to see why we should not follow the terminology of that Act in the present case. It is provided in this clause thatA regulation . . . shall not have any force until it has been laid before both Houses of the Parliament for thirty days, or, if within that time a resolution has been proposed in either House of the Parliament to disapprove of the regulation, until the motion for the resolution has been disposed of. An honourable member might, within the thirty days, give notice of a motion to disapprove of the regulation, but it might be impossible to deal with it for at least - two months. Regulations might be laid on the table in the middle of a session, when the notice-paper was loaded with private members' business, and although a notice of motion-was given within the time specified, it might be impossible to discuss it for another two months. I shall not move an amendment, but make the suggestion to the Government that we should adhere principle laid down in the Acts Interpretation Act. Bill.",62
431,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING," The object of framing the clause as it stands was to insure that Parliament should have completecontrol over the bases of the enumeration. Under the Rules Publication Act the rules, in specific cases, I think, take effect provisionally. I shall, however, look intothe drafting of the clause, and if necessary, bring it into line with the Acts Interpretation Act. Clause agreed to. Schedules agreed to. Bill reported with amendments.

432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND SHIPPING,"Parramatta) I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will consider a very much better way of arriving at the object sought to be achieved by this clause. If he has read the Age of today he will know that a man in Victoria-a n ordinary laundryman - is able to obtain messages from other parts of the world in an instant of time.
