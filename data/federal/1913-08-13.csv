1,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister of Home AffairsWhether, in view of . the statement in the report of the Chief Commonwealth Engineer for Railways (Mr B. Deane), ""That it is confidently anticipated that, while jarrah sleepers are known to have a life of only about fourteen years, karri powellised sleepers will last double that time,"" the Minister will obtain from Mr Deane, and lay on the table, the following particulars :1. Full details of any experiments with powellised karri sleepers covering the period of twenty-one or even fourteen years. 2. The names of responsible Australian recommended preference to jarrah. 3. The report of Captain Saunders, the constructing engineer at Fort Augusta, who has had special experience as a responsible officer with the powellising company. 4. The experience of New Zealand in regard to powellising.",12
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"R e p l y in g to the last question first, I do not know that ib would be advisable to ask for the opinioa of an officer who is subordinate to the Engineer-in-Chief, but I shall call for a report upon the matter. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY : MARCONI .COMPANY'S LITIGATION.",12
3,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I wish to ask a question of the Postmaster-General or the Attorney-General; the matter of the question affects the Departments of both M in isters. The Marconi Company brought an action against the Commonwealth, and. endeavoured to obtain an inspection of.: the Commonwealth stations.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order I,13
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am perfectly in order in outlining the case upon which I base my question. The Court decided that the company should make an inspection within three days. Permission to appeal to the Privy Council was applied for, but refused. I wish to know what is the present position of matters? Has the inspection been made, and, if so, what has been the result? furthe r action been taken against the Commonwealth by the Marconi Company ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The matter has come before the Attorney-General's Department, but, having been engaged in the case as counsel for the Marconi Company, I have asked the Minister of External Affairs to deal with all matters affecting the Commonwealth in connection with that litigation.",13
6,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The question whether inspection has been made has not directly come before me, but I believe that an inspection was made. It would be better if the honourable member did not press for an answer as to the exact position at the present time. I could tell him what he wishes to know, but it wonld be better if he did not ask the question. The advisability of getting evidence from London has been under my consideration, but I ask the honourable gentleman to defer any question as to exactly what is being done at the present moment.",13
7,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Attorney-General says that he was counsel for the Marconi Company in its action against the Commonwealth. Will he state whether he etill retains thatposition ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I hold a general retainer for the Marconi Company, as for a number of other companies, but I have entirely severed myself from the particular litigation against the Commonwealth to which the honourable member refers. Later",13
8,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Attorney-General a further question. In reply to the last question put by me, the honourable gentleman stated that he held a general retainer from the Marconi Company. I wish to know whether, in view of the fact that the Marconi Company is - engaged in litigation against the Commonwealth-litigatio n that may involve the Commonwealth in many thousands of pounds-h e thinks that he should continue to hold even a general retainer from ' that company ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think that the question proceeds from a misapprehension of what a general retainer, given to a member of the bar, amounts to. A general retainer merely gives to the person giving it the right to call upon the barrister by whom it is received, before he accepts a brief from any one else, who Has any may be engaged in litigation, to give notice of the intention of the opponent to retain his services. . That is all. When that notice is given, the barrister who has accepted the general retainer is obliged, of course, to consider all the circumstances that may, or may not, permit of his accepting a brief. In this case, as I have already said, I have completely severed myself professionally from everything connected with the litigation by the Marconi Company. That company, like every other company or individual giving a general retainer, has the righ t to say that it shall have the services of a member of the bar if there is nothing to prevent his giving them. There are a number of other matters in which the Commonwealth has no concern, and with regard to them. I should not be justified in depriving the company of its right to my services if there was nothing in the position which I held against my giving those services.",13
9,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable gentleman says that he is at liberty to accept a brief from the company in proceedings that do not affect the Commonwealth. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Q u it e so. SUGA RBOUNTY .,13
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish, to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs what position he finds himself in as to the payment of the sugar bounty-whethe r application has been made for the payment) of bounty, and whether bounty has been paid up to date ?",13
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The bounty payments have been withheld for the time being, pending communications which have been Bent to the companies concerned, with a view to securing to the growers the' payment of the full amount of the Excise remitted by the repealing Act . We are awaiting replies to the communications which have' been sent out.",13
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The - honourable member' might well lay apaper on the table dealing with the subject: FISHER GOVERNMENT. SOCIALISTIC ENTERPRISES.,13
13,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of External whether he is having balance-sheets prepared of the Socialistic enterprises of the last Government, to ascertain the exact loss in connection with each by means of a comparison of the prices paid in the open market with those which the late Government paid 1",14
14,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Analyse s of the costs of the undertakings of the late Government are now being made, and I hope to be in a position before long to afford the House full information. INTER - STA TE COMMISSION .",14
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I desire to know if the head-quarters of the Interpresented State Commission have been fixed at Melbourne. If so, does the Prime M in ister intend that the Commission shall revey. main here? What is wrong with Canable berra ?",14
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"At the present moment, I do not know where the headquarters of the Commission are to be; the matter is under consideration. No doubt, if the honourable member will address a question on the subject to the Minister of Trade and Customs, the latter wil l afford all the information required. PRIVATE PROPERTY INLAND .",14
17,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether, during the cent electoral campaign, or at any time, he has stated thatTlie trend of economic thought, and even of popular thought, realizes the iniquity of the cognition of private property in land. the one thing above all others that has this country, and has cursed every other country of which we have any knowledge; and unless it be abolished it will curse these countries the future as they have never yet been cursed. I desire to know whether the Prime M i ister, if this statement regarding his lic utterances be correct, intends to anything to abolish private ownership land.",14
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I wish to once and for all that I absolutely decline to answer any question which in the nature of an attack under the guise of an interrogation.,14
19,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,It will be observed that the Prime Minister does not deny having made the statement.,14
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! NORTHERN TERRITORY. TRIALRAILWAY SURVEYS-APPOINT MENTS. Affairs Mr THOMAS - In the policy statement presented by the Prime Minister yesterday we are told thatParliament will be asked to provide funds for trial surveys with the object of connecting by railway Port Darwin with Port Augusta vid Macdonnell Ranges, and with the Eastern railway systems vid Camooweal, which will open up the country for agricultural and pastoral settlement. I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether that statement refers to a proposal to appoint a fresh survey party, or does it refer to the work of Messrs. Chalmers and Lawrence, who were appointed by the late Government some months ago, and whose report must be by the beginning of next year?",14
21,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It refers to a new surThe question put by the honormember was whether the reference was to a new survey party. There may or may not be a new party, but the reference is to a final survey before the construction of the line. The survey begun under the direction of the late Administration will, I hope, be completed by the end of the year. The field data has been collected for all parts except a stretch between Newcastle Waters and Alice Springs. Mr Lawrence is at present in Melbourne, and in tends to carry out all the office work. reHe told me this morning that he hoped that the survey would be completed by the end of the year. What we intend to ask for is that a survey before conrestruction of the line itself be authorized It is by Parliament, so that we may push on cursed with the building of the railway.",14
22,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the in Minister of External Affairs whether, in view of the knowledge of the Departn - ment which he has acquired since he bepubcame Minister, he thinks that a larger do number of official appointments have in been made to the Northern Territory than were necessary, and, if so, what is say the nature of those appointments?",14
23,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The honourable memis ber was good enough, before the House met, to tell me that he intended to ask this question. I have not especially directed attention to the number of officers who have been appointed in the Territory, and I cannot say that any excess has been obtruded upon my notice. Everything depends upon whether the Territory is to be lef t in its present condition, or whether Ministers had in view a policy of development which would justify the appointments made. IMMIGRATION.

25,Mr HUGHES,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"A number of prosethe cutions for offences under the Electoral Act were initiated before the present Attorney-General took office. I shall glad to learn from the honourable gentlethere man what stage the proceedings have reached in those cases, as well as in others that have been instituted by him Mr W . H .

That is a matter to which, so far as the Attorney-General and the advice tendered by him is concerned, I should not be called upon to give an answer here. W it h regard to all prosecutions I may say that, so far as the Attorney-General's Department itself concerned, the persons to receive the first intimation about them will be those I do not propose, while I hold office as AttorneyI n reGeneral, to give specific information of advice which I tender to my colwith regard to prosecutions or intended prosecutions unless they are arrived on the actually launched.",15
26,Mr HOWE,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"The present Administraare tion has entered into an investigation of the voting at the last general election, and having regard to the figures pubThe lished, showing that some 5,000 votes are supposed to have been duplicated, or on in some way rendered ineffective, I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home whether it is intended to continue",15
27,Mr KELLY,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"I may inform the honourable member that the particular in vestigation that has just taken place is shipnot the only one that has been made. have been some other investigations with various phases of electoral For instance, I have endeavoured to trace the safeguards necessary in connection with the ballot-papers, and there is no harm in telling the honourable member that that investigation ELECTION has revealed the loss of 4,000 absent PRESIDING voters' ballot-papers for the referendum. This shows that the checks existing at TO RE - the present time are not altogether satisThe investigations that I am making in regard to the electoral administration generally do not cease with examination that has recently been concluded. That examination was to see how far the duplication of voting ocbe curred, and it does not prove how far was impersonation. In the case of a voter having impersonated another any voter, and the original voter being sub? sequently refused the right to vote by the presiding officer, the inquiry breaks down We shall make all the in quiries that are practicable in the in ",15
28,Mr FENTON,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"Has the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs received any report from the Chief Electoral Officer in connection with the election irregularities, and, if so, will he have the same placed on the table and printed ?",16
29,Mr KELLY,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,Yesterday I laid on the table a copy of the statement presented by the Chief Electoral Officer.,16
30,Mr FENTON,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,That is not a report.,16

33,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"I was not aware that these officers had not been paid. I have had no complaints in regard to the matter, but if the honourable member will give me some of the instances I shall have them attended to. There is no reason why these officers should not be paid, and I shall ask the Chief Electoral Officer to attend to the matter as soon as he can.",16
34,Mr MCGRATH,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,I understand that the Returning Officer in each electorate has submitted a report to the Chief Electoral Officer regarding the alleged cases of impersonation and duplication. Will the Minister lay on the table of the Library the reports of these Returning Officers that have been submitted?,16

36,Mr HOWE,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"In view of the fact that the Government propose an amendment of the electoral law, will the Prime Minister aud his colleagues promise that before any alteration is made there shall be a thorough investigation of all the circumstances of the last election?",16
37,Mr KELLY,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"The Government feel it necessary to introduce the Electoral Act Amendment Bill at an early date for a number of reasons, which, I think, are apparent to all honourable members. In the meanwhile, we shall proceed with the investigation to which I have referred, and endeavour to see that the next election is held on a basis, as far as possible, satisfactory to every elector in Australia.  Minister, upon noticeIs it a fact that the late Minister for Affairs issued a circular marked "" private confidential,"" authorizing any returning officer to allow any elector to exercise the right to vote, although another person had previously done so in his name?",16
38,Mr KELLY,RETURN OF HONORABLE MEMBER FOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question isThe circular referred to was issued as the result of advice from the Attorney-General's Department by the Chief Electoral Officer to Commonwealth Presiding Officers and Assistant Presiding Officers (io,ng). The circular reads as follows :NA OF PRESIDING OFFICERS. Advice has been obtained that an elector does not lose his right to vote because some one personating him has voted in his name, and therefore an elector who, not having already voted at the elections or referendums, claims to vote, and answers satisfactorily the questions put to him by the Presiding Officer, is entitled to vote, notwithstanding that some one else has voted in his name, and his name has been marked off on the list of voters. Presiding Officers will act upon this advising should occasion arise, but it is not necessary or desirable that it be promulgated for public information. A note should be made in the Presiding Officer's memo, book giving particulars of any case coming within the scope of this circular. B. C. OLDHAM, Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth.

40,Colonel RYRIE,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"Has the Minister of Home Affairs any information to give us with regard to the purchase of a road tractor for the Federal Territory? During a recent visit to the Territory, I found the road tractor in a most unsatisfactory condition. The tractor, I understand, was purchased against the recommendation of responsible officers; and I should like to know whether the Minister has any information on the subject?",16
41,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"My information is that the road tractor to which the honourable member refers is in a most satisfactory Home condition from the point of view of the and Commonwealth, seeing that it is lying in the store and unused. It proved very expensive in working during the few months it did work, and since then it has resolutely refused to work at all.",16
42,Mr HIGGS,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,Is this a question without notice ?,17
43,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I do not seem to be able to please my honourable friends opposite; when I start to answer a question, they are delighted, and, when I give a full answer",17
44,Mr HIGGS,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I only desire to point out that this is, apparently, not a question without notice.",17
45,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"However , I shall have inquiries made in regard to the concluding portion of my honourable friend's question, and will, I hope, be able to afford the House early information.",17
46,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"Is the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs aware that the officers at the Capital forced this tractor through the Molonglo River when it was overloaded, and that, in consequence, all its oiling appliances were spoiled ?",17
47,Mr BBCJCE SMITH,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,That is why will not work.,17
48,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"J u s t so; and we desire to get at the facts, and ascert a in what is the true reason for this tractor not working.",17
49,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I heard of this matter for the first time yesterday, and I think I may, perhaps, without offence, state my authority.",17
50,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,Yes ; I told the Honorary Minister.,17
51,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"My predecessor told me. I shall have this question investigated, because I think it has an important bearing on the whole matter.",17
52,Mr FISHER,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,Is not the objection that the tractor was made in the Commonwealth ?,17
53,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,No ; the objection is that the tractor will not work in the Commonwealth.,17
54,Mr FISHER,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,The Government do want the tractor to work because it was made here.,17
55,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"Is it a fact that some of the principal buildings at Acton, in the Federal Territory, have been erected on the main avenue of the Capital, and will , therefore, have to be pulled down ? At the present time the bank is being erected on this avenue, and» I suppose, will have to be removed.",17
56,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"The bank building is, I believe, directly on the avenue referred to. It is not the main axis of the Capital, but one of the two main avenues; and it is rather unfortunate that buildings of a permanent character on the Acton side should have been erected in a way that will possibly interfere very materially with the avenue, or necessitate their removal as soon as we are ready to establish the city. Mr J. H. CATTS - Will the Minister "" s a c k "" the responsible officer for this?",17
57,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I am not prepared offhand, at the request of a member of the Opposition, to "" sack "" any officer.",17
58,Mr JH CATTS,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"In regard to the buildings that have been erected out of their proper alignment, will the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs lay on the table of the House, or of the Library, a report showing what officers are responsible for this?",17
59,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I am having the whole it question of the cost of these buildings gone into now. I had hoped to have the information ready today, but the in quiry has proved protracted. My predecessor will , I think, recognise that it is rather difficult to properly allot responsibility as between the political head and the subordinate officers of the Department in a case like this.",17
60,Mr JH CATTS,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,The political head does not say where the buildings have to be erected.,17
61,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"My predecessor will , I think, recognise that I am not taking advantage of the fact that his official approval was required in this connection. I have no desire to rake up these matters connected with the past, but if the honourable member for Cook insists on the information, I shall make it available.",17
62,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"In view of the reply which he has just given, I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home not Affairs whether he will see that no f u r ther buildings are erected at the Capital until a proper survey of the city has been made ?",17
63,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"The survey of the actual city site has now been completed, and I am giving the question of the Acton settlement very careful consideration, with - a view to seeing that nothing that we do now can possibly interfere with the future - development of the city.",17
64,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I wish to .ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he is aware that the Federal Capital city is some distance from Acton, and that a thousand years hence Acton will probably be a suburb of the city?",18
65,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,I am not aware that - the honourable member's statement is cor.rect. I am aware that on the first prerniated design one of the principal avenues of the city runs through the Acton settlement.,18
66,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he is aware that in America, Broadway runs up to Albany, 150 miles away, and whether - would say that Albany was therefore on Broadway ?",18
67,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I am endeavouring to prevent my fancy roaming to America just now, because it is urgently necessary - that I should keep it on the spot.",18
68,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,Will the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs cause an inquiry to be made into the question - of whether the opposition to the purchase - of the tractor was not the outcome of the tractor being made in Australia ?,18
69,Mr KELLY,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,I have not examined the papers relating to the purchase of the tractor. I am not aware that there was any opposition to its purchase. I only know the facts as I saw them myself at - Canberra a few days ago. B ut I will have the fullest inquiry made into the matter if my honourable friend desires it .,18
70,Mr HIGGS,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether it is proposed to abolish the leasehold system of land tenure in the Federal Copital Territory, and to substitute freehold tenure?",18

72,Mr HUGHES,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"Recently in the Supreme Court of New Zealand, the - Colonial Sugar Refining Company had an appeal under the Anti-Trust Act, and judgment has been given.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",18
73,Mr WEST,CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR FOR THE INFORMATION,"I desire to make a personal explanation. In the Argus of today it is reported that whilst the honourable member for Hume was speaking yesterday he stated that he was pleased to see the proposal of the Government to exclude rural workers from the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act , and that I interjected "" They are too well off."" I wish to say that I did not make use of those words, and, further, that I made no interjection whilst the honourable member for Hume was speaking. he NA UNIONISTS.",18
74,Mr HIGGS,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I desire to ask the At torney-General whether the proposed abolition of preference to unionists is to extend to the legal profession. Does the Attorney-General intend to confine all the legal work of the Commonwealth to members of the Barristers and Solicitors' Associations, and if , by any chance, there should be a non-unionist solicitor or barrister in Australia, will he be given a fair share of such work ? Mr W . II . IRVINE - The question of the honourable member is totally beside the Bill which it is intended to introduce. I can assure him that the provisions of that measure will apply to members of the legal profession as well as to members of other professions, so far as they are applicable.

75,Mr ATKINSON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Can the Postmaster-General inform the House whether the Government has taken any step towards improving the Tasmanian mail service?,18
76,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"There has been negotiation between the shipping companies which carry the Tasmanian mails and the Department, and I today received a communication from the companies setting for th the terms on which they would be prepared to give an im proved service. I have not yet submitted that communication to the Cabinet.

77,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I think that the suggestion of the honourable member is a reasonable one in cases where a guarantee is provided.,19
78,Mr BENNETT,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General if anything has been done in connection with the abolition of the late fee stamp upon letters posted at country railway stations?,19
79,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Shortl y after I assumed office I called for reports from the Deputy Postmasters-General of the States as to whether the late fee stamp upon letters posted at country railway stations could be abolished. Each of those reports was adverse to the proposal, but a list is now being prepared of the small townships along the-various railway lines throughout the Commonwealth at which letters can be posted without inconvenience to the railway officials, and no late postage fee will be charged upon such letters.",19
80,Mr FRAZER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"1 desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether an instruction was not issued over my signature, more than twelve months ago, to the effect that where a post-office is situated an unreasonable distance from a railway station letters may be posted on the trains without a late fee being charged ?",19
81,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I do not think that any such rule has been observed. understand that in some places effect was given to it . Where a post-office was situated three-quarters of a mile or more from a railway station certain concessions were made. But under the new proposal it will not matter where a post-office is located. In the cases I have indicated no late fee stamp will be required.,19

No. The instructions issued by the Department on this matter are that prosecuting officer^ shall, in the event of a fine being inflicted upon a cadet, request the magistrate to specify an alternative punishment in default of payment of the fine of not less than seven days' custody in barracks.

AHERNThat the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to by this House :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Represntatives of , the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyally to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",23
162,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Wide Bay) [3.36] - It is not news to honourable members cf either House that this, the F if t h Parliament of the Commonwealth, meets under very peculiar circumstances in so far as the relation of parties is concerned. There is evidence in both Chambers of a position which is not satisfactory with respect to the carrying on of public business, and there is evidence also of that fact in the speech made by His Excellency the Governor General when opening the present session. The Speech was practically nominal, and offered to Parliament no guide to the policy of the present Government. The statement which was laid on the table of the House yesterday by the Prime Minister, and which purported to outline the policy of His Excellency's advisers, does not do very much to enlighten honourable members and the country as to what is likely to take place. opinion, it indicates, on the part of the Government, a mere policy of marking time. So far as we can see, they do not intend to launch any of those large and national schemes, such as were dealt with by the last Parliament, and which have tended to make Australia what it is today. Nine-tenths of the Government policy is purely negative. The Government, apparently, do not propose to make adjustments in the light of experience, but intend to hark back to ancient ideas, and to the most Tory principles. They mean to entrench privilege and to attack those who really need assistance. My first duty, however, is to offer my congratulations to the honourable members who moved and seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I think that they discharged that duty with credit to themselves and with honour to the House. Both have been returned by constituencies which were represented by [ 5 ] -* others in the last Parliament. One constituency was represented by an honourable gentleman who has passed away, while the other was represented by a man who is still youug, and who may be heard of again in Federal politics. Let me say that I appreciated some of the statements made by the honourable member for Indi . The honourable member, in the course of his remarks, made an appeal to the Opposition to see that the national policy of Protection was carried out. That appeal will not go unheard. In another statement, which, I presume, was made with Ministerial authority, the honourable member conveyed to the House and the country that it was intended to place tli3 maternity allowance on a contributory basis. I do not see anything in the official Ministerial statement that quite bears that out; but I presume it is an indication of the policy we are about to hear. In this lengthy document, which the Prime Minister threw on the table",24
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Thre w on the table ?,24
164,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Yes , in a somewhat indignant manner, if not with indignation-somethin g after the manner in which the honourable gentleman, later in the sitting, exclaimed, "" If that is the feeling of honourable members opposite I shall not say ' another bloomin' word ' ! "" I quote the elegant language of the Prime In my Minister, because he is entitled to have his own words used.",24
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I stand corrected by the elegant gentleman over there!,24
166,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"In the Ministerial statement, attention is first directed to the question of the rolls, and the Government express a desire that these shall be kept"" in proper order. Every member of this House-ever y member of the Labour party-agree s to that. We are glad to know, however, that the rolls are in fairly good order, notwithstanding the wildest and most reckless statements ever made by public and responsible men. The rolls contain the names of the people of Australia who are entitled to the franchise, and there is an excess of names, because, under the conditions of the check system, there must necessarily be more names than there are people with the right to vote. It is, and always has been, the policy of retrogressionists, of Tories, and of privileged people to have as few names on the roll as possible. In a Democracy it is the business of the Parliament to see that the poorest and humblest citizen is enabled to exercise the franchise; and the outburst of anger and annoyance amongst honourable members-opposite is because of the fact that such people have been accorded the privilege. The insidious, mean, and contemptible insinuation is that those people, if any, who did violate their election privileges, were not those with most of the world's goods, but those who are poor and needy-in other words, not those who support honourable members opposite, but those who support the Opposition. The statement reported in London as made by the Minister",24
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"No , no.",25
168,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The statement was ported to have been made by Minister, and was given in the first person at a special interview; and it is an outrage on the credit and standing of the people of Australia. This counpoll? try has been represented here and overseas as inhabited by men and women go who are actuated by corrupt motives, :;nd who act corruptly at the ballot-box. it stands. This slandering of the name of Australia allowed, how was it used ? is in keeping with the traditions of the party opposite ever since the Federal Parliament came into existence. they were in Opposition, and the White Australia policy was before us, they denounced that policy in such language tances from the polling-booth. that Australia was misrepresented, and from that day to this the traditional policy of the Liberal party has been traduce the good name of Australia here and in other parts of the world.",25
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Why did the honourable member not trust the people with the postal vote?,25

171,Mr MASSYGREENE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,That does not answer my question.,25
172,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"If the absentee vote is as good as the postal vote, it is doubtedly safer.",25
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The honourable member s vid he would not trust the people with the postal vote.,25
174,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The Government Whip is evidently anxious to make his speech by way of interjection.,25
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Will the honourable member give me a reference to the statement he says I made?,25
176,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"It is a quotation from Hansard. Does the honourable member deny it ? In Hansard of 7th December, in dealing with this matter, the Prime Minister is reported as saying: - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Queensland has increased the facilities for voting.",25
177,Mr FENTON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,It abolished postal voting.,25
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,And put in something just as good-absen t voting. Could hypocrisy go any further ? Prime Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Where is the hypocrisy about that?,25
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Surely the Leader of the Opposition does not think that the reabsentee vote is as good as the postal the Prime vote for sick people ?,25
180,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I do.,25
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,O r for the thousands of women who cannot get to the,25
182,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I had not intended to deeply into this matter, but the people of Australia might just as well know how When the postal vote was One would imagine that in the great spaces of Australia, such as we find in Western AusWhen tralia and Queensland, the postal vote would be mostly employed by the women, who there very often reside great disAs a matter of fact, however, the number of postal votes used in Victoria during the to Federal election of 1910 was extraordinary. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I shall give the figures for all the States. The postal votes used on that occasion were:-Ne w South Wales, 6,219; Victoria, 14,049; Queensland, 4,020; South Australia, 1,751; Australia, 1,977; and Tasmania, n - 1,233. Thus we find in the most densely is populated State of the Commonwealth vote there were 14,049 postal votes used.",25
183,Sir ROBERT BEST,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The honourable member must know that the reason for. that is that in Victoria we were previously accustomed to vote in that way.,25
184,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"It is quite evident the unpeople were accustomed to vote in that way, because in the honourable member's electorate of Kooyong there were more postal votes cast than there were in the whole of Western Australia.",25
185,Sir ROBERT BEST,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,What about that ?,26
186,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Does any honourable member believe that all these were the bond fide votes of sick people ?,26
187,Sir ROBEET BEST,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Does the honourable member say that they were not bond fide ? Does the honourable member challenge the honesty of those votes?,26
188,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I say that the abuse of the postal-voting system was greater than any other abuse I know under the electoral law. It is quite evident that the honourable member and his colleagues are very much annoyed at the position occupied by them in this matter. honourable member for Darling Downs, who is the Minister of Trade and Customs, was, I think, chairman of a Committee that investigated this question.",26
189,Mr GROOM,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I was a member of Committee on the working of the postalvote provisions, and we gave a report which the honourable member said was right and proper.",26
190,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Her e are the words of the report: The evidence justifies your Committee in finding that many persons who voted by post had not reason to believe they would be more than five miles from their polling place on the day of election, and were on that day within the limit. It would appear that the voting facilities provided have been used contrary to the intention of the Act.",26
191,Mr GROOM,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,And the report was adopted hy the whole of the House.,26
192,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"And Parliament took action to prevent this power being abused. The honourable member for Lilley knows well that gross abuse took place at Gyrnpie in respect of the postal vote. On the. 8th August, 1907, Mr Kidston made some significant statements in the Queensland Parliament. He saidEvery one of us knows quite well that the way in which postal voting was carried out in many cases made it to all intents and purposes open voting-ope n voting under this peculiar condition ; open voting under the eye of some one who probably had some power over the person voting. I venture to assert that if another election takes place with the Postal Vote unrepealed all parties will do their best to get the great bulk of the women to vote by post. . . . There are plenty of women that can protect themselves. There are plenty of women who are in such a position that they are not afraid of their husband's position if they vote the wrong way; but, unfortunately, there are a large number of women who are not in that happy position, and it is chiefly for their protection that it is is wrong sought to remove this blemish from our Act without any delay. . . . I consider it the duty of this House to wipe out the postal vote root and branch, and to wipe it out at once. The Prime Minister has said that the absentee vote is just as good as the postal vote, and that it is less liable to abuse.",26
193,Mr SAMPSON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Is the honourable member aware that in Queensland the postal vote is being restored ?,26
194,Mr FRAZER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"B y a Tory Government.  lotted to Queensland, what proportion came from the Wide Bay district ?",26
195,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I am quoting the The figures relating to the election of 1910.  the postal votes allotted to Queensland came from the Wide Bay electorate?,26
196,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,For the benefit of the the honourable member I will say that the elections which have been conducted in the Wide Bay constituency have been clean beyond all question.  they were not.,26
197,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Not h in g but an absolute and full apology by members of the Government will remove the stain which has been put upon Australia by the statements which they and their supporters have made in the press in regard to alleged electoral irregularities. These wild and reckless statements gave Mr Foster, a leading Minister of the Canadian Parliament, an opportunity to make comparisons which did not reflect credit on the integrity of the people of Australia, as compared with the people of Canada. Anybody who knows America will recognise that it is the last country in the world with which Australia should be compared to our disadvantage in a matter of this sort. Yet, up to the present time, there is not a responsible Minister who has been honest enough to say that the allegations made in respect of impersonation and plural voting at the recent elections were not warranted. As a matter of fact, the number of irregularities which have been discovered are not more than those which are usually found even when a vote is taken in this chamber. Therefore, the voting of the people of Australia was creditable to them, and to this great Democracy.",26
198,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The statements of which the honourable member complains were chiefly made by the newspapers.,26
199,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"And by Ministers. I am sorry that I have not the time to quote the statements of Ministers to the effect that the electoral irregularities represented thousands of votes. The Attorney-General made only one speech dealing with this matter, in which he conveyed the idea that ho believed in these allegations. Immediately he saw the rolls, he hedged, and said, "" I do not say that there are any irregularities which cannot be explained."" But other Ministers were not so careful, and therefore the good name of Australia has been injured. The next point in the M in isterial manifesto is a rather important one. Paragraph 2 deals with two phases of social legislation which was enacted at the instance of the late Ministry. We are told that the present Government intend to abolish preference to unionists in the Public Service. Now, the only preference permitted in the Public Service by the late Government was preference to unionists, other things being equal.",27
200,Mr JH CATTS,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Preferenc e did not apply to the permanent officers,27
201,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"No ; but in regard to casual employment preference was given to unionists, other things being equal. The second part of paragraph 2 in the Ministerial manifesto is nothing more nor less than a stab in the back of associated labour. It has always been the practice when privileged parties wished to inflict an in j u r y upon the masses who were struggling for liberty and protection, that they secured a renegade to inflict it . At all times they have endeavoured to use the tools which were most convenient to their hands. I say here that the world of labour, industry, ancl progress would never have attained to what it is",27
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I rise to a point of order. Is this insulting language in order ?,27
203,Mr SPEAKER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,What is the language of which the Prime Minister complains?,27
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The member has alluded to me as a "" renegade,"" and I ask that he should be required to withdraw the expression and apologize.",27
205,Mr SPEAKER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I did not catch the expression, but if the honourable member for Wide Bay used it , I ask him to withdraw it .",27
206,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I withdraw the phrase altogether, but what I have stated is an historical fact. Nevertheless, I withdraw the expression absolutely so far as it refers to the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman will admit that every step in the direction of progress won by the toiling masses has been won after the roadway has been strewn with the corpses of men who succumbed in the struggle for freedom. They had to band themselves together when unionism was unlawful, and that is not so very long ago. There are men living today who remember the time when it was unlawful to form a union at all, and when imprisonment was the lot of workers if they were known to be united for the purpose of raising their wages from 9s. per week upwards. They were outlawed. But all the powers of monopoly and vested interests could not keep them down. They rose, not because of the help which they received from the privileged classes, but because they banded themselves into associations, and by so doing were able to help each other, and thus to help the nation. We have reached and passed a period in our history when this Parliament deliberately - Liberal s as well as Labour members-supporte d the principle of allowing an organized body of workmen who felt that they had a grievance access to an Arbitratio n Court, and of empowering the Judge of that tribunal to determine whether preference should be f iven to those who brought their plaint efore him. Is there anything unfair in that? If a body of industrial workers choose to go before the A r b i tration Court and ask for a judicial decision upon the plaint which they have lodged, is the Judge of that Court to be refused the power to grant them a preference, even though he believes that they are entitled to it? Are these men and women to have no protection at all ? The honourable member for Hume has made an interjection which I did not catch. Is he aware that one of his confreres has published the statement, here and elsehonorable where, that an organization exists in this country to keep men who are free labourers for the purpose of breaking up our industrial unions? Mr Blackwood does not deny that fact. But men who are aggrieved will fight for freedom. Is it not a deplorable state of things that agents should be paid to break up industrial organizations, which have done more for the progress of the world than all the Parliaments that ever assembled? No more severe condemnation of the Government policy could be found than this attempt to injure the organized bodies of labour throughout Australia. Paragraph 3 of the Government manifesto relates to the duties of the Inter-State Commission, and with the manner in which the Ministry propose to deal with the question of Protection. It is quite evident that no serious attempt is to he made by the Government to deal with the fiscal issue. It is evident that no effort is to be made by this Government to obtain increased powers for this Parliament. It is equally evident to every man here, and to the country, that there are certain great industries, primary and other, that could not last for a single year without ample and effective protection on the seaboard of Australia.  ber give us their names?",27
207,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The sugar industry is one of them. That industry is open to attack from all directions outside Australia, because everywhere outside 'this country sugar is produced with the aid of coloured labour, which is the cheapest labour in the world. The sugar industry cannot live in Australia without ample protection at the seaboard.. The industry has been developed by white labour in the districts lying on our north-eastern coast, in a way that was not anticipated ten years ago, even by the most sanguine. It is an industry which must depend for its existence upon the good-will of the people of Australia. The President of the United States of America, finding it impossible to obtain the powers necessary for the protection of the people's interests, and the prevention of monopoly, proposes to wipe off the American Tariff duties, and to open the ports of America to free sugar. This Government has, apparently, no intention of asking for larger powers for the Parliament for the prevention of monopoly and the protection of consumers. Does the Government intend to prevent monopoly in Australia by opening the ports of the country to free sugar, thus destroying our great sugar industry? That must follow. In the United States of America the sugar industry is carried on largely with coloured, labour, and, therefore, will not be affected so greatly by the loss of Protection as the sugar industry here would be. Were it not for the development brought about by the sugar industry on the north-eastern coast of Australia, we should have to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in preparing for the more effective defence of that part, as we are doing in the Northern Territory. Paragraph 7 of the Prime Minister's memorandum says thatInquiries are being made, and material is being gathered necessary for the formulation of a comprehensive scheme of national insurance oa a contributory basis, embracing sickness, accidents, maternity, widowhood, and unemployment. I ask the Prime Minister whether he considers that there are ample powers in the Constitution for all these purposes, and whether he is prepared to say on what basis contributions shall be levied ? If it is proposed to interfere with the maternity allowance for the purpose of pauperizing recipients, I very much regret it . The social legislation now on the statute book might well stand as it is, and will bear the test of time. That Australia can well afford to find the money I have no doubt at all. The principle underlying the maternity allowance is that the wolf of poverty should be kept at a considerable distance from the door when the lives of, perhaps, two persons are at stake. I hope that our legislation will not be disturbed, and I speak for every member of my party when I say that it will not be disturbed with our consent.",28
208,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Does not the honourable member think that abuses have occurred under the Act?,28
209,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"V e r y few abuses have occurred that have not been discovered. 1 discovered none to speak of during my term of office. If there are abuses, it is for the Ministry to prevent them. Some persons may be accepting allowances who could afford to do without them, but it is more important to maintain independence among the recipients of allowances than to prevent those who can afford to go without them from obtaining allowances. We should not differentiate between those who need and those who do not need.",28
210,Colonel RYRIE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,We differentiate when paying old-age pensions.,28
211,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Because we have to ; but the principle is not a sound one. Where we can maintain what is the right principle we should do so. A number of references are made to the development of the Northern Territory, but I have read in the newspapers statements regarding the policy of the Government in the Northern Territory which are not reassuring. Paragraphs have appeared which suggest that Ministers are a little uncertain as to whether the White Australia policy can be maintained in the Northern Territory. I hope that it is not intended to interfere with that policy there.",28
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,To what statements does the honourable member refer?,29
213,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,To statements published i u various journals regarding the difficulty of settling the Territory effectively with Europeans.,29
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Statement s made by whom ?,29
215,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"-Statement s attributed to Ministerial supporters and others. It is my public duty to mention them, so that the people of Australia, and of the world at large, may know what our policy is in this matter. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows that many of the present Ministerial supporters denounced the White Australia policy from A to Z when they were in Opposition, saying that it could never be established effectively. The honourable member for Parkes, for one, would not deny that he did so. He was utterly opposed to the repatriation of the Polynesians and the adoption of the white labour policy in connection with the sugar industry. He has also condemned the white labour policy generally, time and again. The Government propose to abolish the day-labour system in connection with the construction of public works, and to revert to the contract system. That, I believe, will be a mistake. It will be found difficult to prove that, even in railway construction, the contract system is cheaper than the day-labour system. It may suit or please friends of the Ministry to have the contract system re-established, but, on the strength of statements made in New South Wales and in Queensland, I say that the Ministry should hesitate before departing from the day-labour system. In an official report by the Queensland Minister of Railways, published last year or the year before-thes e are not figures prepared by a Labour Government-it was stated that the estimated cost of railways constructed by day labour was £2,135,914 , and the amount actually expended only £1,864,562, showing a saving of over £271,352, or a net saving of 12.7 per cent. It has also been stated in the press-thoug h not verified officially-that in New South Wales day labour has proved more economical than contract labour.",29
216,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales has stated that the cost of the North Coast line, the biggest work there undertaken, has not been included.",29
217,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"At any rate, the case against day labour has not been proved, and I hope that no change will be made u n t i l it has been justified after a sufficient inquiry. I think that the proposed establishment of a Public'Works Department is a good thing. The late Government did what they could in that matter. It must be remembered that there was no large"" expenditure on public works until we took office. Our expenditure was commenced under circumstances of great difficulty, there being no adequate staff; and in my opinion the work was carried on admirably. My recollection is that when the late Mr Eddy came to New South Wales he asked for £3,000,00 0 to put the railways into order, and the Treasurer of the day promised him the money. But there was no staff with which to expend the money efficiently. Mr Eddy said that it would take him a year to get a staff to look after the expenditure of £1,000,000. For several years the Commonwealth Public Works Branch was absolutely neglected. During our term of office demands for public works came from every direction. Our expenditure had sometimes to be made at a disadvantage, but, considering the difficulties under which we laboured, I think that our public works were done wonderf u l l y well. There is now a better staff, and better facilities for the construction of public works, than when we assumed office, and I iam sure that honourable members generally are glad that that is so. I think we are all agreed that any extension of the old-age pensions will be beneficial, but I hope that the Government will not limi t it to providing for the payment of pensions to charitable in stitutions. The principle underlying our pensions system is that opportunity shall be given to old persons to continue to live in their own homes. That was the desire and aim of those who inaugurated our pensions system. Persons who are unfitted to take care of themselves, and must be cared for in an institution, are, of course, an exception. So far as they are concerned, no serious objection is to be made to the proposal before us. Regarding the proposed alteration of the Audi t Act, I have indicated again and again that, in my opinion, the Government ought, for their own convenience, to be allowed to spend money in July on the basis of the appropriation for the previous year. That is a convenience, and is absolutely necessary, having regard to the period at which the term of office of senators expires.",29
218,Mr FENTON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Why not alter the date of closing the financial year of the Commonwealth ?,30
219,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Then it would be at variance with that of the States. That would be rather a disadvantage.,30
220,Mr FENTON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I should like them all to come into line with us.,30
221,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,We cannot them to fall into line with respect to any matter. I think the proposal to alter the gold reserve in respect'of the note issue is a mistake. Mr CONROY; - I should have thought that the right honourable member would have no objection to that proposal in view of the policy that he tried to follow.,30
222,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I think it is an entire mistake to hold a larger gold reserve than 33 per cent. There should be a statutory reserve of not less than 25 per cent., with a working margin of 33 per cent. I have always held that view, and have no reason to depart from it . The margin I have mentioned is ample, and will become in creasingly so. At the present time, probably, the fund is in credit to the extent of about £320,000. That is to say, the earnings are being placed to the credit of a Trust Fund, and so add to the total amount of gold held or invested against the note issue. We have, therefore, every year an increasing reserve, if not in gold, at least in securities equal to gold, and it is most inadvisable at present to alter the Act i u the direction mentioned.",30
223,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Why ? Consider the present financial stringency.,30
224,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The point is that the proposal made by the Government will lead to a still greater demand on the gold k i the Commonwealth, so that if there is any financial stringency that stringency must be increased. The proposal is unsound, and is one which I hope the honourable member will assist ine to modify, if not to turn down.",30
225,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I fear that I cannot help the right honourable member. I prophesied that the Act would create a good deal of financial stringency.,30
226,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"It did not. As a matter of fact, it relieved the financial stringency.",30
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The Governor of the Bank said it had created some stringency. Remember, I am not attacking him.",30
228,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The Prime Minister evidently refers to the communication which the Governor addressed to the Times; but in i the made no such statement. These were mere trifles, like feathers in a whirlwind, and did not seriously affect the question of the stringency of the money market. The greatest compliment ever paid to the Commonwealth was that given by the Opposition when they said that the financial admininduce istration of the Labour party had in fluenced the money markets of the world. The money markets of London, New York, Paris, and Berlin, according to them, were all shaken! It is worthy of note, in this connection, that since the present Administration took office the money market has become much tighter. When I opened my speech, I remarked that the peculiar position in regard to the state of parties in this Parliament made it very difficult to carry on the business of the country as it should be carried on.",30
229,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Hear , hear ! There is no doubt about that.",30
230,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The r e can be no doubt about it . Although the Labour party came back with a. larger number of members of both Houses than it comprised in the last Parliament, the Liberal party are now in power. I believe that the "" beat time "" policy on the part of the Government is in keeping with the best traditions of all Conservative parties. We cannot blame the Government for doing nothing while they pretend to be doing a great deal; but their attacks on the social and industrial legislation passed by this Democratic Parliament are wholly unwarranted. The mandate they have received from the country does not justify them. Indeed, they are not inaccord with the policy which they put before the people, so far as I have been able to understand it . They contemplate a retrograde step, and if their proposals are given the force of law, they certainly will not prove beneficial to the people. It has been my lot to <be seriously misrepresented regarding the statement. I made in 1910 concerning our attitude towards the fiscal question. I said then, clearly and definitely, that if the Commonwealth Parliament had the power to protect the workers as well as the employers, there was no reasonable protection that we would not give to enable the manufacturers of Australia to secure the trade of the Commonwealth. That was a clear and definite statement. We intended to appeal to the people by way of a referendum to give this Parliament larger powers, so that the workers might apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to remedy any injustice under which they considered they were suffering. We did appeal to the electors, first of all in 1911; but our referenda proposals were rejected. At the last general election we made another appeal by way of a referendum, and our proposals were again turned down. In putting our policy before the people, we said that if the powers for which we asked were granted this Parliament, we should, as a party, introduce and pass legislation for the protection of Australian industries; but that, even if they were turned down, we should feel that since we had submitted our referenda proposals on two different occasions, and the people had seen fit to reject them, it would be our duty to endeavour to carry out a fiscal policy consistent with the protection of Australian industries, and the development of the secondary industries of Australia. That was, and is, the policy of our party. We should also lower taxation. I do not agree with the honourable member that it necessarily follows that local production is always dearer than are importations.",30
231,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I quite agree with the right honourable member that it is not always so.,31
232,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Any one who views the world's outlook and the position of Australia and New Zealand today must recognise that this country, isolated as it is, is not safe ujaless it has a large artisan population, and is in every respect practically self-contained. It is, therefore, doubly the duty of this National Parliament to deal with the question. I understand the Prime Minister took exception to a statement. I made concerning his attitude towards old-age pensions. I have here a number of quotations from speeches made by him, all of which I shall not read; but those which I shall read should convince him that he has expressed himself very freely on the question. Speaking in this House on 17th November, 1911, he said, as reported in Hansard, page 2840FOT a long time. I have felt that our scheme is upon a wrong footing. Old-age pensions should be lifted out of the charitable rut in which they are running. The taint of pauperism and charity should be entirely eliminated from them. Moreover, the Act, as administered, is harsh and irksome in every way. In the same speech he said, as reported at pages 2840-1I think the system should be upon an insurance basis. It should be an insurance and not a pension. . . . The more I think of it the more am I convinced that we must come ultimately to a form of national insurance which will give every man-the millionaire as well as the poor man-wh o has subscribed to his own insurance fund the right to receive that insurance, without taint of pauperism or charity, in his old_ age. That is the scheme which commends itself to my mind.",31
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The only trick the right honourable member's party played was in trying to make the people believe that we were going to do that at once.,31
234,Mr TUDOR,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,What does the present Attorney-General say about the matter?,31
235,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"So the Government do not intend to take action at once? The present Attorney-General has been quite frank as to his attitude. Speaking in this House on 10th July, 1912, he said, as reported in Hansard, page 592I should regard it as one of the worse things that could happen to the country if we were to adopt, as a permanent part of our future policy, the providing for the wants of old age and invalidism by doles out of the public Treasury. Here is another quotation from a speech made by the present Attorney-General in this House on 14th November, 1911, and' reported in Hansard at page 2575I feel that it is not only repugnant to common sense, but opposed to the best instincts of our people, that we should plant here a tree which will not stop at the growth that it has already got, but which will go on growing if we do not substitute for it something based upon the contributory system-somethin g based upon a principle that will give play to the very best instincts that our race possesses. My colleague, the honourable member for West Sydney, attacked honourable members opposite on these statements, and the Melbourne Argus of 5th July last then published this statementEverybody knows, and none better than Mr. Hughes, that Mr Irvine and all Liberal candidates adopt Mr Joseph Cook's declaration for the party on these questions, viz., that the bonus and pensions will be reconsidered in connection with a broad scheme of contributory insurance. That is from the mouthpiece of the Liberal party. Can the Prime Minister deny that lie had anything to do with this ?",31
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Wit h what?,32
237,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The press mouthpiece of the Liberal party accuses the honourable member for West Sydney of gross misrepresentation, because it saysEverybody knows, and none belter than Mr. Hughes, that Mr Irvine and all Liberal candidates adopt Mr Joseph Cook's declaration for the partu on these questions, viz., that the bonus and pensions will be reconsidered in connection with a broad scheme of contributory insurance. It is no use the Prime Minister shaking his head; this is the kind of thing that goes to the public, and then honourable members opposite say that they are misrepresented.",32
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Does the honourable member say that I put that to the public ?,32
239,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"- I quoted the Prime Minister's statement, and here we have what the press said about it .",32
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The member is too ridiculous altogether!,32
241,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Whateve r may be said of other newspapers, we know exactly what the policy of the Argus is. It is a Conservative, Tory policy which that organ desires to see carried out, and the paper's case has never been put otherwise. At any rate, the Prime Minister speaks with two voices regarding a question on which there should be no two voices. Perhaps honourable members have noted a singular omission from the Ministerial statement. There is not a single reference to finance.",32
242,Mr RILEY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,They do not understand finance!,32
243,Mr CONROY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Perhaps the finances were so confused they could not understand them!,32
244,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"It is not a question of understanding; at any rate, the finances could not be more confused than the Prime Minister's statements regarding them. He has made various statements from time to time, and one or two of them have been answered in the press. In the Argus of 15th July of this year, the Prime Minister, in a controversy regarding Federal finance, saidMy reference was to the fact, and I think I quoted the figures, that this year there had been an increase of ,£6,000,000 in their [i.e.. Fisher Government's) income, and it had all been spent, and it was estimated to be spent_ within the year. As a matter of fact there is only a surplus, as Sir John Forrest showed in the House, of income over expenditure for the year of £26^,000, and this notwithstanding that the expenditure on public works is £1,100,000 less than Mr Fisher estimated. The facts are that the total revenue for 1911-12 was £20,546,361, and the total revenue for 1912-13 was £21,878,126, showing an increase of £1,331,765, and not an increase this year of £6,000,000 , as stated by the Prime Minister. A statement issued by Sir John Forrest on 2nd July shows that the estimated expenditure on new works for all departments for 1912-13 was £2,679,092 , and the actual expenditure £2,699,375, showing an increase of £20,283, not a decrease of £1,100,000.",32
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Is that a fair statement?,32
246,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Yes .,32
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Will the honourable memberallow me to tell him that he does not know what he is talking about?,32
248,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"It is the Prime Minister's own Treasurer that I am quoting. honourable Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member knows that he is playing a trick with those figures. The trick is to refer to new works instead of to the total amount for public works, which is £4,000,000, and not £2,600,000 .",32
249,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Does the Prime M i nister say in this House, and before the people of Australia, that there was not in the Consolidated Revenue an actual surplus of about £2,500,000, and an accumulated surplus in the Notes Trust Fund of £291,000 when he took office?",32
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,I have never denied it .,32
251,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Is it true or not true 1,32
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,It is true.,32
253,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,This is the first time that it has been admitted.,32
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,It is not the first time that it has been admitted-it has never been denied.,32
255,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I can assure the honourable member that his admission is worth something to the people of Australia. I have had hundreds of letters from various parts of the country declaring that the Prime Minister stated the contrary, and the press has iterated and reiterated that we were in debt instead of having a surplus, and, owing to his credit and reputation for veracity, the Prime Minister was believed by many people. The Prime Minister will now admit that the late Government did not spend every penny it received or could lay their hands on ?",32
256,Mr KELLY,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The money came in quicker than the late Government could spend it .,33
257,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"We were the first Government to pay off a deficit left by another Government. The Argus, in 1910, said that one of the chief points for the outgoing Fusion party was that the Labour Government would be faced with a deficit of £1,000,000 , and the newspaper was anxious to see how the new Government would deal with it . The one hope, consolation, and source of satisfaction on the defeat of that immoral combination of parties for office was the embarrassment which the Labour Government would meet in dealing with the deficit left by their predecessors.",33
258,Mr MASSYGREENE,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,And the Labour Government took it from the States.,33
259,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Whateve r the faults and failings of the Labour Government may have been, they paid their way. They built an Australian Navy, and paid for it .",33
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,Is it paid for yet ?,33
261,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"It is a large Navy, and has been paid for and provided for out of surplus; and I am sorry to say we find no naval policy in the Ministerial statement. I appeal to the vast majority of the intelligent people of Australia when I say that there is only one policy for the oversea Dominions, especially Australia and New Zealand, and that is the policy of providing first class ships for the defence of these shores. That is a policy which is absolutely necessary for our own protection and for the help of the Mother Country. The policy of the Labour Government in this regard was known fro m the first, and was laid down definitely and distinctly. It was known to the Imperial authorities long prior to the Conference of 1909, when Australia was represented by Colonel Foxton. The policy of the Labour Government is, I believe, the policy of the people of Australia.",33
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,That is policy that has been carried out.,33
263,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,The Prime Minister has five different phases of his policy for Australian defence.,33
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,How many has honourable member?,33
265,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,One .,33
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"Since the party said that £500,000 was sufficient, how may phases have they had?",33
267,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,One .,33
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"The honourable member will admit that the £500,000 has had to be exceeded ?",33
269,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"I do not say that these interjections are deliberately designed to take up time, but they have undoubtedly been deliberate and free. There has been but one policy of the Labour party on the question of Australian naval defence.",33
270,Mr ATKINSON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,We were to have a mosquito Fleet.,33
271,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"What have I done to honourable members opposite that they should interject so much? The Liberal Government were too ' big ' ' to start with 1 a mosquito Fleet-to o big to start in a small way-and , therefore, they adopted the usual course of the party, and never started at all. The objection of honourable members opposite is not because of the size of the ships, but because of our having started to make adequate provision for Australian defence. No one more than the Prime Minister objected furiously to our doing anything of the kind, and he came to au agreement with Mr Deakin and the Liberals, with the result that immediatelj the House met the Labour Government were challenged, without any opportunity being afforded to discuss our policy. The Liberals desired to follow the lead of New Zealand and present a battleship to the Mother Country.",33
272,Mr ATKINSON,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"And a good idea, too.",33
273,Mr FISHER,ABOLITION OF PREFERENCE TO,"H a p p i l y , the Mother Country did not need any such g if t , because it was in a position to build as many ships as it required at the time. All the Mother Country desired was to know the position of the Dominions in regard to their own general defences and the defences of the Empire. We made it perfectly clear what the policy of the Labour Government was, and we have, seen no reason to vary it . If New Zealand presented a ship, the Mother Country had to man it ; and that is a most not the material point. Canada finds it difficult to man the war-ships on her shores. Australia is the only Dominion in the Empire whose sons have offered themselves in larger numbers than are required the to man the Fleet. The Old Country is in greatei need of men to man the ships than it is of money to build the ships, Labour and Australia will be a powerful auxiliary in time of «need. The proposal of the Labour Government, as submitted by myself to the country, that there should be another sister battleship on these shores, is not, in my opinion, an extreme, but, rather, a modest policy highly desirable to meet our immediate needs. If there is any great delay, or any delay whatever, in the contiuuance of the defence policy of the Labour Government, we may live to regret it . am not one to proclaim the dangers of war, but prefer to proclaim the virtues of peace. However, viewing things as we see them in every part of the world today, and especially viewing our situation, together with that of New Zealand, in the South Pacific, isolated from all European populations, we are in duty bound to take such steps, both as regards the sacrifice of revenue and demand on the services of the sons of Australia, as are necessary to provide for our adequate sea defence, irrespective of all other considerations. These are all the matters with which I propose to deal at the present time. There, will be ample opportunity for me to touch upon other questions later on. But, as no policy has been put before us of a character which can commend' itself to a democratic community like that of Australia, which desires progress and will not countenance a policy of retrogression, I have a duty to perform before I resume my seat. This is a young Parliament and a young country- a country endowed with an abundance of latent wealth, and one which only needs a lead. Had Governments like the present occupied the Treasury benches in the past, we should have had nothing in the nature of development and nothing of a national character. For these reasons, aud also in view of the fact that the policy outlined by the M in istry is not in accordance with the pledges made by them, I beg to move That the following words be added to the proposed Address :-But regret your Advisers1. propose to destroy the beneficial character of our social ""and industrial laws; 2. indicate no intention of taking such steps as will reduce the high cost of living ; and 3. fail lo realise the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff.""",33

I presume that there will be a debate upon the amendment, and if we were only granted an extension of the principle underlying my honourable friend's suggestion, we could secure agreement upon all points. There is one matter that I should like to mention, namely, that I think this Commonwealth is largely the host of a party which is about to visit this country from oversea, where a number of Australians were hospitably entertained some time ago. In these circumstances, I think that au arrangement might be made whereby we could show our visitors that hospitality which we should like to extend to them, and with that end in view I would suggest that an equal number of honourable members from both parties in this House might be relieved from their attendance here. It seems to me that that would meet the case as far as it is practicable to meet it .",34

296,Mr FRAZER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Seeing the precarious position which the Prime Minister occupies, I withdraw the remark. Probably the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs will tell me why, in a place like K a l goorlie, where there is no other calling to which they can tur n their hands, 200 or 250 men have been thrown out of their employment ? This question of providing rolling-stock in order to enable the rails to be laid on the earthwork which has already been prepared is a very serious one."" The earthwork at the Kalgoorlie end of the trans-Australian railway has been completed for a distance of 60 miles; but the rails have been laid for less than 10 miles. It has been found impossible to convey the rails further on the trolleys which have hitherto been used, and which have had to be drawn by horses. The necessity of providing waggons to convey rails to the head of the road is a very pressing one, and is a matter of urgent importance to the men who have been employed upon the work. I do say that an explanation should be forthcoming as to why rolling-stock is overdue in connection with the contract which was let Bome time ago to a Sydney firm. If that explanation be, not satisfactory, the firm in question should be compelled to fulfil their obligations or to pay the penalty.",35

305,Mr FRAZER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs is devoting his time to the investigation of the undertakings of one of my late colleagues, but it would be better if he gave his attention to seeing that these people are compelled to f u l fil their contract, or pay a penalty for not doing so.",36
306,Mr HOWE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Dalley) [5.12] - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has given me a line. I have already asked the Government why it has taken certain action in regard to the Fitzroy Dock. The . Prime Minister has attacked the Administration of the Fisher Government, saying that, in taking over the Fitzroy Dock, it did something wrong. I have called for the papers, and I wish to know whether the Prime Minister has in his possession evidence which justifies his charge that the Fisher Government spent £800,000 wrongfully in taking over property that was not worth that amount of money? Can he justify his statement? If not, why did he make it ? The present Government have sent officials to make au examination of the boilers in the establishment. They have sent an officer to the Dock, and the result has been to throw the whole place into a state of disorder. The honourable member for K a l goorlie has referred to a matter affecting 100 or 200 persons; but the matter about which I am speaking affects, perhaps, 1,200 persons. A great number of men have been thrown out of employment for a week or a fortnight by this Administration's lack of ability to control the officers under it . A property has been honourable taken over, valued at between £700,000 and £800,000, and the Government, before it has had time to obtain information as to the real value of the property, or to know the officers under its control, has dismissed a number of the Dock employees. The Prime Minister has made most pronounced charges against the late Administration. I wish to know why a close investigation into the condition of affairs at Cockatoo Island was not made before thousands of men were thrown out of work? Mr Julius never examined a boiler at the Dock, but on his report the Government is closing the establishment. Men of technical training, instead of doing that, would have taken out the boilers two at a time, replacing those that were good, and discarding those that were bad. But this Government, on the mere report of Mr . Julius, has closed down the whole place. There is something needing reform in administration like that. I ask, first, that Mr Julius' report be laid upon the table; and, secondly, that the Minister of Defence shall get the Dock into perfect working order. If this cannot be done, the Government is ineffective for its work, and the sooner it goes out the better.",36
307,Mr SHARPE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oxley) [5.18] - I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if it is true that men in the Construction Branch of his Department in Queensland are to have their wages reduced by a shilling a day. A statement has been made that the Minister has given in structions that that reduction shall take place, but no reason for it has been given. I understand that there has been' no similar reduction in any of the other States. The men feel that they are being deprived of money to which they are justly entitled. It is not known whether the step has been taken for some political purpose, but that is the feeling in Queensland. The men, previous to the reduction, were receiving - only the wages paid in the other States, and it is difficult, therefore, to know why the reduction should be made. I hope that the Postmaster-General will give their case consideration, and I am sure that after making full inquiries he will direct .that they shall receive what they were getting up to the beginning of last month. I trust that he will deal rously with them.  men waited on me in Brisbane, saying that they had been told that they were to be discharged, but that those who applied, would be re-engaged next day at Is. a day less than they had been receiving. If it is the policy of the Cook Government to reduce wages, the sooner the country knows it the better. once saw the Deputy. Postmaster-General for the State, who said that he could give me no information publicly, and suggested that I should wire to Melbourne. I sent a telegram to the Postmaster-General, asking whether it was a Ministerial instruction that the wages of these men should be reduced by Is. a day, but a more Jesuitical reply than that which was returned I have never received since I have been in Parliament. The Pestmaster-General did not answer my question, but fenced it like an old warrior. Knowing him as I do, I feel sure that the reply was dictated by an official, but having signed it , the M in - reduced. ister is responsible, and he it is whom I am attacking. I ask him now, if he were receiving only 9s. a day with which to keep a home over his head, maintain his wife, and bring up five children, paying 16s. a week for rent, he would like to have his wages reduced by Is. a day, or 6s. a week. I did not expect a levelling down of wages by the Prime Minister, whose vote in this Chamber has always been given for a levelling up, and I ask the Postmaster-General in all seriousness if he intends to do this paltry thing. He is robbing these labouring men of Is. a day, which they have been receiving for the last eighteen months. It is of no use to fence the question. Directly the new Government came in , the wages of these men were reduced by Is. a day. I appeal to the Government to restore to these men the Is. per day that has been taken from them, so that they may not go down to posterity as a M i nistry who took Is. a day off the wages of the lower paid meu, while the highly paid officials-the curled darlings of the service-were left by them untouched. No one knows better thau <dnes the Prime Minister what Is. a day means to a working man, and this taking of Is. a day from the wages of working men is the last act of which I thought he would ever be guilty.",36
308,Mr AGAR WYNNE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Balaclavagene- Postmaster-General) [5.26] - I shall do my best to answer the questions raised by the two honourable members who last addressed the House. I was informed by the Secretary of the Department that advices had been received from Queensland that a departmental officer had made a mistake in placing certain men in a class different from that in which they had previously been employed. It had I at been the practice to pay 8s. a day to linesmen and 9s. a day to another class of workers. ,37
309,Mr AGAR WYNNE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was advised from Queensland that a local officer had paid 9s. per day to those who were entitled to receive only 8s. per day, and that this was upsetting all the arrangements. My reply was, "" Let the men finish the job on which they are engaged without suffering any reduction at all. Pay every man who is now engaged 9s. per day, but when you start other work keep to the scale that was fixed."" Thus no man was  man was told one night to knock off, and to start again on the following day at 8s. per day.",37
310,Mr AGAR WYNNE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I directed that these men should continue to receive 9s. per day until they had completed the work on which they were engaged, and every man was paid at that rate, I believe, until the job was completed.",37
311,Mr HIGGS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Capricornia) [5.28] - I have never kuown the Prime Minister to do anything in this House to increase the rates of wages of the men in , at all events, the lower grades of the service; but I have certainly heard him talk about the matter. The only time when he did anything in the interests of the poorerpaid classes was when he was leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, but since he has joined the capitalistic section of the community-sinc e he is the leader of the capitalistic section of this House-w e cannot expect .from him anything else than an order to reduce the wages of workers by Is. per day where ever that can be done. We shall have, however, another opportunity to consider the honourable member's attitude towards the working classes of Australia. I rose more particularly, Mr Speaker, to ask you to reconsider the question raised today as to the publication in Hansard of questions that are asked, but not answered, in the House. You stated, sir, that it was the practice not to report any question which a Minister refused to answer. I have never known an occasion",37
312,Mr SPEAKER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order !,38
313,Mr HIGGS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope, sir, that you will not think that I desire to offer you any affront, or to question your ruling, but I trust that you will reconsider the matter, since 1 veuture to think that there has been a mistake. I believe that it is the practice not to record any interjection to which the honourable member addressing the House does not reply. think, is perfectly fair. But the present Prime Minister said in this House, not long ago, when, as Leader of the Opposition, he was referring to a MinisterTlie honourable gentleman seems to think that it is a proper Ministerial attitude to flout the House and tell honourable members that he will not give any information such as has been asked for. I have never known any such attitude taken up by a responsible Minister in any Parliament with which T have had to do.",38
314,Mr JH CATTS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who made that statement ?,38
315,Mr HIGGS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The present Minister. That was his view when sitting in Opposition. I think you will recognise, Mr Speaker, the disadvantage under which honourable members will labour if questions which are asked in this House, and which ought to be reported, are not recorded in Hansard, merely because the Ministers to whom they are addressed refuse to answer them. I ask you with great respect to consider the question, and to ascertain whether a mistake has not been made by confusing the practice in regard to interjections that are unwelcome to a speaker, and which are not reported, with that in regard to questions addressed to a Minister, and which that Minister may, discourteously or otherwise, refuse to answer.",38
316,Mr JH CATTS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Cook) [5.32] - I Wish to add my protest to that which has been made against the practice of leaving out of Hansard a record of somethiug that transpires in the House. Yesterday 1 asked a series of questions in regard to the electoral inquiry. A number of those questions were answered, but one, which the Miuister did not answer, was omitted from the Hansard report of the proceedings, so that the sequence of these questions was interfered with. The report, therefore, is not a true record of what transpired. I found when I received my proof this morning that this one nuestion had been left out, although its omission interfered with the sense of the other questions. I submit, Mr . Speaker, that when a series of questions is addressed to a Minister we do not get a true record of what transpires if one of that series is not recorded in Hansard merely because it is not answered. If an awkward question is asked, and a Minister declines to answer it, there is no record of it. It seems to me that that is an altogether anomalous position. I have That, I consulted the ex-Speaker, and understand from him that he was not aware that the practice of eliminating from Hansard questions that are unanswered was being followed.",38
317,Mr BAMFORD,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are not eliminated, because they are never inserted.",38
318,Mr JH CATTS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are eliminated from the records.,38
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,That has always been the practice.,38
320,Mr JH CATTS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I noticed a Prime Hansard reporter today taking a note of every one of the questions asked. It is apparent, therefore, that a record is taken, but that a question, if . not answered, is left out of the Hansard report. Sir JOHN .FORREST - The rule has been to leave out of the report a question to which no reply is made. Mr J. II . CATTS - Then if I ask the right honourable member a question which he does not like- a question as to his attitude towards the Governor of the Bank, or as to using political influence with the Governor of the Bank-h e has only to refuse to answer it , and there is no record of it?",38
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Certainly ; that has always been the rule.,38
322,Mr JH CATTS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it is within the power of some person to prevent a full report of the proceedings of this House being recorded, and going before the country, the rule is a very bad one. As to the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley, I wish to add my protest against the discharge of a very large number of workmen from the F it zroy Dock, owing, it now transpires, to a mistake on the part of the Government. The present Administration has done what I have never known to be done by any other Government. As soon as they took office each member of the Ministry went about like the man with the muck-rake in Pilgrim's Progress, raking over every little matter in the various Departments in the hope that the attitude of his political opponents, might be placed before the country in an unfavorable light. In pursuance of this muck-rake policy it appears that agents of the Government went to the Fitzroy Dock to see if they could not find there something about which they could make a noise. The statement went forth that a number of boilers in use there were a danger to the persons employed at the dock. The statement appeared to be ridiculous on the face of it .",39
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,A gents of which Government ?,39
324,Mr JH CATTS,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of the honourable gentleman's Government. It was stated that these boilers were unfit for use, but we know that the boilers in all these large establishments are tested periodically. In the circumstances, it was simply a lot of nonsense to say that a competent manager in charge of the great works at Cockatoo Island would allow boilers to be used that were likely to burst and blow the whole place up. One of the members' of the Government wired over to stop the works. They were precipitately stopped, and a number of the men were, if not permanently sacked, suspended from their work. Almost immediately it was discovered that a huge blunder had been made. Nothing wrong could be found, and an attempt has been made to start the works again. The men suspended from work were paid for two days they lost, and, as a result of the blunder made by the Government, a large number of men have been paid two days' wages for which the Commonwealth has received no return. The honourable member who represents the district has stated that as a result of the action taken the work of an establishment in which 1,200 men were employed was interrupted, and he informs me that 400 of these men are now out of work. They are not being paid, whilst the members of the Government go round scandal-seeking in the different Departments to see if they can discover something upon which they may base a complaint against the late Government. This is only political engineering on their part. Only today we found the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs anxious to charge his predecessor with some derelicton of duty because an officer of the Department has commenced the erection of a building at the Federal Capital out of its proper alignment. One would suppose that it was the duty of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs to go to the Federal Capital to determine the exact spot on which the building was to be erected, and drive in the pegs himself. The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs knows perfectly well that the Minister has nothing to do with the alignment of public buildings. He has responsible and wellpaid officers, whose duty it is to transact such business. Yet, in order to blacken and misrepresent political opponents, it was suggested here this afternoon that the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, in his official capacity, was in some measure responsible for the improper alignment of the building referred to. If there are officers in our Departments who, by their carelessness, leave Ministers open to charges of that kind, it is clear that they are unfit for their position. We should know who they are, and the extent of the dereliction of their duty. In connection with the reduction of wages at Brisbane, I wish to add my protest against the course which - has been taken there. I understood from the present Prime Minister, when on this side, that he would take advantage of every opportunity afforded him to improve wages and conditions. It is true that all I know of the honourable gentleman in that regard is what he has said. I do not know of anything which her has done in that direction. I know that when he was Postmaster-General of New South Wales very low wages ruled in the Department. I know that the wages have been considerably in creased since Federation, and particularly from the time the Labour Government took charge of the Post Office. I hope the protest made here this afternoon will lead to a correction of the policy of the Government in reducing wages, and that we shall have some evidence chat the Prime Minister is prepared to carry out the views he expressed wheu in Opposition with regard to the improvement of wages and conditions of public servants. The honourable gentleman has the opportunity afforded him now, and I hope we shall see the reductions of wages stopped, and the honourable gentleman's expressed desire for the improvement of wages and conditions given effect to. Mr JOSE PH COOK fParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [5.40] - I have listened to a series of speeches on the motion for the adjournment that are quite unusual after a motion of censure upon the Government has been moved.

To begin with , there was scarcely one statement made that is true. Scarcely a correct statement has been made throughout the discussion. But if they were all true, what do they mean? They mean that we are doing our best to cure the radical defects of administration left us by our predecessors. They mean that we are trying to overtake the acts of maladministration and of rightdown administrative inefficiency of those who were formerly in charge of the Public Departments.",40

337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is an excellent judge of dirt. Take the case of the Kalgoorlie railway trucks. Who let the contract for those waggons ? We did not. Our predecessors did. Who began to make this railway before they were ready to make it? Who have been dragging rails and sleepers JO miles on a cart with all sorts of up-todate machinery to do this business lying idle? Whose is the fault? Is it ours? It is the fault of those men who went before us; but f t seems we are to be blamed for all this Ministerial ineptitude.,40
338,Mr FRAZER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"You should keep the contractors up to their dates. Mr JOSE PH COOK - We have never failed to do anything with the contractors to date that we should have done. The honourable member asks for details. He can have them all, and he will find that every fact reflects on our predecessors. We have nothing to do with the matter except to make the best of the trouble they have left.",40
339,Mr FRAZER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I ask you to see that the contractors to whom those contracts were let by the previous Government are made to keep to the terms of their contracts.,40
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member know of anything under the sun which will make a contractor deliver a waggon when he has not it made ? There is only one thing to do, and that is to visit on him the penalties provided for in the bond.",40
341,Mr HOWE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear; do it . Mr JOSE PH COOK - Who says we are not going to do it? It does not help the trouble that exists; it does not interfere with it in any way. This talk of waggons is all behind the mark, and should have been addressed to the honourable member's own Cabinet many months ago. We deeply regret that through the actions of our predecessors in not getting preparations forward, these men have to be thrown out of work, but do not taunt us; let honourable members taunt themselves and their inefficient administration.",40
342,Mr FRAZER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not taunt the honourable member.,41
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is time for a little bit of straight speaking over these things. Honourable members opposite have had it all so far. Now I come to the Dock-this precious Dock. We are told we have sent agents there to make mischief, the result of which is to throw hundreds - out of work. A more infamous statement never came out of the mouth of any individual. It is not true.",41
344,Mr FRAZER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the Prime Minister justified in saying that a statement made by an honourable member of the He use is not true?,41
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I withdraw it . I say the statements are absolutely incorrect. The fact is that the previous Government appointed engineers to investigate the machinery at the Dock-no t our agents-thei r own agents, the specially qualified and specially paid agents of the previous Government.",41
346,Mr HOWE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are men of large ability. Mr JOSE PH COOK - They were employed by the previous Government, and they are not the agents of this Government, specially appointed to make mischief. One man reports that out of ten boilers, five were dangerous, and that as to one of them the sixteenth of an inch was standing between the men and heaven.",41
347,Mr HOWE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,There were two engineers. Tell me who the man was?,41
348,Mr SPEAKER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order 1 The honourable member has already spoken. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The boilers that are kept going are kept going at reduced pressure in order to keep the men at work.,41
349,Mr HOWE,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I want you to mention the name of the man you are quoting.,41
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will try to get the honourable member the name. These reports have been made, not on our initiation, but on the initiation of the previous Government. They showed that the boilers were dangerous, and, for the safety of the men, the Naval Board, on the strength of these reports, advised the Minister to close them down u n t i l they were repaired. I will give the honourable member all the information he wants. He need not bandy words. He shall have all the papers, and all the facts. And when he gets them he will uot like them. In the other case, they will prove that all this kind of thing has been going on, that the men have been working at the imminent danger of their lives, under the administration of our predecessors. I think it is going beyond the length of fair debate when honourable members make these reckless statements that we appointed agents to go to the Dock in order to stir up trouble.",41
351,Mr FENTON,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member does not know who made the report.,41
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was said that we had appointed agents to make trouble in the Dock. That is the only statement. I am combating, and I say that what has occurred in the Dock has occurred in consequence of a report by an officer appointed by our predecessors. That officer reported to the Minister, and the Naval Board, on the strength of the report, advised the Minister as to the course of procedure. That course has been followed in all cases.",41
353,Mr FENTON,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Are you "" stonew all in g "" your own motion?",41
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it ""stonewalling "" to let a little light in on these scandalous statements of yours?",41
355,Mr FENTON,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I made no speech on this particular item that the Prime Minister is talking of. I ask that the honourable member be called on to withdraw his statement.,41
356,Mr SPEAKER,MEN ON KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt the honourable member will withdraw it ; but many of these statements are invited by disorderly interjections. I have repeatedly appealed for order, and I ask honourable members, if they object to such statements when they are made, not to provoke them by their own disorderly interjections. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I withdraw my statement. We are doing our best to repair these difficulties, and to purchase new boilers, and to get these works going to the fullest capacity, and we are doing it with only one eud in view-to get forward the work already in course of construction, to get forward those ships which are years overdue, and to keep the men in employment to the fullest possible extent. But when responsible officers say that it U dangerous for men to work, the honourable member must not expect us, for the purpose of keeping them in work, to jeopardize their lives. We will not take that responsibility. Anything that will remedy these defects shall be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. Every effort is being made to repair the troubles which have been shown to exist at the Dock, and I hope it may soon be that all these men will be at work again, and under the best possible conditions. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.55 p.m.",41
