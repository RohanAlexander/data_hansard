1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir William Aston) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. DEATH OF MR JAMES REAY FRASER,",14
2,Mr GORTON,Unknown," Mr Speaker, it is with deep regret that I have to advise the House of the death in April 1970 of Mr Jim Fraser, member for the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Fraser was born in Derby, Tasmania, on 8 th February 1908. From 1927 to 1935 he was a teacher with the Victorian Education Department and in 1935 he took up journalism in New South Wales. In 1941 he enlisted in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, served in New Guinea from 1942 to 1943, and with the Public Rc'.itions Field Unit from 1944 to 1945. He was discharged with the rank of sergeant in March 1946. Mr Fraser then joined the Department of the Interior and worked there until he became public relations officer for the Minister for Health in 1948. In 1949 he was appointed private secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and he was also during that time a member of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council. In 1951 he was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for the Australian Capital Territory and he remained the member for this Territory for 19 years up to the time of his death. In the House he served on a number of committees and was vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. During the time Mr Fraser was a member he won a well deserved reputation as a dedicated helper of the citizens of Canberra. He filled the role not only of a member of Parliament but also, as it were, of an ombudsman. He took up the cause of all who he felt had not been treated justly by officialdom and indeed he devoted himself to helping the citizens of Canberra as his major task as a parliamentarian. He, I believe, prevented injustice. He helped people to meet with those officials who could best deal with any problems which they had. The regard in which he was held 13667/70-«-I30i by the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory was demonstrated when his funeral took place. Sir, I feel that I have personally lost a friend. We lived not far from each other in Narrabundah and on many occasions stood on the same platform, when I was the Minister for Education and Science, at functions throughout the Australian Capital M.P. Territory. I knew him reasonably well and I know that there was no meanness or pettiness or spite anywhere about him. Though he was prepared to fight for what he thought was right he was not prepared to bear malice. He will be sadly missed by members of this House. Our sympathy goes to his wife, his son and his family, including his brother, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 1st April 1970 of James Reay Fraser. a member of the House for the Australian Capital Territory, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",14
3,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown," I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and on behalf of my Party express appreciation of what he said about our colleague. Jim Fraser was above all a representative. Probably no member of this House of Representatives took his title so literally, was so single-mindedly the representative of the people who elected him, which certainly does not mean merely the people who voted for him. Partly this was due to the nature of his position. He was not only member of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory but also he had to act as Canberra's mayor, senator and ombudsman. Even more, it was in his character, and part of his nature, to believe that the problems of the people-hi s people-were his own. He accepted that role enthusiastically, with all the burdens and all the frustrations it involved. The task involved was enormous. In a city of officials he was the only elected one. In population it had become the largest electorate in Australia. It had the highest proportion of children. There can be no doubt about the response of the people of this city and his rapport with them. My own parents, like thousands of citizens of this Territory, had utter faith in Jim Fraser as a fellow citizen and a representative. It would be proof enough to refer to the remarkable vote he achieved in the last election, but more humanly and more movingly there was the remarkable display al his funeral last Friday by the people of this city by all sections of this community-sometime s thought to be the most reserved and restrained in Australia. This is a city accustomed to great events and great personages, but it kept its warmest, most affectionate and most spontaneous expression of respect for me of its own.lim Fraser. This was a refutation of the cynical assessment often made of the role which can be filled by elected persons and of the altitude which can be shown by the people to them. It was sometimes asserted that Jim Fraser was exclusively a local man. It should not be forgotten, however, that he had the most international, cosmopolitan constituency of any of us. Those of us who have travelled abroad officially will remember that in embassies around the world, wherever Australian diplomats and attaches are posted, affectionate regard would be sent through us to their local member. In the most official, affluent, sophisticated community in Australia there is the greatest need for an unaffected and accessible spokesman, mediator and advocate. Jim Fraser filled all those roles splendidly. I believe we in this House would know how much he owed to the precedent set, not least in Canberra, by his brother, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser) and his devotion to all matters affecting the rights of the citizens. Jim Fraser understood, ns the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory must above all, the workings of government. He deeply respected the people who administer the business of government. Witnesses who appeared before him on the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory all testify to his fairness, his tesy and his comprehension. I can say for myself- I believe I can say for each member here, and above all for thousands and thousands of people in this great cityhe was my friend, faithful and just to me.",14
4,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown," I desire to associate the parliamentary members of the Australian Country Party with the motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and seconded and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). I join with the members of my Party in the tributes that have been paid by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition to the late Jim Fraser. He was indeed a most honourable and a most respected man. I suppose if any of us sought a tribute nothing could be higher than to have it said that one is honourable and respected in the judgment of one's fellows. This was the judgment of Jim Fraser by all parliamentarians and certainly by the community that he represented and served. His most outstanding characterstic as a parliamentarian was his complete and single minded devotion to the interests of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. As I saw Jim Fraser over the years, his thoughts, first, second and last, were for the people whom he represented in this great city and he represented them during a period of quite dramatic development. I have ascertained that when he was elected in 1951 the population of the Australian Capital Territory was some 25,000 people and now it is more than 120,000 people. He gave the most complete satisfaction as a representative to the people of Canberra during that period. The community demonstrated on two quite recent occasions the great respect and affection in which Jim Fraser was held. His immense majority in the recent general election was itself evidence of this and the tremendous tribute that was paid to him by people of this city on the occasion of his funeral was the second great manifestation of this respect and affection. As has been said he was a kindly man. He was a completely trustworthy man. There was nothing petty about him at all. I am sure that Jim Fraser will be missed by the Parliament. He was a strong and good man. I join the members of the Australian cour- Country Party in this tribute to him and extend the sympathies of my colleagues to Mrs Fraser, her son and Jim Fraser's brother, our colleague Allan Fraser.",15
5,Mr STEWART,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I had a deep admiration for the late Jim Fraser as a friend, as a colleague in Caucus, as a husband and as a father. Jim Fraser surpassed in each of these aspects of life the rigorous standards that should be imposed on all men. It was in Caucus for 17 years that I knew him best. We were together in some turbulent times but in all those times Jim Fraser exhibited the same excellent qualities of character that he exhibited everywhere else that he moved. He was a man of independent and determined thoughts. His decisions were made after thorough consideration and having made them he was never swayed by any type of pressure. He stood straight against any odds. He was beholden to no man; yet was a man of extreme good will. He expressed all his opinions openly and forthrightly and granted the same privilege to those of different thoughts. He was a true Labor man as his parliamentary life has shown. To Mrs Fraser, his son Andrew, his brother Allan and other members of the family I express my deepest and sincerest sympathy. I will miss him as a friend and colleague in Caucus. I earnestly pray: Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord. May perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace.",15
6,Mr NIXON,Unknown," I would like to add my tribute to that of other honourable members who have spoken. As Minister for the Interior I came into constant contact with Jim Fraser over the many problems affecting the people of the Australian Capital Territory. He exhibited a humaneness, an interest, a patience, a real understanding and genuine concern for people and for their worries. He achieved a great deal for individuals and for families in Canberra. When it was not possible to obtain satisfaction for a constituent he did not just blame the department or the Government but would patiently explain the reasons to his constituent until that person had a proper understanding. This honesty won the respect of the officers of my Department and the public of Canberra. Jim Fraser had a real understanding of the difficulties of administration but at the same time fought with zeal to uphold the rights of individuals and was tireless in his endeavours. He brought to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory an invaluable local knowledge. He affection served the people of Canberra and their Parliament with distinction. It was for all these reasons, and for many others, that a mass of people turned up at the funeral service and lined the roadway to pay a last tribute to Jim Fraser. For my part, I enjoyed a rare understanding and friendship with him. I join with other honourable members in extending sympathy to Mrs Fraser and Andrew, to Allan and to the rest of the family in their great loss.",16
7,Mr FOX,Unknown," I would like to join with other honourable members who have paid a tribute to the late Jim Fraser. As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I knew him well and 1 greatly admired not only his capacity for work but also the diligence with which he applied himself to representing his constituents, both inside this House and outside it. I believe that it can be said of most members of this House that they are clearly identified in the minds of the public with either a particular subject or subjects or with the political parties to which they belong, or both. But it can truly be said of Jim Fraser that he was identified with his electorate. He was Mr Canberra. I am quite sure that a great many people who reside in the Australian Capital Territory were not aware of his political affiliations but knew that if they had a problem Jim Fraser was the man to see. The thousands of people who attended either the service at St Andrews or at the cemetery, or who lined the road to the cemetery, were there to pay their respects not to an office but to a person-the late Jim Fraser. I think if it can ever be said of any member of Parliament that he resided in the hearts of his electors it can be said of Jim Fraser. He will be missed by a great many people in all walks of life and in all sections of the community. I would like to extend to his widow, his son, his brother and the other members of his family my very deep sympathy.",16
8,Mr ALLAN FRASER,Unknown,"Eden-Monaro)Mr Speaker, the extent of the respect and shown for my brother and the honour accorded to him in death is deeply appreciated by all his family. It is a source of much comfort to his wife, Helen, and it will be a source of much pride to his son, Andrew, as he grows to manhood to realise the high regard in which his father was held. No-one close to Jim could be unmoved by the tributes paid to him here this afternoon and I know that Helen is grateful for them and grateful for every act of courtesy and consideration shown both during his illness and since. I carried to Jim in hospital many messages from colleagues on both sides of this chamber and I would like honourable members to know that he was glad to get each of these messages-h e quite valued them. He knew that his illness was mortal and he had known that since the morning after the exploratory operation. He continued to take a keen and cheerful interest in parliamentary doings. He laughed and joked with those around him and it is simple fact to say that no-one heard from him one word of grumbling or self-pity at his fate. As has been said, Jim will be missed for many reasons in this chamber. An incidental thing which 1 recall now is his gift of repartee and his well-timed and often humorous interjections. In this respect-and it may be that I am coloured by brotherly pride- T think he ranked with Frank Anstey and Frank Brennan who were remarkable figures in this Parliament in the days of my youth. I cannot add anything further to what has been so generously and adequately said this afternoon. I thank the House for the references in which I have been included. We have been the only brothers ever to sit together in this House and we have been very close to each other. J remember Jim as an able parliamentarian, as a man whose life was to help others and, if the House will permit me to say so, as a wonderful brother. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Mr Gorton- I suggest that as a mark respect to the late Mr Jim Fraser the sitting be suspended until 8 p.m.",16
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I feel sure that the gestion made by the Prime Minister meets with the concurrence of the House.,17
10,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 2.52 to 8 p.m. NA Kangaroos Mr Calwell presented from certain residents of the State of Victoria a petition showing that the red kangaroo and many other marsupials have been depleted by the effects of uncontrolled shooting for commercial purposes; their numbers have dropped to a numerical level which leaves their survival in doubt; no laws are adequate to protect these animals, in such a vast country. Only a uniform law, and a complete cessation of killing for commercial purposes, can assure the survival of the kangaroo. The petitioners pray that the export of all kangaroo products be banned immediately, and the Commonwealth Government makes a serious appraisal of its responsibility in this urgent matter. Mr Calwell- I agree 100% with what the petition says. Petition received and read. War Service Homes Mr LUCHETTI presented from electors in the State of New South Wales a petition showing that ex-servicewomen who enlisted during World War II have been discriminated against in the interpretation and administration of the War Services Homes Act 1918-1962. Whilst cm enlistment they were prepared to serve in any area, exservicewomen who did not actually serve outside Australia are at present debarred from war service homes rights. The petitioners pray that immediate action be taken to grant war service homes rights to all wartime ex-servicewomen. Petition received and read. NA",17
11,Mr GORTON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of left Australia on 30th March to visit Vietnam and the United States. In Saigon he bas had discussions with senior leaders of the South Vietnamese Government and sugwith Vietnamese, United States and Australian officials and Service commanders. On 4th April Mr Fraser arrived in Washington to have discussions with the Secretary of Defence, Mr Laird, on aspects of the F111 projects and contracts. Mr Fraser is expected to return to AusI tralia on 14th April and during his absence the Postmaster-General (Mr Hulme) is seek acting as Minister for Defence and will represent the Minister for Supply in this House. I also wish to inform the House that the Treasurer (Mr Bury) left Australia on 5th April for Korea and Japan. He will be attending the third annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Developseveral ment Bank in Seoul and will also have discussions in Tokyo with the Japanese Minister of Finance. The Treasurer is expected to return to Australia on 1 Sth April and during Mr Bury's absence I shall be acting as Treasurer. NA",17
12,Mr WEBB,ROYAL VISIT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he know that the Australian Broadcasting Commission and other news sources are referring to the visit of the Royal family as 'the Royal of Australia'? Would he agree that as tour does not include one-third of the continent, namely Western Australia, it is hardly a tour of Australia? As the Royal family is spending about 5 weeks in Ausduring tralia, mainly in New South Wales and Victoria, would he even at this late stage try to get the Royal family to go to Western Australia even for a short visit?",18
13,Mr GORTON,ROYAL VISIT,"I think it is not inapprosaid, priate to describe the tour as a tour of Ausbeen spent. tralia though it could not be described as a tour of the whole of Australia. I would agree with that part of what the honourable ago. member says. I think the honourable member and the House generally will understand the calls that are made upon the Royal family on a tour of this kind and that, though they may well like to attend every part of Australia, it is in the time able to make available impossible for them to do so, and their wishes and the requirements of the Royal tour director must be taken into account in this respect. I think I should point out that the Royal family is visiting, not only New South Wales and Victoria, but also Queensland and Tasthese mania. I am sure that they would regret, we would regret, that they are unable to visit Western Australia on this occasion, but trust that the honourable member will understand the reasons for this and will not to level any criticism as a result of it. NA",18
14,Sir JOHN CRAMER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Is the Prime Minister aware that the allocation of funds for loans to ex-servicemen for the purchase of homes for the current year has been exhausted? Is he also aware that there are hundred applications for loans which have been approved and that contracts for the purchase of homes have been entered into but that no money is available? The Prime Minister will realise that if these are facts a great number of ex-servicemen will be placed in the position that they will have to borrow bridging finance at excessively high rates of interest to complete their transactions while they are awaiting the availability of their loan from the War Service Homes Division. Will the Prime Minister consider making available an immediate special grant to the War tour Service Homes Division to enable it to the complete the transactions referred to?,18
15,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"In reply to the first part of the question, yes, I am aware that the funds available for war service homes thisfinancial*year have now been spent. I might point out to the House that during this financial year the Government made available for war service homes a sum of $55m, which is $5m more than the year before. As the honourable member this increased amount has already",18
16,Mr WHITLAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,It was over $70m 10 years,18
17,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,I hear some petulant interjections.,18
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Mr Lucock)Order! The Leader of the Opposition will they are cease interjecting at the table.,18
19,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"In reply to the second part of the question, I am aware that there are some hundreds of applicants who have applications for loans for the purchase of existing buildings-existin g houses-and are distinct from applicants for loans as for the building of houses. There are some hundreds of these, and as a result of the money voted having been exhausted these applicants who normally would have received the loans for which they have applied in May or June will have to wait until July in order to receive their loans. Mr Stewart-Vietna m veterans are being knocked back.",18
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Order ! There are too many interjections. The House will come to order. Question time is a time for members to ask questions of Ministers, and when the Ministers are replying to those questions I would expect the House to come to order so that the member who asked a mail. question and others interested in the matter might be able to hear the Minister's reply.",19
21,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"As 1 was pointing out, the result of this is that those who have applications to buy existing buildings and who would normally have received their loans in May or June will now have to wait until July. T would suggest that it is likely to lead to any significant requirenear ment for bridging finance-this delay some 6 or 8 weeks. I would like to add to that that those who are applicants for loans for building their own houses, as distinct from buying existing buildings, will not any way be affected by the matter which terms? the honourable member has raised.

24,Mr SHERRY,POSTAL SERVICES,"I intend to do precisely that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask the Postmaster-General: Is this document prepared and distributed by a disloyal, hostile regime in open rebellion against Her Majesty the Queen whom we are soon to welcome in this national capital?",19
25,Mr HULME,POSTAL SERVICES,"I am not aware of the document to which the honourable member refers. The Post Office does not have a view in relation to articles which are placed in the mail, provided they are in conformily with the regulations of the Post and Telegraph Act. The only discrimination which the Post Office is allowed in this connection is in relation to articles which are blasphemous, indecent, etc. I do not know the precise wording of the legislation. Honourable members should appreciate that the Post Office, unless it is suspicious that this type of material is going through the mail, has no right whatever to open the NA",19
26,Dr MACKAY,FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS,My question is addressed to the Minister for External Affairs. No doubt the Minister has seen reports that the French Government plans to resume the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmounsphere at its test site near Tahiti in the future. I ask: What is the potential of danger of this action to Australia and other countries? Will' the Minister ensure that the Australian Government's concern at this regrettable step is conveyed to the in appropriate French authorities in suitable,19
27,Mr MCMAHON,FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS,"Recently the Australian Government was advised that the French Government had decided continue nuclear tests in the Pacific to area close to Tahiti. We have since advised the French Government officially we object to the tests being carried We did so for two reasons. Firstly we think it is unfortunate that when considerable thought is still being given to a comprehensive nuclear test ban the partial nuclear test ban treaty should be defied. We regard it as a fundamental step towards outlawing the use of nuclear on weapons completely and as a basic step total disarmament, if they can ever be achieved practically. There is a second reason. We believe that the people in the Pacific area are entitled to lead their lives free from the fear of atomic fallout or some sort of harm to their way of living. We are not able to say exactly what kind of test it will be, but we have expressed our very deep regret to the French Government that it should find it necessary to carry out any kind of atmospheric test in this area. We do hope that the French Government will take some notice of our protests and those of other governments. NA NA",19
28,Mr HURFORD,CORPORATION,"The Minister for Trade and Industry will recall that he issued a statement dated 12th February 1970 defending the proposed Industry Development Corporation and that he repeated the information in a second reading speech on the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1970. The right honourable gentleman drew an analogy between EPIC and the proposed Corporation, pointing out that EPIC had also been attacked as a Socialistic measure but claiming that it was 'a sound business venture'. I ask: Now that the Minister is a convert to Democratic Socialism, is he planning to promote some other government or semi-government institutions? May I draw his attention particularly to the needs relating to other forms of insurance? (Question not answered)",20
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION,"Mr Lucock)I point out to the honourable member for Adelaide that a question must relate to department under the control of the MinisNovember ter to whom the question is addressed. A Minister is not to be asked for an expresanswer sion of opinion or to comment on a hypoand thetical question. Mr MCEwen- I found the question offensive, Mr Deputy Speaker, not obliged to answer offensive questions. NA",20
30,Mr HALLEIT,UNITED KINGDOM RURAL POLICY,I ask the Minister for Trade and Industry a question. I understand that the United Kingdom Government has recently made an annual review of its policy in respect of domestic agricultural support prices. Has the Minister particulars of these new decisions? What significance does he attach to them in relation to AusAboriginals. tralia's trading opportunities in the United Kingdom for its agricultural products?,20
31,Mr MCEWEN,UNITED KINGDOM RURAL POLICY,"Like all other advanced Western countries the United Kingdom has a policy of support for its agricultural industries. It is customary for it to make an annual review of the amount of that support. This review was conducted recently and the results have been announced. I do not carry in my mind the figures for the individual items but there have been substantial increases for nearly every item-for wheat, barley, beef and milk to mention some. I think the price support for beef is more than £Stgll per cwt live weight. Those who are concerned with livestock industries will realise what an extremely high price support this is. Similar provisions have been made for other agricultural and livestock items. I think it would be be;ter if I treated the question as being on notice. I will supply the honourable member and thereby other honourable members with a full and detailed reply to the question. NA",20
32,Mr WHITLAM,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,Has the Attorney General secured approval to introduce a Bill to abolish capital punishment under federal laws? The Minister will recall that-although the Senate passed such a Bill in June 1968 his predecessor had debate on it in this place adjourned indefinitely and he himself fruitthe lessly wrote to the Prime Minister in 1968 to have the debate revived.,20
33,Mr HUGHES,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,I am afraid that the I propose to give to the honourable learned gentleman will not satisfy his thirst for information because I am not in the habit and do not propose to fall into the habit of commenting on rumours and I am circulated in the Press. NA,20
34,Mr BONNETT,ABORIGINALS,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. During the recent conference of the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders League statements in the Press quoted the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, Senator J. Keeffe, as saying that some Federal parliamentarians had been discreetly instructed to divide the Will the Prime Minister order a thorough investigation into the allegations made by the senator? In the interests of the Australian people will the right honourable gentleman endeavour to persuade Senator Keeffe to announce publicly the names of the Federal parliamentarians whom he claims to be involved, as I feel that his statement casts a distinct slur on integrity of every member of this Federal Parliament?",20
35,Mr GORTON,ABORIGINALS,"I do not know quite how question I can order an investigation into an unsupexclusively ported allegation from the Federal Presinewspapers. dent of the Australian Labor Party-a n allegation which has no supporting evidence whatever. Indeed, I would somewhat doubt whether an allegation of that kind from that source ought to be dignified by an inquiry of this kind; but I would, in of the question which the honourable ber has asked, take this opportunity to gest to Senator Keeffe that he might, support of this offensive allegation, put ward publicly any evidence he has and name any members of the Federal Parliafacilities of the ment to whom he is referring. If he does not do that, the Australian public will able to judge the force and veracity of what he has to say. If he does make these things public, and I am sure he will then I would certainly seek to investigate them. A remark from the other side of the chamber suggested that he might be referring to Mr Wentworth, the Minister for Social Services. 1 think most honourable members of this House would agree that he has done more to assist the Aboriginal cause than has any other single member of this Parliament since he has been letters Minister.

36,Mr DUTHIE,POSTAL DEPARTMENT,"I address a question to the Prime Minister in his capacity as ing Treasurer. Is it not a fact that the Treasury, with Government backing, quires the Postmaster-General's to pay interest to it on every dollar that is made available to it by the Government for capital works thus forcing the people to pay twice for postal services? Is this farce to continue? Is it a fact that the Postmaster-General proposes to increase again postal and telephone charges order to meet what is an unnecessary and Government created deficit?",21

We are giving the resolution the closest consideration. in The honourable member may be assured that it meets our full wishes and we wilt do all we can to implement it. NA,21
42,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I address my question to the Minister for Social Services. I preface my question by saying that there is a disparity in the purchasing power of pensions in the Northern Territory compared with their purchasing power in the south, because the recognised cost of living is about one-third higher in the far north than it is in the southern cities and settled areas. I ask: Will the Minister give consideration to my continued representations for a district allowpart ance to offset the northern pensioners' disI advantage?",22
43,Mr WENTWORTH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This is a matter made of policy which will be considered at appropriate time in the Budget context. May I say, however, that it has been the settled policy not only of this Government but also of its predecessors that social vice rates shall be uniform throughout tralia. It is perfectly true that, in areas, particularly the Northern Territory, some costs of living are higher than elsewhere. On the other hand, in a warm climate, as it is up there, certain costs of living are lower. In point of fact, an inquiry was made into this situation and the disparity is not as great as it would be thought to be at first glance, although a disparity does exist. That is all that say on this matter which concerns policy question. and where there is a long established procedure and principle which have been in interest. followed by this Government and set by its predecessors.

44,Mr UREN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"My question, which I address to the Prime Minister, is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Bennelong in regard to war service homes. Tn reply to the honourable gentleman, the Prime Minister said that $50m had been spent on war service homes this year. Is the Prime Minister aware that the report thisfinancialyear of the War Service Homes Division discloses that the income the Government receives from war service homes is in excess of $70m? Is the Prime Minister aware also many Vietnam veterans who have made application for homes have been informed that they must get thefinanceto bridge the gap between their money and the cost of the home and that they are paying from 14% to 20% in interest rates? I ask the Prime Minister: Will he make money available immediately from war service homes revenue or instruct the Commonwealth Bank to make bridging gap loans available to these young men so that they may get a home without suffering the infringement of these exorbitant usurers rates to build a home?",22
45,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Commentin g on the first of the honourable member's question, think, if he casts his mind back, he will recall that I said not that $50m was spent thisfinancialyear but that $55m had been available this financial year as comits pared with SSOm last financial year, an increase of $5m, and that this had been spent. 1 also pointed out to the House that the exhaustion of this sum during this serfinancial year will.

It will have some effect on those seeking to buy existing buildings and the effect, as I have pointed out to the House, will be this: On the information provided to me these applicants-and there drawal are some hundreds of them-woul d foreign normally have received their loans in or June. They will now be required to until July. It is difficult to believe that period of delay of some 6 or 8 weeks would require, in most cases, bridging finance be negotiated or that it would make any significant difference in that period of if this were to happen. VIETNAM MORATORIUM CAMPAIGN itself.",23
59,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"My question is addressed to the Minister for External Affairs. I ask: Is a balanced presentation of Australia's commitment in Vietnam South East Asia important to this country's association with its allies? If so, does Minister view with concern the distorted impression which the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign, heavily organised and influenced by Communists, will project concerning Australia's position? Is this particularly in view of the individual identification so many members of the Australian Labour Party with the proposed Campaign? Finthis ally, is not this concern even more urgent as personal support was assured to the Campaign by the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition at a meeting of unions affiliated with the Queensland Trades and Labour Council held in late February at the Brisbane Trades Hall?",23
60,Mr MCMAHON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"It is critically important to us that there should be a balanced presentation of the Australian point of view in relation to the retention of troops and our ultimate objectives in Vietnam. Our purposes are clear. We are there-as we originally went there-in order to attempt to maintain the freedom and the independence of the peopte of South Vietnam. Opposition members-Oh , no.",23
61,Mr MCMAHON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I am glad that by its reaction the Opposition identifies itself here. obvious reaction illustrates the wide difference that exists between the Opposition and the Government. We are there to protect freedom and decency and the right of those people to look after themselves free from intimidation and from aggression from outside. As to the objectives of the Moratorium Campaign, what is of significance is that it urges the immediate withnot only of Australian troops but of troops and it does not specify that May the foreign troops include the invading wait forces of North Vietnam. So anyone who this participates in this kind of moratorium march, or whatever else it might be, is to therefore, unless, some correction can be made, supporting the forces of aggression time and supporting those who want South Vietnam to be dominated by other countries rather than by the people of the country As to a balanced presentation, 1 believe that other countries will take little or no notice of the moratorium marchers. and By way of illustration I can point to the failure of the moratorium the marchers in the United States of America towards the end of last year. The final march was abandoned because the marchers found that the silent majority were strongly expressing their resentment to so what the left wing minority in that counof try were doing. Consequently, Sir, you are entitled to think they will do the same in country if they get the opportunity to do so. As to the meeting attended by the Leader of the Opposition, I have been informed that he did attend a meeting of the Queensland Trades and Labour Council. It is well known that that Council as distinct from the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council, which the Leader of the Opposition nominally supports, is under strong left wing control. Opposition Members-Oh !",23
62,Mr MCMAHON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Agai n I am glad to see the divisions opening up between the Government and the Opposition because it it some time since we have seen these sharp divisions between the Government and the new found Opposition benchers, who as ye: have not been able to control themselves.",24

66,Mr MCMAHON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,We will see. 1 finish on this note. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition was present at the meeting of the Queensland Trades and Labour Council and there is no doubt that the matter of the moratorium marches was raised. I am informed and I believe it to be true-bu t if it is not true either as to his presence or as to his comments he can deny it. This in itself will be significantthen when the discussion was over Motion (by Mr Uren) negatived: That the Minister be not further heard.,24
67,Mr MCMAHON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have only this to say: The Leader of the Opposition can, he wishes, deny it but he is also asked deny whether he said when this question the moratorium march was completed: ' with you. I go along with you port you.' NA",24
68,Mr WHITLAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,I ask the Prime Minister a question about war service homes.,24

70,Mr WHITLAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he has been advised that this year the War Service Homes Division will receive the record amount in principal repayments and interest payments of over $75m, which is at least $20m more than the amount allocated for expenditure by the Division this year. Does he concede that no more than 7 years ago the amount of expenditure by the Division itself was $75m? If these figures are correct will he make available sufficient of this year's $20m profit from war service homes to ensure that those who want to buy existing houses, whether brand new or old, are able to do so thisfinancialyear?",24
71,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, for a while there I thought that the Leader of the Opposition was going to say something else reverting to what the Minister for External Affairs had asked him to comment on.",24
72,Mr REYNOLDS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,You were mistaken.,24
73,Mr GORTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes , I was mistaken. I concede that. The answer to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is: No, I have not been advised of what the Leader of the Opposition claims to be the fact. Nor do I think it has great relevance to the real fact that during this financial year the amount of money made available for war service homes has been increased by 10% over the amount available for the last financial year and that as a result of this and as a result of the great use that has been made of it there will merely be if the inconvenience of some 6 or 8 weeks to wait for those seeking to buy new homes, of which will not prevent them from buying I am these new homes as is suggested by the and I supLeader of the Opposition. NA",24
74,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH SUPERIOR COURT,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General without very much notice. He will no doubt recall the persuasive reasons advanced by his predecessor when he introduced the Commonwealth Superior Court Bill 1968 on 21st November of that year, which Bill provided for the establishment of a Commonwealth Superior Court. I ask the Attorney-General whether the arguments advanced on that occasion are still valid, whether there is still a need for a Commonwealth Superior Court and, if so, what course he proposes to follow to have such a Court established.",24
75,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH SUPERIOR COURT,"I think I should begin my answer by commending the honourable fact member for his engaging frankness. But to put the matter briefly, this whole question is under my consideration. It is a very large question and I shall make up my mind about this proposal, or about what I may recommend concerning it, in the light of existing circumstances, which are not altogether the same as they were in 1968 when the Bill to which the honourable member refers was introduced. tion does touch a matter of policy and beyond saying it is under my consideration I do not propose to say anything else.",25
76,Mr KEOGH,COMMONWEALTH SUPERIOR COURT,"My question is directed to the Minister for External Affairs. Is he aware that his Department recently issued a backgrounder research paper on Laos in which was included amongst a list of reference books, one entitled 'Mekong Upstream' by W. G. Burchett? Did the Department act with his approval? Is the author of 'Mekong Upstream' the same W. G. Burchett who was recently permitted to enter Australia by his Government? If so, did the Minister or his Department have any discussions with Mr Burchett when he was here on the situation in Laos? Did Mr Burchett give the Government permission for his book to be used as a reference in policy pronounceby ments such as this research paper?",25
77,Mr MCMAHON,COMMONWEALTH SUPERIOR COURT,"I had no contact with Mr Burchett, nor would I ever wish to have any contact with him. So far as my Department is concerned. I read in the newspapers that he was anxious to establish a rapport with the Department and I think if he had established any my Department would have let me know. If he had asked to contact me, I probably would have unwillingly said yes without any kind of enthusiasm whatsoever. As to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, I have not heard anything about the matter he raises. Nonetheless I will make inquiries for him and let him know whether the Department knows any more than he appears to know at present. NA",25
78,Mr JESS,VIETNAM MORATORIUM,"I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question with respect to the Vietnam Moratorium. In view of the that it is publicised that a large number of Federal Labor Party members of Parliament have signed support for the moratorium, as have also a large number of members of the Communist Party of Australia, could he give the reasons why the Trades Hall Council in Victoria, and I believe also those in Tasmania and New South Wales, have repudiated this call? Is it because of the association with the Communist Party? If This quesnot, what are the reasons?",25
79,Dr EVERINGHAM,VIETNAM MORATORIUM,I rise on a point of order. The question refers to a matter not within the competence of the Minister. LAOS Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER- I would suggest that portions of the question come within the ambit of the Minister's Department. The Minister might answer those parts which relate to his Department.,25
80,Mr REYNOLDS,VIETNAM MORATORIUM,I rise on a further point of order. I just seek consistency in the application of the standing orders. How could the Minister possibly purport to know what was in the minds of these people? What right has he to ascribe any motives to them in this respect? This is not a matter within the competence of the Minister and I ask you to rule the question out of order.,25
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VIETNAM MORATORIUM,I have already given a ruling on the point of order raised the honourable member for Capricornia. The Minister may proceed.,25
82,Mr SNEDDEN,VIETNAM MORATORIUM,"In answer to the honourable gentleman's question: It is a fact that an organisation has been established to endeavour to persuade the public of Australia that there is some sort of movement here to protest against Vietnam involvement which is separate and distinct and indigenous to Australia. The truth is, of course, that that movement stems directly from overseas. It has been stimulated without any doubt by Communist manoeuvring. There is no doubt that there are people in Australia seeking to use this force that originates overseas. The great misfortune about it is that there are a number of people in Australia who are thought to be the victims of a propaganda move which will bring them into association with the movement in an attempt to make it appear widespread and to make it appear respectable. Unfortunately, there are members of the Australian Labor Party, in the Parliamentary Party as well as in the organisational Party, who are not mere dupes but who have willingly given their support to it. 1 regret to say that organised Labor in Australia has endorsed the Vietnam moratorium. In order for that primary action to become the policy it is necessary for more than 50% of the Trades and Labour Councils to endorse it. Three have failed to endorse it. One of the members on the other side, in taking a point of order, asked how could I know what is in the minds of those people who refuse to endorse it. I think 1 do know what is in their minds. They are decent Australians who will have no part of it and that is the reason why they refused to endorse this action. But this has become a matter going beyond the mere political polemics. This has become an issue in which one of the members of the front bench of the Opposition has issued a call- a clarion call he would like to think it-to the Australian people and particularly to those in Victoria and in Melbourne, to cease work, to occupy the streets and to occupy public buildings. It is an invitation to anarchy as properly described. It is a matter of such importance that I expect that a statement will be made by a Minister in this House so that the matter can be properly debated so that the views which are held by honourable members in this House can be exposed; for I am quite sure that whatever certain members of the Parliamentary Labor Party believe their views are not the views of the great bulk of those people who vote Labor and who support the Labor Party. Those people who will be called upon in the future to vote ought to know the character of the people they are called upon to vote for. For that reason there will be debate on this matter in the House. NA",25
83,Mr BARNARD,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY,"I refer the Minister for the Navy to reports that the Naval Board has accepted the retirement of Captain J. P. Stevenson. Did the honourable gentleman in January this year recommend that Captain Stevenson should not be allowed to retire? Did he say that it was his judgment that to meet the needs of the Service Captain Stevenson should remain in the Navy? Did the honourable gentleman say, as reported in the 'Canberra Times' on 6th January, that he would not turn around and put his name to a form of words which smacked of perjury and which was against his plain belief and complete conviction? Did he say further: 'Any criticism should be directed to me. I have some old-fashioned ideas about ministerial responsibility?' If these statements are correct, .does the Minister now support the Naval Board's acceptance of Captain Stevenson's retirement?",26
84,Mr KILLEN,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY,"f think this is a splendid illustration of erring in the reading of a statute. When J first read the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act ancl references made in section 39 (2.) (b) of that Act fo the Board's making a decision regarding the acceptance of an application to meet the needs of the Service, T took the viewancl I am sure that my honourable friend would agree with me that it was a reasonable one to take-that the 'Board' in that sense was the Naval Board, but the 'Board' in that sense I found on further examination was the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board. This is a Board that occupies by force of statute of this Parliament a statutory independence. The Board exercises a role which is akin to that of a board of trustees. I was invited by dint of circumstances to place before that Board all the retevant facts concerning Captain Stevenson. It is not a case of my changing my mind or of the Naval Board changing its mind although I pause to make the observation that if a person who has placed before him further relevant and persuasive argument refused to change his mind I would be left to conclude that that individual is not affected by elements of obstinacy but is consumed by stupidity. 1 want to point out to my honourable friend and to the House that the ultimate decision rests with the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board. It is the Board's decision. It makes a decision whether to accept the retirement. It would have been within the Board's province and thoroughly competent for it to have turned around and said: 'No, we do not accept it.' Then it would have been open to the Government to consider the matter on that basis. But that Board accepted it and there the matter rests. What the honourable gentleman has before him and what I have before me is the decision of a board which has statutory independence-a n independence that has been enjoyed by that board for many, many years.

90,Mr MCMAHON,CIVIL ASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA,"by leave- I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that the Commonwealth Government has decided to make a grant of S53.8m-$US60m-in economic assistance to Indonesia for the 3 year period 1970-71 to 1972-73. In the current financial year 1969-70 the level of our assistance will be about $I5m. The increase clearly shows the Government's desire to assist Indonesia's enormous developmental needs. Following the remarkable recovery of the Indonesian economy during the past 3 years it also shows the Government's confidence that assistance is being used effectively to promote economic development. In 1966 the Suharto Government inherited an economy that was in great difficulties externally, with strong internal inflajects tion and a declining productive sector. By 1969 inflation had been brought under control, exports were increasing and the productive sector was moving forward again. Credit for this dramatic improvement in the economy must be given to the sound policies of the Indonesian Government. These efforts have been backed by a flow of international assistance from Western donors. Indonesia is now in a position to move from the stabilisation stage into the development stage, which began with the five year development plan in 1969. The problems faced by Indonesia are still immense. The heavy legacy of economic neglect of earlier years will take time, resources and determination to overcome. Reflecting these needs and the greater opportunities for an effective attack on these problems, Western donors of the Inter-governmental Group on Indonesia have endorsed the assessment by international agencies that Indonesia requires SUS600m in assistance for the period up to 31st March 1971. This compares with a request for SUS500m for 1969. Australia's commitment of $53.8m forms a part of this international effort. Of course, it relates to a longer period than the $600m Indonesia requires up to 31st March 1971. In the past our aid commitments have been made, in accordance with our budgetary practices, on a year by year basis. However, this year we are making a commitment for 3 years, so that the Indonesian Government, with this forward knowledge, can integrate our aid commitment into its own planning. We envisage that our aid will be disbursed on a rising scale, so that expenditure will be greater in the last year of the 3 year period than in the first. As in the past this assistance will take the form of balance of payments support through what is called the B.E. or export bonus system, supply of commodities, including wheat flour, economic development projects, technical assistance and student training. As Indonesia turns from the immediate problems of stabilisation towards the longer term goal of economic growth, we think there will be a shift in our own programme with greater emphasis on project aid. We are continuing the current railway rehabilitation and telecommunications proand in the coming year plan to start on projects for the renewal of town water supply systems in Bogor and Den Pasar. We are investigating in a preliminary way a pioject lo rehabilitate the port of Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java, where a number of Australian firms plan investment. 1 would like to mention the AustraliaAsia university aid and co-operation scheme. Whilst it is not financed from the Indonesian aid vote which I announced it is being directed principally to Indonesia. This programme is designed to set up a framework of co-operation between Australian universities and universities in Indonesia and also in Malaysia and Singapore. It will provide fellowships for research and staff training in Australia, travel awards for Australian university staff to work in the recipient universities and supply of library books and laboratory equipment. Initially the scheme will concentrate on research and training associated with food production. This bilateral aid by Australia and other donors is being supplemented by assistance from the multilateral aid institutions to which Australia contributes, such as the International Development Association and the Asian Development Bank. I should add that none of Australia's aid is debt relief. This is simply because all aid has been on a grant, not loan, basis. Thus, Australia is not one of Indonesia's creditors. But Australia shares Indonesia's concern that a satisfactory long term solution must be found to the huge international indebtedness inherited from the previous regime. If Indonesia is to succeed in the task of raising living standards, her creditors must reach a realistic settlement of these debts. This settlement must be within Indonesia's capacity to pay. Australia cannot stand back from the problems which Indonesia faces. Indonesia has been, and continues to be, the largest recipient of our bilateral aid outside Papua and New Guinea. I believe that the decision to give Indonesia $53.8m over 3 years reflects the wish of all Australians to play their part in the international effort to assist our nearest neighbour in the task of raising the living standards of its 118 million people. I commend this to the House.",28
91,Mr WHITLAM,CIVIL ASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA,"by leave- I will be referring to Indonesia in the resumed debate on international affairs but in the defence context and therefore I speak immediately on the economic aspects to which the Minister for External Affairs (Mr MCMahon) has just referred. I thank the Minister for letting me have a copy of his statement some hours ago. I found this to be a courteous and helpful departure from the procedure followed on the last occasion a statement was made about economic aid to Indonesia. The decision to assist Indonesia by announcing a 3 year target for economic assistance is commendable. I noticed that yesterday afternoon newspapers referred to a major breakthrough in the offing. I think a scrutiny of the statement now shows that the projected target means a slackening in the rate of increase in aid to Indonesia at a time when Australia above all countries should be increasing economic assistance to its nearest neighbour. The quota set by the Minister for the 3 years is $53.8m, which is an average of about $ 17.9m in each of the 3 years. In reply to a question that I asked last August the right honourable gentleman's predecessor disclosed that our aid for the calendar year 1969 was running at S 16.8m-a n increase of S2.5m over the calendar year 1968. From the Minister's reference tonight to the our current financial year's level of assistance being about $15m it would appear that there is a short fall in the taking up of aid. The starting point for purposes of comparison should be the calendar year figures. Setting these against the next 3 years target period we can see that the rate of increase in aid has sharply declined. In the calendar year 1969 aid increased by $2.5m, but the increase for the 3 years target figure averaged out at only $1.3m.",29
92,Mr MCMAHON,CIVIL ASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA,The honourable gentleman is confusing United States dollars and Australian dollars. If he converts to United States dollars he will find that there is a steady progression.,29
93,Mr WHITLAM,CIVIL ASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA,"I will check the answer again in the light of the Minister's intervention. The Government cannot rely on the defence that Australian aid goes to Indonesia in grant form. The Netherlandshardly a richer country than Australia-in 1969 gave approximately $22m in grants to Indonesia. It should also be remembered that the bonus export component of Australian aid-som e $ 10.1m in 1969-is directly tied to Australian purchases and thus provides benefits to Australian industry and exporters. Similarly, food aid totalling some $3.4m in 1969 also provided direct benefits to the Australian primary producer. Aid is, of course, a two way process but by stressing the grant aspect of the aid programme the Government does little to educate Australian public opinion to understand that aid helps the donor country as well. I believe that we need an imaginative review of our policy of aid to Indonesia. The establishment of a 3-year target should have provided the opportunity for such a review. It did not. It is a mixture as before. We were slow, too slow, to increase our aid programme to the new Indonesian regime. Nevertheless we should now applaud the fact that whatever the amount may be-it will not make a great difference to Indonesia's economy-at least it will be known 3 years ahead and in good time.

At the moment we have representation on the Australian National University and the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, but that is about all.

96,Mr WHITLAM,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"Werriwa-Leade r of the Opposition) [9.13]- I congratulate the Minister for External Affairs (Mr MCMahon) on the occasion of his first speech in that portfolio. I cannot congratulate him on its contents. The last time the Minister spoke in this House on international affairs was in October 1967. On that occasion, he denounced proposals for stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and negotiating with the National Liberation Front as 'treason'. The Minister was then the most outspoken of those members of the Cabinet who used Australia's influence to sabotage American peace initiatives and prolong the war. We are not likely to have again such an opportunity for obtaining a settlement on anything like such satisfactory terms, not only for the Vietnams but for the Indo-China region, as we had in 1967. At that time Australia had considerable ability to influence events, by influencing the United States of America. We squandered that influence by abusing it. The Minister was among the foremost of the spendthrifts. One would have expected to see from the Minister some contrition-that necessary confession of failure which must precede amendment. We have nothing of the sort. On the contrary, the Minister clings to the old attitudes and theories which culminated in the present disaster in Indo-China. The Minister uttered some fine sentiments about the need for telling the people the trutha pretty plain admission that they have not told the truth in the past. The Minister is spokesman for the only democratic government in the world which would now dare depict the war in Vietnam and its origins exclusively in terms of external aggression. The Australian Government is the last to cling to this disastrous obsession. Does it expect the Australian people to be the last in the world to believe it? The President of the United States knows that his people no longer believe it. In his Report to Congress on 18th February he studiously avoided the exploded claim that this war can or would ever be interpreted solely in terms of external aggression. Indeed, in that speech he paid tributes to both North Vietnam and NLF which, if uttered by an Australian, would be described by the Minister as treason. I say this interpretation of the war and causes has been a disastrous obsession. Under its baleful influence, the conflict in Vietnam escalated into the longest and third largest war this century; it has been at the root of the massive blunders and massive bloodshed of this conflict; it has built up a tawdry totalitarian regime, running a fifthrate power, as the arbiter of Indo-China, while a hardly less totalitarian regime drags in its wake the prestige of the mightiest democracy the world has known or will ever know. Yet the Minister claims this policythis policy allegedly designed to teach North Vietnam that aggression does not pay-is succeeding. The Minister is caught up in the toils of a terrible self contradiction. To justify 5 years of disaster in Vietnam, he says the policy pursued over those 5 years is a success; yet to explain events in Laos and Cambodia, he invokes the domino theory. Thus runs the Liberal syllogism: North Vietnam is being taught that aggression cannot succeed, but North Vietnam is extending her aggression to the whole of Indo-China. This is the Liberal logic: The domino theory will operate unless we succeed in Vietnam; we are succeeding in Vietnam; the domino theory is operating. The bankruptcy of Liberal policy, Liberal theories, Liberal attitudes is revealed in the most significant sentence in the Minister's speech. 'Cambodia', he says, 'does not fit readily into the themes I have developed in my statement'. How impertinent of Cambodia! Events have an unfortunate habit of refusing to fit into Liberal themes. We do not hear much these days of the grand old rationale of our involvement in Vietnamthe need, according to Sir Robert Menzies, '-to prevent the downward thrust of China between the Indian and Pacific oceans'. The Minister himself 2 years ago drew a new MCMahon line: 'Australia would fight aggression wherever. it occurred'. Now, while explaining the situation in Laos and Cambodia wholly in terms of North Vietnamese aggression, he hurls his defiant thunderbolts about 'our sympathetic interest'. The truth is that events in Cambodia fit perfectly into the most significant theme of Jndo-China's history since World War II the theme which explains the disasters which have befallen our aims, our arms and our its efforts in that area. That theme is our continuing failure to recognise and identify with the national aspirations and expectations of the people of the area. At the bottom of the alienation of so many and so much representing the best in our communities is the failure to answer this crucial question of our time: Why is our cause, the cause of democracy-embracin g mankind's hope for decency and dignity, backed as it is by unparalleled power-so vulnerable, and in this region so apparently impotent, in the face of the challenge of so obsolete, crude and brutal a creed as Communism? We began with all the advantages and still hold most of them. Look at our area in global perspective. Of the 12 significant countries of the Pacific Basin, 9 are democracies. The most developed, the strongest, of those-the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia-ar eflourishingdemocracies. Ten of these 12 countries reject Communism. Two of these-the United States and Japan - ar e the world's first and third industrial powers. Three of them-the US., Indonesia and Japan-ar e the world's fourth, fifth and sixth most populous nations. The two great Communist powers touching on the Pacific reserve for each other a greater hostility than they do for us. For 23 years Indian democracy has grappled successfully with the problems of the world's second most populous nation. In those same post-war years the overt military strength of the Soviet has been turned exclusively against other Communist nations. Yet, with all these strengths, we still find ourselves awaiting the next disaster. Surely then, only an Olympian capacity for error could have brought us to our present situation in this area. Cambodia illustrates and encapsules the fatal flaw of Western policy. The flaw is this: In this area especially, though not only in this area, we have allowed the Communists to identify with national leadership and national aspirations; in the name of anti-Communism, we have all too frequntly identified ourselves with all that is opposed to that leadership and those aspirations. We have preferred anti-national regimes who will profess opposition to Communism against nationalists who refused to do so. We have preferred nominal anti-Communism to neutralism. The whole Vietnam adventure was based on the gamblethat a militant anti-Communist regime could be established there and on the fallacy that such a regime would be more to our advantage than a neutral government associating with none of the great adversaries. For 17 years in Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk dexterously kept his country neutral. He was an excellent diplomatist and a most excellent Prince. For all his faults, as in our superior detachment we may view them, he achieved the one thing worth achieving in his situation and for his nation: He maintained, he embodied, the national identity. I make no comment or judgment on the causes of his overthrow. I echo for Australia the statement made for the United States by the Senate Majority Leader, Senator Mansfield, that 'those among us who applaud his fall are mistaken*. As to the consequences, so much is plain: A real national leader who refused to identify with either East or West now divides his exile between Peking and Moscow; a neutralist who, barely a month ago, warned against precipitate American withdrawal from the region is now the client of Peking; a head of state who was confident that the Red Khmers could be locally contained is now championed by the Red Khmers; and, above all, worse of all, the people of Cambodia are now to know war in a way that they have never known it for 17 years. Indeed, one would hardly expect the tragedy of this dimension to 'fit readily into the themes developed' by the Minister. The Minister is content to justify and explain all events in this area-in Vietnam, in Laos, in Cambodia, in Thailand-by postulating North Vietnamese aggression. This, he says, in each case, is 'the fundamental cause'. If we were to accept the Minister's explanation, plainly nothing could or should be done except stop North Vietnamese aggression-jus t as we are supposed to have stopped it in South Vietnam. The Minister puts forward the same 'fundamental cause' in South Vietnam, in Laos, in Cambodia. Does he, then, put forward the same solution-the solution which he claims has been successful in Vietnam? Is this Canberra's message to Washington, to Vientiane, to Phnom Penh - that we should follow up our 'success'God save the mark!-in Vietnam by similar 'successes' in Laos and Cambodia? Even to justify himself, even to satisfy Senator Gair, the Minister dares not go so far; but Laos and Cambodia may know-the Liberals declare it fearlessly to the world-that they have our 'sympathetic interest'. The Liberal tradition continues-tal k big; encourage the elements in any American administration which urge escalation; make it as difficult as possible for the United States to negotiate. Is it yet possible to propose a rational, attainable policy for this area? We on this side believe it is. We have put it again and again for 5 years. Its object is to neutralise Indo-China-that is, the countries of this area should not be subject to intervention, much less confrontation, on the part of the competing great powers. This is a much broader objective than the present declared policy of the United Slates-'Vietnamisa tion' of the war in Vietnam. 'Vietnamisation' of the war is the method of American withdrawal from the war. But the important aim must be to 'Vietnamise' the peace. The current events in Laos and Cambodia present the last opportunity we shall have for an international conference on Indo China. This is an opportunity-no t golden, not bright, but the last-whic h cannot be lost. Australia should be now proposing it. It is to international conferences, in 1954 and in 1962, that we owe whatever respite we were given in this area. It is true that we squandered the respite and abused the opportunity; it is equally true that the International Control Commission set up by those conferences has been rendered ineffective. But the precedent and the machinery exist for Indo-China in a way that they do nowhere else in the world. We should be urging it; we should be supporting France in her call for a global conference. Whatever may be thought of France's actions and motives, one thing must be said: She has learnt the lessons of her grievous losses in Indo-China. There is nothing so depressing in the Minister's speech as his continuation of the fine old Liberal tradition of downgrading negotiations and rubbishing proposals from the other side. Sir Robert Menzies laid down the line that he would be the last Prime Minister to denounce negotiations. As it turned out, the present Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) was. The Minister for External! Affairs mentions the 'proposals for a peaceful settlement'-hi s words-in Laos put forward by the Pathet Lao on 6th Marchand then proceeds to discount them. He discounts them on the ground that they are 'one-sided'. If negotiations are never to proceed except on the basis that one side must put forward two-sided proposals, negotiations will never start-o n this or any other matter. The Minister was Minister for Labour and National Service long enough to know that. One of the main reasons why President Johnson is no longer President of the United States is that he persistently refused to acknowledge that proposals for negotiations are not necessarily proposals for final settlement. It is argued that negotiations go on interminably, that the intransigence of the other side makes a mockery of them, that they are futile and sterile. But what can be said of negotiations that cannot be said about the war itself-wit h this difference, that negotiations do not destroy whole nations. The simple, blunt truth is that the Minister and his Government, and particularly its leaders, rubbish negotiations-whethe r they are 'one-sided' proposals from the Pathet Lao or, to quote the Prime Minister, 'these things called peace talks in Paris'because of an attitude of mind which represents a hankering for vanished supremacies, a nostalgia of a distinctly racist cast. If, conceivably, a European area were involved in the kind of protracted and selfdestructive conflict that we now see in our area, that we have seen for a quarter century now, in Indo-China, this Government would urge and encourage every move in the United Nations to stop it, on any terms at all. If, conceivably, a European belligerent were to put forward proposals such as Hanoi's 4 points of 1966, or the Pathet Lao's proposals of 6th March, we will would be touting every capital in the world to secure a peace conference on the basis of those proposals. We would not be looking too deeply into motives or consequences; we would be intent only on stopping the war or preventing its spread. I know that this attitude is not confined to supporters of the war; I know there are opponents of the war, and particularly of Australia's commitment to it, whose real objection is that we should be concerned in killing men or being killed by men of a different colour-becaus e they are a different colour. But it is only in the present government that such people are part of, or have access to, the decision-making processes of this country. It is all very well for the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to give us 7 columns in Hansard under the heading 'Strategic Assessment', which was more geography than strategy. It is not just for geographical reasons that we have to play our part in Asia. Nor is it the reason which ran through the speech of the Minister for External Affairs like a dirge-to provide 'stability'. This is not a role which this or any other democracy should set for itself-o r believe itself capable of achieving. Australia's path to Asia is through doing the right and good thing. Our purpose and justification as a part of European civilisation in this Asian region is to show what it is to do the right and good thing according to the great Western ideas of reason, tolerance and progress and belief in human dignity and decency. Yet all to often Australia shows the obverse ugly side of European civilisation-it s intolerance, its racialism, its desire to overawe and overwhelm those it chooses to regard as inferior. In short, all too often this nation does the wrong thing or, more frequently, we lose the credit for doing the right thing by doing it grudgingly and gracelessly-mos t notably in Vietnam, but in all those other matters which the Minister mentioned but chose not to discuss, namely, the problems of southern Africa, the South Pacific, such developments in disarmament as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and the proposal for better control of chemical and bacteriological warfare. Our attitude, more than our geography, determine the role we are to play in this region. The Gorton Government's sympathetic attitude to southern Africa-o r the regimes there-is doing Australia great damage in the world and in particular in our region. A fortnight after the Prime Minister was sworn in as a member of this place I drew his attention to a letter in the 'London Times' in which the Agent-General for Victoria, a former Liberal Minister in that State, declared that South Africa and Rhodesia are in a similar position to Australia in that 'they are resisting the march of Communism in the Southern Hemisphere'. I asked the Prime Minister whether he would repudiate this inept and offensive statement. He replied: I believe it perfectly true to state that Australia, in fact, is resisting the encroachment of Communism in this part of the world and I have no apology to make for that part of the letter. During the remainder of that year the honourable members for Cbisholm (Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) and Moreton (Mr Killen) and the former member for Bowman had a free hand to synchronise questions and speeches in favour of Rhodesia. A year ago I drew the Prime Minister's attention to the visit to Australia on an Australian passport by Air Vice-Marshal Hawkins, who was formerly Commander of the Rhodesian Air Force and was to become Rhodesia's diplomatic representative to South Africa. I asked the Prime Minister whether he would make it plain that the Australian Government did not approve of an Australian citizen taking a position described as Rhodesia's diplomatic representative. In reply the Prime Minister contented himself with referring to the Air ViceMarshal's 'most distinguished career fighting for the free world against Fascism as a pilot with great distinction and finishing up as the head of the air force of a country which was then joined in opposing Hitler, Fascism and Fascist rule'. Spurred by an interjection by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen), he went on to praise Rhodesia as a country in which many of our pilots trained to fight against this aggressive Fascism. He concluded by asserting the rights of a man with 'a career which was distinguished and which had greatly helped the freedom of the world and the relief of Europe from conquest from abroad'. Our Prime Minister's nostalgic affinity with Mr Smith, this yearning for the halcyon days of the junior officers' mess, has infected the whole range of his Government's actions and our country's standing. It is little wonder that, after watching Mr Ian Smith's recent interview on 'Four Corners', the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Turner), the Liberal member with the longest parliamentary experience after the honourable member for Cbisholm, pointed to the inescapable inference that in the opinion of Mr Smith the Australian Government sympathises with his regime and with its policies. Nor is it surprising that this same honourable member, fresh from his experiences in New York, has publicly and privately warned his colleagues that Australia will exert no beneficent influence in the United Nations until we clear up and clean up our attitudes on Rhodesia and New Guinea. The Australian Government is conspiring with the Rhodesian regime to facilitate the movements of its officials around the world. These officials can no longer receive British passports. Their Rhodesian passports are not recognised by any loyal member of the United Nations. The Australian Government has therefore obliged by giving alternative Australian passports to such of the Rhodesian officials as were born in Australia. The regime's Secretary of External Affairs-so named-wa s granted an Australian passport by the Australian Embassy in Pretoria in June 1967. The regime's diplomatic representative in Portugal received his Australian passport in December 1967. In August 1968, on instructions from Canberra, our Embassy in Pretoria gave Air ViceMarshal Hawkins his Australian passport. Last August I placed the following question on the notice paper for the Prime Minister: Is it in accordance with the Government's policy for persons described as Rhodesia's diplomatic representatives in South Africa and Portugal to hold Australian passports. I received no reply before the last Parliament was dissolved. I placed this question on the notice paper again 5 weeks ago. I have still received no reply. The Committee established in pursuance of the Security Council resolution of May 1968 has reported that, despite sanctions, Australia's exports to Southern Rhodesia have risen in each of the last 3 years and Australia has risen from ninth to second place among exporters to Southern Rhodesia. In the first year after the resolution, 88 persons were approved for entry from Rhodesia for visits and 107 for residence; in the following 9 months the figures rose to 105 and 127 respectively. It seems about half the entrants have travelled on Rhodesian passports. Thus in both trade and passports Australia is known to be defying United Nations resobe lutions of May 1968 and earlier and reby affirmed and reinforced as recently as 18th March by the Security Council. In answer the honourable member for Chisholm, the former Minister for Immigration in effect apologised for having to follow United Nations resolutions on Rhodesian passports and said that there was certainly regret his part in having to do so. In these circumstances should any of us at Kurri Kurri: be surprised that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) feels free to November. defame Australia, its people, its churches, its unions, on Rhodesian television? We may know how insignificant is his position said: as chairman of the Liberal Party's immigration committee. Other nations may place some emphasis on that position, not least the United States, where the Negro population is notably critical of the Australian Government. Our relations with the United States have always been to take account of the fact that it includes the world's most powerful black, community. The decision by the Secretary of State, Mr Rogers, to close down the American consulate in Salisbury reflects the strength of feeling among Minister said: America's 25 million negroes on this issue and on any issue involving the racist policies of South Africa and Rhodesia. Other nations, too, noting the preoccuand pation by the honourable member Moreton with African governments and his evidence before the Rhodesian regime's Constitution Commission, will draw own conclusions from the fact that he has now been appointed to the Australian Ministry, and a defence portfolio at that. In his first speech as Minister, the honourground able gentleman could not forbear to obtrude a reference to the new member for Robert1960s son (Mr Cohen), who has dared to expose racist policies and attitudes by certain Australians in Australia towards Africa. Knowing how anxious the Prime Minister now is to ingratiate himself with the Demober. cratic Labour Party, other nations place nificance on the statement by Senator Gair to the National Press Club last October that the Government should examine the possibility of a naval arrangement with South Africa for defence in the Indian Ocean. The attitude of our Government towards the Territory of Papua and New Guinea will judged in the world, and in our region, the fact-amon g others-that a score of the Territory's police officers have preto viously served in African countries-mor e than half of them in Rhodesia-and that 49 other members of the Administration staff have previously been employed in African countries. The new Minister for External on Affairs did not take long to disclose his own attitude towards southern Africa. He was reported as saying on 15th November",30
97,Mr MCMAHON,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,I was not there on 15th,35
98,Mr WHITLAM,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,I will remind you. You I am a former Treasury expert . . .,35
99,Mr MCMAHON,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,I am sorry. I thought you were speaking of foreign affairs.,35
100,Mr WHITLAM,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"I accept the Minister's apology. I will read the full report uninterrupted. 1 do not think the listening public or the Minister's own colleagues should miss any of his sentiments on this first occasion when he spoke on foreign affairs after having been shifted to that portfolio. The I am a former Treasury expert and now a foreign relations expert. Between 20 minutes lo 5 yesterday and 10 minutes to 9 this morning 1 had to make 3 decisions. One was about foreign aid one was about apartheid and I can't remember for what the other one was. He said he had made his decision according to the principle of non-interference in their the affairs of other countries. Throughout the 1950s the Menzies Government opposed any United Nations resolutions condemning apartheid on the that this was a domestic issue which concerned South Africa alone. During the the Government came first to abstain from voting on such resolutions and finally to vote in favour of them. The issue came to a vote in the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly on 14th NovemEighty-three members voted in favour sigof it and 20 abstained. Australia reverted to a vote against. The decision the Minister could not remember related to the Portuguese territories in Africa. It arose on the same day in the Fourth Committee. Eightyeight members voted in favour of it. This time Australia had the grace to abstain. The General Assembly carried 12 resolutions last November and December relating to trusteeship and non self-governing territories-Fourt h Committee matters-o n recorded votes or roll-calls. On all these controversial questions of colour and colonies Australia never voted against South Africa or Portugal. She consistently voted against all her neighbours in South East Asia and the Asian Commonwealth and the Indian Ocean. Australia voted in favour of 1 of the 12 resolutions-o n New Guinea; she voted against 2-o n Rhodesia and Oman; and abstained on the rest. New Zealand voted in favour of 4; Canada 5; Japan 8 and Tndia 10. Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore and Thailand supported all the resolutions except that on Oman. Cambodia, Laos, Madagascar, Pakistan and the Philippines supported the whole 12 resolutions. The Minister for External discussion of Australia's attitude to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the control of chemical and bacteriological fare. He explicitly recognised that these matters are crucial in achieving a detente between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Government has never recogquestion nised its responsibilities in this regard. Treaty is fundamental to the detente. Adhesion to it is the most important reNations. quest on disarmament the United States had made to her friends and allies. The second point of the Guam DoctrineAmerica's nuclear guarantee to friends and allies-make s sense only in the context of the Treaty. The guarantee is feasible only if the Treaty works; Congress will endorse such a guarantee only to the extent that it is covered by the Treaty. Australia was the 97th of 98 nations which signed the Treaty before it entered into force. IndoProtectorate. nesia was the 98th. New Zealand had signed it on the first day; she ratified it 7 months ago. Yet. in his 11th hour announcement that Australia would sign, the Prime MinisSolomons ter did his best to cast doubts on the validity of the guarantee. Is it any wonder that, with America's ANZUS partner baulking. other nations less closely associated were doubtful? To emphasise Australia's reluctance and scepticism, the Prime Minister gratuitously coupled his announcement that we would sign with an announcement that we would not yet ratify. So we are to go through the whole sorry process again-if it is left to him. Inevitably, we will ratify; bu(, as far as this Government is concerned, it will be done in the same begrudging way as we came inevitably to sign-the day designed to ensure that Australia has the least influence and the least credit. The Gorton Government has an unerring ability to make a vice out of necessity. If Rhodesia and the Non-proliferation Treaty are examples of Australia's failure to co-operate with the United States in her best endeavours, our conduct at the United Nations on control of chemical and bacteriological warfare betrays equally short sighted efforts to support the United States when most isolated and idiosyncratic. In the General Assembly, Australia, Portugal and the United States alone voted against the declaration that the Geneva Convention outlawed chemical and biological agents of warfare which poisoned or killed men, Affairs avoided animals or plants. Our record on these 3 matters-Rhodesia , warthe Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and chemical and bacteriological warfare-ha s a common denominator. It has not been a of consistent support for the The United States, or concerted action with fellow members of the Commonwealth of The one common factor is that we have been out of step with our neighbours; we have either lagged behind or been at outright loggerheads. At the United Nations at least, the Government consistently votes in favour of isolationism in our region. The Minister named the South Pacific as one of those matters on which debate is to be deferred. Fiji will become independent this year. Then the only British territory in the South Seas will be the Solomon Islands It is all the more urgent, therefore, that Australia make arrangements with the retiring British to facilitate postindependence arrangements between the and New Guinea. Such arrangements will mitigate the pressure for secession in Bougainville, which after all is the northernmost of the Solomons. The great significance of these matters is that Australia is directly and fully responsible for the specific decisions it makes upon them. They are all directly, some of them entirely, in our province. On none of them can we escape the consequences of the decisions we make, and the decisions we make are the things upon which we are judged by other nations. The Minister chose not to deal with these specific matters. He preferred the larger canvas. He preferred to base his statement not on those matters where Australia can or must make responsible decisions, but on Australian opinions on matters where the decision is not ours. Thus his statement dealt largely with Australian opinions rather than Australian decisions. He expressed his Government's opinion in 3 great matters of policy of 3 great nations; he expressed his Government's opinion as to action taken, policies enunciated, or likely developments in Britain, Japan and the United States. Yet even now, when we have had the benefit of the foreign affairs statement by the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for External Affairs' postscript, it is not quite clear what the Government's attitude really is to each of these 3 matters. Still less certain that the Government has any realistic understanding of the policies of there 3 governments, or that its own policies are realistically related to the policies of these governments. We can only assume that the contradictions revealed by comparing the statements by the Ministers for Defence and External Affairs show that the Government as a whole is confused and uncertain. Of course, I reject with deserved contempt the Press speculation that these contradictions reflect personal rivalry between the immediate Ministers for Defence and External Affairs. Who could believe such a thing? Nevertheless, the contradictions remain. The Minister for Defence made it clear that in his belief the British policy of withdrawal from our region was irreversible. The tenor of his speech was so strong this line that half the papers in Australia attributed the word 'irreversible' to him direct quotes, although the word itself is contained in the actual speech. Perhaps that was the word the Minister used when giving his pre-speech briefing to the Press, when he was using the new Liberal technique of giving a ministerial statement a spurious significance by locking the Press up with it several hours before it is made in the Parliament. Ministers like the Minister for Social Services (Mr Wentworth) who went to sleep during the statement by the Minister for Defence might reflect on the sufferings of the pressmen who were physically imprisoned with it for 5 hours beforehand. Until the current Prime Minister got this bright idea, locking-up the Press used to be reserved for Budgets only, to prevent corrupt transactions. Perhaps the Minister for Defence felt he had to protect the shares of General Dynamics. However, the Minister for Defence plainly accepts the irreversibility of British disengagement. The Government's defence policy is presently based on such a position. Yet the Minister for External Affairs makes a last minute plea for a reversal of established British policy. In any meaningful sense, the thing is chimerical. Even should there be a change of government in Britain between now and 1976-the election after nextthere will be no significant British presence in this area after 1971. More particularly, is it there will be no troops-n o land-based forces-in significant numbers after 1971. This is not merely a decision by a government of a particular party, nor, as the Minister for Defence seemed to imply, is it purely a decision of economic exigency. It is part of the inevitable trend, the policy that any European power-and Britain today is exclusively a European powermust follow. There is no more reason for Britain to have land forces in this area in the 1970s than for France, Germany, Italy or any other significant European power. In this regard, it is quite irrelevant which party is in power in Britain. So, in the first of the three significant factors which the Minister for External Affairs mentions, one thing stands out-Britai n will not station, Britain will not maintain, garrisons of quite troops in this area in this decade. The second factor the Minister for Exteralong nal Affairs mentioned was Japan. Here again we find divergence between the in Ministers for Defence and External Affairs. not The Minister for Defence seems to be proposing some sort of interventionist military role for Japan. The Minister for External Affairs, to the credit of his Department, specifically rejects such a role, for his Department knows it is impossible. Of course, to speak, as the Minister did, of Okinawa redenta as an assumption of regional responsibilities by Japan is doubletalk. The very political elements in Japan most vocal on the return of Okinawa are those most opposed to any return to militarism in Japan. The blunt truth of the matter is this: There is not a country in Asia which would invite Japanese military intervention in its defence, and there is not a country in Asia to which Japan would be prepared to send troops. It is just not on. The Minister makes no recognition of the fact that, as trading nations, Australia and Japan have a common national interestthe preservation of the freedom of the high seas. Recently Australia had an opportunity to show the Japanese Government that this common interest can be important for our future relations. Nothing was done. Recently the Soviet announced major naval exercises around Japan which would severely disrupt Japan's trade and commerce. Such disruption would have affected Australia, not least because of the infringement of the principles outlined in the Convention on the High Seas. Australia failed to join Japan in its successful protests to the Soviet. Both Ministers correctly emphasise the importance of the role Japan can play in economic development in our region. They overlook what is perhaps her most significant role of all-in helping bridge relations between the United States and China. No country stands more to gain from rational relationships from China; no country is so well placed to make the beginning towards securing sucb relationships. It is regrettable that the Minister for External Affairs, while paying lip-service to the concept of restoring China to the international community, returned to the old doctrine that China must first give proofs of her fitness to be a member of that community. In this case again, one can draw a contrast between the doctrinaire approach of the Australian Government and the cautious pragmatism of the Nixon Doctrine as outlined in the President's address to Congress on 18th February. President Nixon makes no such prior conditions. If the standards of international conduct laid down by the Minister were the conditions of membership of the United Nations they would form as good an argument for expelling Russia as for excluding China. The problems of building a rational relationship with China are complex enough; it would resolve one difficulty if we were to drop at once the habit of directing sermons rather than proposals to China. The initial steps towards improved relations are about such matters as trade, travel and communications. As one of China's significant trading partners, Australia has certain opportunities. The pity of it is that up to 2 years ago we could have joined with Canada and Japan in helping the United States off the hook. But now, a comparison of the President's speech of 18th February and the speech of the Minister for External Affairs shows that in fact the United States has moved ahead of us; the official American position is now well in advance of ours. The third great factor which, according to the Minister, has 'major implications for our region' is Nixon Doctrine itself. The new and crucial part of this Doctrine is Siatesclause 3, which states: . . .the United States will look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defence. Fundamentally, this is the President's response to the demand of the people and the Congress of the United States that there shall be no more Vietnams. It is perhaps not so much a new doctrine as a return to orthodoxy after the Vietnam aberrationnamely, the orthodoxy that American arms should not be involved on the mainland of Asia. I agree with the Minister that the 3 factors he mentions-Britis h withdrawal, the role of Japan and the Nixon doctrineare 3 of the most significant factors in determining Australian foreign and defence policies. But he seems to avoid the cumulative impact of the 3 factors. For there is one thing that each of these 3-the 3 policies of very diverse nations-hav e in common: They each drive at the same point. They all define for themselves a role in Asia; but each of them excludes the provision of ground troops as part of her role. None of them will in future provide manpower. Not only do these 3 powers reach a common conclusion; they work on a common assumption. It is not just because of economic difficulties that Britain is no longer prepared to provide troops for Asia; it is not just for historical reasons that Japan cannot; it is not just for domestic political reasons that the United States will not. Beyond these reasons, each powerful enough in itself, is the greater reason - the futility of foreign troops in national Wars. These 3 great powers- 3 of the 4 nations, with Indonesia, with which Australia is most concerned-eac h abdicate voluntarily from the role of providing troops for the defence of foreign countries. Australia alone still proposes such a role for herself, in the face of experience, in the face of the future. Yet of all these countries, we are the weakest in manpower. We have not a fifth of the manpower of the smallest of these powers. We are a small, exceedingly wealthy nation neighboured by the most populous and some of the poorest nations in the world. And yet, in such a situation, the linch-pin of our defence policy is a battalion-1,00 0 menin Singapore. We are asked to believe that this is a meaningful ind modern contribution to the needs of tLiis region, at the time that the greatest of the democracies are turning their backs irreversibly on such methods. The garrisoning of a single battalion in Singapore is an irrelevancy to genuine regional co-operation. Indeed, it may be a barrier to that objective. Regional co-operation which ignores Indonesia is. a contradiction in terms. It would be idle to pretend that our relations with Malaysia have improved as a result of the decision to withdraw our forces from Terendak and instal them in Singapore. On the terms which our own Government lays down as the role of our troops, logic would have required that, if they were to be stationed anywhere, they should be in Malaysia. Under these terms, there could be only one conceivable role-helpin g to prevent border incursions in northern Malaysia. If there is any other role envisaged, the House would like to hear it. Such an involvement would require closer collaboration with Malaysian forces and a considerable degree of command integration. Plainly the decision to withdraw from Malaysia precludes such collaboration and integration. I believe it was deliberately intended to achieve that result; but once that crucial decision was made, the facesaving compromise was made between the Prime Minister and the former Minister for Defence that they should go only as far as Singapore. The logistic problems involved in such an operation have never been revealed to this House; the Minister for Defence avoided mentioning them. As a result of this compromise- a political compromise and nothing else-w e have a decision which is militarily wrong, logistically wrong and historically wrong. We have a battalion in search of a role; indeed it seems we have a battalion in search of a roof. It cannot be said too often that the basis of regional co-operation in our neighbourhood is Indonesia; it cannot be said too often that defence arrangements which exclude or bypass Indonesia are completely unbalanced. I can think of no significant country in the world which plans its foreign and defence policies with so little reference to its nearest and greatest neighbour as Australia does in relation to Indonesia. Both the Ministers for External Affairs very and Defence express their abhorrence of what they call isolationism. I can only assume their anonymous auditor was intended to be the Prime Minister-this House's leading isolationist. Isolationism is as much a matter of attitude of mind as of the disposition of forces. We do not automatically become regionally minded by isolating one of our battalions in Singapore. The true antithesis of isolationism is not regional co-operation and regional involvement but interventionism. Australia should stand for regional co-operation and involvement; it should reject both isolationism and interventionism. Regional involvement requires not only military co-operation but, most importantly, social and economic cooperation. It requires above all an attitude which recognises and sympathises with national aspirations and national expectations. The real objection to isolationism is not military but moral; not just what might happen in other countries, not what other countries may do to us, but what we may do fo ourselves. The archetype of isolationism in our hemisphere is South Africa. The true isolationists in this country are those who would create a similar image for Australia, those who contemplate an association of Ishmaelites in the name of anti-Communism. That is the path toward real isolation in our region, from the peoples of our region. The Government's voting record in the United Nations shows just how far this truly isolationist spirit infects our present rulers. Equally, interventionism is a morally and socially destructive doctrine. The recognition of this is at the root of the present appraisal, and what will prove to be a reversal, of American policies. The war in Vietnam spells the end of interventionism not merely because it has been militarily disastrous but because it has been socially disastrous. It has been the most divisive and disruptive war in America's history: It has been the most divisive and disruptive war in Australia's history. President Nixon's problem is not to 'save' Vietnam, or 'save' Laos, but to save the fabric of American society. No democratic society can long survive half-alienated, and in the United States alienation is deepest among the very groups upon whose co-operation and dedication democratic society most dependsthe young, the educated and the idealistic. No enemy has inflicted a greater defeat upon the United States Army than it received from within at My Lai. No conscription can make up the loss of 60,000 young Americans who cross into Canada each year to avoid Vietnam. Yet these Australian Liberals-thes e little frightened men who proclaim their proprietorial interest in the American alliance-ar e prepared to see this war go on and on, have twice sabotaged American initiatives to end it, have resented or resisted any moves to stop it, whatever the cost to America's real strength and purpose in the world. And for what reasons is this blood-bath in Vietnam, and this disintegration in the United States, to continue? In February the Minister for Defence, speaking in Perth to an assemblage of Young Liberals-estim able enough young people who get far more frankness from Ministers than this Parliament ever does-sai d that the trouble was that the people of Australia did not understand the Government's attitude. It is 5 years next month since the first battalion was sent to Vietnam. Three Prime Ministers have presided over the subsequent escalation. Three national elections-tw o general elections and a Senate electionhave been fought with Vietnam as a central issue. Nearly 400 Australian troops have been killed. Every significant Australian newspaper, at one time or another, has supported the war, and most still do in one way or another. Yet the Minister for Defence believes that majority opposition to continued commitment is simply a question of better public relations. The same Minister, speaking in Saigon last week, re- stated that the reduction of the Australian commitment was solely dependent on decisions by the United States: that is, on behalf of the Government of Australia, a Minister states publicly that it is of no importance whatever Australians think, that it is not for them to propose, dispose or oppose. In the same week, the Prime Minister described demonstrations against the war as 'anarchy', as 'storm-trooper tactics'. The truth is that these demonstrations are designed to assert Australia's moral responsibility for actions committed in the name of Australia, when her government has abdicated its own responsibilities. It was left to the Prime Minister of Australia to be the first to describe dissenters against Vietnam as Communist-inspired. In 5 years of dissent this charge has never been made, and particularly not in the United States, where the list would include half the Congress, including the Senate Majority Leader, two brothers of a former President and a candidate for the vicepresidency of the United States. But this charge, flung out so irresponsibly by the Prime Minister, has its own intrinsic significance in relation to the foreign affairs debate that goes on in this Parliament <i:id this nation. It betrays a central fact of Liberal foreign policy-making. The foreign affairs decisions, even the commitment of troops, have depended on internal political considerations of the most cynical kind Fundamentally, the Liberal appeal is to fear, and one of its ingredients is racial fear. We will have to root this out, out of our government, out of our national character. This nation's proper part in our region, as a good neighbour, a good helper and as an example of the good and open society, cannot be built on the basis of fear or hate. To try to do so is to inflict on ourselves, on our system, on our civilisation, a far deeper wound than any foreign enemy is ever likely to do.",35
101,Mr FAIRBAIRN,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"Farrer) [10.9]- I had always hoped that we might have a bipartisan foreign policy in Australia as has applied to such a great extent in both the United States and Britain. But after hearing tonight's speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) I realise that this is further from fruition than ever before. And why would it not be? How could we ever expect to get a bipartisan policy with a party that undoubtedly is controlled enormously by the left wing? I have seldom heard the Leader of the Opposition so caustic as he was against our great ally the United States of America. All of us know that the Americans have their faults but do we not have faults ourselves? At least, when it comes to our corner of the world it United States which is carrying the free world on its back; but the United States is getting mighty little thanks from people like the Leader of the Opposition for doing so. Perhaps he is getting ready for the Vietnam Moratorium. I understand that one of the 13 members who had not signed the document giving support to the Vietnam moratorium was written to and asked why he had not signed it. At least he had the courage of his convictions to say that he believed it would be disastrous for Australian troops to be immediately withdrawn from Vietnam. Mr Jess-He will not last long.",40
102,Mr FAIRBAIRN,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"No , he will not last long. What will happen to him? Why would the Opposition not support this Vietnam moratorium? Its policy on Vietnam is identical with the policy of those who are organising the moratorium. They believe that all Australian troops and in fact all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Vietnam. When they refer to foreign troops they do not for a moment mean the North Vietnamese; they mean those who are fighting the North Vietnamese. They believe that Australian troops and American troops should be withdrawn. The Labor Party believes in this and so do the Vietnam moratorium organisers. Everyone in Australia realises that the moratorium is being supported financially by the Communist Party through its front movement, the Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament. We were told by the Leader of the Opposition that the intervention by the United States in Vietnam had been a Vietnam aberration. But what would happen if the Americans were to withdraw. It is terribly easy to make these cutting and caustic remarks when you have no responsibiity. What would happen if the United States and Australia immediately withdrew, as has been advocated both by the previous Leader of the Opposition in his policy speech of 1966 and by the present Leader of the Opposition in 1969? There would be chaos. I am sure that no-one would think for a moment that all troops supporting Vietnam- I was going to say all the foreign troops-coul d be withdrawn without chaos. A recent visitor to this country was is the a very great Englishman, Sir Robert Thompson, who is a great expert of counterinsurgency, having assisted enormously the British in Malaysia-Singapore and now assisting the Americans in Vietnam. In a book he wrote recently he said: The consequences of a defeat need to be carefully weighed. In South Vietnam itself a people would go under. Judging from past experience in China and North Vietnam perhaps several hundred thousands, who have supported the war and fought valiantly and who would certainly oppose the conqueror's subsequent collectivisation programme, might be slaughtered. This will not be shown on television and so may not worry subverted liberals and fellow travellers, but others may have it on their conscience. There is after all no Formosa to which the victims can escape, nor has any area been set aside for them in the Californian desert. In a year or two they will be conveniently forgotten and the consequent stagflation of the economy is advanced as a specious argument for international aid. The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party are advocating this and will do this if they have their way but, thank goodness, we know they will not have their way. Even though the Americans are de-escalating the war at the present moment we know that they realise and we realise that it is necessary and will be necessary for support to be given to the South Vietnamese for some time to come. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the 3 elections that had been held since the Vietnam war commenced, but he did not make the point that one of those 3 elections in which the Vietnamese policy was the vital issue, the 1966 election, saw this Government returned with the greatest strength that any Government has had during the 70 years history of federation in this country. Surely that shows-and thank goodness it does-that the ideas of the Leader of the Opposition and the ideas of the Australian people are poles apart. The Leader of the Opposition believes that we should have rushed in and signed the Treaty for the Non-Pro! iteration of Nuclear Weapons. He can always find someone to quote, and in this instance he quoted New Zealand as an example. I suppose he says that Australia should automatically have done what New Zealand did. We have signed the Treaty, but with certain reservations. It is only right that we should not blindly charge in and sign something just because the Leader of the Opposition thinks that by doing so we might encourage someone else to sign it. We would all welcome a really watertight treaty, but we want to find out whether it will prevent proliferation. Personally I have great reservations in my own mind as to whether it will prevent proliferation. I have heard a very eminent scientist recommend that if a country wanted eventually to become a nuclear power the first thing it should do is to sign and to ratify the Treaty. It will then have access to all the information it requires. It will be able, under inspection, to build up supplies of plutonium, and if and when it desires to become a nuclear power all it has to do is pull out of the Treaty and within a matter of months it can become a nuclear power. Before we go ahead and ratify the Treaty we want to be sure that it is watertight and that it will reduce proliferation. I would like to give to the House some of the conditions the Commonwealth Government would like to see fulfilled before it will ratify the Treaty. The Australian Government hopes that the Treaty will be effective in its operation and will lead to improved relations and enhanced co-operation between the nations of the world. It believes that a condition of an effective treaty is that it should attract a necessary degree of support. Some progress in this direction has been made but the Government will nevertheless want to be assured that there is a sufficient degree of support for the Treaty. It is of interest to note that the support which has brought the Treaty into operation has come from those countries which have no possibility or feasibility in the near future, or even in the fairly distant future, of becoming a nuclear power. We want to know what is to happen to the greater powers. For example, we know quite well that neither France nor China will sign. They are both nuclear powers but they will not sign or ratify the Treaty. We know that India will not ratify it. West Germany and Japan have recently signed but like Australia have very strong reservations about ratifying it. They want to see that something is done to satisfy the reservations they have about the Treaty. South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan and Thailand have not ratified it. Thailand has not even signed. Indonesia has not ratified, neither has Israel, Italy, any of the Euratom countries, or Spain or even for that matter Byelorussia or the Ukraine. Surely before we press ahead with committing ourselves - and we could commit ourselves irrevocably on this matter-w e ought to determine what support the Treaty will get, and whether it will reduce proliferation or whether it will be like the nuclear test ban, during the operation of which we discovered that 2 new countries had become nuclear powers. The Australian Government went on to say in paragraph 7 of a paper issued by the Department of External Affairs: Notes that Article 10 of the Treaty provides that any party has the right to withdraw in circumstances that jeopardised its supreme interest. What does this 'jeopardy of supreme interest' mean? If a country can say its supreme interest is jeopardised and so easily get out of the Treaty, what on earth is the use of the Treaty? If it is hard to get out you bind yourself for all time. No one can foresee what the future holds for us. So these are reasons-and there are others - wh y I believe the Commonwealth Government was very wise indeed to take its time before it decided to sign and, when it did decide to sign, to put in these reservations. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition I believe that the Government deserves to be congratulated on the recent statements that it has made on foreign affairs. They go a long way towards meeting the criticisms that have been made of the inadequacy of the Government's recent approach to foreign policy. They signify a very necessary adaptation to the changing circumstances of Australia's international environment. I mentioned the Government's recent statement on foreign affairs. While tonight we are debating the statement of the Minister for External Affairs (Mr MCMahon) we need also to take into account the recent statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser). In outlining his strategic thinking behind the new approach to the defence of Australia he covered much of the ground also covered by the Minister for External Affairs. Here I would like to issue a word of warning to the Government. As I see it, the strategic assessment of the international situation is primarily a matter for the Minister for External Affairs and his Department. After the strategic assessment has been made and accepted, perhaps with some variations by the Government, it is then for the Minister for Defence to determine, in the light of that appreciation, what should then be our defence forces and equipment. On this occasion, apart from some minor variations, the two Ministers have been singing the same tune. But I can foresee problems and misunderstandings ahead for the Government if both these Ministers feel themselves free to put forward their separate views on external affairs, unless there is the closest collaboration between them. To return to the statement of the Minister for External Affairs, this is a new policy; let there be no mistake about that. The main difference from the old foreign policy is that the main emphasis is no longer on supporting the traditional great and powerful allies and upholding military alliances. The main emphasis is on Australia looking after its own interests and protecting itself as a significant power in the South East Asia region. An active and more independent role for Australia is seen as the best way in which Australia can advance its security in the changed circumstances of the 1970s. None of this is to say that Australia should lightly do anything which might in any way weaken its relations with our traditional great allies in the United States and Britain. On the contrary, every effort should be made to preserve and even strengthen relations with these countries. But, as realists, we must recognise that our traditional allies will not loom as large as they did in our part of the world. It is therefore sheer prudence to base our foreign policy on a greater measure of self reliance than in the past. The new foreign policy of the United States-as outlined by President Nixon in his report to Congress on 18th February-mus t have had a great impact on the formulation of the Government's new foreign policy. President Nixon's report has obvious significance for Australia. The first point is that, in this 40,000-word review of the whole range of American foreign policy and defence commitments, Australia and the ANZUS Treaty do not get any mention at all. It would be wrong to conclude that the Nixon Administration has written Australia off and that Australia ranks as quite insignificant in American calculations. But, at the same time, it may be an indication that Australia does not loom as large in the thinking of the American administration as Australians may have been led to believe by the emotional attachment of President Johnson. President Nixon, in his statement of the new American foreign policy, states in one place that the United States will not be involved in the world because of its commitments. 'Our interests must shape our commitments, rather than the other way around', he said. He went on to say: 'The fostering of self reliance is the new purpose and direction of American involvement in Asia'. In other words, America, which in Asia has been carrying the free world on its back, is getting a little tired of doing so, and is looking round to see what contributions the other democracies are making or are prepared to make in this area. The other three largest democracies who have or have had interests in South East Asia are Japan, Great Britain and France. I was very pleased to see therefore that the Minister for External Affairs devoted a major part of his speech to the growth of Japan and the even greater growth which is likely in its influence in the region and beyond. Japan is almost completely lacking in fuel and natural resources for its vast industries. We know this to our profit as a major supplier of many raw material's to Japan. Any interruption to the flow of these supplies, which consist of oil from the Middle East and Indonesia, rubber from Malaysia, and metal ores, wool, coal and wood chips from Australia, would be quite crippling to the Japanese economy and intolerable to the Japanese Government. That fact alone is likely to impel the Japanese Government to increase radically its self defence forces. The extreme pacifism of the Japanese people following the disasters they were led into by the militarists in World War II is quickly waning, and the Japanese people are increasingly sensing the need for military forces for defence, like other peaceable countries. They are raising the proportion of their gross national production spent on defence above the present low level of 1%. They plan to treble the amount of money spent on defence in the next 5-year programme compared to the 5 year defence programme they have just completed. I welcome this move, even bearing in mind the history of Japanese aggression in the Second World War. I mentioned that the other two major democracies who have or have had interests in South East Asia are Great Britain and France. The Minister, quite rightly, said that it would be a major misfortune if, at this time, the benign British influence east of Suez was diminished, when the region is faced with such new and complex problems. He said that we therefore strongly hope that the British withdrawal may be delayed. He has been called naive and unreal in expressing the desire that Britain retain an influence east of Suez. It is true that, at the present moment, the only hope of reversing the current trend of British withdrawal from Malaysia appears to be a Conservative win in the approaching elections. Some British even ask: 'Why should we waste money stationing troops thousands of miles from Britain when our vital interests are not immediately in jeopardy?' One could have said the same thing during two world wars when Australia's vital interests were not immediately threatened but when hundreds of thousands of Australians flocked to the aid of Britain and France and a great many of them now lie buried far from their native shore. For our size, we probably made a greater contribution than any other nation to the success of the allies. Yet, only in the latter part of the Second World War were our own vital interests at stake. Again, in both the Malaysian emergency and the confrontation in Borneo-countrie s from which Britain has in the past drawn great wealth-Australia n aid was readily forthcoming. One would have expected therefore some sympathy and understanding from the two great industrial nations of Britain and France for us in our dilemma in Vietnam. What have we received? The French are making a small contribution towards the civilian expenditure of the Vietnamese Government on schools and hospitals, but otherwise one gets the impression that they would hate to see anyone succeed in Vietnam where they failed. British ships continue to carry goods into North Vietnam, though they expect our help in their so far unsuccessful confrontation with Rhodesia. It may be said that the reason for the failure of France and Great Britain to make any contribution in Vietnam is their opposition to the war. But have they or any of the many others throughout the world who are opposed to the Vietnam war ever thought out to the end the possible alternatives? There appear to me to be only two alternatives-eithe r North Vietnam is going to get South Vietnam, or it is not. It is the second alternative that we and the United States are backing. We believe that the future of South Vietnam must be determined by the people themselves, and that North Vietnam should be prevented from determining that future by force. Thus, the alternatives in South Vietnam would appear to be a free nation, gaining in strength and prosperity, governing itself via the ballot box but still needing for some time some assistance against external aggression, or else a sort of Communist Yugoslavia preceded, of course, by a bloodbath. I do not think many people would desire to see the latter, although having read the book on Vietnam by the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS), I am not so sure that he does not want to see this solution. In his book 'No exit from Vietnam', from which 1I have already quoted, Sir Robert Thompson goes on to say that if America does not stand firm in Vietnam 'every other American commitment will be exposed ta doubt and anxiety on the part of those in whose favour it was made'. Sir Robert concluded: Thore will be a tendency on the part of the United States either to retreat towards isolationism or to reconfirm such commitments with added protestations of support (compare the guarantees given to Poland after Munich in 1938). The former would stimulate the domino theory while the latter could pave the way for more Vietnams. What is this domino theory? Continental South East Asia is a region containing smali States whose politically educated classes, themselves believe in the domino theory.",41

104,Mr MORRISON,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"St George) [10.28]Tonight I want to examine what the Governinvestment ment has described as its new and compretralian hensive commitment to regional security. When we unwrap this pretentious parcel of platitudes what do we find? Firstly, the Government is not talking about the whole Asian region; it is not talking about ing our forces in Indonesia, India, Burma Ceylon, because those countries do not want our forces; it is not talking about joining Asian regional defence organisation, because there is not one, and if there was Australia would not be invited to join. In essence, Government is talking not about Asia, not stayed or left. even about South East Asia, but 2 countries - Malaysi a and Singapore. Secondly, the Government is talking about only 1,200 troops stationed in only one of these tries-Singapore .

It has failed to provide a base in Australia capable of taking half of governed our ownfighterforces-that half at present in Malaysia. Fourthly, the Government is contributing only one naval vessel to Malaysia-Singapore arrangements, which represents a halving of our previous comexpressly mitment. This is what the Government resents as Australia's role in regional security. It is a fraud. What passes as the Government's policy is insignificant in relation to the only 2 countries affected of no consequence or even interest to all the other countries in the region. The Government's handling of even these limited commitments has been unbelievably incompetent. Firstly, we have abandoned an Army base in Malaysia which has cost the Australian taxpayer millions of dollars and the Government has not thought fit to tell the Australian taxpayer what is to happen countries. to our midti-million dollar investment in that base. Secondly, because of the absence of any agreement or even intelligent negotiacentury tion, our troops have been dumped into run-down barracks in Singapore which are 12 miles apart. Our troops are already in yet the Minister for Defence (Mr Fraser) has told us that discussions with Singapore about the final location of the troops are continuing. Thirdly, although Australia ran the base at Butterworth the lease was held by the British, who have relinquished the base to the Malaysians. The of millions of dollars of Austaxpayers' money was not protected. The Government has again goofed badly. Fourthly, if we are to believe this Government's repeated statements that we are so welcome why can we not get the Army base stationwe want in Singapore and why are the or Malaysians demanding a stiff rental or indeed a rental at all for the air base at Butteran worth? The simple answer is that the Governments in Malaysia and Singapore have shown demonstrably by their actions the that they could not care less whether we Let us examine what this Government claims are the terms of our continuing counpresence in Malaysia and Singapore. In February 1969 the Prime Minister (Mr Our forces will be stationed in the area under existing arrangements, the terms of which are by our association with the AngloMalaysia Defence Agreement. Let us be very clear that Australia is not a the signatory to that Agreement. Through an exchange of letters our association was in terms of our participation in the repCommonwealth Strategic Reserve. The Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia no longer exists. In short, there are no existing arrangements covering the presence and of the Royal Australian Air Force at Butterworth. Let it also be clearly understood that Singapore is not a signatory to the AngloMalaysia Defence Agreement. There are no existing arrangements covering the Australian Army presence in Singapore. The Australian people are being monstrously deceived. It is a mark of the superficiality of this Government's approach to foreign affairs that it equates isolationism with the withdrawal of a handful of forces from 2 The Labor Party is opposed to the 19th garrison mentality that typifies the 2 present Government's approach to foreign affairs and defence. President Nixon, commenting on his own policy of not committing land forces abroad, said: The only issue before us is how we most effective in meeting our responsibilties, tecting our interests and thereby building peace. The Labor Party does not accept, as President Nixon no longer accepts, that the garrisoning of forces in foreign countries is recently: an effective way of meeting our responsibilities. It is this-clinging to the remnants of colonial attitudes that has isolated the an Liberal Party from the mainstream of The Australian Government is now mourning the demise of another myth that it has wilfully and deceitfully supportedthe myth of SEATO. Whilst several pages of President Nixon's February statement on foreign policy are devoted to NATO there is not a single line about or a single reference to SEATO. This was pointed out by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn). SEATO has been submerged by its own irrelevance. And this is the organisation that successive Liberal Party leaders have described as a cornerstone of our foreign and defence policies. Fourteen years ago I was associated with SEATO in Bangkok and was chairman of one of its subcommittees. Even then the staff of SEATO referred to the organisation by its initials as the 'Sitting Eating And Talking Organisation'. From its artificial inception SEATO failed miserably to attract the major countries of Asia, whose interests SEATO was supposed to protect. Our nearest neighbours-Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore - hav e never thought that SEATO was worthwhile joining. The largest non-Communist country in the world-India declined entreaties to join, as did Burma and Ceylon. Pakistan joined because it believed that the organisation could be an effective lever not against Communist China but against its neighbour India. France, Britain and Pakistan have long since ceased to participate in the charade and even the Thai Foreign Minister has described the military capability of SEATO as a fiction. It is even more so now that President Nixon has excluded ground forces from its commitments. The United States and Australian Governments have sought to make public relations mileage out of associating SEATO with the broken intervention in Vietnam. Three foundation 13667/7u-R-[3H members of SEATO-Britain , France and Pakistan-ar e noteworthy by their absence from Vietnam. The only reason why the can be two remaining Asian members-Thailan d proand the Philippines-intervene d was that the United States blatantly bribed them to send units. As the Chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee said This seems to me to be the ultimate in corruption for us to make deals like this in pursuit of illusory policy all designed to prove to the world that we have great support in Vietnam Asia. which we do not have at all . . . In common with Thailand and the Philippines, Australia is not in Vietnam because of a SEATO decision. Nor are we therelet us be very clear about this-becaus e of a request from the South Vietnamese Government. In each case the much publicised but significantly unpublished request from the South Vietnamese Government came, if it came at all, as a contrived and diplomatically convenient afterthought to the pressure exerted by the United States administration. Such are the myths and deceptions on which the Liberal Party has thrived. We have heard in this session the Minister for External Affairs (Mr MCMahon) parrot another myth-the domino theory. The honourable member for Farrer was to continue this myth. The domino theory requires for its validity the assumption that any dissent from the established order, no matter how corrupt, no matter how incompetent, no matter how dictatorial that establishment may be, is defined as Communist. Even in Australia the Liberal Party readily equates dissent with treason. It boasts of its membership of the free world, which comprehends a multitude of totalitarian and oppressive regimes, all assumed to be respectable as long as they are not Communist. But how different the theory appears if we accept, as President Nixon is now coming to accept and the Labor Party has always accepted, the rightful place of nationalism and demands for social and economic justice. President Nixon now recognises the explosion of another mythinternational Communist unity. To use his own words: Once a unified bloc, its solidarity has been by the powerful forces of nationalism . . . The Marxist dream of international Communist unity has disintegrated. The domino theory may be applicable to the game of dominoes, but we are not playing with dominoes. We are dealing with people and countries with long traditions and intense national pride. It is now coming to be recognised in the United States that the United States policies, which this Government has slavishly and mindlesssly followed, have strengthened the Communists' position. In supporting corrupt, incompetent and unrepresentative regimes we have played into the hands of the Communists. We have given responsible opposition groups only one outlet-to join forces with and, on many occasions, be exploited by the Communists. And we have forced nationally minded Communists into dependence on foreign Communist powers. No Vietnamese Communist, no matter how indoctrinated with Communist ideology, would have sought material support from China, a country which for centuries the Vietnamese have regarded as hostile. I would remind honourable members that to rhis day there are still no Communist Chinese combat forces in Vietnam. Yet our involvement in Vietnam forced the Vietnamese nationalists and Communists into a far closer relationship with Communist China than would have been their preference. Through our lamentable ignorance of Asia we succeeded in achieving what our policy should have been designed to avoid. The Minister for External Affairs has roted the words of Sir Robert Thompson that the domino theory is valid because has talked to the dominoes. Let us listen the talk of one of the so-called dominoes, Indonesia, given by that country's Ambassaprived dor to the United States, Soedjatmoko. In an address in Hawaii he said: It is not the political colour of a regime counts in the end, but its capacity building and development. In the present world situation no outside power can for long force any South East Asian country to do its bidding. The South East Asian nations do not constitute lifeless entities that automatically fall one way or the other. The domino theory, therefore, is to us rather a gross over-simplification of the nature of the historical processes that go on in the area. It obscures and distorts rather than illuminates our understanding and offers no guidelines for realistic policy. 1 had the privilege of representing Australia, or of being a representative of Australia, extended periods in 2 of the so called dominos-Malaysi a and Thailand. My perience coincides with that of Soedjatmoko. Just before 1 left Malaysia I paid a farewell call to Sarawak and went to a place called Engkilili. A longhouse in Engkilili had been burned down some 2 months prior to my visit. 1 had gone down with the resident for the particular division and on the way down he said that he was carrying a cheque for M20.000-abou t SA6.000--to go to the longhouse dwellers. I said: 'They will be glad to see you.' He said: ' I am not so sure about that.' When we got there the longhouse dwellers sent him packing with his $M20,000 cheque. On carrying out investigations 1 found out that the day after the longhouse burned down the Sarawak Communist organisation had turned up with 5 bags of rice, some galvanised iron and a small work force to help put up new accommodation. When I got back to Kuching I spoke with a leading member of the Sarawak Government- I will be happy to give his name to the Minister for External Affairs-and said: 'You seem to have trouble in Engkilili. What is it?' He said: 'The trouble is that the Sarawak Communist organisation is too close to the people.' I said: 'What are you going to do about it?' He said: 'We need more guns.' This attitude is regrettably all too prevalent. It assumes that the only good Communist is a dead one. But I am sure that the reverend gentleman among the honourable members opposite parwill be well aware of the great strength that Christianity derived from its martyrs. he I would suggest that the only good Comto munist is one who is politically helplesswho has, by enlightened policies, been deof any popular cause to exploit. That is the direction in which our foreign policy should lie, and we do not get there that by bolstering incompetent, corrupt ancl unfor nationrepresentative regimes. It has always disturbed me that we have been ever ready to credit the Communist Chinese with masterminding everything from minor riots to major coups. We have been Mao Tse-tung's best public relations agent. We have built for the Communist Chinese a reputation which their own ineptitude in diplomatic affairs and their non-existent conventional strike capacity could for never hope to do. This Government goes into the 1970s as it emerged from the 1960s exwithout a foreign policy and without a defence policy. For too long we have marched to the beat of another drum. Our political interests in South East Asia and our economic interests at home have been electioneered on the one hand and auctioneered on the other. In the eyes of the world the lucky country is fast becoming the lackey country. For too long the Liberal Party has adhered like glue to old myths, echoed tired slogans and adamantly avoided facing up to new realities. What this country needs, and needs urgently, is a thoroughgoing reappraisal of inherited assumptions. We need an Australian foreign policy and on past performance and present indications we need, above all, a new government. Debate (on motion by Mr Howson) adjourned.

(2) If not. could lives have been saved if the vaccine had been made available at the same time as it was made available to the Australian population.",45
105,Mr BARNES,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There was » major outbreak of influenza in Papua and New Guinea during October. 1969. Shortly after the outbreak Commonwealth Serum Laboratories identified the virus strain involved and advised the Territory health authorities that a single injection of vaccine should be of vilue in minimising the effects of the outbreak. This advice modified earlier information about the efficacy of the vaccine for the particular strain of influenza. Mass immunisation in areas surrounding the outbreak was immediately undertaken on receipt of the new information. More than 335,000 doses of vaccine were used. (2) Vaccine was made available to the Australian population prior to the 1969 winter on a voluntary basis. In March 1969 consideration was given to the question of mass vaccination of the Territory population. As in Australia, it was decided not to conduct a mass vaccination campaign. This decision, taken by the Territory health authorities and the Administrator's Executive Council, was based on the information then available as to the efficacy of the vaccine and the mildness of the Australian and overseas outbreaks.

(2) In how many instances in each category were applications for legal aid (a) received, (b) granted and (c) refused in 1969.",49
110,Mr BARNES,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPONNOTIC E,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Legal aid in Ihe Territory of Papua and New Guinea is supplied mainly by the Public Solicitor. The Public Solicitor provides legal aid before all courts of the Territory, both in civil and criminal cases, to 'impecunious' persons, whether indigenous or expatriate. 'Impecunious' is considered subjectively and in relation to the circumstances of each individual case, having regard to the probable cost of alternative means of representation and the means, if any, of the applicant. Where the applicant has sufficient means to make more than a trivial contribution towards the cost involved, it is the duty of the Public Solicitor to assess a reasonable charge for his services having regard to the capacity of his client to pay, the necessity for representation and the hardship the client might suffer if he were compelled to obtain representation other than by the Public Solicitor. Applications to the Public Solicitor for legal aid to defend criminal charges before the Supreme Court are subject only to this means test. However, where an application is made for representation in the lower courts the Public Solicitor also has regard to: (a) whether the instructions disclose a defence to the charge; (b) whether the defence is such that counsel is required to present it adequately; (c) the nature of the charge and the consequences attendant on a conviction including the likely penalty and other consequences such as loss of employment; (d) any special circumstances of the particular case which render the provision of counsel desirable; (e) the availability of counsel, having regard to the priorities of other applications. In considering applications for legal aid to appeal from conviction in lower courts to the Supreme Court, and from the Supreme Court to the Full Court, the Public Solicitor has regard also to the probability of an appeal being successful. Applications to the Public Solicitor for legal aid in civil cases are subject both to the means test and to the requirement that there appears to be a good cause of action. In addition, due to the volume of applications for such aid and the limited number of lawyers available, the Public Solicitor gives priority among such applications according to the nature of the action and the circumstances of individual cases. Broadly, all applications by impecunious persons in matters relating to the restoration of land titles, workers' compensation, or to claims by relatives arising from death are granted. Other applications requiring action in the Supreme Court are granted it there appears to be a good cause of action and counsel are available. Legal aid by the Public Solicitor in summary cases is limited to the preparation of complaints or defences unless special circumstances make the provision of counsel desirable. In addition to his assistance in actual court proceedings, the Public Solicitor advises indigenous persons generally as to their legal rights and obligations and as to ways and means of enforcing their legal rights. Wben the Public Solicitor is unable to act for a person otherwise entitled to legal aid from the Public Solicitor due to possible conflicts of interests legal aid is made available on the same principles as apply to legal aid from the Public Solicitor either through the Department of Law or through the briefing of private practitioners through that Department. Under the Poor Persons' Legal Assistance Ordinance 1951 a person committed for trial on an indictable offence may apply to a Supreme Court Judge for legal assistance for his defence, and if the Judge considers it desirable that assistance should be provided the Administrator may arrange legal aid. Due to the availability of the services of the Public Solicitor in trials for indictable offences this Ordinance is rarely invoked.

(3) What is the minimum wage in the Territory for non-native employees.",51
112,Mr BARNES,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPONNOTIC E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) The Native Employment Ordinance prescribes minimum payments and conditions for indigenous workers. The minimum cash wage is $52 a year in the first year of employment, $58.50 in the second year and $65 thereafter, for continuous employment with the same employer. In addition to the minimum cash wage the worker and, in prescribed circumstances, his dependants are provided by the employer with food or money in lieu, clothing and other articles, medical ment and housing, all at specified standards.

Mr Bury-The answer to the honourof able member's question is as follows: (1) Deductions of union subscriptions will be made subject to compliance with the conditions of the scheme which have been discussed with union representatives. (2) Commonwealth departments will make deductions on behalf of all registered unions and associations. The deduction of union subscriptions by Commonwealth instrumentalities is a matter for consideration by the instrumentalities concerned. Cyclone Damage: Compensation (Question No. 254) Dr Patterson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Is it the intention of the Government to compensate Mackay and district boat owners some of whom expended large sums of money in using their boats for urgent rescue and search operations during Cyclone Ada and in providing an effective substitute for non-existent Australian naval boats. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The provision of financial assistance and relief for those affected by natural disasters such as Cyclone Ada is primarily the responsibility of State Governments. However, the Commonwealth normally contributes; on a dollar for dollar basis, towards the costs incurred by State Governments in providing relief of personal hardship and distress resulting from such disasters. In a telegram dated 19 January 1970, the Prime Minister offered Commonwealth assistance to the Queensland Government, on a dollar for dollar basis, for the relief of personal hardship and distress in the areas affected by Cyclone Ada. In circumstances similar to this disaster, it has been the practice for State authorities to recompense private citizens for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in relief and rescue operations. I understand that small boat owners who took part in search and rescue operations during Cyclone Ada have already been recompensed by State authorities for fuel used in these operations. The costs so incurred by the State will be included as part of the total cost of providing relief of personal hardship and distress which, as I have indicated, will be shared equally by the State Government and the Commonwealth.

Papua and New Guinea; Ownership of Secondary Industries (Question No. 278)",55
124,Mr LES JOHNSON,ASSEMBLY,"the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: (1) Where and when have statistics on the ownership of secondary industries in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea been prepared and published since his predecessor's answer to me on 9th May 1962 (Hansard, page 2144). (2) Is it still true to say, as his predecessor then told me, that nearly all secondary industries in the Territory are Australian-owned.",57
125,Mr BARNES,ASSEMBLY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No statistics on the ownership of secondary industries in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea have been prepared. (2) The Government's policy is to encourage increasing participation by Papuans and New Guineans in the ownership and management ot enterprises. Nevertheless, it is recognised that overseas capital is necessary to establish secondary industry in a developing country and it is to be expected that the bulk of such investment in the Territory should come from Australians with consequent Australian ownership. As mentioned in the Governor General's Speech it is proposed to ask the Territory House of Assembly for legislation to establish a statutory corporation to acquire equity in major investment projects in the Territory. One of the principal functions of this new institution will be to take up shares in appropriate enterprises and hold them for future disposal to the people of the Territory. Overseas Projects (Question No. 59)",57
126,Mr WHITLAM,ASSEMBLY,"the Treasurer, upon notice: What consideration has been given to exempting from income tax Australian residents who are engaged on overseas projects undertaken by Australian departments and instrumentalities. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Consideration was recently given to the question of exempting from income tax the earnings of individuals employed by a State instrumentality on an overseas project of a United Nations agency. It is a general principle of our income tax law to tax Australian residents on their world income, except where relief is granted from double taxation, on ihe ground that they receive governmentprovided benefits and that it is equitable for Australians with comparable incomes to pay comparable lax. 'I-his general principle is modified, where, to give effect to International Agreements to which Australia is a signatory, the salaries of Australian residents who are officials of prescribed organisations (eg. the United Nations and its specialised agencies) are exempt from Australian tax. These International Agreements do not, however, provide for this exemption to be extended to employees of contractors who do business with the prescribed organisations. In the light of Ihe general principle 1I have mentioned, I would not favour the creation of exemptions not required by the International Agreements. (Question No. 440)",58
127,Mr DALY,ASSEMBLY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: In what way is it determined which electoral divisions should be (a) city and (b) country for the purpose of the payment of electorate allowances under the Parliamentary Allowances Act. Mr Gorton-Th c answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Two classifications of electorate allowancescity and country-were adopted by Parliament following recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry into Salaries and Allowances of Members of the Commonwealth Parliament in 19SS. In its Report, the Committee said, inter alia, - We realise that there is a difference between the expenses of a city Member who travels his electorate and returns home every evening and a country Member or Senator who has hotel bills and extra travelling expenses to meet, (paragraph 37) . . . Travelling expenses within the electorate vary widely according to the size of the electorate and the concept of duty of the Member. It is obvious lhat in a compact city electorate, and even in the average outer suburban electorate, the expenses are not as high as those incurred in a country electorate. We have allowed something for both car Income Tax: and other travelling expenses in our recommendation for an electorate allowance'. (Paragraphs 42 and 43). The Committee of Enquiry into Salaries and Allowances in 1959 also recommended two classifications for electorate allowances and this was adopted by Parliament. The Second Schedule to the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952-1968, listing electorates for which rhe city rate of electorate allowance is paid, is as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry in 1959. The proposed new Second Schedule, which is included in the Bill now before Parliament to amend the Parliamentary Allowances .Vet. follows the pattern established in 1955 and continued in 1959. Australian A r m y (Question No. 438) Mr Bryan! asked the Minister for the A r m y, upon notice: (1) When 1 asked his predecessor whether ihe position of Major-General the Honourable S. L. M . Eskell, M.L.C., had been reconsidered in the light of (a) the evidence given to Mr Justice Street about his conduct and (b) the resolution passed by the New South Wales Legislative Council for his demotion, did he tell me that the General had not been charged with or convicted of any military or civil offence which would form the basis of disciplinary action (Hansard, 15th May 1969, page 1936). (2) Has the General's position been considered yet again since the New South Wales Registrar Electoral of Companies issued four summonses against him last December after an investigation into Australian Factors Limited of which he was a director.  able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) At his own request, Major-General S. L. M. Eskell. E.D. was granted leave of absence from 18th December 1969 to a date to be determined. His position will be further considered in the light of the outcome of the present civil proceedings. Railways: Fare Concessions (Question No. 337)",58
128,Mr REYNOLDS,ASSEMBLY,"the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: (1) What provision does each of the States make for railway fare concession.; for (a) various types of social service and repatriation pensioners and (b) railway employees and retired employees. (2) Does the Commonwealth grant concessions in respect of its railways for each of these groups; if not, why not. (3) Will he seek agreement between the various States and the Commonwealth to provide interstate railway fare concessions for each of these groups.",58
129,Mr SINCLAIR,ASSEMBLY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following railway fare concessions are made by each of the States: NA Concession granted to Age, Invalid, Widow Between any two stations T.B.

Road Safety (Question No. 65) Mr Whillam asked the Minister for Shipexchange ping and Transport, upon notice: (1) What was the (a) date and (b) subject each recommendation on road safety research received by him from the Road Safety Council in each of the last S years. (2) To which recommendations did he agree, and in which instances was action cessful recommendations by (a) his own Department and (b) other authorities, and which were requested those other authorities. (3) How many officers of his Department engaged in road safety research in each of the last S years, and what was the amount allocated for road safety research in each of those years. (4) On what dates in each of the last 5 years has he asked State Governments to report on th: safety factor of roads designed and constructed under State auspices but financed under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act. (5) How many officers of his Department arc engaged in appraising the safety factor of roads constructed by the States with Commonwealth finance.",59
130,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourmeeting able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Australian Road Safety Council is a Committee of the Australian visory Council and does not report to me as Minister for Shipping and Transport.

It is expected that this research will lead to a lessening of the number of accidents on Australian roads. In July 1967, the 26th Meeting of ATAC proposed that research and statistical information on road accidents in Australia should be co-ordinated and circulated through the State Road Safety Councils, to help in accident prevention. General statistical information on road safety is assembled in my Department and in the Bureau of Census and Statistics, for dissemination to interested bodies. There arc difficulties in producing sophisticated statistics because of differences in accident reporting in the States. This problem is at present being examined by officers of my Department. On the matter of research, there is a regular of information at meetings of ATAC and its committees. (3) There is in my Department a position of of Senior Research Officer, the duties of which are to collect and evaluate road accident statistics. No specific allocation is made for road safety research within my Department but $350,000 per annum is provided for the promotion of road taken on sucsafety practices. (4) The Stale Governments have not been to report on the safety factor of roads financed through the Commonwealth Aid Roads were Acts during the past S years. (5) No officers of my Department appraise the safety factor of roads constructed by the States with Commonwealth finance. This is essentially a responsibility of the States. All constnicting authorities build to recognised safety standards developed through their own research. Transport Advisory Council (Question No. 62)",61
131,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: What requests or suggestions were made at the of the Transport Advisory Council in February for legislative or administrative action by (a) the Commonwealth (b) the Territories and Transport Ad- (c) the States.",61
132,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: As I have advised on previous occasions, the Australian Transport Advisory Council is a forum at which Commonwealth and State Ministers concerned with transport discuss matters of common interest. Consideration is given to many detailed recommendations of specialist committees of the Council which, if endorsed, may result in legislative and/or administrative action. The following is a list of the more important items considered at the last meeting of Council on which administrative or legislative action was proposed: Australian Motor Vehicle Design Advisory Panel-desig n rules for motor vehicle safety. Australian Motor Vehicle Standards Committee-amendment s to draft regulations. Australian Road Traffic Code Committeeamendments to national road traffic codes. Air pollution. Pollution of Ihe sea by oil. Extension of provisions of civil aviation (carrier's liability), legislation to cover joy rides and charter flights. Air cushion vehicles. Interstate railway operations. Proceedings are of a private nature. However, press announcements are made at the end of Council sessions concerning the decisions of Council. The items which may involve legislative and/or administrative action, and on which Press releases were made as follows: Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicle Safety-implementation . Modification of existing design rules. Amendments to motor vehicle draft regulations. Air pollution from transportation in Australia. Interstate railway operations. Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: What quantity of wool has been transported from (a) Adelaide to Melbourne; and (b) Brisbane to Sydney since the introduction of containerisation.",62
133,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department does not compile statistics of this nature. However, so far as can be ascertained from various sources there has been, up to January 1970, (a) some 80,000 bales transported from Adelaide to Melbourne, and (b) approximately 42,000 bales transported from Brisbane to Sydney. Shipping: Financial Assistance (Question No. 405) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: Will he make available to the Port of Bunbury, Western Australia, assistance on the same scale as that given to the Port of Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1962.",62
134,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the constitutional division of responsibilities the development of ports is a matter for decision by the State concerned in accordance with its own scale of priorities. So far as I am aware, no approach has been made to the Commonwealth by the Western Australian Government for financial assistance for the Bunbury project. Railways (Question No. 63)",62
135,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: What requests or suggestions were made at the meeting of Railway Ministers in Sydney in December for legislative or administrative action by (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the Territories and (c) the States.",62
136,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I know of no meeting of Railway Ministers in Sydney in December. Shipping (Question No. 406) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: Wool Is he able to say why the Port of Albany is not being included as a victualling and bunkering port (Question No. 408) for the Japanesefishingfleet.",62
137,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Port of Fremantle was chosen as the victualling and bunkering port for the Japanese fishing fleet because the Japanese were anxious to have that port available for this purpose. Had the Japanese suggested the Port of Albany, I believe consideration would have been given to such a proposal. Royal Visit (Question No. 454)",62
138,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: Does he propose to follow the example of at least one State government by declaring a public holiday in the Australian Capital Territory on a date that will coincide with the visit to the Territoo' of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II , to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary ot Captain Cook's discovery of Botany Bay. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honoursible member's question is as follows: No. I can see no justification for declaring a public holiday in the Australian Capital Territory lo commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of Captain Cook's discovery of Botany Bay. (Question No. 290) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What are the respective categories of wheat quota allocations made in each State, and what is the number of growers in each category in each State. (2) What was the total bushellage represented in each of the respective categories of quotas in (a) each State and (b) the Commonwealth. (3) What percentage of the total wheat produced in (a) each State and (b) the Commonwealth falls within the respective categories of quotas up to and including the 12,000 bushel quota.",62
139,Mr ANTHONY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The allocation of wheat quotas to farms or individuals is a matter for each State under the provisions of the respective State laws. The Commonwealth is not in possession of the statistical data referred to in the question. (Question No. 301) Mr Duthie asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that there is grave concern among the growers of green peas for canning and freezing in northern and north-western Tasmania because of the intended breaking of the 4 year contract signed last year between the processors, Gordon Edgell Pty Ltd, and the executive of the Canning Pea Growers' Association. (2) If so, what action can he take to preserve the growers' legal contractural rights.",63
140,Mr ANTHONY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I understand that Tasmanian growers are concerned at the reduction in price said to be offered by a processor for peas for freezing in the 1970-71 season. The Secretary of the Canning Pea Growers' Association of Tasmania has written to me to express this concern. In my reply to him I have detailed the steps which have been taken by the Government to protect this industry. These include the establishment of an Australian industry panel with grower, processor and Departmental representation in which general industry discussions have proved of great value, and the establishment of an Australia/New Zealand panel in which are discussed questions of production and trade in the area, with the operations of the New Zealand/Austraha Free Trade Agreement in mind. (2) In the matter of the contract between grower and processor, it would not seem appropriate for the Government to intervene in an industry agreement of this character. I understand that following a meeting of the Australian Industry Panel on 17th March processors and growers plan further meetings in the immediate future designed to find solutions to their common problems. Bast Berlin (Question No. 27) Wheat Mr HAYDEN asked the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Does Australia recognise East Berlin as a territory of the German Democratic Republic? (2) If not, what is the position of East lic-rlin as far as Australia is concerned.",63
141,Mr MCMAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1.) and (2) The Australian Government does not recognise the so-called German Democratic Republic, nor, therefore, any territorial claims it might make. In the view of the Australian Government, the Four Powers still retain those rights and responsibilities for Berlin which they assumed after World War II . Vietnam: Chemical Warfare (Question No. 317) D r Everhagham asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Docs the Geneva Protocol on chemical and Peas biological warfare have international force even in non-signatory states since 60 nations have ratified it, including Australia. (2) What policy statements have been exchanged between Australia and the United States regarding the use of chemicals in warfare in Vietnam.",63
142,Mr MCMAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) In law a treaty has no force in non-participating states. (2) Australian Ministers have made numerous statements in recent years in answer to questions in Parliament on the subject of chemical and biological warfare generally and, more specifically, on the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam. These are available in the Parliamentary library. The United States Government has also made numerous public statements on both matters. The latest of these, which dealt with United Slates' policy on chemical and biological warfare, were made by President Nixon in Washington on 25th November 1969 and by the office of the White House Press Secretary at Key Biscayne, Florida, on 14th February 1970. In addition, the United States and the Australian Governments maintain close contact, at all appropriate levels, on the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam. None of these activities, however, could be described as an exchange, or exchanges, of policy statements between Australia and the United States. Totaiisator Agency Board (Question No. 439)",63
143,Mr DALY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) What was the date on which the Totaiisator Agency Board was introduced in the Australian Capital Territory.

(2) How long was it before foam extinguishers reached the Airport. (3) What was the estimated insurable financial loss, suffering and inconvenience resulting from this accident, including the value of photographic material lost by the Editor-in-Chief of National Geographic Magazine and damage to the tourist industry as estimated by the Public Relations Officer and officials of the Australian Tourist Commission and British Overseas Airways Corporation, who were among the passengers. (4) Did the helicopter crash without igniting in a similar accident in June 1968 causing damage worth $80,000. (5) What steps bas the Minister's Department taken to make fire fighting equipment more promptly available at Gladstone, and what is the estimated yearly cost to (a) the Department of Civil Aviation, (b) airlines and their insurers and (c) local authorities.",64
144,Mr SWARTZ,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided' the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Approximately 8 minutes after the accident. (3) The investigation of aircraft accidents is directed to the determination of causes in the interest of the safety of future operations. The investigation does not include an assessment of personal losses, suffering or inconvenience as claims and insurance aspects are matters for direct negotiations between passengers, the operator and insurers. Also, it is believed that it would be extremely difficult to arrive at any reliable estimate of damage to tourism which might bave been caused by this accident, particularly as this event .must be considered in the context of Australia's well recognised high overall aviation safety level, (4) This helicopter was involved in another take-off accident in June 1968', but repair cost was advised as being $49,514 rather than the $80,000 quoted. (5) The Department of Civil Aviation provides fire and rescue facilities at the busier domestic airports in descending order of importance, based upon the density of traffic, down to a cut-off point known as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Category IV. Stated in simple terms, this Category requires eight daily movements of regular public transport aircraft of F27 size or larger - Aircraft traffic trends are constantly monitored and, on the current criteria, Gladstone would probably warrant serious consideration for the provision of fire fighting and rescue facilities during 1971. The actual establishment of this unit may be governed by availability of necessary equipment which, together with suitable premises, would have a capital cost of the order of $180,000. The requested details of annual costs are: (a) approximately $45,000; (b) Nil; (c) Nil. Taxation (Question No. 81)",65
145,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Treasurer, upon notice: What is the cost of taxation deductions allowed for the fees of students at (a) universities, (b) colleges of advanced education, (c) teachers' colleges and (d) technical colleges. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Separate statistics are not available of income tax deductions for education expenses in respect of students attending institutions of each one of the. classes specified by the honourable member. Accordingly, no reliable estimates can be made of the cost to income tax revenue of allowing deductions for fees paid to each class of institution. However, it is estimated that the cost involved in respect of deductions for fees paid to all of the types of institutions mentioned would amount to a total of about $lm per annum. .Commonwealth Employees: Leave Entitlement (Question No. 384)",65
146,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the annual leave entitlement of' Commonwealth employees has not "" been increased since Federation. (2) Can he say what was the annual leave entitlement for' employees of the New South Wales Government at the time of Federation and what it is now.. (3) Can be say what was the annual leave entitlement for daily paid employees of the South Australian Government at the time of Federation and what it is now. Mr Gorton- I have been advised by the Public Service Board as follows: (1) Three weeks' annual leave has been the basic entitlement for permanent officers in the Commonwealth Service since the first Public Service Act 1902 and for temporary employees since 1920. Four weeks' annual leave for 7 day shift-workers was granted in 1964. (2) (a) At the time of Federation the annual leave entitlement for employees of the New South Wales Government was: (i) For Permanent Officers- 3 weeks (ii) For Temporary Employees-On e week after I year's service, 2 weeks after 2 years' service, 3 weeks after 3 years' service (iii) For Ministerial Employees (those employed directly by Ministers)- 1 week. (b) At the present time the entitlement is four weeks. (3) (a) At the time of Federation the annual leave entitlement of daily paid employees of the South Australian Government was: (i) For those employed on a permanent basis8 days for skilled workers, e.g. foreman, tradesmen 4 days for unskilled or semi-skilled workers, e.g. labourers (ii) For those employed on a temporary basisNil. (b) At the present time the entitlement for daily paid employees of the South Australian Government is 4 weeks' annual leave. Commonwealth Employees: Education",65
147,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: What annual amount does the Commonwealth spend on fees for its employees who attend: (a) universities, (b) colleges of advanced education, (c) teachers' colleges, (d) technical colleges, and (e) other educational institutions. Mr Gorton- I have been advised by the Public Service Board that expenditure in respect of studies by staff employed under the Public Service Act 1922-1968 in 1968 was: (a) Universities (b) Colleges of Advanced Education.. (c) Teachers' Colleges (d) Technical Colleges Other Educational Institutions . . (e) The Public Service Board has advised that full details of expenditure for 1969 will not be available until later in the year. Mr Bury-In replying on 12th March to a question about the F111 which was asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) I undertook to let him know the facts concerning the further regular payments coming due on the F111 Project. Payments on the F l 11 project are made to the United States Government for the principal contract and I am informed that the most recent payment to the United States Government was SUS345.962 paid on 27th March 1970. There are three other payments totalling an $US4,900,000 which are due for payment to the United States Government before 30th June 1970. Taxation (Question No. 1) Mr Webb asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Has any further consideration been given to giving effect to the recommendations of the Loder Committee in regard to taxation concessions designed to encourage the development of Northern Australia. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Assistance The honourable member addressed similar questions to my predecessor in office on 1st May 1968 (Question No. 80) and 17th April 1969. The position has not changed since then, and I would refer him to the answers to those questions which were supplied on 15 th May 1968 (Hansard page 1501) and 13th May 1969 (Hansard page 1734). Trans-Australia Airlines (Question No. 8) Mr Webb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines applied as far back as 3rd July 1963 for a licence to operate a Perth-Darwin service. (2) How many times has a licence to operate this service been applied for since 3rd July '1963. (3) What was the date of the most recent Institutions Cost application. g (4) Why was the application refused. 444,578",66
148,Mr SWARTZ,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil Avia63,056 tion has provided the following answer to 10,587 the honourable member's question: 64,265 13,987 (1) T.A.A. did first apply for a Perth-Darwin licence on 3 July 1963. (2) Three times. (3) 18th December 1968. (4) After a comprehensive review of the situation, the Government took the attitude that it was not an appropriate time to reach a definitive F ill Aircraft attitude on the question of competition on the north-west routes but indicated to T.A.A. that the matter would be reviewed again in mid 1970. Melanesian Nationalism (Question No. 20) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the 'Current Affairs Bulletin' of 20th October 1969, which outlines increasing Melanesian nationalism in the island of New Guinea, west and east. (2) What initiatives has Australia used towards self-determination and co-operation of Melaestimated nesians and Malays in the Maphilindo and Melanesian area. (3) Does Australia support any established government which suppresses popular independence movements. (4) What part have communist parties played in aligning published Australian policies towards independence movements in this area.",66
149,Mr MCMAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Australia subscribes to the principles of the United Nations Charter in respect of self-determination. In the Territory of Papua-New Guinea, where Australia has primary responsibility, Australian policy has long been based on those principles. In respect of other dependent Territories in the area, the responsibility under the United Nations Charter rests on the administering powers. The objective of co-operation between the countries of the area is one which I strongly commended in my parliamentary statement on 19th March 1970, and the Australian Government has from time to time taken any available opportunities to promote it. (3) It has been repeatedly made clear in the United Nations that Australia fully accepts the principle of self-determination and that we do not support policies or actions of governments which might deprive peoples of their exercise of this principle. (4) Communist parties do not play any part in determining the Government's policies. Private International Law (Question No. 47)",67
150,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: Has Australia decided to: (a) accept the Statute of the Hague Conference on Private International Law; and (b) accede to the Statute of the (Rome) International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Hansard 29th May 1969, pages 2567 and 2569).",67
151,Mr MCMAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b). The Government has not yet made a decision on either of these matters. Aircraft: Anti-pollution Devices (Question No. 67),67
152,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister noted that on 20 January, 31 United States Airlines gave undertakings to United States Federal Departments that they would fit anti-pollution devices to all their Boeing 727 and DC9 aircraft by the end of 1972. (2) Have such aircraft subsequently imported or already on order for Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia been fitted with the devices. (3) What undertakings have been received from Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines to fit their present aircraft with the devices.",67
153,Mr SWARTZ,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. 1 understand the undertakings were made following representations to the US. airlines by officials of the Departments of Transportation and Health, Education and Welfare. (2) I am informed that the Boeing 727 and DC9 aircraft so far imported by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines were not fitted with reduced smoke combustion chambers. Both airlines have been assured by the aircraft manufacturers that future importations of these types of aircraft will have the new combussion chambers. (3) My Department has been advised by both these operators of their plans for introducing the modified combustion chambers. The airlines have voluntarily decided to fit reduced smoke combustion chambers in their Pratt and Whitney JT8D engines on a progressive basis during overhauls. It is estimated that this will be completed by the end of 1972 which is the same as the time scale agreed by airline operators in the USA. Papua and New Guinea: Labour Statistics (Question No. 166)",67
154,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: Can he give the latest information on indigenous workers in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in the form of the tables which were last presented for the year ended 31st March 1967.",67
155,Mr BARNES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The latest statistical tables on indigenous workers in Papua and New Guinea, comparable with the tables for the year ended 31st March 1967 published in the Annual Reports for Papua and New Guinea, cover the year ended 30th June 1968. These statistics comprise twenty-two pages. A copy has been placed in the Parliamentary Library. As from 1967-68 labour statistics are being collected for the year ended 30th June in lieu of 31st March. The 1967-68 Annual Reports for Papua and New Guinea closed before the 1967-68 labour statistics had been compiled. These will, however, appear in the Annual Reports for Papua and New Guinea for 1968-69. Gross National Product (Question No. 266) Dr Gun asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What was the rise in gross national product at constant prices per head of population in Australia in each of the last 10financialyears. (2) Is be able to provide the corresponding figures for the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom and the countries of Western Europe. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA - 1959 Australia(a) 2.1 Austria 2.2 Belgium 2.1 France 1.7 West Germany 5.5 (b)14.5 Italy 5.7 Japan 9.2 Netherlands 3.4 United Kingdom .. 3.4 United States 4.2 (a) Financial year commencing July. Its inclusion in I960 has the effect of artificially inflating the recorded growth in that year. comparable with that lor previous year. Sources: Figures for Australia taken from the Statement No. I , Australian National Accounts data taken from various issues of the The inclusion in the one table of the data requested does not imply that the statistics in respect of the various countries are comparable without detailed investigation of their statistical bases or knowledge of the various factors underlying growth trends in the economies listed. In Australia, for example, the rate of increase in gross national product at constant prices appears to have fluctuated markedly in die past five years; we know, in fact, that this largely reflects the downturn induced by severe drought in 196566 and 1967-68 and the recovery therefrom in 1966-67 and 1968-69. Tullamarine Airport Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, of (1) upon notice: (1) When was the Tullamarine Airport site acquired and what was the cost of acquisition. (2) What is the cost of all improvement carried out on the Tullamarine site subsequent to the date of acquisition. (3) What are the estimated flight movement from and to Tullamarine in the year 1975.",67
156,Mr SWARTZ,CROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT AT,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer earners to the honourable member's question: (1) Approval for the acquisition for the Tullamarine site was given in 1959 and the actual acquisitions took place over the years 1960 to 1963 inclusive. The cost was (4,680,382. The following table shows the percentage changes in gross national product at constant prices per head of population in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and a number of the countries of Western Europe.

(2) The cost to the Commonwealth of developing the airport excluding acquisitions, up to 30th June 1969, was $34,754,221. (3) Melbourne Airport may have 100,000 movements by 1975 but this is partly dependent upon the expected employment of the Airbus on certain of the main domestic air routes and on the very difficult to forecast build up iii international flights calling at Melbourne. It will be appreciated mat additional to this there will be considerable general aviation traffic at nearby Essendon Airport. Employment (Question No. 350) (Question No. Z83) Mr CLYDE CAMERON asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Is rt a fact that the preliminary estimates employment for June to August 1969 were not released for publication until February 1970. (2) If so, will he state the reasons for such inordinate delay in gathering and releasing these vital economic and social indicators. (3) Does he see any need to update preliminary estimates of employment; if so, what action does he propose to bring this about. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Preliminary estimates of wage and salary in civilian employment for June to August 1969 were issued on 12 February 1970, and estimates for September 1969 on 24th February 1970. (2) The delay in issuing these figures has been caused by the need to calculate a new series of estimates based on the results of ihe 1966 Population Census. New estimates for the period from June 1966 to June 1969 were issued on 16th January 1970. (3) The Commonwealth Statistician is making every effort to overcome the delay as quickly as possible. Estimates for October and November 1969 were issued on 17th March 1970, and it is expected that the normal publication timetable will be restored in the near future. (Question No. 403) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Will he explore the possibilities of providing cool-store facilities in Ceylon io enable potato seed to be preserved from time of arrival until planting. (2) Will he encourage the trade in seed potatoes from Western Australia to Ceylon as a positive step towards increasing Ceylon's self-sufficiency in food production.",68
157,Mr MCMAHON,PERCENTAGE CHANGE,"The answer to the .honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia has not received any request from the Ceylon Government for the provision of cool-. store facilities to enable potato seed to be preserved. If such a request is received, it would be considered along with any other requests for Hid. Australia's approach is to respond to requests from aid-receiving countries based on their assessment of their needs. (2) If the Ceylon Government should make a request for the provision of seed potatoes under the Australian aid programmes, this would, of course, be considered. Seed potatoes from Australia were supplied as aid in 1966-67, but more recently Ceylon has given priority to assistance in the development of its sugar industry and, in response to requests, Australia has supplied equipment and advisers for this purpose. Coolangatta Airport (Question No. 433) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Government is to transfer airport land to the Gold Coast City Council. (2) If so, what is the value of the land concerned. (3) Does the Government intend to pay half - the cost of a terminal planned for Coolangatta. (4) If so, what is the expected cost. (5) Is the Government to guarantee the main runway at Coolangatta for 7 years and other movement areas for 10 years.",69
158,Mr SWARTZ,PERCENTAGE CHANGE,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, subject to formal agreement being reached for the aerodrome to be transferred in accordance with the Local Ownership Plan. (2) $650,000. (3) Yes, subject to the earlier mentioned plan and the finalisation of the local ownership negotiations. (4) $500,000 of which the Commonwealth would pay half. (5) The Government is confident that the main runway will not require major work for 7 Potatoes years and accepts responsibility in the very unlikely event of any such major works being required. The Government also considers that other movement areas will prove adequate for at least 10 years. If, in our opinion, additional movement areas are required during those 10 years, they will be provided by the Commonwealth. Bunbury Airport (Question No. 434) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Will the Government assist the Bunbury Town Council to provide an airport of the standard required for passenger services. (2) As the airport has been brought up to what were Department of Civil Aviation standards dt the lime of construction by the Council, would the D.C.A. bear the total cost involved.",69
159,Mr SWARTZ,PERCENTAGE CHANGE,The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I have arranged for the Department to discuss the matter with the Bunbury Town Council in order to ascertain what additional work is required to improve their aerodrome to licensing standards. I understand that widening of the strip is the main work required and that this widening was not undertaken at the time of the original aerodrome works. (2) The appropriate Commonwealth grant for local ownership works is 50% provided there is an airline or well-established commuter service. In the event that either of these services is attracted to Bunbury consideration will be given lo the payment of a Commonwealth grant. International Labour Organisation: Maritime Conventions (Question No. 49),69
160,Mr WHITLAM,PERCENTAGE CHANGE,"the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) How did the Australian Government delegates vote on the instruments adopted at the Fifty-fourth (1969) Maritime Session of the International Labour Organisation. (2) What earlier I.L.O. maritime conventions have (a) entered into force and when, and (b) been ratified by Australia and when. (3) In what respects do Australian laws or practices fall short of the standards set by I.L.O. maritime conventions which Australia has not yet ratified. (4) What Commonwealth, State and Territory laws must be amended before Australia can ratify the remaining I.L.O. maritime conventions. Mr MCMahon: The answer to the Honourable Member's question is as follows: (1) 1 assume that the Honourable Member is referring to the Preparatory Technical Maritime Conference which was held in Genoa from 15 th26th September 1969. The 54th Session of the International Labour Conference will be held from 14th to 31st October 1970.

(3) and (4) The information requested by the Honourable Member is contained in the 'Review of Australian Law and Practice Relating to Conventions adopted by the International Labour Conference', which was published by the Department of Labour and National Service in October 1969. I understand that the Minister for Labour and National Service has provided the Honourable Member with a copy of this publication. Health Organisations: Australian Electronic Therapy Services (Question No. 121)",69
161,Mr WHITLAM,PERCENTAGE CHANGE,"the Minister for Health, upon, notice: (1) What are the names of registered health benefit organisations in Victoria which direct contributors who need physiotherapy to Australian Electronic Services. (2) What is the relationship between these organisations and Australian Electronic Services. (3) Do the organisations pay benefits for physiotherapy rendered by other firms and individuals. (4) How many employees of Australian Electronic Services provide physiotherapy and how many are qualified physiotherapists.",70
162,Dr FORBES,PERCENTAGE CHANGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following registered health benefit organisations have an arrangement with Australian Electronic Therapy Services to provide physiotherapy services to members: The Ancient Order of Foresters in Victoria Friendly Society, Melbourne. Australian Natives' Association, Melbourne. Grand United Order of Free Gardeners of Australasia, Melbourne. Independent Order of Oddfellows of Victoria, Melbourne.

February 1969 Papua and New Guinea: Broadcasts by Members of House of Assembly (Question No. 162) Mr Wltitlam asked the Minister for External Territories upon notice: (1) Which Members of the House of Assembly for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea have made broadcasts from Administration broadcasting stations. (2) On what dates and subjects did they make the broadcasts. (3) Which candidates made broadcasts from the stations during the month before the House elections.",70
163,Mr BARNES,BROADCASTS BY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Records in respect of the first House of Assembly are incomplete. Records for the second House are fairly comprehensive. The available information is set out in the attached tables. (3) There is a standing instruction to all Administration radio stations that no candidate for House of Assembly elections may use Administration radio for political campaign purposes. No such use was made of Administration radio by candidates prior to either the 1964 or the 196S House of Assembly elections. One Ministerial was broadcast over Administration radio within a month of the 1968 elections. Mr S. Giregire gave a talk about passion fruit in January 1968. The talk had been recorded before January. NA Subject Treatment 1 : NA Kokopo Show Interview Christmas message Talk United Nations meeting..

166,Mr WHITLAM,RADIO WEWAK,"the Minister for notice: External Territories, upon notice: What provision is made for the wives dependent children of persons imprisoned in Territory of Papua and New Guinea?",78
167,Mr BARNES,RADIO WEWAK,"The answer to the honourobserved able member's question is as follows: Under the Child Welfare Ordinance 1961-1968 so used. of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea an allowance not exceeding Seven dollars per week used may be granted by tha Director of Child Welfare sion to where one or both of the parents of a child under workingdetermine the age of sixteen years is imprisoned. In addition, the Administrator makes ex gratia grants to other dependants of persons in prison in deserving cases. Such grants are made by way of rations in subsistence farming areas and by cash, not exceeding Five dollars per family per week, urban areas. However, such grants are required only in a few cases, as relatives in need are usually supported by kinsmen under traditional arrangements which are a feature of the family relationship of Papuans and New Guineans. The obligation to help a relative is often a binding customary obligation. Welfare officers regularly visit all major corrective institutions in tory and detainees are encouraged to discuss with notice: them domestic niatters including fears they may have for the well-being of their families. The decision whether to make grants of assistance or not is made on the basis of actual need, having regard to the customary support or other assistthat ance that is being received by dependants of detainees.

169,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,RADIO WEWAK,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon (1) Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Conand ciliation and Arbitration Commission has the machinery for keeping Commissioners informed on the Commission's policy relating to the standards of wages and conditions that are to be by Commissioners when arbitrating on industrial matters.

(3) Does this mean that where existing wage notice: differentiation and/or special skills and/or adaptability of female workers bas led to the exclusive employment of females in a particular industry or calling, such females may become disqualified for equal pay on this account. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth did not intervene in the Equal Pay Case referred to by the honourable member, but the Public Service Board appeared a party. However, the Commonwealth did interpartially vene in the public interest in the private case which was joined to the Public Service Case and was concerned with two applications by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union. (2) Yes. (3) The question whether females employed individual classifications should be eligible for equal pay is either a matter for agreement between the parties concerned, or for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deterlodged mine, assuming, of course, that the matter comes within Ihe Commission's jurisdiction.

Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) While I am aware that there has been some dissatisfaction over alleged' delays in the hearing of claims lodged with Federal Tribunals 1 do not in agree that the delays have been such as to give rise tt> grave or growing dissatisfaction. 1 would add that 1I have lequested an investigation into allegations of delays in the handling of claims with the Commonwealth.

It is not intended to affect the wage, of any employee who is already receiving the prescribed minimum through over-award payments'. (2) The determination of a minimum wage in the Federal jurisdiction is a matter for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which reaches a decision on the claims submitted to it, taking into account the argument and evidence submitted by the parties and interveners, including the Commonwealth. If increases in the minimum or other wages are to contribute to raising the standard of living, and in this wages are only one element though an important one, the increases must be within the capacity of the economy to support.

Observations made by the Committee of Experts indicate that it regards more than half the countries which have ratified the Convention as not complying fully with its provisions.

189,Mr STEWART,RADIO WEWAK,"the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that many migrants arc refused recognition or a licence as a tradesman upon arrival in Australia. (2) Are adequate precautions taken in overseas posts to ensure that intending migrants with trade skills fully understand the requirements for recognition as tradesmen in Australia. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourmem- able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The qualifications of migrant tradesmen in the trade categories covered by the Commonwealth Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act (engineering, electrical, boilermaking, blacksmithing, sheetmetal and boot trades) are assessed by technical advisers attached to our overseas posts at their time of application. They are informed by letter whether their qualifications meet the requirements for recognition in Australia and of the action they may take after arrival to secure recognition through the local trades committees set up under the Act in each State. In practice all applicants whose qualifications are assessed overseas in this way by the technical advisers as metal and electrical tradesmen would obtain recognition as such tradesmen after arrival in Australia. Some migrant tradesmen (for example, electricians) must in addition meet the licencing requirements of the various States in order that they may work at their trade. These as well as applicants in other trades similarly placed (for example, plumbers) are given detailed information about the State registration and licencing requirements. Tradesmen not in the categories covered by the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act are counselled by the overseas posts, on the basis of their employment experience, as to the likelihood of their being recognised as tradesmen in Australia and of any difficulties which they may experience in acquiring that status.

(3) What stage has now been reached in the attempt to secure uniform laws on the matters listed in his answer on 24th September 1969. Mr Hughes-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since 24th September 1969 the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys General has met in the following places on the dates indicated: are nonAdelaide-1 1 th and 12th December 1969 Wellington, New Zealand-27t h February 1970. (2) and (3) It would be inconsistent with the confidential nature of the discussions of the Standing Committee to provide a complete list of the matters considered by the Committee. The present position of the matters listed in my predecessor's answer of 24th September 1969 (other than matters appearing from that answer to have been completed or removed from the agenda) and of matters considered by the Standing Committee since that date is shown in the list set. out below. Items numbered 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 were considered at one or both of the above-mentioned meetings. Present position The Report of the Law School of the University of Adelaide has been received. The Victorian Government has appointed a working party to consider the feasibility of implementing certain parts of the Report. Further consideration of the Report by the Standing Committee has in consequence been deferred. The Company Law Advisory Committee has submitted four interim reports dealing with(a) Accounts and Audit; (b) Substantial Shareholdings and Takeovers; (c) Investigations; (d) Share and Option Dealings by Directors and Officers . of Companies. The Standing Committee has accepted most of the recommendations in the first three reports and Bills to implement those recommendations have been introduced or will shortly be introduced into the State Parliaments. Similar laws for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are now being prepared. The Standing Committee has not yet completed its consideration of the fourth report. At its meeting on 27 February 1970 the Standing Committee agreed that a draft Bill then before it should form the basis of legislation to be enacted in the States. Bills have been introduced into the Victorian and New South Wales Parliaments. Further consideration of this matter by the Standing Committee has been deferred in view of consideration now being given to the Convention by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The Standing Committee has requested the Company Law Advisory Committee to recommend appropriate legislation. Each Attorney-General is examining the Report of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales on Infancy in relation to Contracts and Property. State Bill has been prepared and discussed. It is now a matter for each State to introduce legislation. (Question No. 265) Dr Gun asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: How many items were investigated by the Tariff Board in the last 5 years with a view to(a) imposition or increase of a duty, and (b) removal or reduction of a duty. Mr MCEwen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the 5 year period 1964-65-1968-69 , 125 reports were received from the Tariff Board and tabled in Parliament. In 63 of these reports the Board recommended increased protection, in 26 cases it recommended no change in the level of protection and in 36 cases it recommended a reduction in protection. Industrial Disputes (Question No. 218)",87
198,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TEXT OF RESOLUTION,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that a large number of industrial disputes occur as a result of alleged employer victimisation of union shop stewards. (2) If so, will he examine the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for the purpose of ascertaining what amendment will be necessary to prohibit the dismissal or demotion of a union representative except in those cases where an employer is able to prove to the satisfaction of a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court that such representative has been guilty of grave dereliction of duty incompatible with his duties to his union and to those members of the union whom he represents at his place of employment. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourcould able member's question is as follows: (1) No. Some disputes involving alleged employer victimisation have come under notice from time time but the number of sucb disputes appears be relatively small. It is not possible to give precise figures of the number of such disputes. (2) Section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1969 already provides protection to union members wbo are or wish to become officers delegates of their union, against victimisation on that account. Oil Drilling Adjacent to Barrier Reef: (Question No. 244) Mr Scholes. asked the Minister for missions National Development the following question, upon notice: (1) Were Commonwealth subsidies being paid to firms carrying out experimental oil drilling adjacent to the Barrier Reef. Tarif f (2) Are these subsidies to be continued if it is found that these operations could cause harm to the Reef. (3) Has be suspended payment of subsidies until a full inquiry has been conducted.",88
199,Mr SWARTZ,TEXT OF RESOLUTION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Some subsidies under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act 1959-1969 had been paid to companies in respect of drilling operations in areas off the Queensland coast, some of which could be considered to be adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. (2) Future policy on subsidising drilling operations in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef will, if necessary, be considered when the results of the proposed inquiry into possible damage to the Reef by oil drilling are available. However, this issue is not likely to arise, as 1 would not expect that potentially harmful operations will be allowed by the Queensland Designated Authority. (3) There are no wells being drilled or firmly programmed for the area at present. Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (Question No. 287) Mr Foster asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is he able to say whether there is widespread belief among organisations representative of professional engineers and trade unions that the Commonwealth Government and its instrumentalities unduly influence the decisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. (2) To guard against this possibility, will he give an assurance that in future the Government will not attempt to unduly influence the Commission by (a) issuing economy statements which have that effect, (b) using the term 'in the public interest' which may be taken in a misleading way and (c) regarding impending decisions of the Commission as having a detrimental effect to on the economy which may be taken to imply to that the Government is opposed to an increase compatible with the cases presented by employee organisations. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honouror able member's questiou is as follows: (!) Insofar as the belief of which the honourable member speaks is held it is quite wrong and is a reflection on the integrity of members of the Commission. (2) The Government will continue to discharge Subsidies Its responsibility by issuing such statements about Ihe economy and other matters as it considers are warranted. Moreover, it will make such subto the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as it considers are in the public interest and it has a statutory right to make. It is for the Commission to decide what weight it will give to such submissions just as it bas lo decide what weight it will give to submissions by other bodies appearing before it. Conciliation and Arbitration: Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association (Question No. 377)",88
200,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TEXT OF RESOLUTION,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that great public inconvenience, loss of wages and production has arisen from employers' refusal to negotiate with the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association on its 1967 log of claims for updated conditions of notice: employment. (2) Are the chief obstacles a refusal of employers to grant (a) double time for dayworkers after 2 hours overtime, (b) normal ing overtime rates for unrelieved shiftworkers, double time for shiftworkers when Sundays and public holidays fall on an ordinary rostered shift, (d) meal allowances to all employees required to work overtime and (e) payment for public holidays which fall on a shiftworker's rostered day off. (3) Is it a fact that a considerable number of awards already provide for the conditions now being sought by the F.E.D. and F.A. (4) Is it also a fact that Mr Commissioner R. H. Watson, who is handling this dispute, when hours. dealing with the rate of meal allowance, fixed a rate of 85 cents compared with the Metal Trades Award rate of 81.00 and that the last-mentioned rate has been upheld on appeal to the Commonany wealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. decision (5) Is he able to say whether, as a consequence of Commissioner Watson's decision on the rate of shorten meal allowance, the F.E.D. and F.A. has decided other forms against making further submissions to Commisincreased productivity sioner Watson on any of the matters in dispute. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The F.E.D.F.A. presented employers with a log of claims in 1966. A new award, the Engine Drivers and Firemen's (General) Award 1968 was handed down in September 1968. union's request, it was confined to award rates. Since that time claims for updated conditions employment have been the subject of Commising sion proceedings and negotiations between the parties. (2) On 5th January 1970 the F.E.D.F.A. put operation. these claims to the Metal Trades Employers Federation with a request that all six be satisfied by direct negotiation. The M.T.E.A. could not accede to some of these claims because they were matters of principle which the union should submit to arbitration, but there were areas for negotiation with regard to other matters. union reply was that it would be satisfied only an affirmative reply to all claims. (3) No. (4) On 13th January 1970 Mr Commissioner Watson granted meal allowance rates of 85 cents for the first meal, 50 cents for the second meal, and 85 cents for each subsequent meal to workers on overtime who had not been given adequate prior notification of their being required to overtime. Similar provisions under the Metal Trades Award are 51.00, 50 cents and $1.00. Under that award a flat rate of $1.00 per meal for all workers on overtime was set in 1969, but on appeal this was varied to the rates mentioned. (5) I am not aware of any such decision by the union. Coal Industry Tribunal Award (Question No. 378)",89
201,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TEXT OF RESOLUTION,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon (1) Did the Coal Industry Tribunal recently make an award to permit the working of multiple to a settlement due to shifts on developing headings for 'long wall' minin collieries owned by the Australian Iron (c) and Steel Industries at Kemira and Appin. (2) Is it a fact that long wall mining greatly increases productivity in South Coast collieries and that since 1959, Australia's overall coal production has increased from less than 16 million tons to more than 33 million tons without any significant increase in the work force. (3) If the overall productivity per man has increased to the extent indicated, why has the Coal Industry Tribunal repeatedly refused to grant the union's claims for reduced working (4) Is he able to say whether the combined mining unions have decided to strike immediately attempt is made to implement the Tribunal's unless the union's claim for shorter hours is acceded to. (5) Is it in the public interest to refuse to working hours when mechanisation or of technology results in greatly and is accompanied by substantial displacement of workers.
