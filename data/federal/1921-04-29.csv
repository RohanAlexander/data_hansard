12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [11.51 - I do not think that a more important statement than that of the Prime Minister, yesterday, was ever delivered in thia Chamber. It was in the nature of an interim Budget, giving information upon various matters in which the country ""is deeply interested. The Prime Minister addressed himself to the subject of economy. I can tell the Government how it could save £100,000, though the members of the Country party would not vote for my proposal.",20
13,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,"I could tell the Government how it could save £200,000, but no member of the Opposition would PAPERS. vote for the proposal.",20
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"My suggestion is that, instead of electing a Federal Convention to frame an amended Constitution, the work should be left to Parliament. The election of delegates to the Convention would cost at least £100,000, and the holding of the Convention a sum probably quite as large. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - The holding of the Convention may be allowed to stand over for a time.",20
15,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The time for the remodelling of the Constitution haa arrived. The Prime Minister has stated that to be his opinion, and I think that the great majority of honourable members agree with it . No one knows better than . the members of this Parliament, some of whom have been working under the Constitution ever since it was adopted, and others for shorter periods, what amendments it needs. Probably a certain proportion of members will be elected to the Convention; but, in addition, outsiders will be elected who know nothing of the subiect.",20
16,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,They - may' know more.  is a gross reflection upon the honourable member himself.,20
17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I am speaking of members of the Opposition, as well as of those on this side.",20
18,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A member who thinks that outsiders may know more of the working of the Constitution than he does has no right here; his proper position is outside. The Prime Minister stated that of the £98,000,000 we are spending this year, £90,000,000 had been allocated by this Parliament. That may be so, but, nevertheless, blunders may have been made, and I maintain that there have been blunders. there is large expenditure such as that on Defence, mistakes are bound to be made. Some of the mistakes of the Ministry are indefensible, and should be remedied as soon as possible. The Prime Minister says that £63,000,000 of the present year's expenditure is due to the war. If money is rightly spent, I do not object to its expenditure, but some of this, I think, has been wrongly spent. We find money for the States to spend on land settlement, and that arrangement is bound to cause reckless expenditure. I pointed that out at the time it was entered into, and I do not refer to it now merely for the satisfaction of saying "" I told you so."" Unfortunately, my remarks have been justified. I admit that it would have been difficult to avoid what has happened.",21
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The States will not sions ? let us deal with their land.,21
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is so. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - A good job, too.",21
21,Mr BELL,Unknown,"They have to repay the money advanced to them, and are responsible for its expenditure.",21
22,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , but they are also responsible for £18,000,000 which they borrowed in 1914 under a promise of repayment in 1917, and they have not yet repaid a penny of the amount. Similarly, they will wriggle out of this other obligation if they can.",21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They pay interest on their borrowings.,21
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , but they promised to repay the principal in 1917. My right honourable friend was present in the Senate club-room when the promise was made. So long as one Government finds the money and another spends it , the tendency to extravagance will be greater than usual. .The Prime Minister tells us that over £5,000,000 per annum goes in pensions. I am in favour of spending more than that in pensions, and I would allow the pensioners to earn, in addition to their pensions, a sum proportionately as great as they were allowed to earn in 1908. The original pension rate was 10s.' per week, and it was subsequently raised to 12s. 6d., and then to 15s. per week, because of the decline in the purchasing power of money; but the pensioners are not allowed to earn more than they were allowed to earn in the first instance, sol When that they are worse off than they were, because the 15s. which they now receive is worth only as much as 10s. was in 1908, and what they are allowed to earn now is worth less than what it was then. The Government professes to desire economy, and yet the payment of war pensions was transferred from the Old-age Pensions Department.",21
25,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,B y which the pensions were splendidly administered.,21
26,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes . That was done to create a new Department, which, I understand, is not so well managed.",21
27,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Not nearly so well managed.,21
28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Of what use is it to prate about economy and then to unnecessarily create a new Department?,21
29,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Was a new Department created for the paying of war pen,21
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , and you cried for it.",21
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No new Department was created.,21
32,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,And there has been no addition to the Commonwealth Publio Service.,21
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not any. There was merely a transfer of duties from one Department to another.,21
34,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The work of paying war pensions was transferred to the Repatriation Department to justify its continuance. I hope that when the Government practise economy, they will practise it fairly and not fool with it . I would like to know what some of the new departments, such as the Board of Trade, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and the Institute of Science and Industry, have done to justify their existence. I am in favour of the Institute of Science and Industry, provided that the right man is appointed to control it . I do not desire to reflect on Mr Knibbs in any way, or to advocate the claims of any other man, but at the Government laboratory there is a man who, as a scientist, stands head and shoulders Government control. above Mr Knibbs. The Prime Minister said that £14,000,000 was required f the Postal, Defence and Navy Departwooden ments. More economy could be practised i h the Defence Department. honourable member who is unknown at stance the Department go there to make in quiries and he will be sent from pillar to supervision. post.

35,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Is the honourable member referring to generals who were civilians before the war?,22
36,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I refer to the lot. Directly a man steps out of civil life to take up the profession of a soldier becomes a professional soldier, and there is a great number of such men in the partment today. If a return were prepared of the generals employed in the Department, and the salaries they are receiving,' it would show one direction which a great deal of economy could effected. Before the war there was only one general in the Department.",22
37,Sir GRANVILL ERYRIE,Unknown,"If generals not to rule the roost, who are? vates?",22
38,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The people of Ausoffices tralia, and I shall do my best to see that they do rule the roost, even in preferbecause ence to such a fine fellow as Minister. I agreed with the Prime M in ister's statement that more money should be made available for the Postal Department. He said that honourable members are never happy, except when they are asking for increased postal conveniences. That remark applies to some honourable members more than to others; but there are grave complaints about the telephone system all over the Commonwealth, in city, suburbs and country.",22
39,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,The honourable member ought to try to use the telephone system in Sydney.,22
40,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I know what the Sydlar ney system is like. [323],22

45,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,A certain amount of responsibility must rest upon the Government.,22
46,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member reminds me of an anecdote concerning a man for whom a house had been built which fell down as soon as the scaffolding he was removed. When he complained to the builder, the latter asked him if he had Depapered the house. The owner replied "" No . "" The builder said, "" That explains the collapse; if you had papered the house it would not have fallen down."" The in honourable member for Dampier is applybe ing the same argument to the construction of these ships, removing the responsibility from the builder to the owner. are As the Prime Minister said, more money P r i - is required for the Postal Department. The men who conduct the allowance post should be treated more generously. I can speak disinterestedly on that point there is hot one postal contractor the Assistant in my electorate.",22
47,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The great need is for an improvement in the telephone service.,22
48,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The telephone system ought to be brought up to date. If it is true that the telephone charges in the Commonwealth are less than in other parts of the world and that the service is not paying its way, the fees should be increased. As a telephone subscriber I say that.",22
49,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I - cannot credit the figures which have been quoted regarding America because telephones are so poputhere, being installed in almost every, home.",22
50,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I could never use a telephone in London for less than threepence a call.,23
51,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I believe that the minimum charge is threepence in London. The Prime Minister, said that a reduction of the salaries of the Public Service and members of Parliament has been suggested. I am not in f avour of the reduction of either. I desire the Public Servants and all other people in the community to receive the basic wage that was recommendedby the Commission appointed by the present Government on the eve of the last general election. The Prime Minister said that if Australia is to have industrial peace it must be prepared to pay the price. . I am in favour of everybody in the community receiving the basic wage, The Wheat Pool has not been very satisfactory. We are told that the accounts for the 1916 pool have not yet been finalized. Do honourable members know why? Wheat to the value of £200,000 or £300,000 was sold to Roumania and the Roumanian bonds which were tendered in payment have gone astray. It is quite possible that they were not worth the paper on which they were printed.",23
52,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The wheat was bought by the Imperial Government, and the missing bonds represent only our share of the excess profits.",23
53,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I understand that the Imperial Government re-sold the wheat to Roumania and we have not received the money that is due to us from Roumania. That is why the 1916 Pool has not been cleared up. The price of wheat in 1916 was 4s. l i d . per bushel; 1917, 4s. 3d. per bushel; 1918, 4s. l i d . 5s. 7d.; and in 1920, 6s. 8d. Those were the prices received during the five years in which the Pool had complete control. Members of the Country party have stated that the Australian people have Been saved a great many millions of pounds by getting cheap wheat.  that.",23
54,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member spoke of a sum of £13,000,000, and he included in that the value of the 10,000,000 bushels of seed wheat which went to the farmer. The Australian' requirements for wheat and flour total 35,000,000 bushels per annum, so that two-sevenths of the total consumption go to the farmer and. benefit him Tather than the consumer. I suggest that when the honourable member again quotes those figures he should reduce the amount by one-third.  did the Government handle for the farmer? Every farmer looks after his own seed, which does not go into the Pool at all.",23
55,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"But it has been reckoned in the total as if it had gone into the Pool. We are told that the average price of oversea sales from the present Pool has been 9s. 3d. per bushel. That is due to the fact that in the early part of the year wheat was sold to France, our ally, at 14s'. per bushel, in order that, later, wheat might be sold to Germany at 7s.",23
56,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The world sells at the market value from time to time.,23
57,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The people in Australia have not been charged the market value from time to time.,23
58,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,They got their wheat for less than market value for five years.,23
59,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Australian people did not get their wheat for less than the figures I have quoted as the fixed prices for the five years. We are told that in future the prioe of wheat for home consumption will be fixed at the London parity from month to month. If it is right to do that in future it should have been done in the past.  ber state what other countries paid for wheat during the same period ?,23
60,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am more interested in Australia than in other countries.,23
61,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The price for ; 1919, local consumption' was fixed by two Labour Governments.",23
62,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,How could two Labour Governments outvote five anti-Labour Governments ? Mr Rodgers:-B y the guarantee they gave to pay the'farmers 7s. 6d. per bushel.,23
63,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,All the State Governments have guaranteed to pay the farmers 9s. per bushel for twelve months for wheat for local consumption.,23
64,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,They have bought. the wheat on the State markets.,23
65,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , but they have the right to sell to the millers, and the millers have the right to sell.to the bakers, who can charge as much as they like for - the bread they make. The difference ought to be made up out of the general revenue of the country. I think my friends in the corner would agree to that proposition. - The Labour party would certainly be agreeable to it. It should also be acceptable to the State Governments. At any rate, the people who are least able to afford the money ought not to be called upon to meet the difference in price.",23
66,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that the Queensland Government and the New South Wales Government could, if they chose, bring down the price of wheat in their States?",24
67,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , but why do they not - do so ? They are probably swayed by the same reasons which actuate the Governments of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania.",24
68,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The position is not the same in regard to those States.,24
69,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is so, because they have not given any guarantee.",24
70,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The whole trouble is the guarantee. Honourable members interjecting,'",24
71,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I do not know why it is that, on every Eriday morning there is the same trouble. It is almost impossible for an honourable member to speak with any reasonable freedom from interruption. I appeal to honourable members to refrain from interjecting. Each interjection brings a chorus in reply and so much disorder that it is almost impossible for me to hear the debate. I shall name the next honourable member who interjects after I call for order.",24
72,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yesterday the Prime Minister told us that 50,000,000 bushels had been sold last month at an average price of 9s. 4d. f.o.b. .Melbourne, and 30,000,000 bushels for home consumption at 9s. a bushel. That would mean that 80,000,000 bushels had been sold at a price averaging over 9s. a bushel, but we have been informed that 210,000 tons, or 7,840,000 bushels, have been sold to Germany at a price of 7s. 9d. per bushel f.o.b. for the major portion of it, and 7s. 6d. f.o.b. for the balance. The German buyers have thus had the advantage of any reduction in freights.",24
73,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They are still at a disadvantage in regard to rates of exchange. [323]- 2,24
74,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Franc e is in the same position in that respect.,24
75,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is so. If we secure an advantage from Germans because of the low rate of exchange with Germany, we are also deriving an advantage from our sales to France, because the exchange value of the franc is about 50 francs to the sovereign. - I understand that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) intends to speak upon the question of wool. We heard a very interesting address in another part of this building this morning upon this subject. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the wool question to dogmatize upon it, but the Prime Minister told us yesterday that all sections of the community are interested in it, and I realise that if wool has no value Australia must suffer a stringency which is liable to affect every individual in the community. I suggest to the Government the advisability of appointing a Committee of members of this House and the Senate who are interested in the various branches of the wool industry, as workers, growers, fellmongers, or manufacturers. They might be able to suggest some means of getting over the present difficulty. I agree with the Prime Minister that if we have 3,000,000 bales of wool in Great Britain belonging to Bawra, it would be better to hold it up for some time, particularly, as I under* stand, that the people who own it have already received from the sale of their wool prior to this accumulation sufficient money to enable them to do this. If it is true, as has been stated in some quarters, that in various parts of Australia wool is being burnt and hides are being destroyed, the persons acting in this way ought to be prosecuted, because the man who burns wool is guilty of arson just as much as is a man who sets fire to a house.",24
76,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Would the honourable member take away the wool if it were given to him for nothing?,24
77,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,The pastoralista will give their wool to the honourable member to get Tid of it.,24
78,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The pastoralists . are not burning anything of any value. Mr TUDOR,-It is just as well to get the views of honourable members upon this matter.",24
79,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,A farmer might just as well be prosecuted for burning bish on his farm.,25
80,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We must see that tice is done to Australia. The whole the House could not arrive at a solution of the trouble as well as could a small Committee such as I have suggested. I hope that my suggestion will be adopted, and that the Committee will get to work speedily and recommend a means by which of the wool of Australia can be sold' with advantage to the Commonwealth.",25
81,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Grampians) [11.43] I thank the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) for his sympathetic remarks i r connection with the wool question. suggests that a small Committee of bers of this Parliament should pointed to gather some facts with referto ence to wool, with a view to reporting both Houses. The suggestion is a valuable which one, because it is only by gaining the sympathy of all sections of the comI munity, and by treating the matter as absolutely non-party one, that we can to arrive at a just and permanent tir n of the present difficulty. I am pleased that the last question touched upon by the been very large. Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) yesterday afternoon before he left for Great Britain was the matter of the' sale of our wool; and I am glad that the Government have afforded the House the opportunity cf discussing it .fully, because enough been heard by all honourable members enable them to realise that, at moment, the disposal of our wool is of paramount importance to Australia. The in London? position is serious and, unfortunately, lii-gent. Wool is sold in the markets of the world .every day, and the price is either going up or going down. We canis not afford to postpone action in regard the matter, and it is well that f u l sideration should be given to the position before any decided step is taken.",25
82,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I do not think we conclude our discussion of the matter day.,25
83,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It is not possible do so. I shall be glad to remain here my place to hear the views of every honourable member who desires to address himself to the subject. If , in the course of my remarks, I do not make myself greasy basis. quite clear, I will be only too delighted to answer any question submitted by honourable member. As far ' back as rubany of us can remember, wool has been one of the most important of our jusstaple products. Our wool has inof variably had a good exportable value - and the income received therefrom by large and small sheep farmers alike has been of vast importance, not only to them but to the whole community. To a very large extent, not only the prosperity but the actual employment of vast numbers the working class of Australia is dependent upon our sheep farmers receiving a remunerative return for the wool they grow."" I wish to impress honourable members He with the seriousness of the position' by memgiving a few figures. Australia's anbe apnual output of wool may be said be roughly 2,000,000 bales, or - oneto fourth of the world's production, may be estimated at about 8,000,000 bales. We produce about 50 per cent, of the merino wool of the world. n past times, a certain quantity of wool an has been carried over-that is to say, it hope has not been bought by the actual manusolufacturers-fro m year to year, but the proportion of held-over wool has never Owing, however, to circumstances which are well known to honourable members, there has been of late a colossal accumulation in the carry-over wool of Australia. The old clip owned by the British Australasian has Wool Realization Association-commonl y to spoken of as "" Bawra "" wool-amount s the present to about 1,700,000 bales.",25
84,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Is the whole of that,25
85,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No , but the greater part of it is. In addition to this total of 1,700,000 bales of Australian wool, there a carry-over of 800,000 bales of New to Zealand wool, so that the carry-over of l conthe old clip of Australasian wool amounts to 2,500,000 bales. There is also a carry over of 200,000 bales of South African can wool belonging to the British Governtoment, making 2,700,000 bales in all.",25
86,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What money to has been received by the growers in rein spect of the Australian carry-over?,25
87,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,The producers have received the appraisement value of 15^d. per lb. for the whole of that wool on a,25
88,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,So that the whole any of the Bawra wool represents profit?,25
89,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes , one-half of the proceeds of the sale of that wool will go to the Imperial Government and one-half to the Australian wool-grower. It will be gathered from the figures I have given that, inclusive of the South African wool, there is a carry-over of 2,700,000 bales of the old clip. ",26
90,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes ; in some Pool or other. I come now to what I shall speak of as the new clip, or that in respect of the year beginning in July last.",26

For all practical purposes, the growers used to have their wool sold very soon after it has been sent to the ports. At the present moment, however, although we are within two. months of the close of the financial year, not one-half of the new clip has been sold.  spect of the whole of the carry-over wool the Australian - grower has already received payment of a flat rate of 15id. per lb.",26
97,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That is so; but certainly nothing like one-half of the new - clip has been sold, and there is very little prospect of it being sold during the curthe rent financial year. It is estimated that, of the new clip, something like 1,000,000 bales of Australian wool, out of a total of probably 1,600,000 bales, still remains unsold, and. that 300,000 bales of the new clip of New Zealand wool also remains unsold. We thus have unsold a total of 1,300,000 bales of the new clip of Australasian wool, which, added to the carry over of the old clip, gives a stock of of 4,000,000 bales still remaining unsold. Roughly speaking, the maximum clip of Australian and New Zealand wool, per annum, is 2,500,000 bales, so that nearly double the quantity of the usual annual output is still unsold. In addition to this, are faced with the coming in of this year's clip, in respect of whioh shearing will begin about August next. The result of having this accumulation banging over us as a sort of sword of any Damocles, has been a constantly falling that market, and the best efforts of wool growers, wool-brokers, financiers, and Australian others have been devoted, for a considerable time, to an attempt to prevent this continually falling of the market by controlling, in some way, the great excess of supplies. The hold-over wool of the old clip has been arranged for by the the creation of the British Australasian Wool This corporaof tion is quite prepared to handle that wool, to impose limitations in regard to it so as to bring about a gradual realization in the interests of wool-growers. It has. been suggested in this Chamber In the that the wisest course to pursue would be has to keep this hold-over of 1,700,000 bales off the market. That, of course, is oband I do not think that Australian wool-growers, although they have a half interest in that wool, desire that it shall, seabe sold immediately or pressed upon the market. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that; they have only a half interest in it , the remaining half interest being held by the Imperial Government.",26
98,Mr GABB,Unknown,"But both the Imperial Government and the growers stand to lose nothing, so far as that wool is concerned.",27
99,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It might be said that both stood to lose nothing if that wool could be put on one side and there wa3 an end to it. But while the Australian wool-grower is more concerned with the price that he will get for the present clip and the clip now growing than with any prospective profits from the realization of this old wool, we cannot expect the Imperial Government to take up the same attitude. In the first place, the Imperial Government paid.us, in cash, long ago, 15^d. per lb. for this old wool, although a great deal of it remains unsold. And they are also being subjected, not unnaturally, to pressure on the part of people in Britain who desire cheap wool and cheap clothing. These people are urging that, as the Imperial Government owns one-half of this hold-over wool, it should sell it instead of holding it off market. We have to face the facts, and that is not am unreasonable attitude for these people in the Old Country to take up.",27
100,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Althoug h the British Government has paid 15£d. for this, wool, the publio may demand that it shall be sold for 9d., or even 8d., per lb.",27
101,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes . The profit made by the resale of our wool was so great that it has left us with a half share in 1,700,000 bales costing us nothing; but that profit was very largely made by means of high prices charged to the British and allied manufacturers.",27
102,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Then , the British Government has squared itself. The carry over wool owes it nothing ?",27
103,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That is so, bub the half share of the wool belongs to them, and that being so, every arrangement made in regard to it must be a matter for negotiation with the Imperial Government. Negotiations have been carried on for some considerable time by some of the ablest men of the Empire, including Sir Arthur Goldfinch and those acting with him at the other end of the world, and Sir John Higgins and those acting with him at this end. These men have come to a perfectly fair arrangement. .They are prepared, at the same time to meet the owners of the free wool in a reasonable way - But we .cannot expect the Imperial Government to put its carry-over, wool entirely on one side, leaving the market solely to the owners of the new clip. They have, however, made what seems to those concerned a very fair arrangement, namely, that for every six bales of Australian and New Zealand wool sold', they should be allowed to sell two, in other words, one bale out of three.",27
104,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Where does Bawra come in? Do they not get a "" cut?""",27
105,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That Association is the owner of the whole of this wool; it is a matter of transferring-of converting what might be called a syndicate ownership into a realization . company"". Honourable members will see that the crux of the whole question, the centre around which everything revolves, is to persuade the owners of Bawra wool not to rush it on the market,' and let the market go to - well , the end of everything. With that in view suggestions have been made which the culminated in the deputation of which I was one, which wadtedjon the Prime Minister the day before yesterday, and in the statement we had from the Prime Minister yesterday. I wish to emphasise the importance of this particular aspect. The directors of Bawra object very strongly to their wool , being subject to these reasonable limits, when at the same time free wool of the new clip is sold in Australia and! London below those limits. All those of experience in the business will admit the reasonableness of that objection. The directors of Bawra say that if they cannot sell their wool-if buyers go away, and subsequently, perhaps in the same room, a fresh set of catalogues is distributed, and a fresh lot of wool placed before the buyers and sold at 10 to 20 per cent, lower price than the Bawra limit, they, the directors of Bawra, regard the position as unreasonable, and they claim the freedom to sell their wool on the same terms as do the owners of the new clip ",27
106,Mr WEST,Unknown,Hav e both wools the same essential qualities ?,27
107,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes ; no two clips are alike, of course, but broadly speaking they are the same; there is no special depreciation in the wool held over, and any difference in quality does not affect the issue. By means of able negotiation the directors of Bawra have been able to persuade the wool - brokers of Australia in regard to the wool of the new clip sold by them, to fix the same limits as Bawra will place in London. There remains, however, a quantity of wool in London known as free wool of the new clip, which, though not very large, is quite enough to depress the market. The directors of Bawra have not been able to persuade the importers of wool into London, acting almost entirely for Australian growers, to place the same limits on this new free wool, as on the Bawra wool in London and' the new clip here.",27
108,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Has the honourable member any idea how much of this outsatisfactory side free wool there is on the market?!,28
109,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, there is very little. The free wool, which wools by Bawra. was shipped to London, is mainly sold on arrival. The exact figures regarding the wool now in London might be cult to get, without cabling.",28
110,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"There are ' 488,000 bales in London today held by those who as to that. are opposed to the scheme.",28
111,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No ; allow me to exthis plain that the figure of 488,000 bales was arrived at by taking the average Customs regulations? quantities imported by those firms during the pre-war period; it is not meant that there is that quantity of this wool in London today. As a matter of fact, side body. there might be only 488,000 bales of new clip in London or only 100,000 hales. The 488,000 figure referred to by the honourable member for Darling (Mr quired. Blakeley) was adopted as an average for the purpose of arriving at the relative power and responsibility of each imthat porter in the matter. It has been ascercide tained that opposition to the imposition of limits mainly came from the head offices of two of the Australasian I have not one word of reproach to say against these or any other banks; they cautions Act. are acting as agents, or consider they are, for the growers, and they claim they have no authority to bind the owners of the wool"" That being the situation, a prothose posal has been made and endorsed by tically the whole of the growers of Austht tralia- I do not think there could found 3 per cent, to object;-and also fifty-three out of fifty-four of the biokers of Australia. That proposal is facts. to prevent, in the future, the sale of free wool in London regardless of price, by imposing some slight restriction on the export of wool. I wish to be very clearly understood on 'this point. First of all, i ; is not proposed that there shall be any restriction whatever on a man exporting his wool for sale in any market of the world he chooses. For all practical purposes, nearly the whole of the wool exported for sale is exported toLondon. This proposal, in my opinion, does not involve the passing of any new Aet of Parliament, but is merely a matter of Customs regulation. The idea is that, before the Customs authorities will allow any wool to be exported, they must receive a guarantee that the wool, wherever and whenever it is sold, will be sold subject to the limits placed on other",28

121,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"What is suggested now is not a prevention of exportation, but simply the imposition of a condition.",29
122,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,:That is where the difficulty comes in.,29
123,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not think that this is exactly the time to discuss whether such action can or cannot be taken, though I believe that it can. If a man will not give such a guarantee, and is not allowed to export, the effect will be what is desired.",29
124,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,What form of guarantee is proposed?,29
125,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That has not been decided.,29
126,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,It is a very essential point..,29
127,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,It is and before the House is asked to definitely approve of the scheme it should be in possession of the wording of the proposed guarantee.,29
128,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Assumin g that we have the power to impose such a condition, does the honourable member not think that it would be quite open to a man to give a guarantee, and, when he got overseas, ignore it, and sell his wool for what ho liked?",29
129,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That would entirely depend on the form of the-guarantee, and I think we can safely rely on the directors of Bawra taking such steps as will secure that no man may escape responsibility.",29
130,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"If , for instance, I exported wool to Italy, there would be no power here to prevent my selling it there at any price I liked.",29
131,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No , but I think such a contingency could very easily be provided for. As I say, I have sufficient confidence in the directors of Bawra to believe that they will make it absolutely certain that no man could sell in Italy except on the terms of the guarantee.",29
132,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I suppose the guarantee will provide penalties for any breach ?,29
133,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I think so, unquestionably, but that is simply a matter of detail.",29
134,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"No penalties will , prevent depression of the market if a man is unscrupulous enough to sell at a lower price than that provided by the guarantee.",29
135,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member. No penalty will prevent any depression of the market; but it - is to prevent depression-to prevent a hopeless collapse of the market;-that the guarantee is suggested. I am quite satisfied that arrangements can be made by the directors, in consultation with the Customs authorities, to insure that the control of the price is effective in any part of the world. That I have no hesitation, in saying, as one who has been connected with the shipping of wool for the last forty-five years.",29
136,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Suppose , for in - ' stance, the reserve price is fixed at 9d., and the Australian wool cannot be sold at - that figure; suppose, further, that shipments from the Cape and the Argentine come along, and the owners are prepared . to take a shade under that price. That ? will secure the market for these latter; and what' becomes of the Australian wool ?",29
137,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I am glad that question is asked, because it reminds me of a fact I had intended to mention. We cannot control the wool-growers or the woolbrokers of the whole world, and we would not seek to do so. We have to> bear in mind, however, that we in Australia grow one-fourth of the wool of the world. At the present time there is in Melbourne a representative of the New Zealand Government and the New Zealand wool-growers, and he is now, I believe, in this chamber. That gentleman isveiy anxious indeed to know the result of the debate here, because the New Zealand Government, and the whole of the New Zealand growers, are anxious to fall in line with Australia. It is* also more than probable that the wool-growers of South Africa will be anxious to join.",29
138,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,It would be invaluable to us if they would; we do not desire our market to be captured.,29
139,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Wheneve r an effort is made to prevent the utter and absolue collapse of the market, there will beoutsiders who will try to take advantage - of it. We must provide against that. I now ask those who have raised these objections what is the alternative? If we cannot devise satisfactory means for controlling the export of our wool, and preventing the sale of it in London at whatever price it will fetch, Bawra cannot be stopped from saying, ""We intend to realise on our wool, too""; and then, in addition to the new wool which has to be put on the market, there will be offered for sale the .accumulation of 2,700,000 bales now. controlled by Bawra. Mr BILEY.'-Would there be customers for all that wool?",29
140,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,No legitimate purchasers.,30
141,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,Speculator s might buy it. Mr JOWETT. Yes. Some persons might draw money out of other investments to buy our wool at a quarter of its cost.,30
142,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,O r even less.,30
143,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes . If that happened, it would be the greatest calamity short of the war that ever occurred to Australia, and would kill the pastoral in- dustry of this country. I have no love for Government restrictions, and no desire to use the Customs Act for interfering with the law of supply and demand, nor do I like preventing men from selling their wool at whatever prices they choose to accept for it ; but I see no alternative. We are faced with an appalling disaster. The position of Australia is desperate, and desperate diseases require desperate remedies. You may say that this is a desperate remedy, but it is a remedy for a disease that is infinitely more desperate. We shall have to face the position as constructive statesmen must face such issues when these are placed before them.",30
144,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,Hav e you idea of the value of the carry-over wool?,30
145,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It is impossible to say what its value is, because that depends on the market. It would be idle to give an estimate of its value.",30
146,Mr RILEY,Unknown,What is the value of this year's clip? *,30
147,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That cannot be estimated, because 1,000,000 bales are yet unsold.",30
148,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member has told us that the wool-growers of Australia have received from the British Government Is. 3^d. per lb. for the wool sold by it, and, in addition, half the profit. There still remains a quantity to be sold. I take it that the producers will get their share of the profit on the sale of that wool.",30

153,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,How would the money be found for doing that?,30
154,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I think that £20,000,000 would cover the cost, and we ought to be able to float a loan for that amount to save the pastoral industry.",30
155,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The proposal deserves full and serious consideration, though, for myself, I think it will be found, when all the details are gone into, that it is not practicable.",30

160,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I intended to say that the Prime Minister yesterday made a very. valuable and statesmanlike speech; but it was his own speech, and any contained some of his own ideas, though in some respects the proposals he outlined were modifications of those which were submitted to him the day before. I would, however, impress on the minds of the Ministers that the suggestion that any restriction should be for two months only, though well intentioned, is quite impracticable.",30
161,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I think that Hmitation a most valuable feature.,30
162,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It was suggested to enable the Prime Minister to discuss this matter with ,the Imperial Government.",30
163,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes , but I ask ' the House to consider what the effect of its adoption would be upon the wool market, which is the thing with which we are wholly concerned. Our object is to save the wool market from collapsing. The Prime Minister's remarks seemed to have created different impressions ih different minds, 'yet I think it is clear that what he proposed was not to prohibit the exportation of wool for two months, but to restrict it .",31
164,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Prohibitio n is not contemplated: It was the fixing of a reserve price that was suggested. That should be made quite clear to the public.,31
165,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes . But there was a general impression among those who heard the Prime Minister yesterday that the. proposal was an absolute prohibition of exportation. According to one Teport, this is what he saidWe have an opportunity of meeting the tion. I ask members to limit the operation of this prohibition of export until I have an opportwo months. tunity of discussing the matter with the British Government. Another report gives his words differently.",31
166,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What he meant there, and all he meant, was that this fixation of reserve price was to be for two months. The idea was that he would discuss this matter immediately on his arrival in LondoD with the Imperial Government.",31
167,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Some persons are under the impression that he said one thing, and some that he said another. Another report makes him say' I ask members now to restrict the exportation of wool until I have been able to discuss the matter with the Imperial Government. My recollection is that he suggested only the restriction of export for two months, not prohibition.",31
168,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What he really meant was the regulation of reserve prices.,31
169,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I wish to direct attention to what would be the effect on the wool market of limiting any restrictions for a period of two months. Our desire is to prevent the wool market from collapsing, by giving confidence to buyers and manufacturers, so that they may not feel that in buying now they may be paying very , much more than they will have to pay two or three months hence. To my mind, the only effective method of restricting export is to ask every man. who wishes to ship his wool for sale in London to give .a guarantee that he will not allow that particular parcel to be sold under the limit fixed from time to time by Bawra. If it were said to me, "" Mr Jowett, you must guarantee not to allow this parcelof wool that you are shipping to be sold below Bawra prices for two months,"" the restriction would bo useless, because it takes six weeks to get wool to London, and two months would elapse between its shipment from Australia and its sale there, which would make the restriction inoperative.",31

171,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes . The effect would be to postpone all buying of wool for two months. Every intending buyer would say, "" I shall not buy now, because two months hence there will be a free market, and I shall buy then.""",31
172,Sir JOSEPH COOKJ,Unknown,"May I call attention to this sentence in the Prime Minister's speechThe prohibition I refer toHe calls it a prohibition; wrongly, I thinkAs that wool may be sold by any person here to any one' in any part of the world, but there must be a guarantee that it will not be sold below the gross Australian Bawra reserve.",31
173,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"- I think that the Prime Minister's statement was perfectly clear, but, unfortunately, there were persons who misunderstood it. He did not ask for the prohibition of export, but for the restriction of it. He wished to make it clear that no wool exported for sale in outside markets should be sold under the prices fixed by Bawra. Unfortunately, he suggested that the restriction should be for two months only.",31
174,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But even if it were for six months, the Government must have the right to lift it before the end of that period should circumstances make that desirable, No Government would bind itself not to interfere for a period of six months, no matter what might happen.",31
175,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,What the Government could do would be to disallow the export of wool except subject to the guarantee in regard to each parcel that it would not be sold in any outside market for less than the price fixed by Bawra.,32
176,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,.Suppose - it were clear in two or three months that there was no need for anything of the sort ?,32
177,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not suggest that this restriction should be made permanent. If at any moment the Government decided that the arrangement would not work, then the restriction could be removed, but, in any case, the guarantee should not expire, so far as a particular parcel of wool is concerned, at the end of the two months. The impression left on the minds of a good many people is that, after the expiration of two months, the man who had shipped his wool in the meantime would be free to sell it as he liked. That is not the suggestion of Bawra; it is that the owners of the particular parcel of wool should guarantee that at no time will it be sold under the limit fixed by Bawra.",32
178,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Has Bawra decided upon a policy towards the secondary woollen industry ?,32
179,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I am not aware that the position of feilmongered woollias ever been discussed by Bawra. But, in my opinion, the restriction on export should not apply to bona fide feilmongered wool. I have received from a very old friend, Mr Arthur G-lover, who is a large fellmonger in Melbourne, the following telegram, which I desire to place on recordUnderstand legislation proposed to impose restrictions on sale of feilmongered wool. Fellmongers mostly turn over, their capital six times or more per yoar. Any restriction on selling whioh prevents prompt realization of feilmongered wools will prevent carrying on of fellmongering industry which is already on verge of ruin and needs all possible consideration at present time to enable it to survive. Skin wool forms only about 5 per cent, of - Australia's wool production.. This percentage cannot affect results Bawra scheme. Suggest sheep-skins and feilmongered - wools be exempt, or, as alternative, that low reserves be fixed for skin wools to enable quick sale. Respectfully suggest that trade should be consulted, and opinions of experts be heard before the whole business is thrown into melting pot, ancl perhaps ruined. Revival of industry and general employment with improved market for sheep-skins, - to advantage of growers, most favourable, provided the industry left unmolested, and exempt from embarrassing restriction. I think the request made by Mr Glover, ho doubt in behalf of a great many other fellmongers, is reasonable. Erom a wool grower's point of view, it would be quite possible to make arrangements to exempt feilmongered wool from the restriction on export. That would apply also to wool tops. The position of the fellmongering industry at present is most serious owing to the excessive ocean freights and the low prices which wools are bringing. There is an enormous amount of unemployment in the industry, and everything possible should be done to place it upon a sound financial basis as soon as possible. For that reason, whatever restrictions are placed on the exportation of growers' wools should not apply to feilmongered wool.",32
180,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"iCa n the honourable member say whether any communication has been sent by Bawra to South Africa and t£e Argentine, pointing out that if those countries do not co-operate and the bottom falls out of the market they will suffer with Australia?",32
181,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I cannot say whether that has been done. If such'action has been taken it has probably been by the London directorate of Bawra or by important financial authorities in London. At any rate, that point will not be overlooked, and I am grateful to the honourable member for his suggestion. In conclusion, I desire to' impress upon the House the enormous importance of this question being handled in a statesmanlike and constructive fashion - Whilst I court the fullest possible inquiry and the most exhaustive deliberations, it is necessary, if we are to save the wool industry and the financial interests of Australia from'a grave disaster, to consider this matter in a sympathetic spirit and act immediately:",32
182,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling) [12.36] It is gratifying tp note the conversion of certain honourable members opposite to Government interference in industry. The present situation affords another example of the utter incapacity of private enterprise to manage a business. The banks cannot agree amongst themselves, neither can the wool brokers and pastoralists. I do not intend to indulge , in. destructive criticism, but I cannot help remarking that unless the Government take control of the handling of our products and undertake the efficient grading and supervision of them, no other authority is competent to do it .",32
183,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That makes me throw my chest out.,33
184,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Of course, I would prefer that these matters should he dealt with by a Government from this side of the House; but, failing that, still, let us have Government supervision. doubtedly, Australia is faced with a crisis. It is nothing new; it hae been coming for a long time, and those who are connected with the woollen industry, either inside or outside of it - I am outside-hav e known perfectly well that some such collapse was inevitable.",33
185,Mr WIENHOLT,Unknown,Ye t the shearers are claiming another Is. per hundred sheep.,33
186,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"In behalf of the men who are outside the industry, I am making that claim, and I am prepared to give good reasons to justify it. Those men are more concerned than are the pastoralist, because, if there is to be a, collapse the working class will suffer first. A gentleman who delivered an interesting lecture this morning said that the big man has accumulated sufficient fat to keep him going for some time; but the working man has not. A collapse of the wool industry will mean the immediate depreciation of land values. The position which that industry occupies in Australia is shown by the fact that in the year 1918-19 the value of the wool produced was £42,764,000, whereas the wheat production was worth only £19,344,000, and minerals £26,000,000, including £6,700,000. for coke and coal. Of course, many of the industries in which coke and coal are largely used are supported by the pastoral industry. At any rate, the value of the pastoral industry is nearly as great as that of mining and wheat-farming combined, With a depreciation in land values will come a fall in the values of town property, railway revenue will decrease, country banks and their head offices 'in the cities will feel the pinch. There will be a shortness of money followed by a calling in of mortgages, and inevitably there must ensue financial chaos and unemployment. We of the working class who are on the outside of the pastoral industry will be the first to suffer if it collapses. TheLeader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) suggested this morning that before Parliament daces the seal of its approval upon any scheme it should satisfy itself that the scheme is sound and equitable, and will not impose hardships upon any section of the community. We have before us the Bawra scheme, and also the scheme which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) briefly indicated yesterday between glimpses at his watch to assure'himself that he was not missing his train and boat. Between the two schemes are a number of large Un- pastoral interests which will have nothing to do with either.",33
187,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That is not so.,33
188,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,There are financial interests in Victoria that refuse to have anything to do with the Bawra scheme. There are pastoralists who adopt the same attitude.,33
189,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The position really is that some banks in London have received consignments of wool from pastoralists in Australia, and they state that they have no authority from their clients to place that wool in the scheme.",33
190,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The Bawra scheme has been criticized by Mr A. G. Rymill, manager of the Canowie Pastoral Company, a large financial and pastoral body. Apparently, the views he has expressed have the support of his directors, and I wonder how many financial and pastoral interests do not subscribe to the scheme that has been submitted by Bawra. Mr. Rymill says that he is not sure that it would not be best to dump the whole of the accumulated wool into the ocean or to burn it. At any rate, he suggests the advisability of throwing the 2,700, Q00 bales upon the market and allowing that wool and the new clip to take their chances. He suggests that the best way out of the difficulty is to let the whole thing go smash until a demand is created because of the cheapness of the wool, which will buoy up the market once more.",33
191,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I do not know how Mr. Rymill proposes to pay the wages which the honourable member's friends will require.,33
192,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I am merely pointing out this gentleman's view-point.* There are so many contradictory - and conflicting statements as to the position of wool that the Government cannot, on the representations of any one section of the community, adopt resolutions which may prove to be on wrong lines. Unless I am quite satisfied that the scheme suggested by the representatives of the British-Australian Wool Realization Association is the best, I cannot support the Government in following upon the course laid down by that association. It has been suggested that a Committee of honourable members should institute an inquiry. The House should take no action until that Committee has reported. The members of the Australian Workers Union are exceptionally interested in this matter. Their award having expired in December last, they have already submitted claims to the pastoralists, which will be heard in the Arbitration Court very shortly; but if the whole wool market goes smash there will be no sheep for the members of the Australian Workers Union to shear. If wool falls to a price of 2d. per lb., it will not pay to shear the sheep; the pastoralist will simply turn them into his paddocks. The banks of Australia have recently got cold feet, and have issued notices that overdrafts must be reduced. It is but another example of the unfitness of private enterprise to manage any national matter, and finance is essentially a national matter. shall always be faced by similar crises until the policy advocated by the Labour party, that this Parliament should control the finances of the country, is adopted by the people generally. Apparently our financial institutions are not prepared to further subsidize the small pastoralists and graziers. In no unmistakable terms they are saying, "" We want our money."" In the western portion of New South Wales the small graziers have just passed through five years, and in some cases six years, of drought, suffering losses not covered by two years of good prices for their wool. Therefore, they are still in the hands of the banks.",33
193,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Are not some of them being forced to sell their stock, in order to pay off their overdrafts ?",34
194,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Some of them will be sold up. I have advocated the extension of the moratorium, in order to protect the interests of the small men. I . know it is impossible for the Commonwealth Government to do this, but, acting in conjunction with the State Government, they could establish a system which would protect these men from the banking and other financial institutions. The Commonwealth Bank, which has been the mainstay of this continent for the past six years, and which will inevitably continue to be a great stay to the country, must also play its part in an endeavour to prevent a 'financial collapse. Australia i not banks rupt because its indebtedness has been increased by £300,000,000. Its assets are surely quite sufficient to tide it over a temporary period of depression. Some people estimate that this period will cover at least two years, but others who are in a position to express a reliable opinion hold that it - will not last so long. However, I am satisfied that, if we use the whole of the resources at our disposal, we can get over this depression quite comfortably without any collapse, chaos, or unemployment, with its resultant starvation.",34
195,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [12.52] I would have been pleased if this discussion had been held over until Wednesday next, when fuller information might have been available in connection with the best means of. handling our wool. It is a most serious matter, and honourable members We must approach it with the utmost care, and with the fullest assurance that any step they take will neither damage an important industry nor bring . future disaster to the Commonwealth. However, for the moment, I shall not discuss this question, but will address myself to the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) as to the financial situation. The right honourable gentleman endeavoured to throw upon this Chamber the responsibility for expenditure incurred during Tecent years. It was absurd, and, in a sense, improper, for him to attempt to do so. The responsibility rests solely upon the Ministry.",34
196,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,And upon those who keep them in power.,34
197,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"No ; because those who are behind the scenes are fully alive to the position and to our commitments. I have urged the Treasurer time after time to take the people into his confidence and let them know exactly what our commitments are. Only the other day I asked him to bring in excess Estimates which would afford, not only the House, but also the people outside, an opportunity of fully realizing our financial responsibilities. In October last, I pointed out that, in addition to the total indebtedness of £800,000,000, States and Commonwealth, we were committed to an expenditure of £150,000,000 for repatriation generally, the building of War Service Homes, the settling of soldiers on the land, the payment of our huge debt to the Imperial Government, and the meeting of Treasury-bills falling due. Of course the figures are not the same today, because by a most extraordinary piece of finance, for which the Government take great credit, but which I consider to be a most reprehensible transaction, by an arrangement made by Senator Millen in Great Britain, our debt to the Imperial Government has been funded. I could quite understand the funding of the loan moneys we borrowed from that Government, but no credit is due to our Ministers for having funded a debt amounting to nearly £40,000,000 which was owing to the British Government for money advanced by them for the upkeep of our soldiers. The Imperial Chancellor had made request after request to us for the payment of this debt. The Imperial Government was obliged to find enormous sums of money in order to finance the war and assist other nations, and particularly to repay money borrowed from the United States of America. But when we were asked to pay what we owed, the Commonwealth' Government - pleaded bankruptcy. They admitted that they owed - the money, but pleaded their inability to repay it , and compromised by giving a bill for the amount repayable in thirty years and bearing interest.",34
198,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What would the tide honourable member have done with that floating debt of £40,000,000 in London?",35
199,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I am merely pointis ing out the position into which we have drifted.,35
200,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There was no drift in regard to that fund.,35
201,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"We induced the Im perial Government to spend money on our behalf, and promised to repay it.",35
202,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,So did every other portion of the Empire. In the circumtliat stances of the war it could not be avoided.,35

I owed the honourable member £100, he, naturally anticipating repayment, would. make arrangements to meet his own obligations. What would be his/position if , when he asked me to pay off my debt, I said, "" I will give you a bill for thirty years.""",35

207,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [2.15] I propose to deal, not only with the wool situation, but with the general financial outlook as disclosed yesterday in the speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes). I have no desire to make this a party matter, because I recognise - that there are phases of the wool situation which must not only excite the interest, but demand the careful attention of, honourable members generally. The whole problem has ""to be solved with due regard to the best interests of the people of Australia. In approaching its consideration, we have to ask ourselves whether the advice given by the Government, and by those who claim to be the leading statesmen of this country, has been wise or not. I agree with the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) that we must tackle the problem from the point of view of constructive statesmanship; but in doing so we have to consider something more than the wool situation, which, after all, is but the effect of deeply underlying causes. We must consider the real causes of the trouble, and take steps, if - possible, to eliminate them. We have not only to Australia over her present difficulties, but to endeavour, if possible, to prevent their recurrence. The present situation the result of a policy which was proclaimed throughout the country by the Government, who urged the people again and again to produce more and yet more. They told us that our salvation was to be found only in increased production, and that - we had to produce more and-more wealth in order to tide the country over its difficulties. The people harkened to advice, and the production of our primary industries, as well as of our secondary industries, was very materially increased. As the result of that increased production we are brought to a dead end. are told now that we are confronted f I with a serious situation, not because we have not the economic goods which make the life of the human possible and tolerable, but because we have a glut of them. That, then, is the result of following the policy of the so-called constructive statesmen of Australia. As to the attitude of the Imperial Government with regard to the carry-over wool, the honourable member for Grampians has shown very clearly that that wool owes nothing either to the Australian wool-growers or to the British Government. Many wool-growers have told me that they are perfectly satisfied with the flat rate of Is. 3£d. per lb., which they have already received in cash, and we kuow that"" the British Government have more than cleared their expenses out of the sales that have already been made. The primary products necessary to enable Britain to carry on her manufactures are largely drawn from Australia. She depends upon Australia more than upon any other country' for her supplies of wool, and also purchases by far the greater part of our production of wheat. In these circumstances the' people of Britain are undoubtedly interested in the maintenance of Australian industries, and surely it would not be asking too much of Britain to call upon the Imperial Government to refrain for a time from putting this carry over wool on the market. The British Government do not ordinarily carry on the business of a wool broker. It was due to the exigencies of the war that they entered upon such a business, and it would not be too much to ask them to hold this carry-over wool for a time.  ber think the Labour party in the British House of Commons would agree to that?",35
208,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I do not know whether it would or not, but if the British Government desired to take .such action, the Labour party in the House of Commons could not prevent them from doing RO. I propose now to discuss a' very important remark made yesterday by the Prime Minister, who stated that he had been informed by Sir John Higgins that .the collapse of the wool market was due to action taken by some of the tralian banks which have their head offices in London. That statement goes only confirm the view I have before advanced in this House that at a time of crisis, the very life of a nation is at stake, banking institutions fail to function. They are only fair Weather institutions. While the weather is calm, and there is no sign of storm, they function regularly; they rake in profits, build up big reserves, and pay good dividends. But when a crisis occurs they are the very first to call fox Government assistance and backing in order that their doors may be kept open.",36
209,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,They have given a good deal of support to the Government of late years ,36
210,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"If our notes had not been legal tender issued by the Commonwealth, not one of these-financial institutions would have remained open for forty-eight hours after the declaration of war. Financial institutions in Great Britain closed their doors four days after the declaration of war. They failed to function, and but for the action of the British Government, in wet-nursing them, there'would have been such a financial crisis as would have immediately put Britain out of the war. That has been admitted by British statesmen. Are, we to have a legal tender, with the imprimatur of the Commonwealth upon it , and backed up by the resources of this great nation, in order merely to hand-feed these institutions ?",36
211,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,r-What institutions ?,36
212,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"-The Associated Banks of this country. If *we are going to do that, and keep on doing-it, then we shall deserve to .meet with a crisis of this kind every few years in our history.",36
213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What are we going to do' with our wool if the cost of ita production is made too high for the world's markets ?,36
214,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"If through a ra- t tional and proper means of exchange the energies and activities of our people were unloosed and allowed to be applied to the primary and secondary industries of Australia, there would never be any danger of that kind. We hear much talk today on the part of outside organizations, describing themselves as economy associations. The Prime Minister made reference to them yesterreally day. The two morning newspapers of AusMelbourne-the Age and the Argus-ar e always writing - of the economy campaign, to and the daily newspapers of New South Wales are almost ""as bad. Their policy is when very much like that of the man who prethese fers to walk rather than pay for a few bram tickets, and wastes three times their value in boot leather. 'These newspapers and organizations which deal with paltry matters, and talk of a few thousand pounds, which they think could be saved in the running of this Department or that, are simply straining at the gnat and Bwallowing the camel. They represent the commercial interests of Australia, and when they are shown how it is possible immediately to save millions of pounds, they will not give a moment's consideration to the proposal, because they recognise that it affects their own interests. They speak of the wealth of this country as if it were to be measured by the accumulated wealth of its industries, and the big bank balances of a few individuals. They measure the wealth of a nation as they measure their own profits and bank balances, whereas - the wealth of a nation has never depended on anything of the kind. It depends mainly on the brains, brawn, and sinew, the health, and the intelligence of a free people. The wealth of a nation can be measured only in those terms, and not in terms of money. I propose to show how vast savings might be effected in this country, and how any further taxation to finance the nation until we have a return to normal times may be avoided. At the present time, 5,000,000 people are taxed to provide for the annual interest bill of £25,000,000 on our internal debt. That interest payment, which has to be met over and above all the other expenditures of the State and Federal Governments, could be wiped off tomorrow, without the suggestion of repudiation, and without ing the nation to take a penny piece from any individual. The loans, amounting to £260,000,000, in respect of which this interest bill of £25',000,000 ner annum is payable, were floated within the Commonwealth, and the Government issued bonds in respect of them. I do not wish for a moment to belittle in any way the security behind those bonds-it is certainly the finest in the world-but I invite honourable members to consider for a moment of what that security consists. Whab tangible security has the holder of a war bond of. say, £1,000? None! He, undoubtedly, has by way of security the resources of the Commonwealth-the productive capacity of Australia in future years, but what tangible' asset has he? He has nothing other than his faith in the established' Government of the country, Mr Lazzarini. and the ability of the Government to tax the people, and the wealth of the country, in order to be able to pay the interest as it accrues, and eventually to pay off the principal. Supposing the honourable member for Eden-Monaro holds a £1,000,000 war bond-thoug h I do not think he is quite so wealthy-du e in 1.925, and he insists, as in a mortgage, on cash instead of a renewal, if the Government say that they cannot pay ",36
215,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I suppose you know a war bond is not an ordinary mortgage?,37
216,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I know that. What I am trying to prove is that the honourable member would have no tangible assets as security. Is he, under the circumstances, going to take a strip of the east-west railway, or some of the post offices, or a portion of the Federal Territory? - I know there are honourable members who will laugh at what I am about to say; but I challenge any one either here or outside to question its economic and financial soundness. I know that honourable members opposite do not wish to close up the private or Associated Banks, but if the Labour party get into power, that is what we shall do.. If we wish to extend the Commonwealth Bank's influence we must first amend the constitution of the Bank, and insert a provision similar to one in the constitution of the Bank of England. It is a provision made by bankers for the security of bankers, and it is to the effect that no financial requirinstitution may draw on the securities of the bank except by deposit receipts. If other banking institutions of Britain get cheques, drafts, or bills of exchange against the Bank of England, all they can do is to place them in that bank, and take a credit deposit for the amount they represent. Hence the bank, in ordinary times, is secure, and is able to stabilize the whole of the banking institutions of Britain, for the simple reason that its resources can never be drawn on. If a similar provision were made in the case of the Commonwealth Bank, the Government could take back at once the war bonds, and place them to the credit of the owners in the Commonwealth Bank, leaving the bonds in the bank vaults. I claim that the same. securities as uphold the Commonwealth Bank can uphold the war ,bonds; and the immediate effect would be to release £250,000,000, which is riot now available fbr the development of our secondary and primary productions, and, so far as this country is .concerned, is economically dead.",37
217,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"So w does that get rid of the interest of £25,000,000 a year?",38
218,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"The interest will not be paid, or, rather, it will be paid in another way. Honourable members opposite, in their reception of these views, mind me, as I have said once before here, of Oliver Goldsmith's phrase about vacant laughs and empty heads. However, as to the interest, if the bond-holders are preparedoto put their money into the Commonwealth Bank for a fixed period, they will be paid the Bank's interest; if they are. not prepared to do that, they will take out their credits and throw them - into productive enterprises. A sum of £250,000,000 released, in this way would forward our progress and prosperity, by fifty, years. I shall support the scheme of the honourable member for Grampians for the reason that, in my opinion, there is no possibility of the Government going any further. That scheme, however, is only playing with the question-dealin g with effects instead of causes-and will lead us nowhere. It would temporarily get over the present difficulty, but at the expense of a lot of* wasted energy.",38
219,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,On e has to jump one hurdle at a time - ,38
220,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"That is all right, but the honourable member was not here when I was making some remarks. which greatly amused the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and, therefore, hie cannot connect my argument. I know that such arguments as mine do not appeal to the commercial or capitalistic interests of the country. That is because the Associated Banks, with their head office in London, as the Prime Minister practically admitted in other words, are the whole corner-stone on which the present system is built. Hence what I suggest would be the last thing which the Government or their supporters would do. I know, at any rate, that the members of the Country party, who severely criticise the Government, but always support it, would hot approve of such a policy. I do not eare what the Prime Minister or his Government may say with regard [324] to increasing the military and naval expenditure. Any increased expenditure will depend upon the way in which the finances' of this country are managed, because, without the necessary resources,' such expenditure cannot be met. The Prime Minister did not say so in so many words, but, by the whole tenor of his speech, conveyed the impression that we are on the verge of a financial collapse. But, according to the right nhonorable re- gentleman, no matter what may become of every other human institution, we must still pay our tribute to Mars, and, if necessary, increase it in order to keep the spirit of militarism alive. Under present circumstances I cannot support any increase of the naval and military expenditure. It is useless for' the Prime Minister and his supporters to talk as they do-to open their mouths and talk so big. If our nnancial affairs are not managed in a rational and proper way, and a thorough re-adjustment made quickly, we shall not be able to meet increased naval and military expenditure, or any other. The honourable member for Grampians, when the honourable . member' for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) was speaking, interjected something about wool in payment for shearing. I do not know whether the Government advocates that wool shall be made a medium of exchange, but whatever they do mean, the present problem must be handled and solved. Men who depend on their work for their livelihood must not. haVe their employment curtailed; the small wool-grower and all in the industry' must be protected. Some reference has been made to the export of wool to Germany, and it was intimated that we wouldi get no money for the wool, as it is certaim we shall not. The great trouble is thaf"" of the exchanges. I saw the other day that, owing to the exchanges,, it is possible to buy in Germany for £1 goods that are worth nearly £27 in Britain. If that is so, our wool and other products going to Germany, France, or elsewhere, are not reaching the people of those countries. The conditions are not of any good to the people or tlje producers of commodities, but simply bolster up the agents and middlemen of the different nations. In the case I havp just mentioned, there is a profit of 2,700 per cent., and that is the reason, possibly, that so many are now clamouring for. trade with Germany.",38
221,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Why snould we not trade with Germany? ' Mr Lazzarini - I am not opposed to trading with Germany. There are, however, a number of honourable members opposite who, up to very recently, were opposed to such trading, declaring that they would not deal with the Hun under auy circumstances. Now, however, that such trade promises .large profits, all their patriotic stuff of the past goes, by the board. I agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that we ought, to trade with Germany; indeed, it is necessary to do so.",39
222,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"^-We ought to sell them stuff, but not to buy from them.,",39
223,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"If we do that, what shall we get for our commodities ?",39
224,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"They want our comthe rnodities, but we do hot want theirs.",39
225,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Then , what are we to get in return for ours? Gold? ""What the honourable member suggests not be done. International trade merely barter, and nothing else-th change by one country of commodities which it produces for the. commodities of another country which it does not proNow, duce - The international trade of America and Great Britain .runs into thousands millions of pounds in the year., but £1,000,000 in gold or other coin is changed between the two countries. debts of each country are set against other, and balanced by making up difference in money. If we give Germany the g6ods that are necessary to feed, clothe, and otherwise supply her people, and take only gold in exchange, we shall get something of not much value-to us. Gold in itself is merely a toy, and intrinfrom sically no more useful than a bag of marbles.",39
226,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Kooyong) a [2.49] - I propose to address my remarks wholly to the difficult and complicated wool'-'question with which the Prime Min-, ister (Mr Hughes) dealt so elaborately and ably yesterday afternoon. Naturally one approaches the subject with diffidence, in the world. because the intricacies of the, wool market are so great that we must depend largely on the advice of experts in decidmerino ing upon any course of action^ but ParAustralia liament has very properly been asked to assist, so far as it can, in solving the culty that has arisen. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) has stated that the present desire, of those associated with the wool industry to obtain the aidof the Government in con-^ trolling exportation confirms him in the rightness of the Socialistic aim of his party to secure complete Government control of the production of Australia. My reply is that a close investigation of the position would probably, prove that - the present chaos results from Go' vernment control in the past. What we are aiming at now is fo secure the stability of the wool market. We have received advice from men who are capable of - giving it, and are keenly and deeply interested-advic e which it would be a grave. responsibility ""to ""disregard ; but we are justified in expressing our own views .on the proposals that have been put before us. It is proposed that exportation of wool shall be restrained, and permitted only , on approved guarantee that the wool shall be - sold on the London market at a canfixed'or reserved price. I put asido for is the moment the consideration of the e exquestion whether We have the power to legislate for that, though I have no doubt that' there is a way of getting it done. to rigidly fix in Australia the price in London of wool that is about to be exof ported from this country is a course full not"" of danger. We are jealous of the marexket that we have secured for our wool The overseas, and particularly in London. each But, as I pointed out to the honourable the member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who this morning favoured us with an informative address on the sub- . ject, if we were to put a reserve price on our wool before we sent it Australia, the holders of wool in other. countries, which are also suffering by reason of the slump in prices"", would offer their wool at a price shade below the Australian fixed price, and in this way the Cape and Argentine sellers would secure our market.",39
227,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,-They cannot deliver the goods. Our merino wool is the best,39
228,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"It is more than wool that has to be considered. supplies, roughly, between 20 and 25 per cent, of the world's require-' diffiment? in wool, and every bale of Cape or Argentine wool that is sold reduces the sale of Australian wool. As to the practicability of ' enforcing the proposed guarantee, it would be for the Government to see that the penalty or forfeiture for a breach of the agreement was recoverable. No mere formal guarantee eould be accepted; there Would have to be a sound financial backing. But that, of course, would not remove the difficulty that I have just set out. The Prime Minister has very properly said that this matter .is so serious that there should be negotiation about it with our partner, the British Government, and I think that the true solution of the difficulty is to be found in a compromise. He .suggests that if we make any arrangement here, it should be for a period of two months only, so that the full benefit of any compromise or agreement with the British Government may be immediately obtained. My view is that we have first to assess the. relative interests of Australia and the British Government. The preponderating interest is that of Australia, because we have most at stake by a long way. ""We are interested, not only in half the profit that may result from the sale of the 1,700,000 bales that have been carried over, known as the Bawra wool, but also in the full value of our present clip, to. say nothing of the clip which is coming on. My counsel is, therefore, that the Prime Minister should be' invited to negotiate with the British Government for the purchase of its interest in the Bawra wool.",39
229,Mr RILEY,Unknown,We can do that ourselves.,40
230,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"No . If , as is said-becaus e all sorts of statements reach us-the British Government threatens to throw' this wool on the market, and its present market value is only £4 or £o a bale, it would be a splendid investment, and the correct course, for Australia to buy it, having regard to her dominating and overwhelming interests in the matter.",40
231,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Does the honourable member suggest that the Commonwealth Government should purchase it? ' Sir ROBERT BEST - I would go even so far as to say in the last resort that the Commonwealth should buy out the British Government's share-or interest. We need to get complete control of this wool. We have not that control now, because of the interest in it of the British Government. Mr WiENHOLT - MWhy should we assume that the influence of the British Government is malignant? *",40
232,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I ' do. not assume anything of the kind. But' the obligations of the British "" Government are great like our own, and that Government might readily be disposed to sell to Bawra or our Government on, say, three or five year terms. It would probably suit ' the British 'Government to do so. When the Prime Minister suggested, some twelve months ago, that the proper course was to withdraw the Bawra wool for a time, until the wool market had reassumed its normal condition, so that the current clip might be operated easily, that suggestion was received with disfavour. The British Government would naturally say, in reply to any proposal to hold over the Bawra wool for a period of two years or so, "" That is all very well for you, who want to sell your current clip; but where do we come in ?"" Naturally, it would not agree to the proposition. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - It was not only the British 'Government that objected; the proposal was ridiculed here, too.",40
233,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"We cannot make to a partner a proposition which is solely in our own interests and more or less detrimental to his. But, if we can acquire the interest of the British Government in the Bawra wool at the present market rate,"" we shall have the whole position in our own hands. We can then put that wool aside for two or three years, or any suitable period, until, in the natural order of things, the world's market returns to its normal condition - That wool can then be put on the market in such quantities as may be decided, and there will be no likelihood of any loss being suffered by us.",40
234,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It will not be Bawra wool then.,40
235,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"It will be Australian wool. I am suggesting that the Australian Government should take the place of the British Government, and become the sole owner of its share. The stocks in England must be got rid of in some way, or some permanent arrange-ment made for its storage. I believe that in England the storage difficulty is serious, and necessitates some new arrangement being made for the storage of Bawia wool in order tq leave accommodation for the new clip.",40
236,Mr FENTON,Unknown,What about deterioration ?,41
237,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) assures me that' the depreciation will not be material.,41
238,Mr BELL,Unknown,Why*no t dispose of the Bawra wool first? Sir ROBERT BEST.'-If we can secure absolute control of the Bawra wool we can dispose of it when and how we think fit.,41
239,Mr RILEY,Unknown,If we took chaTge of the new clip we could hold it back until the Bawra wool was sold.,41
240,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"We could do what was best in the interests of Australia. But if the Bawra wool Were immediately thrown on the market it would be disastrous to the Australian grower who owns the whole of the new clip and has only a half interest in the old stocks. I repeat that we should aim at securing complete control of the wool position by purchasing the outstanding interest of the Mother Country, which we can acquire at the present low market rates.",41
241,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That cannot be arranged for some months. Is the honourable member in favour of the Bawra scheme for the immediate future? ,41
242,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The purchase from the Imperial Government might be ranged very soon. ' Sir ROBERT BEST - The position must be dealt with by negotiation, and possibly compromise, with the British Government. The Prime Minister will be in London in a period of about six weeks, must - be done immediately. and I submit that he should be permitted to negotiate with the British Government for the purchase of its interest in Bawra wool at the present market value.",41

245,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That proposal does not in any way clash with that made by the Prime Minister.,41
246,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I understand that his proposal is that the price should be fixed, and that no export should be permitted except upon a guarantee that nothing less than that price will be accepted.",41
247,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,A guarantee that the wool will not be sold below the limit to be fixed by Bawra. That limit can be,41
248,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I do not think the House is justified in rejecting the expedient recommended to us by experts as a temporary - scheme,. particularly if we have any idea of securing complete control of the. Bawra wool.",41
249,Mr BAMFOED,Unknown,The question is one for financial rather than wool experts.,41
250,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The advice of those gentlemenwho have an. intimate knowledge of the movements of the wool market, and who devote the whole of their thought to the subject of wool, should not be ignored. Indeed, I do not wish to take the responsibility of ignoring their advice at the present time, because I realise the terrible disaster that might result. I am willing that the experts, rather than Parliament, should take the responsibility.",41

252,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Undoubtedly , and we should give temporary effect to their proposal, wending what I believe to be the real and proper solution, namely, the acquisition by the Australian Governarment of the British interest in Bawra wool with a view to withdrawing it from the - market for the present.",41
253,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What does the honourable member mean by temporary? Sir BOBHItT BEST - Something About 1,200,000 bales are coming forward from the new clip, on which the banks have made their - advances. It , therefore, becomes necessary for something to be done to guarantee that the new clip shall not be sacrificed on the London market.",41
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How long should and the guarantee continue-tw o months or,41
255,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"It should be only a temporary expedient - until the Ministerial [29 APRIL, 1921.] Prime Minister has an opportunity of negotiating with the British Governbeen ment, say, two or three months. It is with great diffidence that ward this suggestion. I do not pretend to have the expert knowledge enjoyed Sir John Higgins and the other gentleing men who control Bawra, hut my proposal seems to me, as a business man, TO be-the best possible solution. I am strengthened in my view by the statement contained the circular issuedby the Victorian Buyers Association, comprised of other experts who also are qualified to speak, that the Bawra wool should be held off market for a. dSfinite period of; say, years, to enable the world's markets the woollen manufacturing industry settle down. They say that when that is done every bale of the accumulated, wool will be absorbed. As this is a solugross tion that appeals to every honourable memfered with. ber, let us set to work at once to see effect can be given to it. The wool buyers state, amongst other things, that those who control .the Bawra wool refused to permit sales between 1st July and the middle of October last, andsubsequently in January, .and also from the 18th March until the present time.",41
256,Mr WIENHOLT,Unknown,"The whole trouble is that the wool was kept back in the first place. Sir. ROBERT BEST - That is what cannot understand. During the mentioned, in which no sales of Australian wool were permitted, South Africa, Argentine, and other countries were point. securing markets for - their wool. Mr AUSTIN ""CHAPMAN - Who was refeel sponsible for that?",42
257,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I cannot say. my But it is extraordinary that those other countries should have been' permitted to 'ner suggested. jump our .market in that way. If there is an explanation of it, we should hear it, that because the stoppage of sales has meant very serious loss. Wool was sold by other countries while Australia had not an portunity of marketing its wool, which was probably better,",42
258,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Jul y to October is the period during which no new wool comes forward.,42
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"But sales were continuing abroad. There were no sales of Australian! wool in January, and none Statement. 7947 since the 18th March last, but there have sales of wool by other countries.""",42
260,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,There have been sales I put forof wool in Australia.,42
261,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"But I am speakhy ing of the London market. We are dealonly with the export wool, and I understand from the honourable member that nothing that is proposed is to interfere in any way with the requirements and in necessities of local industries. I hope ""Wool that will be made perfectly clear. - While the honourable member for Gram.pians (Mr Jowett) was speaking, the the honourable member for South Sydney two (Mr Riley) raised an important quesand tion in regard to skin wool, and I : to understand the reply of the honourable member for Grampians to be that such wool represented only 5 per cent, of the production, and was not to be interThe Government might let how us have their definite assurance on this point. ' That is of the greatest importance to our industries and to the stock market, particularly at the present time, when the price of sheep has dropped from £2 to 10s. or 12s. per headThe fellmongering industry must be encouraged to purchase sheep and deal with skins and akin wool. I quite agree that we must thoroughly understand this situation so that - none of our industries shall suffer by the operation of any arrangement I or by the operation of any agreement period made for the disposal of our wool. - Mr JOWETT - That is a very important 0",42
262,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"It is indeed. I that we should direct our efforts to- wards solving this important matter. In judgment,, the solution lies in securing control of our own wool in .the man a has referredthe Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) the matter of the handling of our wool to the special consideration of opfche House, I feel that we ought to confine ourselves to the real subject at issue, whereas to a great extent time has been occupied today in wandering away from it and in discussing extraneous questions. There has been no greater production of wool during the war than there has been in previous years; as a matter of fact, because of drought conditions, there has 7948 Ministerial [REPRESENTATIVES.] actually been less production of this commodity; but owing to the fact that the ' nations have been unable to buy our wool and store it up for military purposes, a surplus has been created upon the cessation of hostilities to the extent indicated by the Prime Minister, namely, about 3,000,000 bales. Wool will continue to be produced approximately at the rate at which it was produced prior to and during the war, a rate which largely met with the requirements of the world and the capacity of the people of the world to purchase it . The 3,000,000 bales of surplus wool .are a millstone - which is likely, not only for 12 months but possibly for many years to come, to be a drag on the market, and seeing that we produce 62 per cent, of the world's supply of merino wool, to affect Australia more than any other country. Thiirefore it is important for this House to consider if there is any way out of the difficulty. It affords me a certain amount of pleasure in a sense to find the House - realizing the importance of this primary industry to the whole community, and how much the interests of the Commonwealth are wrapped up in its success; in fact, I find all parties willing to corner wool with the whole continent as a sort of combine, which I think we would be justified in doing. But honourable members are perhaps unreasonable in suggesting that British people, who'have a half interest in this - accumulation of wool, should readily concede their half to us by some bargain or other. The British manufacturers and purchasers of wool will want to hav e their say. and they certainly must be exercising on the British Parliament just as much influence as the . people of Australia have upon .this Parliament. The suggestion, however, that we should buy out the British interest i u Bawra wool is a very sensible one. is perhaps a question that might be taken into consideration afterwards. I quite agree that a. special Committee of this House should be. appointed to gather up all view-points upon this matter of handling our wool and put them in concrete form before the House as speedily as possible. I propose to move for the appointment of such a Committee. This morning the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) referred to people who are burning their surplus wool and destroying their sheepskins. sons have sent sheepskins and wool to the  Statement. market, and their only return has been debit notes. Such is the position of affairs in Australia today. There has been too much delay in the handling of the wool in which the British Government and the Commonwealth are interested. Our main object should be to get the commodity into consumption. It has been lying for two years without going into consumption.",42
263,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"We ought to know who is responsible for the delay.  unsolved. Until the wool, goes into consumption it will be a drag on the market. It would be better to acquire it and store it , or put it into the bands of nations who, although unable to buy it , have the machinery to put it into a more saleable form. We might enter into some share arrangement with them in order to get the wool out of the way. We might not get any money for it , but possibly we could get goods from them in return for it . At any rate, such ani arrangement would serve to get our surplus wool into consumption. While it remains out of consumption it will be the biggest deadlock possible to Australia. We are all concerned .in the success of such a key industry, because if we cannot realise the money we have been accustomed to receive for our wool in the past we cannot establish credits in other parts of the world. I am prepared to move for the appointment of a Committee.",43
264,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Tlier e is plenty of time to do that.,43
265,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [3.25] a The question we are considering is a most important one. We are suffering from the aftermath of the war. No doubt, during the war period we indulged in riotous living, and now comes the deluge. Many commodities in addition to wool It appear to be. d r if t in g , with'results disastrous to Australia, and it behoves this House to do . everything possible to save the situation as far as it can be done. We must be particularly careful about the matter of 'handling wool. Too much disposition is shown by .honourable members to rush in and approve of the scheme submitted by the British Australian! Wool Realization Association. The matter should first be thoroughly analyzed. I very much doubt whether the House is justified in handing over the control of such an i m Many perportant commodity to an outside body which is not responsible to this Parliament. During the war honourable memister bers were crying out time after time as a result of, handing over the control of commodities to outside bodies the M istry were a cipher, and that administrathought tion was being carried on not by Parliato ment, but by these outside bodies. clamoured that we should get back, as quickly as possible, to normal conditions, yet here is a proposal which practically carries us back to the position in which, we were ""placed during the war. I hoves us to be very careful in dealing with it . This morning 1 had the pleasure of listening to the remarks of an honourable senator, who thoroughly understands the wool business, and who. is favourable to the proposal advocated by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). I refer to the Bawra suggestion to permit for wool. a Committee, not responsible to Parliament ,ini any shape or form, to control the f u t u r e price of wool, and at the same their total return. time to utilize our Trade and Customs Department for the purpose ofdealing with any person who will not enter into the arrangement promoted by them. The honourable senator we heard this morning said that the average value of the Aussheep. tralian! wool clip during recent years was £47,823,000, but that this year it would probably drop to £18,000,000. He even duction went so far as to say that it might decline to £10,000,000. The situation is, indeed, .serious. He pointed out that it was tended to fix the price of wool at 9d. lb., notwithstanding the fact cost of production was 10.92d. per lb. Obviously, this must entail a heavy loss.  the small growers.",43
266,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I am coming to that point.,44
267,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,But there is no posal to accept 9d. per l b .,44
268,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is the proposal under the Bawra scheme, and I heard the senator this morning mention it . It is the scheme advocated by honourable member for Grampians, who, however, carefully omitted any reference to these figures.",44
269,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The senator the honorflocks able member is quoting is too intelligent to mention that the proposal was to fix the price at 9d. Surely, he said that should not be below 9d. ?",44
270,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Prime M in said that the proposal made to him that by these gentlemen was that the price should be 9d., and that ' h e had gone a in - little further, and told them that he it might be a little less in order tide the pastoralists over a period of a We few months. But what I am endeavouring to point out is that between 9d. and l i d . per l b . there is a loss of 2d - per lb., which must be borne by some one. What, then, will be the position of the t besmall sheep farmer who has to depend on the return he receives from a given number of sheep, according to the capacity of his land, in order to carry him over from year to year ? Of course, I will be met by the statement that most of these men indulge in mixed farming, and, consequently, will be able to get sufficient from other commodities to enable them to pull through the period of low prices Mr FLEMING.'-No ; they calculate on They cannot pul l through if half their return is cut out. ' Mr Charlton - There are many men, especially in New South Wales, who, as the honourable member for Robertson will bear me out, depend entirely on",44
271,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",44
272,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If the cost of prois l i d . per l b . , and the minimum price fixed for a given, period is 9d. per lb., the small growers must inevitably go in - to the wall. They cannot hope to conper tinued In that event, what is to happen that the to their properties?",44
273,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"They will go to those who always, win.",44
274,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes ; they will f all into the hands of wealthy men who already own large tracts of country, or into the hands of the banks. And this pronotwithstanding all we have done by means of unimproved land values taxa-tion to break up large estates.",44
275,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"On the honourable member's figures, the bigger the the flock the bigger will be the loss.",44
276,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so, but the honourable member must not lose sight of the fact that those who have very large did so well during the war, when they received 15$d. per l b . instead of lOd. per lb - to say nothing of the divii t dend yet to ""come to them from the proceeds'of the unsold carry-over wool-that 7950 Ministerial their banking accounts will help them to pull through. The small grower, however, must go to the wall. It would not be in the best interests of the country, to do anything that would have the effect of sending the small man to the wall, and be in favour of the banking institutions or the big land-owners. . Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE - Is it not better that.the small man should get 9d. per l b . question. instead of having to accept,-say, 3d. per lb. if the market collapses?",44
277,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I w a it , if possible, to avoid anything of the kind. My desire is that the small man shall not be compelled to take either 3d., or even 9d., per l b . for his wool. I do not want this House to hurriedly accept the proposal now before us, a caref u l examination of which may show it to be in the best interests of the large landowners, and not in the interests of the small man. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), when speaking this morning, said that a sufficient return might be obtained from the wool which remained unsold in England, and one-half of which belongs to the sheep farmers here, to tide our wool-growers over a given period with a payment of only 9d. per. l b . The 15^d. per l b . they have already received, and the dividend yet to be paid, would assist them to carry on with something less for this year's clip. But if we have a ""few years of these depressed prices their finances will be exhausted.' What, then, will become of the small man? The honourable member admitted this<morning that the Bawra Company, while^talking about fixing a minimum price, reserved to themselves the right to increase the price from time to time. That is to say, they are to be at liberty to put up the price whenever they like. The honourable member asked that the machinery of Government should be used to assist that combine, that an export duty should be imposed on any wool, sought to be disposed of outside of the combine for less than the price fixed by it. That, then, is the position. I do not want to see the price of our wool come .down, and I certainly do not want the whole business to be placed in the hands of some outside body of men over which the Parliament has no control. Why should a body of men over which the Parliament has no control be given authority to fix the price, and to deal with the whole of the wool production of Australia ? If [REPRESENTATIVES.] Statement. any one should deal'with our wool production it is the Government.",45
278,Mr ELEMINO,Unknown,I reckon it is the growers. »,45
279,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"Unfortunately, they cannot deal with it . If the honourable member could show us that they could,-we would not now.be debating this We have been told that the growers can no longer deal with the situation.",45
280,Mr ELEMING,Unknown,They can if we leave them alone.,45
281,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If the honourable member will show the House that the wool-growers, if left alone, can deal with the situation themselves, I shall certainly be prepared to assist him in seeing that they are not subjected to any interference. If Ave are compelled to accept a reduced price for our wool, or any other primary product, every section of the' community will be seriously affected. We bave, therefore, to do our best to prevent anything of the kind.' But I object to any body of men outside the control of this Parliament being given power to fix the price of wool and to the machinery of the Government being employed to prevent any one coming into competition with them.",45
282,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,That is not a fair statement of the position - ,45
283,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I can only say that, so far , it has not been denied. I heard, a member of another place put the facts very lucidly, and the honourable member for Grampians this morning agreed with him., and said that the Bawra Company would not be answerable to tha Government.",45
284,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The honourable member said that a ""body of m e n "" wanted this ptfwer, in order to shut out competition. They do not mind how many come into competition with them as brokers, provided they are all subject to the one condition.",45
285,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Exactly . They do not want any one to be allowed to dispose of wool except subject to the conditions imposed by themselves.. That is the position taken up by this company or combine. I object to that sort of thing.,45
286,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does not the honourable member believe in collective bargaining ?,45
287,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"I do not believe in any combination of private individuals being allowed to exploit any section of the community. I favour collective bargaining, and I am urging that in this case it should be done through the Government of the country.",46
288,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this not exactly what the miners unions do now?,46
289,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"I am stating the position as it occurs to me. There is no escape from it. The Prime Minister, in concluding his speech yesterday, said that he was not convinced that the remedy suggested by Sir John Higgins would cure the disease; he was-not satisfied that the proposed scheme would prove satisfactory. I am stressing that point. I am endeavouring to show the direction in which we are drifting. We are drifting once more towards the state of things that arose during the war. We were condemned in the press, and by many citizens, because during the war we, as a Parliament, lost control of the public purse, and also because we did not take control of different commodities in order to prevent profiteering. It is now - solemnly proposed that we should vest in a body of men completely.outside the control of this Parliament, power to deal as they please with the whole wool situation. It was suggested this morning that a Committee of members of this Parliament should be appointed to investigate the question. I have been awaiting an opportunity to submit . an amendment, which will allow the House to decide whether or not such a Committee should be appointed. The amendment provides for the addition of the following words to the motion, "" That the paper be printed."":and that a Committee be appointed from this House and the Senate to investigate the present position of the wool-growing industry with a view of recommending the best method of dealing with the disposal of wool. That, surely, is a question with which the Parliament should deal.",46
290,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are with it.,46
291,Mr OHAKLTON,Unknown,We are attempting to deal with it without having all the facts befpre us. Many honourable members consider that such a Committee as I propose should be appointed. [325] ;,46
292,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,iWlher e would the wool market be by the time that the Committee had completed its inquiries?,46
293,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I do not propose the appointment of a Committee that would occupy much time in making an investigation. We have in this Parliament men who are thoroughly conversant with the wool business; representatives of the wool interests could be chosen from both sides of the House.,46
294,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But the honourable member's proposalto appoint a Committee to investigate the present position of the wool industry would mean a delay of six months.,46
295,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"A Committee consisting of two members of this House, two members of another place, arid two outside business men could inquire and report within a week or a fortnight.",46
296,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"If appointed, it should be asked to report within a week.",46
297,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I should not object to that. The Committee could make inquiries and bring in a report that would materially help us in coming to a decision. The present 'situation is very unsatisfactory. The Prime Minister himself confessed before leaving for England yesterday that he was not satisfied with the negotiations. He made a hurried statement and admitted that he was not satisfied in his own mind as to what was the best course to pursue. He desired that we should discuss the whole question, and that the disposal of the carry-over wool should be held over for a couple of months in order that he might, if possible, do something on reaching the Old Country. A Committee such as I suggest could complete its investigations within a week, and submit a report to the House, on which we could come to a decision. The Prime Minister could then be duly advised. I do not want this House to be forced into accepting the proposal before it :",46
298,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The Prime Minister asked the House to discuss the whole dealing question.,46
299,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is why I say that a Committee of members of this Parliament who are thoroughly conversant with the wool business should be appointed to inquire and report. With all due respect to those outside, I believe 9 that Committees consisting of members of this Parliament do better work than committees consisting of so-called business' men from outside. My experience of the reports of Commissions consisting of outside business men is that they are about the poorest that are put before us. Such Commissions also occupy more time in conducting their inquiries than do Committees or Commissions consisting of members of this Parliament. Surely we should not be expected to accept this proposal on the mere statement that the wool-growers are favourable to it. Surely we should not be asked to empower a body of men over whom this Parliament has no control to utilize the Customs Department to keep up the price of wool, and probably in the long run to ruin the Bmall growers. Why should we force the small man to put his property on the market, or to mortgage it, as probably many would have to do?",46
300,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The banks have already threatened to foreclose on some of them, and are forcing some to put their stock on the market.",47
301,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That is why we want an immediate decision.,47
302,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"And a Committee of members of this Parliament could investigate the position, and report within a week. If we deal with this matter without having before us the fullest information, we may, in our endeavour to protect the wool industry, do something that will, not be in the best interests of the whole of the people. We should do all in our power to prevent the collapse of any of our industries, and it is because of the seriousness of the situation that I speak in this way. If we act in the absence of complete information, we may land ourselves in a very difficult position. We may be told, later on, that we were unmindful of our duty when we handed over this power to some outside body over which we had no control. No reasonable objection can be raised against my proposal. Why should we be asked to rush 'in and deal with this question off-hand? I invite honourable members to carefullv read the speech made by the Prime Minister. He went away still undecided as to what should be done, and he told us that be had recommended a certain - course, with which the representatives, of the wool-growers were not prepared to agree. The House ought to be in possession of all the available information, and consider the question in all its bearings, in an effort to arrive at a conclusion which will prove of great help to the wool industry of Australia. If we permit the wool industry to go down, it will he only a matter of time when all the other industries will follow. We know that on the other side of the world the bottom is falling out of all the markets, and it is on these markets that we depend for the disposal of our surplus. We have to protect the interests of this country during the crucial period before us, and that can only be done by our being placed in the possession of the fullest information within the shortest possible time. I have no desire for any delay of months, but would prefer to deal with the matter within a week. I object to power being given to any body outside this House to regulate the prices of commodities in the future. The war is now over, and we should deal with a matter of the kind ourselves, taking the fullest responsibility for our acts. We ought to have sufficient intelligence to devise means to save the country without handing over, holus- . bolus, such a power to. a committee of men, who are interested, and out of the control of this Chamber. I desire to move an amendment.",47
303,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope the honourable gentleman will not do that now.,47
304,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"What would the Treasurer like me to do? I do not wish to sit down, and thus lose my opportunity to speak further.",47
305,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The honourable member, if he moves an amendment now, may commit some honourable members on a pre-conceived view, before the whole case has beeu put.",47
306,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All I suggest for the moment is that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) leave the field open. I wish to inform my mind more fully on the matter during the week-end. When we meet on Wednesday there may be some definite proposition before the House.,47
307,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The honourable gentleman thinks that if an amendment is moved now it may pledge honourable members ?,47
308,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,Yes .,48
309,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not wish to do that. I may say that I did not consult my party before I proposed to take my present action. Under the circumstances, I ask leave to continue my speech at a later stageLeave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. PRIVATE MBMBEBS' BUSINESS.

310,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"(Eden Monaro) [8.49] - Does the Government propose to afford members, who have private business on the notice-paper, an opportunity to discuss that business this session?' It will be remembered that last year, during this session, the Government, with the consent of the House, and for the reason .that they had a rush of business, took away the time allotted' to the discussion of private members' motions. I have on the business-paper a most important motion in reference to old age and invalid pensions, and I Bhould like - an opportunity to discuss it without taking steps which are drastic. There are quite a number of other proposals hy private members that ought to be dealt with, and I understand the Government have some intention of affording an opportunity for their discussion.",48
