The AQIS consideration of the whole of this based on the work of Alexander and the extension meat. In my opinion, AQIS has refused to consider protocols, and has argued not only the trade argument which says that the Australian consumer The exact benefit is about 30c per chicken chickens. I think if it were put to the Australian per chicken in order to continue to eat clean parrot population. However, put that to one side.

So to mount the trade argument that ultimately run the risk of damaging that food very basis of our most compelling and productive newcastle disease debate has been that it is of his work to apply to cooked chicken the proper basis and the full gamut of the argument but, in my view, a spurious consumer will benefit from cheaper chicken meat. imported into Australia, if they come as whole people they would gladly pay that extra 30c Australian chicken and maintain the Australian disease in Australia-if you can get it If you spread the advantage to the consumer NA 4232 over a period of time it would be, say, $3 million is one outbreak of newcastle disease in a 10-year consumer, the Australian government and everybody proposed here makes it impossible in pure political advantage either.

The fact of the matter is that under the without the certificate, and it is a law of Japan government-issued phytosanitary certificate. we have it or not.

Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I can only answer these questions insofar as they seek information about the Environment, Sport and Territories Portfolio. I am not in a position to provide the information you have sought in respect of my Commonwealth colleagues, nor State and Territory Governments as this information is not held by my Department 1995/96 Spent in $'OOOs 10,148.50 1,529.90 etc.) 3,737.40 592.60 2,845.70 1,784.00 518.90 756.10 46,633.00 9,575.90 1,446.00 1,179.50 545.50 29,363.10 1,121.60 1,019.00 10,400.00 1,953.30 Infrastructure) 600.00 1,036.50 126,849.50 Subject to that caveat, the response is as follows: (a) The objectives of the relevant programs are set out in Table 1 below. (b) The estimates of expenditure by the Environment, Sport and Territories Portfolio for the financial years 1992193, 1993/94, 1994/95 and 1995/96 are set out in Table 2 below. (c) These programs are still subject to review and evaluation as part of the current Budget process and I cannot comment further at this stage. Table 1 (a) The Waterwatch Australia Program This program aims to provide a national community based water quality and aquatic biodiversity monitoring program. It aims to catalyse the establishment of community driven monitoring programs in all parts of Australia, and especially in areas of high nature conservation value. The Feral Pests Program This program was established in 1992193 with the objective being to reduce the impact of feral animal pests on native species and the natural environment, particularly in areas important for the recovery of endangered species through the development and implementation of projects in cooperation with other Commonwealth authorities and State and Territory agencies. River Murray Corridor of Green Program This program seeks to restore the River Murray to ecological sustainability by protecting, extending and linking remnant native vegetation on public and private land to enhance productivity and biodiversity. The Program concluded in 1995-96, but the work of the River Murray Corridor of Green will continue to be funded, possibly at a reduced level, via the National Corridors of Green Program. Greening Australia Ltd implements the Program, under contract to the Australian Nature Conservation Agency. The Program assists local people to extend existing vegetation corridors along riversides, raillines, roadsides and ridgelines, and to link them together into a network of vegetation to help combat land degradation and loss of biological diversity. Successful consortia of local government, landholders, landcare and other community groups received up to $75,000 over two years under community incentive contracts. Drought Landcare Program The objective of this program is to stimulate onground landcare activities to protect land, water and vegetation resources from the effects of drought; to assist in preparation for post-drought recovery; and to mobilise the long term unemployed in these activities and to address the employment needs of farmers, their families and farm workers. Uluru-Kata Tjuta Tourism Management was established under the December 1992 Statement on the Environment. The extra funds, used to protect the Park from such pressures, will achieve the dual objectives of supporting a valuable tourism industry while sustaining the ecological and cultural values of the area. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency will use the funds to carry out erosion control, stabilisation of viewing area and other works. Ozone Protection Program The objective of this program is to meet Australia's obligations to protect the ozone layer by working with relevant industry sectors, government Table 2 NA WH Management System National Pollutant Inventory Monitoring River Health and the community, and contribute to international efforts in ozone protection to ensure that Australia's achievements are not eroded by a lack of adequate or timely action in the rest of the world. The National Pollutant Inventory This Inventory will provide information on emissions to the environment, for use by industry, governments and the community. It will provide part of the information base for good policy making, for planning, cleaner production and waste minimisation. The goals of the Inventory are to: provide information to enhance and facilitate policy formulation and decision making for environmental planning and management; satisfy community needs by providing publicly accessible and available information, on a geographic basis about being released to the environment, especially those of hazardous nature; promote and facilitate waste minimisation cleaner production programs for industry and government; and assist Australia in meeting international obligations. National Reserve System Cooperative Program The objectives of the Program are to: expand existing government programs for developing and implementing a bioregional approach to identifying protected areas; provide incentives to the States and Territories to cooperate in progressively developing the national system by the year 2000, including providing funds for land acquisition; develop and apply national management principles for protected areas, in association with the States and Territories, which are in line with international standards. World Heritage Management The program aims to develop consistent management arrangements and structures, including Ministerial Councils for each State, community consultation and scientific advisory bodies tailored to the needs of individual properties. The program aims to develop and implement management plans for all World Heritage properties. 1992193 1993/94 1994/95 1995/96 0.750 0.750 0.750 0.500 3.000 1.200 1.200 1.000 2.500 3.000 3.500 Halon Management/Ozone Protection Drought Response *(Australian Heritage Commission) Drought Response *(Australian Nature Conservation Agency) Control of Feral Pests Feral Animal and Weed Control Murray Darling Corridor Waterwatch National Reserves System Uluru Tourism Estimates shown are the amounts approved at the as price adjusted figures nor * These two amounts relate to the Drought Landcare program delivery. State of the Nation (Question No. 311) Mr Filing asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: Will he provide a true statement of the state of the nation, including its real economic performance, immediately before the next election period commences.",152
33,Mr HOWARD,PROGRAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The coalition made a commitment during the election campaign that it would legislate to ensure that the true budgetary position of the nation was publicly released at the beginning of each election campaign. That commitment will be implemented as part of the statutory Charter of Budget Honesty which will be introduced in the Budget sitting of the parliament. Taxation: Contingent Debt (Question No. 406) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 June 1996: (I) Further to his statement in answer to my question without notice concerning contingent debt (Hansard, 28 May 1996, page 1505) that the Government will make policy decisions on taxation matters, has his attention been drawn to taxation ruling SST6. (2) Is it a fact that from 1 October 1996 major changes to the interpretation of tax laws will come into effect and that (a) goods producers, including manufacturers, goods processors and fabricators, (b) importers, (c) wholesalers, (d) retailers, (e) indirect 1992/93 1993/94 1994/95 1995/96 0.100 0.203 0.199 0.199 0.300 0.200 2.700 4.050 1.500 1.500 1.500 1.500 0.700 2.230 1.930 1.750 0.100 l.000 1.000 l.000 0.100 0.800 l.000 l.000 0.800 3.650 4.150 5.300 0.500 0.400 0.500 0.500 time the decision was made.

Program and indicate the agencies responsible for marketers, including direct sellers, (f) end users, (g) taxpayers who sell to related entities and (h) duty free operators will be affected; if so, was the decision to make the changes taken by the current Government. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, I have received a copy of SST6 from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This public ruling is not a change of Government policy. The ATO in conjunction with professional bodies and taxpayer representatives has developed a comprehensive ruling to assist taxpayers to determine the taxable value of the goods they sell. The ruling deals with and provides solutions for issues affecting the calculation of taxable value of goods which is a major building block in the sales tax law. The ruling seeks to assist taxpayers by explaining the practical application of Government policy. Next to the difficulties experienced in correctly classifying goods for sales tax purposes, determining the taxable value of goods is the most common and time consuming problem faced by both the ATO and taxpayers. For this reason publishing a public taxation ruling on taxable value was considered to be of some priority by the ATO, sales tax practitioners and large corporate taxpayers. (2) This ruling is the result of intensive negotiations over the last 2 years with sales tax professional bodies, industry bodies and the ATO. It provides certainty and consistency through the use of Safe Harbours that can be adopted by taxpayers. These are practical guidelines to help make taxable value calculations easier and will provide clarity for taxpayers to self assess their sales tax dealings. While safe harbours are not mandatory, if taxpayers apply them and pay sales tax at the correct rate they will have met their sales tax liability for that transaction. The ruling provides simplified methods of calculating taxable value and may reduce the cost of compliance for taxpayers who choose that option. In conjunction with the professional bodies and the Corporate Taxpayers Association, the ATO has included processes in the ruling to manage the impact of the withdrawal of previous rulings and to give taxpayers time to consider their position. If a previous ruling conflicts with the principles in the new public ruling, it will be altered from I October 1996 giving taxpayers time to consider their position and to approach the A TO if their circumstances are not adequately dealt with in the ruling. If there is no conflict of principles, all private rulings issued after 30 June 1992 will cease to be effective 5 years from their date of issue. To date the ruling has been very well received by both the practitioners and taxpayers and there have been a number of positive reports in the media. Third Party Property Insurance (Question No. 412) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 June 1996: Has he endorsed the Industry Commission's recommendations against compulsory third party property insurance; if so, what steps will he take to encourage the Insurance Council of Australia to repeat its advertising campaign in South Australia which resulted in a 7 per cent increase in cover over a two month period. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The government's response to the Industry Commission's report was announced in my Press Release of 3 May 1996. In that response, I noted that the Commonwealth would raise in the Council of Australian Governments' Committee on Regulatory Reform those recommendations of the Commission that fall within the jurisdiction of and Territories. The question of compulsory third party property damage is one such issue. The Commonwealth Government generally supports the Industry Commission recommendation that State and Territory Governments should not introduce a compulsory third party property damage insurance scheme in any form that limits insurers' underwriting flexibility. Any government imposed limitation on the underwriting discretion of insurers (for example, to mandate coverage and/or premium rates) could have an adverse impact on insurers' solvency and their capacity to pay claims. This may discourage insurers from participating in the vehicle insurance market and reduce the level of competition which acts to keep premiums to a minimum. Alternatively, insurers might seek government guarantees against adverse 'outcomes flowing from any limitations imposed on their underwriting discretion. I am informed that the Insurance Council of Australia's campaign in South Australia was not a direct response to the Industry Commission's report, but to local circumstances and that it was wholly funded by the insurance industry. The Government is of the view that advertising campaigns of that nature are solely for the commercial discretion of the industry. Burglaries (Question No. 494) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Economist of 8 June 1996 containing a claim that a person is more likely to be burgled in Australia than in the USA and indicating Australia's high world ranking in the incidence of burglary. (2) Is it a fact that a high proportion of burglaries are committed to fund drug addiction. (3) Will he ensure that proposed funding cuts to the Australian Customs Service do not adversely affect the fight against drugs.  member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) This is a matter primarily for state or federal police forces and I note that the question has been asked of the Attorney-General. (3) As minister responsible for Customs I will continue to require Customs to fulfil the Australian community's expectations of Customs to play its part in the fight against drugs by pursuing the most the States effective application of its resources. Environment: Convention and Memoranda of Understanding (Question No. 497) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: (1) Will the Minister provide a list of the international conventions and memoranda of understanding arrangements between Australia and other countries in which Australia has made environmental commitments. (2) For each instrument referred to in part (1), which section of the Minister's Department is responsible for ensuring that Australia meets its international environmental obligations. (3) What departmental (a) funds and (b) staff are committed to ensuring Australia's international environmental obligations are met. (4) How has the Commonwealth's allocation of resources in (a) staff and (b) funding toward meeting its international environmental obligations varied between (i) 1994, (ii) 1995 and (iii) 1996. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I have provided, in the table below, the list of international conventions and memoranda of International Convention or Memorandum of Understanding Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention) OECD Decisions relating to Transfrontier Movements of Wastes, especially C(86)64, C(88)90, C(90)178, C(92)39 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and Montreal Protocol on Substances Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping The Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (The World Heritage Convention) UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region (SPREP Convention) International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITT A) Convention on Biological Diversity Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention) Convention on the Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific (Apia Convention) Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention) understanding arrangements between Australia and other countries. I have limited my answer to those conventions and memoranda of understanding for which my portfolio has carriage. The memoranda of understanding listed are those agreed between the Government of Australia and the governments of other countries. (2) The list includes the areas of my Department which have the major carriage for each of the instruments. (3) and (4) Allocation of resources within the Portfolio is carried out on the basis of meeting the Government's overall environment objectives, rather than specifically in response to international commitments.

Private Health Insurance Answer to question by the Honourable Michael Lee to the Prime Minister asked in question time on 10 September 1996, which was taken on notice by the Prime Minister. 'My office and I communicate on a regular basis with the Minister for Health and Family Services and his office about a wide range of issues pertaining to health policy matters, including private health insurance. To the best of my knowledge and the knowledge of my office, at no time prior to 28 August 1996 did the Minister for Health and Family Services or his office advise me or my office that the Minister had been aware at the time of the Budget of any funds having been granted increases in their rates. On 28 August 1996, after the Herald-Sun published an article, my office contacted the office of the Minister for Health and Family Services which informed my office that there had been a number of increases in private health insurance premiums since the Government assumed office and provided my office with the details of a number of these increases. On 29 August 1996, the office of the Minister for Health and Family Services provided my office with a letter from National Mutual Health Insurance dated 25 July 1996 addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services advising him of an adjustment in rates. This letter was brought to attention on 29 August 1996. On 29 August 1996, my office was informed by the Minister's office that none of the increases which had taken place since the Government assumed office had been brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and Family Services by his department. On 29 August 1996 and 30 August 1996, my office and I had a number of conversations with the Minister for Health and Family Services and his office about private health insurance premium increases. In the course of those conversations, my office and I were informed that the Minister had personally been aware of at least one of these increases before the Budget. There is absolutely no disagreement between the Minister and me on any issues of substance relating to this matter. The last part of the Honourable Member's question must be considered in its my correct context, whereby earlier in Question Time today the Minister was responding to inteIjections from the Opposition as to whether he had a responsibility to inform me of an advertisement in a newspaper.'",163
