0,NA,Unknown,"be a sale to a syndicate of capitalists called the H all Sound Syndicate. The proposal was a very large one, and it was not carried out owing to objections raised by some of the State Governments, notably that of New South Wales-. I may say that the land embraced in that area which was to have been disposed of to the syndicate was no doubt good land, as land goes in New Guinea, and whether for better or for worse, it is still in the hands of the Crown. I-say "" for better or for worse "" because it may prove of advantage or otherwise to the Commonwealth. The prices asked, subject to arrangement with the Government, were not less than 2s. 6d. per acre for freehold agricultural land, and 6d. per acre for freehold pasturage land.",30
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"wish to call attention to Standing Order 54, which is some times transgressed. Perhaps it is advisable that I should read it. It providesEvery member of the House, when he comes into the Chamber, shall take his place, and shall not at any time stand in any of the passages or gangways. When I see honourable members standing in the passages, I call their attention to the standing order, which they sometimes appear to forget. If they will kindly remember it, it will not be necessary to mention it on future occasions.",30
2,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"The price asked for leasehold agricultural land was 6d. per acre, and for leasehold pasturage land Id. per acre. While the freehold conditions look extremely liberal, those who are acquainted with the conditions of pastoral estates on the mainland will not consider that the leasehold conditions are otherwise than substantial. I. am not saying this by way of advocating the purchase which was then proposed, but in order that honourable members may understand tlje terms upon which the land was offered.",30
3,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,The leasehold terms are six years' purchase.,30
4,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"My sole desire is to give honourable members an idea of what has been done, and of the prices which were fixed upon the land. The improvement conditions, which were to be subject to arrangement with the Government, provided for an expenditure of not less than 2s. 6d. per acre, within five years, upon agricultural land, and of not. less than 2s. per acre, also within five years, upon pasturage land. These lands were to be open for sale after the expiration of six months from the date of the third publication of the notice in the London Gazette. I find that in the British New Guinea Gazette of 28th December, 1901, it was announced that the following should be the schedule of deposits to be paid upon applications for land:-Te n acres and under, £ 3 ; over 10 acres, and under 50, £ 5 ; over 50, and under 200, £ 1 0 ; over 200, and under 1,000, £ 2 0 . For every additional 1,000, £10. Upon approval of publication, a further sum was to be deposited that, together with the first amount, would be equivalent to half the purchase money, plus the survey fee. The balance was to be paid upon issue of deed of grant. I have mentioned these matters, not for the purpose of showing that they are actually and fixedly regulated at present, or as indicating what, I think, ought to be done in the future. I simply wish to inform honourable members as to the conditions that have prevailed, and to show also that land has been obtainable at New Guinea at no great price; but that, nevertheless, the lowness of the prices has not attracted settlement. This shows conclusively that there must be some obstacle independently of the price, because, no doubt, alargequantityof the land would be useful and productive. One of the chief obstacles is that lack of communication to which I have referred, and I think that both for transit and postal purposes the Commonwealth ought to be prepared to do a little beyond granting £20,000 per annum towards the expenses of the Administration, with a view to turn the settlement to good account for white people, and at the same time promote the interests of those who were the original owners of the soil.",30
5,Mr BROWN,Unknown,What is the total area of alienated land in New Guinea 1,30
6,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I have not the figures by me, but I shall take a note of the honourable member's question, and have the information prepared before the close of the debate. I find that the mission work that has been done in New Guinea has been of great assistance^ to the Government. The most amicable relations have hitherto prevailed between the missionaries and the Government, and Sir George L e Hunte informed me some time ago that the Government were' very largely indebted for the progress made to the assistance and co-operation of the missionaries, especially in reference to the preservation of peace. That completes the short sketch-I honourable members will not think it too long-of the provisions of the Bill. able members will have inferred that it is not thought proper in this Bill, which is in the nature of a Constitution for New Guinea, to deal with questions which call for legislation. It is intended to leave these for subsequent action by the local authorities, subject to the control of the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth, and also to such controlling Acts as the Commonwealth itself may think fit and proper to pass. I have endeavoured to avoid laying down broad lines of policy relating to the land or other matters, leaving that for separate legislation, primarily by the Council, to be established in New Guinea, which will always be subject to the control of this Parliament. It will be necessary to make some provision with regard to our dealings by way of trade with New Guinea. I am afraid that I cannot do so in this Bill owing to the terms of the Constitution, but the matter is so important that I propose to make it the subject of a supplementary Bill. Honourable members have been informed that New Guinea has a small Tariff of her own which embraces some specific duties and a fair range of ad valorem duties. If I remember ""aright the ad valorem duties do not in any case exceed 10.per cent. Of course, it is a revenue Tariff pure and simple. Inasmuch as it is impossible to say that New Guinea has reached the stage at which manufactures can be established there, I do not propose, by any legislation at present, to interfere with the Tariff under which the possession raises a considerable portion of its annual But I put it to honourable members whether some distinction should not be made between territories which are acquired by the Commonwealth, and which become-even in a limited sense-part of Australia, and those which stand outside of it. To my thinking, in this young and struggling possession, which cannot have much in the way of manufactures, but which produces certain articles for export-its productions are varied, although there is no great quantity of them-we might make some relaxation in our Tariff. It appears to me that some consideration must be to such territories as they come under the regis of the Commonwealth. honourable members may entertain Sir Edmund Barton. objection to that proposal on the ground that hope the products are to some extent! raised by black labour. But it must not be forgotten Honor- that these people inhabit the territory of which we are assuming control, and in taking them underour protection, even if we are not bound to do so, we are, at any rate, justified in making to them some concession which we should not make to outsiders.",30
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It appears to me that the Prime Minister is anticipating a discussion upon a contingent motion which appears upon the business-paper.,31
8,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"Of course, I cannot make any such provision in this Bill . I was about to add that when the Legislative House resolves itself into a Committee of Ways and Means at an early date, I propose to put before honourable members a measure which is designed to effect that object. It consists only of a clause or two, and when it is submitted for consideration honourable members will be able to determine whether my proposal in that respect is a just one. I have now completed my sketch of the provisions of this Bill . I should like any honourable members who may be prepared to do so, to continue the discussion. I anticipate that the measure will incur some criticism, and I do not expect the motion for its second reading to be carried until further opportunity has been given for debate. If, however, any honourable member feels justified in commenting upon the Bill today, I shall be extremely pleased.",31
9,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,Unknown,"Does the measure contain any provision for the control of the liquor traffic 1 revenue. Sir EDMUND BARTON - There is no provision in the measure dealing with that question. This is more of a Constitution Bill . I may add, however, that the proper way to deal with the control of the liquor traffic, if it is not dealt with satisfactorily by local ordinances, is as a department of legislation in which the Commonwealth has its own powers, in the exercise of which it can see in what way that particular traffic can be prevented from becoming noxious to the community.",31
10,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," This B i ll is, of course, the natural extended corollary to the resolutions which were adopted by this House last session. No Some doubt it marks,a very interesting departure an on the part of the Commonwealth. We are asked to deal with the first dependency that has been under our Constitution. It seems to however, that this is a Bill which can be better discussed in Committee than upon the motion for its second reading. The number of questions which were asked the Prime Minister during the course of his speech clearly indicate that much of the criticism which may be levelled against the Bill depends upon the explanations which has to make. To my mind it is a simple, plain machinery bill for the of our new possession. In some respects apprehend that it is merely a tentative measure, because the Government possibly have had much opportunity of understanding the intricacies of. the ministration of New Guinea. As they become more fully acquainted with - them, I presume that this House will have an opportunity either of amending this Bill or of passing a more acceptable measure. There are one or two points which were not made quite clear by iny right honourable friend. I do not quite the connection between the control exercised by this Parliament and the administration in New Guinea. I presume that there will adjourned. be full power of control, to prevent the Legislative Council and the Administrator of the Government of Papua from doing anything that might be inimical to the general interests 1",31
11,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"Oh, yes; the power of disallowance which the Crown possesses in regard to our legislation. is a provision that measures of special portance shall be reserved for the assent the ""Go vernor-G en eral. Sir "" WILLIAM MCMILLAN - This B also embodies the regulations made by Imperial Government which were operative under the administration of Queensland.",32
12,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Where they are repealed a substituted provision has been made to the same effect.,32
13,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, referring to the very low price at which land was offered agents in Papua, said that that inducement ment was not sufficient to attract population. If there be any difficulty in attracting population there, we cannot do better take a leaf out of the book of Canada granting special terms to people who are prepared to occupy moderate areas, paying available. no regard to the matter of price. In a country like New Guinea, which possesses established climate that is not suitable to the white me, races, we need, whilst preventing speculation and land-grabbing, tooffer the utmost inducements to those who are willing to overcome the difficulties incidental to its development. I am glad to know that one of the chief points of administration will be to conserve the privileges and rights of the people who were the original inhabitants of he the land. I have no doubt that with our experience of land settlement, which we administration have gained in previous years, the adminisI tration of this territory under the Commonwealth will be much better than it was cannot under the British . Government. Whilst I have no desire to prevent second readading speeches upon the Bill, I think that as the machinery which it provides is of a veiy simple character, it might be better to take the measure formally into Committee, and then to adjourn its further consideration. If no other honourable member . desires to speak upon it-and I have just sacrificed my own opportunity-the Prime Minister might see consent to that course. B y that means I think that time will be saved. Debate (on motion by Mr HENRY WILLIS ) PERSONAL EXPLANATION. - Mr SALMON (Laanecoorie) - I desire to make a personal explanation. I intended to take this course at the commencement of our proceedings today, but the honourable There member for Melbourne was not then in his implace, and therefore I deferred my opportuof nity. In addressing the House upon the 16th July, I stated that the freight for ill horses from Melbourne to South Africa the was £ 8 per head. The honourable member for Melbourne challenged the accuracy of my statement and saidIf the honourable member will give me the horses I will have them conveyed from Melbourne to South Africa at £5 per head by a steamer leaving here on the 20th inst. A firm of shippers and stock and station in Melbourne upon seeing that statein the press, applied - to Messrs. M c l l wraith, MCEacharn, and Co. for space for a number of horses on the Cooeyannaj which than was supposed bo leave Melbourne on the by 20bh inst. They were bold, however, that the vessel was full, and that no space was",32
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the honourable mema ber explaining any matter ?,32
15,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Yes . The accuracy of my statement was challenged, and I am showing that it was substantially correct, and that horses could not be shipped to South Africa for £ 5 per head. Whilst the honourable member for North Sydney was speaking, I interjectedDo all these lines cany eargo to South Africa ? I think the honourable member is wrong He then askedWhich line does not! To which I repliedThe White Star Line. The honourable member 'for Melbourne then interjectedThe White Star Line carries oargo. I have since applied to Messrs. Dalgety and Company, the agents for the vessels, who have assured me that they do not carry cargo to South Africa. The accuracy of these two statements was challenged, and I think it is right that I should show that they were both correct. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I think it would have been fairer if the honourable member for Laanecoorie had informed me of his intention to bring this matter before the House. I am not prepared to answer his statements as fully as I should have been, had he given me notice of his intention. Under similar circumstances I think that I should have extended that courtesy to him. The statement which I made, that the freight for horses from Melbourne to South Africa was"" not £ 8 per head, is perfectly correct. Steamers will carry horses, when their deck space is free, for less money than that. Had the Cooeyanna had space available, we should have been only too glad to carry them for £ 5 a head. After the honourable member had spoken upon Thursday last, I found, upon returning to my office, that whilst the information previously in my possession was that the Cooeyanna had deck space available, that space had since been filled up with sheep. H a d deck space been available, we should have been only too glad to carry horses to South Afric a for £ 5 per head. Regarding the honourable member's statement that the White Star line does not carry cargo, I should like him to ask Messrs. Dalgety and Co. whether that line is not interested in a contract for the carriage of fruit from Tasmania, also whether it is not interested in a contract for the carriage of butter 1 I shall be surprised indeed if the information conveyed to me regarding the White Star line is incorrect. T was informed that it was a party to a contract for the carriage ofbutter. DEFENCE BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 16th July, (vide page 2278), on motion by Sir JOHN FORRESTThat the Bill be now read a second time.",33
16,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"South Sydney). - I scarcely think that the Minister for Defence can expect this measure to be passed into law with the celerity that his breezy optimism suggests. Although the measure has been before us for a considerable time it is one of very great importance. The Minister for Defence invited the House to allow the Bill to go speedily into Committee, so that it may become law without delay, and spoke in a way that seemed to suggest that the whole matter had practically been consented to. I should like to be able to join with the patriotic Opposition in assisting the Government in this matter, just as we have done in regard to other questions; but I feel satisfied that if we allowed the Bill to go into Committee immediately, our action would result only in a still greater loss of time. The Minister has requested us to read the Bill together with the regulations that have been made under it. I have spent many hours in looking over this measure, and, indeed, in reading up the whole question of the defences' of the Commonwealth. I have also perused the regulations that have been recently issued under the powers conferred upon the Minister by the Defence Acts of the States. And having done so, having considered all that has been put before us on the subject, I feel bound to ask-""What is now the defence policy of the Commonwealth ?"" Two years have elapsed since the Defence Department was taken over by the Commonwealth, and we have a right now to ask the Ministry what is their defence policy. The Minister for Defence has had the privilege of moving the second reading of two Defence Bills in this House. On each occasion he has explained to us their various provisions, but we are still utterly in the dark-and those who take part in our defence are themselves also still in the dark - as to - what is to be the Commonwealth system of military defence. The Minister says that we must regard this measure as a machinery Bill. No doubt that is so. But I hold that, according to the best examples we have in the political history of the mother of Parliaments, in introducing a measure of so much importance as this, the Minister-and particularly in the exceptional circumstances in which the question of defence has so long stood-shoul d not only have explained the provisions of the Bill, but should have detailed the system to be pursued in regard to our defences. Upon that point, which is. of so much interest to every one who has to take a part in shaping the legislation of .the Commonwealth, we have no information. The Minister has referred us to the regulationsthat have been issued - under the various States Acts. I 'have read those regulations, and it seems to me that in them, as in the measure itself, there is no declaration of policy. No glimmering is given of what is to be the system of land defence for Australia.",33
17,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,A citizen soldiery.,34
18,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I wish to rebest mind the Minister that Canada and Switzertralia. land have a system of citizen soldiery, that the colonies which now form this Comshould monwealth have each had a separate system of citizen soldiery. We desire now to which of those systems, or what combination of the whole, is to be adopted by the Comthe monwealth? Prior to federation the various colonies had schemes of defence which more frequently than otherwise were systems comparative mismanagement calculated result in chaos. It was always that one of the most important benefits, so far as the question of economy was concerned, to be secured to us by federation, was that we should obtain an improved system of defence for a greatly reduced expenwho diture. So far, however, we have seen nothing in the shape of the result which was anticiwas pated by so many federalists. It was always urged, prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, that under federation we should have great savings and secure better and more efficient defence. U the present we have certainly made savings, but until we have obtained more light guidance than it has yet suited the - try to give to this House, it will be imposmore rapidly established. sible for any one - to say whether we have secured a more efficient system. evidence of the absence of systematic consideration, I desire, in the first instance, to refer to the report of the Federal Military Committee, which sat here nearly two years ago. In this interesting report, it is stated that a sub-committee strongly recommended thatIn order that a scheme may be prepared for the division of the Commonwealth into military districts a map should be prepared showing1. The distribution of the population within the Commonwealth. 2. Facilities for transport by land and sea. 3. Distribution of the existing forces. 4. Position of strategical ports, coaling and cable stations. The sub-committee concluded their report with the following recommendation :That the Minister be recommended to appoint an organizing committee of five officers representing the General Staff, Artillery, Engineers, Departmental Corps, and Pay Department, to procure and collate the information required under sub-paragraphs (as) and (ft). That the above committee should be instructed that they are not to lay down anj' organization, but to confine themselves solely to procuring and arranging the data necessary for laying down the organization. The committee consisted of some of the military experts that we had in AusThe3 concluded their report with a r and - request that this essential information be collected presumably for the use of the General Officer Commanding, who know had not then been appointed, and one of the first and signal blunders committed by Department was its failure to carry out that recommendation. These facts should have been collected not only for the guidof ance of the General Officer Commanding, to but for the information of this House. said It is true that the fact that a general officer had not been appointed affords some excuse for the failure of the Government to do more than they did in 'the early stages of the Commonwealth. I was one of those entirely coincided with the expressions of approval which were offered when it announced that the services of the present General Officer Commanding had been secured. I think, however, that immediately after the appointment of that disa tinguished soldier the Government should p to have commenced to frame a system of defence, and that they should have laid and that system before this House. In that Minisway the system would have been much But what did the Ministry do ? They seem to have left As an the whole matter entirely in the hands of this distinguished soldier. They left it t6 him to give them the lead as to called the character which our defence should take. If the question at issue had been purely one as to the calibre of dealing guns, the quantity and character of the small arms to be provided, the quantity of munition necessary, the kind of uniform be worn by the troops, and the tactics to followed, the Minister might well have pended upon the advice of that very skilled and distinguished expert. But a Ministry whose Treasurer, in the course his first Budget statement, said that stood aghast at the enormous military penditure which had been piled States; a Ministry whose Minister for Defence admitted, when we were dealing the House. with the first Defence Estimates submitted to the House, that they were at least £100,000 toohigh, whoconsented to cut them down by £131,000. and who subsequently cut them down by £175,000, and agreed to reduce them still further ; a Ministry such as this, who finally said they believed. that we should still secure efficiency notwithstanding all these savings, to the Commanding Officer as soon as he was appointed-""We are of opinion that the land defences of this Commonwealth should be made effective for a sum of £600,000 per annum."" They might have mentioned that amount or whatever other sum they thought should be allocated to that important object. They might also ing that they considered that the defence system of the Commonwealth should have yertain broad characteristics. They might have allowed the General Officer Commandthis ing to present them with a report within those lines, setting forth some system which they could have placed before the House, and upon which they might have obtained House, some expression of legislative opinion.",34
19,Sir JOHNFOHREST,Unknown,We did so.,35
20,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,If the Government have done so they have never taken this House into their confidence. No definite scheme has been put before us. Sir JOHN .FORREST - We have never a chance to do so.,35
21,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,We have never had a scheme placed before us.,35
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The House will have the report from the General Officer ComEstimates, manding in the course of the next day or two.",35
23,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"We are now upon to legislate upon this question, and we have to form conclusions as to the land defence of Australia. When we were with the question of naval defence' no such difficulty was experienced. A clearamcut proposal was put before us. The whole to of the details of that proposal were as be freely available to every honourable member deof this House as they were to the members of the Ministry, and the House had no difficulty in arriving at an intelligent deof cision. But so far as our land defences are he concerned, the expenditure upon them has exbeen cut down from time to time with the up by the consent of the Ministry.",35
24,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"B y the direction of Mr G . B . EDWARDS - The decision of the House was that the Estimates first submitted to us should be reduced by £131,000. Subsequently the Ministry reduced those Estimates by £175,000.",35
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Then honourable members reduced them to the extent of should have said another £62,000.",35
26,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"That is so. The Acting Minister for Defence at that time said that they could be cut down to that extent, and that the forces would still remain effective. In view of that fact, it is useless to blame any section of this House for having reduced the Defence Estimates. have The Government made themselves a party to the reduction. So far as that reduction is concerned, I do not know of any more maligned political party in House than is the labour party. I, with other honourable members of the Opposition, as well as certain honourable members on the Government side of the joined with the labour party in insisting that the Estimates should be reduced. Yet from time to time we see statements in many of the principal newspapers in Australia, blaming one particular party in this House for having ruthlessly cut down our defence expenditure, and left the country undefended. Such a charge is not just. It is not in accordance with the facts. had The true history of the cutting down of our Defence Estimates is to be found in Hansard, and in the journals of the House. They show that on every occasion when Ministers were urged to reduce the Defence they were apparently only too willing to do so. As a matter of fact, before any attempt had been made to reduce them, the Treasurer, as I have already pointed out, Stated in the course of his first financial statement that he stood aghast at the enormous totals. Jn dealing with the contingencies or allowances he remarked that he was positively afraid to add up the totals because he did not know to what proportions they might reach. that, we have the fact that the cost of the States systems of defence carried on prior to Federation was rapidly approaching something like £1,000,000 per annum. If we have to pay anything like an adequate sum for the naval defence of Australia, the Commonwealth will not be able to afford the expenditure we are drifting into in regard to our land defences.",35
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There is nothing in this J3ill as to money matters. Mr G. 33. EDWARDS - The fault of the Bill is that it puts no system before us. The history of this question shows that from the very first we have been awaiting the presentation of a scheme.,36
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member should look at clause 27. That provides for a system.,36
29,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I have looked through the Bill most carefully, and I see nothing in it but a want of system. Indeed, there is an inconsistency in several of the clauses, to which I shall have to refer later on. The measure was brought before us in the first instance on the 2nd August, 1901. But on the 30th April, 1902, during the consideration of the Estimates, the light honourable gentleman admitted and his statement is on record in LTanscurd - that £100,000 could be saved in the Defence expenditure, and that, although he could not undertake that saving in the expenditure of the current year, he would see that it was made next year. A motion was carried to reduce the Defence expenditure by £200,000",36
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think that the honourable member should deal more closely with the provisions of the Bill itself.',36
31,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"No doubt you are right, Mr Speaker. I shall, therefore, make no further reference to the detsiils of this matter. At present, however, the case stands in this position : AVe have repeatedly discussed the various phases of military organization, but, whether we have been dealing with the financial aspect of the question or with the system of defence to be adopted, the difficulty has always been that no proposal for any definite plan of organization has ever been put before us. Consequently, we have always been in the dark as to the best way in which to face the problem before us. There is another matter to which I wish to refer. Although Ministers have received Apart from advice from the General Officer Commanding, and from other experts, it is quite apparent that those experts were not aware, when they prepared their reports, of the arrangements into which we have just entered for the naval defence of Australia. Their recommendations were not based upon the knowledge that this House would vote for the scheme of naval defence to which we have just agreed, a scheme much more effective than any hitherto in existence. It has been my contention all through that, in dealing with the Defence expenditure of the country, we should determine, not only exactly how much we are prepared to spend, but upon what system we are prepared to spend it, and what steps will be taken for the provision of naval defence. If Ministers are guided by the advice which they receive from the General Officer Commanding, how is it that nothing has been done so far towards strengthening what he has indicated as the weakest part of our defences t It has been pointed out that an expenditure of perhaps £500,000 is necessarily to properly equip our forts.",36
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not yet coming to the Bill.,36
33,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I intend to point out that the Bill does not provide for a proper scheme of defence, and that it is only when we have a well-grounded and thoroughly considered system before us that we can properly deal with the matter.",36
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member should read clause 27. That and the following clauses will give him all information as to the system which,the Government intend to adopt.",36
35,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I have read every clause in the Bill , and I intend presently to refer to them briefly, in order to point out what I consider defects in the measure. When we were dealing with the Defence Bill introduced last session, a great deal was .said about the expensiveness of the officers' uniforms, but there is no provision in this Bill to regulate that matter. Honourable members generally were of opinion that equal opportunities must be afforded to the members of a citizen defence force to become officers if they duly qualify themselves for commissions; and, that being so, the Minister should not only have provided for such equal opportunities, but should have introduced into the measure what I might term a sumptuary clause, which would prevent the wearing of expensive uniforms such as men of small means could not afford to purchase.",36
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Regulation s have already been published concerning the uniforms of both officers and men. Mr G. B : EDWARDS - At the very time when we were discussing the matter here, and honourable members were objecting to the use of expensive lace and braid and other adornments on officers' uniforms, the subject was also being discussed by the members of the Canadian Parliament, and they were equally of opinion that, not only should opportunities be given to every man in their citizen defence forces to obtain a commission and distinguish himself in the service of the Dominion, but that no obstacle should be placed in the way of the acceptance of a commission by a man of small means because of the expensiveness of the uniform which would have to be worn.",37
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member should read clause 11.,37
38,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I would point out to the House that our attitude in regard to this matter is not merely the attitude of an extremely democratic people. The question is being dealt with even in the old countries of the world, where military systems have been in existence for centuries. In Great Britain a special committee was recently appointed on the motion of the Secretary of State for War, to inquire into the nature of the expenses incurred by the officers of the British Army, and to suggest measures for bringing commissions within the reach of men of moderate means. It must be remembered that that committee was asked to inquire into the conditions prevailing in the regular army of a country where social differences exist which we have not to consider here. Y e t in concluding their report they recommended that none but authorized articles of uniform shall be worn by officers under any circumstances, and that frequent changes in the details or design of dress should be discountenanced to the utmost extent practicable. When a recommendation such as that is made in the old country in regard to the uniforms of the officers of the regulararmy, surely we have every justification for' the attitude which we have taken up in regard to the uniforms of the officers of our citizen army. The Bill , but for one or two signal exceptions, is on the lines of the measure introduced last session. I shall give the Government every assistance to get it into Committee, so that we may obtain a workablemeasure under which the defence force of the Commonwealth may be properly organized. As the Minister has said, it is largely a machinery Bill , under which we can provide for the employment of 50Q,000 soldiers, or for a force of only 200 or 300. There are, however, some clauses in it which provide for one system, while other clauses provide for another system, and I intend to address myself to the House particularly in regard to those clauses, in the hope that the Ministry will consider the objections that are pointed out, and will be willing to accept in Committee the amendments which I feel sure honourable gentlemen will wish to make. The Minister has taken credit, and I think rightly, for giving preference, under clause 11, in the appointment of officers, to persons who have served in the defence force "" for three years without a commission."" Nothing seems to me fairer and more equitable than a provision of that character. It carries into effect an idea which I have always entertained, that we can never make a defence force popular with the masses, upon whom we have to depend for the defence of the country, unless opportunities are given to all its members to qualify for, and to obtain, commissions, if they desire to do so. That being so, it is only right that men who have served in the ranks should, other things being equal, have the preference in the appointment of officers before persons coming from outside. I do not see, however, why this provision should apply only to the "" first appointment of officers."" Why should it not apply to every appointment, if the principle is a good one? Another provision of which I approve is that which empowers the Governor General to appoint any person to be an officer, or to promote an officer for distinguished service or marked gallantry in the field, without requiring him, to pass the prescribed examination - But although that is a very good clause, I hope that our forces will never be engaged in actual warfare, and that, therefore, there will never be an opportunity to bring it into force. The provisions of clauses 24 and 25 are very different from the provisions of clause the Bill introduced last session. That provided a limitation of the tenure of certain important appointments.",37
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Since then it has laid seemed better to allow the matter to be on dealt with by regulation.,38
40,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I think that i is a matter which should not be dealt with divided by regulation. We leave too many matters structional. toregulation. Under clause 15 of the Bill first introduced officers were limitedin theirtenure of important positions, and after listening system to the discussion on the second reading of that measure, I came to the conclusion that there were good reasons for such a limitation. A man may have done good service which mental entitled him to appointment to an important Artillery. position, but he may afterwards, by reason of age or for some other cause, become capacitated for the proper performance of committee his duties. It is not pleasant for a Minismake ter to have to force such an officer to retire, and consequently he often remains on after he is really incompetent. The provision to which I am referring, however, provided for the compulsory retirement of such the officers. Under this Bill, the Governoreconomized, General is to have power to place officers upon the retired list, and to fix by regulatraining, tion the ages for the retirement of officers. In my opinion those provisions are not as when good as the provision in clause 15 of the original Bill . The clause which provides for the establishment of a naval college is a very important one. I do not know that we are likely should to take immediate action for the estaband lishment of such a college, but it tary is quite certain that something must be done at this end of the world to provide for the military education of our officers. was pleased to hear the Minister say that he had taken great interest in what had seen of the administration of Kingston College in Canada. A great number of committees have been sitting in England, inquiring into various military matters, and one of the subjects thus dealt with is education and training of military officers. Some of the disclosures made by the evidence obtained by that committee show that if we rely entirely upon the old country for officers, we may get men who have been brought up in a very bad school. In many respects the existing military schools utterly condemned by the committee. W i the Woolwich Academy the committee 15 of expressed themselves as "" on the whole clause satisfied,"" but they recommended certain changes, special stress, according to the weekly edition of the London Times, being the defective organization which separates the command from the instruction of the cadets. t It would appear from the committee's remarks that the officers placed over the cadets are into two branches-disciplin e and inThe discipline officers have nothing to say to instruction, and the instructional officers have nothing to do with the command.. This is the legacy of bygone days. It is a matter for surprise that the Woolwich authorities, who, in all other respects, are so entirely up-todate, should have waited for an outside committee to suggest a change which has been long ago applied throughout that admirable regiorganization which exists in the Royal inTurning from Woolwich to Sandhurst, the remarks which are wholly unfavorable, and constitute a severe indictment of the college administration. According to the report of Mr. ""Akers-Donglas and his colleagues, there is a lamentable lack of supervision both of the indoor studies and of the outdoor work of the cadets, time and duties of instructors being badly and arranged with only haphazard regard to the discipline and educational requirements of the students. The drill and practical instead of being carried out by the officers, are delegated to staff-sergeants, and, the committee asked the Assistant-Commandant for an explanation of this extraordinary arrangement, he admitted the system to be bad, but ascribed it to the incapacity of the officers military and under his command. This report also recommends that advantage be taken of some of the universities, I think that even if we establish a milicollege for the instruction of our officers in certain lines of military education, we should still take some measures to get our I officers passed through the universities in order that they may possess special groundhe work qualifications. I come next to what are called the divisions of the defence forces, and this is where I complain of the utter lack of system in the proposals. The existing militia and volunteer forces are to be perthe petuated. I have never been able to understand why we should preserve the distinction that exists between volunteer and militia forces. Some militia officers will say that the our militia has turned out the best class of serviceable men, and, on the other hand, volunteer officers claim that their system has are been attended with the best results. I do t h not care what kind of force we have, but if we are going to create citizen forces-and the title chosen by the Minister for Defence is an admirable one-w e ought not to have volunteers. two classes of men. We do not volunteers on the one hand, and partially paid men on the other. We should get rid serves. of these shreds and patches-thes e tattered remnants of an army. Our military forces should consist of riflemen clothed in the same uniform and subject to regulations, as to pay and otherwise, in all the States. I believe the wisest have been to get rid of the old system, lock, stock, and barrel, and start anew, because, undoubtedly, the changes which have been made, or which are under contemplation, have very much disorganized tire forces, and have disheartened some of the best of the men. It would have been very much more satisIt factory if the whole of the forces had been disbanded and re-enrolled under a new uniform system.",38
41,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Whic h would the honornationalizing able member prefer-voluntee r or partiallyput paid forces?,39
42,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I do not care very much which we have, but our system should certainly be uniform. Perhaps we an allowance. ought to have partially-paid men, because I do not think we should get as good results from a purely, volunteer force as from a annum. partially-paid body of men. The men should not expect to receive payment equal to the wage of a first-class mechanic, they should be paid at a fair rate for their time and trouble in 'submitting training and discipline. In Canada the defenceless. forces are practically all militia-, the receiving only half-a-dollar, or about per day, compared with the 8s. per received by the members of our partiallyto paid forces. The militiamen of Canada, therefore, occupy a position midway between our volunteer and militia forces. We cannot have an effective national system of milianxious tary defence which provides for both classes of soldiers. There must necessarily be a feeling of irritation on the part of volungive teers when they know that other men ceive 8s. a day. Let us glance at the anomaly which presents itself in another respect. I have here the latest return which I was able to obtain relating to the stiength of the forces in the different States. In New South Wales the estabdicated lishment of the partially-paid 5,527, and that of the volunteer forces 3,479. In Victoria there are 3,405 partiallyvolunteers paid or militiamen, and 2,729 volunteers. the world. Queensland has 2,768 militiamen and 638 South Australia has 1,968 want militiamen and no volunteers.",39
43,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,But they have re,39
44,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"We s t e r n Australia has no militia, but 1,923 volunteers. Tasmania has practically no militia but she the same has 2,043 volunteers.",39
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Thos e are not the plan would most recent figures.,39
46,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"They are dated 23rd of April, 1903. I have quoted the establishment, and not the actual strength. The actual strength varies but very slightly from these figures. I do not think the difference amounts to more than 7 per cent. it will be seen that some of the States have practically all militia and some practiand cally all volunteers, and the return will serve for the purposes of my argument. In the defence forces, we should them upon one common footing. If we cannot induce men to submit themselves to training for the purposes of defence without payment, we should make some provision for",39
47,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"We should have to provide for an additional £70,000 per",39
48,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I should not object to that. Although I have joined but others in cutting down the Defence Estimates, I should never be a party to reducing to them to the extent of leaving the country I am ready to pay any men amount that is necessary for defence 2s. purposes; but I want our defences to day be arranged upon a proper system, and be assured that, we are getting what we pay for. . I am certain that under the old regime scarcely one of the States got fair value for its money. I am to assist the Minister, whose heart I know is in this measure, to adopt some good system of military defence, which will us' as effective a force as possible refor the money which we are prepared to spend upon it. If another .£70,000is required in order to bring our forces into a proper state of efficiency I shall be quite satisfied to grant it. I know that if we act in the direction I have in a far more satisfactory spirit will forces is prevail among the men.",39
49,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,There are militia and in - practically every country in,39
50,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Not in Canada. Perhaps the honourable and learned member - does not consider that half a dollar a day - could be called payment.,40
51,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I should not call it pay ; it would be more like tea money.,40
52,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I scarcely re.gard 2s. a day as adequate payment for the time which a militia man would have to devote to training in order to make himself efficient. The Bill provides that the permanent forces may be - employed outside of the Commonwealth or its waters. When the Minister was addressing the House I could not help asking him why he sought this power, and he pointed - out that the men belonging to the permanent forces had adopted soldiering as a profession, and that there was no reason why they should not be sent beyond the bounds of the Commonwealth if it were - considered desirable. It is not on account - of the men that I object to the clause, but because I do not see why the Government - should be granted such a power. I can well understand that our ships should be permitted to go beyond territorial limits, but there is no reason why our soldiers should be required to do so. The defence - of Australia, so far as the army is concerned, should be confined to operations upon our own soil, and the Government - should not have power to send away our men to take part in some war in which we might have little or no interest.",40
53,Sir JOHNPOKREST,Unknown,"We are a part of the Empire, and if the Empire were at war we should be at war also.",40
54,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I am just as loyal to the _ Empire as is any honourable member, but I think that it is well to sionally check that desire for military ploits which exists even in this part of world. The provision that members of the citizen, forces of the Commonwealth shall not be required to serve beyond the limits - of the Commonwealth is a very proper one, because the Constitution does not empower us to go beyond protecting the Commonadopt wealth. Some objection has been raised to clause 47, which provides for the protection of the States against domestic violence, but, it seems to me that by inserting a provision of this kind the - Government have simply discharged a constitutional liability. It is clear that is only in cases where a Government of State has proclaimed that domestic violence exists therein, that the Governor General, upon the application of the Government of the State, may call out the forces necessary for its protection. There can be no danger in granting such a power. There is a very broad distinction between our power to deal with defences, and that which is conferred under the Constitution of the United States. In the United States each separate State, subject to the ultimate authority of the Federal Government, controls the militia forces, and can use them for the suppression of domestic violence, but under our Constitution all power over the defence forces is vested in the Federal Government. Therefore, some such clause is necessary. I think that the Minister is quite wrong in desiring power to call out the whole of the male inhabitants of Australia in case of emergency. H is object is to show to' the rest of the world that, if occasion demanded it, the Commonwealth could put a million men in the field. The fallacy of that position is at once obvious. It is true that we could put a million men in the field, if necessary. But what sort of men would they be ? The greatest experts in the world would acknowledge that they would be absolutely useless. What we require is a body of thoroughly trained and efficient men, and I do not think that the power to call out the whole of the male population of the Commonwealth between the ages of 18 and 60 years will ever require to be exercised. If occasion arose, the safety of the State being is the highest law, the Minister would have that power. The clause in question is, to my mind, a blot upon the Bill . It implies a doubt as to the capacity of Australia to occadefend herself under a purely voluntary exsystem. I hold that, if we adopt a system the which commends itself to the patriotism and democratic spirit of our people, there will be no need for the exercise of these extraordinary powers, because the patriotism of Australia will provide sufficient men for her defence. If the Minister desires to a system such as that which the clause suggests, he had far better go in for conscription at once, because by that means he would secure trained men. Personally, however, I am opposed to conscription. The idea of putting a million men in thefieldfor the purpose of bluffing Russia or Germany is it altogether too thin to be contemplated in a a Bill of this character. Under clause 58 power is conferred to establish and maintain a cadet force. I do not think we can obtain any system of defence which is likely to prove satisfactory which has not the cadet force for its basis. Quite recently a series of articles appeared in the Times concerning the military resources of Great Britain. The author of those articles, who is evidently very well acquainted with the military system, not only of England, but of the rest of the world, lays great stress upon the power of Great Britain and Ireland to defend themselves without any regular soldiery whatever if the potentiality of a citizen defence is sufficiently appreciated. He declares that they should adopt the system of training cadets in their schools and universities. B y instructing children at school they receive a much more efficient training than they are likely - to get subsequently. Even if the State had to pay for compelling them to remain at school a year longer than would otherwise be required of them, in order that they might receive the rudimentary training of soldiers, I hold that the money would be well invested from a national point of view. Under clause 61 power is given to the military authorities to assume control over the States railways. That is a power, which cannot be avoided in case of war. But under this Bill power is given to use not only the States railways and tramways, but also private railways and ferries. An officer simply b}' wearing a uniform can thus make use of any railway or ferry without paying toll.",40
55,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Does not that apply only to time of war ?,41
56,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"No ; it applies also to times of peace. Clause 64 providesMembers of the defence force may, as prescribed, be billetted, quartered, or cantoned, nothing in this Act shall authorize the quartering or billeting of any member of the defence force in any house solely occupie c women or by women and children. Strange to say the regulations under that provision apply only to time of war, whereas the operation of the clause itself is not restricted in any way. I think that is an oversight. Every civilized community has abandoned the idea of quartering troops, except in times of great emergency. The power to make regulations under this Act is one that I think should be limited. I have seen most important regulations tabled here, which have been confirmed through defaulb of objection being taken'to them, and they have thus received the force of law. Under this Bill there is the usual stipulation thatAll regulations shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within 30 days after the making thereof, if the Parliament be then sitting, and i not, then within 30 days after the next meeting of the Parliament. If either House of the Parliament passes a resolution, at anytime within fifteen sitting days after any regulation is laid before it, disallowing any such regulation, that regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. I should like to point out that regulations made under a Defence Act are amongst the most important matters that can affect society r The power to get a regulation confirmed through default of objection being taken to it by this House within fifteen days is one which should not be vested in any Ministry. It would be utterly impossible for any honourable member who might disapprove of any regulation to get a specific motion bearing upon it discussed within that period. Further, he could not deal with the question except by consent of the Government or by adopting an extreme course which might involve a crisis. In matters of such importance as regulations under a Defence Act, which may affect society and the libertj' of individuals",41
57,Sir JOHN FORKEST,Unknown,They are not so wide as that.,41
58,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Thes e regulations are very wide indeed.,41
59,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,How could this House discuss and settle a set of regulations of that kind?,41
60,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I am merely pointing out that we shall not get an opportunity of considering them. "" I think that a substantive resolution by a member of the Ministry thatany regulation should but have the force of law would overcome the difficulty. Then there are some minor clauses in the Bill bearing upon the question of the wearing of the military uniform or dress. I often think that we have not been careful enough to preserve the dignity of the uniform. I have seen the uniform of a militia man positively degraded. In dealing with offences of that kind the powers conferred under this Bill are not sufficiently great. Clause 79 saysAny person who not being a member of the defence force wears any uniform of the defence force, or any colourable imitation thereof, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds. Provided that this section shall not prevent any person from wearing any uniform or dress in the course of a stage play, a music hall or circus performance, a ball, or a bondfidemilitary representation. I see no reason for allowing the military uniform of the Commonwealth to be worn by a performer in a circus or a stage play. Our young soldiers should be taught to respect their uniform as they are taught to respect their flag. That uniform ought to be protected from the insults which have been heaped upon it in the past, at any rate, in some of the States with which I am acquainted. The clauses dealing with courts martial I must leave for the consideration of the legal members of the House. I think the Minister may accept my assurance that we shall do our best to pass the Bill this session. Certainly he needs it. He has already deferred its consideration too long, and I think he has been wanting in his duty to this House in not having made us acquainted with the system under which he intends to carry on the defence of the Commonwealth. In a breezy, cheery way he invites us to pass it en bloc, and indeed he would like to attach to it a provision for the construction of the transcontinental railway. Cato in the Roman Legislature used to conclude every speech he made with the words Delenda est Carthago- "" Carthage must be destroyed,"" which he declared he would repeat until Carthage was destroyed. Similarly it seems to me that the Minister must refer to the construction of the transcontinental railway in every speech that he makes. I hold that that line is not required so much for defence purposes as it is for the purpose of connecting the States for the purposes of trade and commerce. I trust that the right honourable gentleman will obtain both the railway and the Bill , and that the latter will provide the Commonwealth with an efficient system of defence.",41
61,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne) I must say that I have read this Bill with surprise and with pleasure. I desire to congratulate the Minister upon the very manifest improvement in tone which this Bill displays. We saw in the original Defence Bill all the swagger and bluster of swollen militarism, but in this we have a much more moderate proposal, which I hope will eventually be moulded into a practical scheme for the Commonwealth of Australia. In the original Bill it was actually proposed that every man who enlisted in a rifle club, in 6 Y order to make himself proficient in the use of the rifle, should be liable to be ordered against his will to Afghanistan, Africa, or anywhere else. We have no such provision in this Bill . I agree, however, with the honourable member for South Sydney, that we miss, both in the opening statement made by the Minister, and in the Bill itself, any reference to a definite system which would commend itself to the people or the Parliament of Australia. It seems to me that in Australia we have been fluctuating in regard to this matter between fits of scare and fits of economy, and that we do. not exactly know whether we should throw all our money into defence and its cognate subjects, or whether we should set apart no money whatever for that purpose. Therefore we have at present a system of defence which is really no system, which is not founded upon any definite lines, and at the same time we have no guidance from the Minister as to the policy that we ought to adopt. I do not speak as an expert in regard to these matters, but I consider that it is about time that those who are not experts should remove the heavy heel of the expert, with his clanking spurs, and show from the common sense point of view of ordinary people what seems to be required in this direction. I am quite content to accept, as authoritative and correct, the opinion given by Major General Hutton in the report presented by him in A p r i l of last year. In that report he shows, as clearly as any one could show, that it is absurd to suppose that there will be much need of land forces in Australia. After all Australia is an island, and we cannot make it anything else. If we cast aside the responsibility that we are taking upon us of having a land frontier in New Guinea we must see that an attack upon us must be from oversea, and our position is as Major - General Hutton describes itEfforts at oversea aggression upon Australian soil will in all probability therefore be reduced to raids by an enemy's cruisers based on his defended ports. Such raids might be undertaken to extort an indemnity under threat of bombard ment, or to destroy commerce, or to obtain coal He points out how that with a people so truly united as we are in one allegiance it would be utterly absurd for any large body of troops to attempt to obtain a permanent footing upon Australian soil in support of a foreign power. No one would venture upon such an experiment. I think that there has been far too much made of the necessity for infantry, and even as to the necessity for artillery and engineering corps, while far too little has been made of the necessity for the naval defence of Australia. I am not, however, going to carry that opinion to an extreme. Evidently the people are very desirous of having some kind of a defence force, and even if it were only for the sake of the physical training and discipline which it affords, I think it may be ad visable that we should have one. I believe that, in this Bill , the Minister is claiming for the Government of the Commonwealth, from time. to time, extraordinary and unconstitutional powers with regard to the determination of what is ""war"" and ""time of war."" He proposes in the Bill to give the Government, for the time being, very large powers "" in time of war "" or "" war."" If we turn to the definition of those terms in the interpretation clause, we find that they virtually mean that the extraordinary powers proposed to be given to the Government are to be used, and that the ordinary courts are to be closed, at the will of the Minister in office-no t necessarily in the case of war, but if he considers there is danger of war.",42
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable learned memberobjected to the use of the word "" emergency "" in the last Bill. word would he have us use 1",43
63,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"It is not a question of words, but of things.",43
64,Sir JOHN POEREST,Unknown,Would the honourable and learned member have us wait until the Minister saw the danger at our very door ?,43
65,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I "" do not wish to put this matter unfairly. I am sorry that the Minister cannot distinguish in this case between words and things. He was usually able to do so in Western Australia. If the Government chooses under this Bill to say that there is clanger of war, not in Australia but in any part of the British Empire, they will be able to bring into play the extraordinary powers with which they are to be vested, to call out the inhabitants, and .to enforce what is called martial law. If honourable members turn to the definition clause, they will see that although the opening words are fair sounding and correct, the words at the end are dangerous. The Minister read to us an extract from the United States Act . But he will find no words in that law that enable the Government to say finally whether a state of war exists. That is a responsibility which the Government must take. It is a responsibility which was taken by the British Government in the South African trouble. It is a responsibility which was discussed in the De Marais case in the Privy Council. The truth is that it is a very important protection to the liberty of private people, that a general *vho enforces martial law takes the risk of being able to prove that a "" war,"" or a "" state of war,"" exists in that district. I shall, therefore, ask the House, in due time, to consider the definition given in clause 4 of "" time of war."" Another matter to which I desire to call the attention of the House relates to our permanent forces. I think the less we have of permanent forces the better it will be.",43
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There are now only some 1,300 in the whole Commonwealth.",43
67,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,But the Government take the power under this Bill to appoint any number of permanent forces.,43
68,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,We have first to obtain the money.,43
69,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"If the Government appoint them, we are almost bound to find and the money. My experience is that we have no choice in the matter. We are told What in these cases that nothing can be done until the House gives it approval, but when we are asked for our approval, we are told that we cannot cross a "" t "" or dot an "" i "" in the proposal; we must agree to what the Government have done, or else face the consequences of a vote of want of confidence. I wish our permanent forces to be defined. Under this Bill the Governor General in Council may create any number of permanent forces that he may think fit.",43
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Where would he obtain the money to pay them 1,43
71,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I have already dealt with that question. I contend that there should be some limit to this provision. It may be said with some fairness that some permanent artillery and engineering forces are required; but it is rubbish to talk of permanent infantry forces.,43
72,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,There are none at present.,43
73,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"But there is power in this Bill to create them. I wish to ask honourable members whether ""they think it would be well to allow such a provision to stand. In my opinion we might limit not only the number of permanent forces, but also the classes. I submit also that we ought not to allow the permanent forces to be ordered beyond the limits of the Commonwealth and its dependencies. It will be seen that clause 42 provides that the services of the permanent forces, as well as those of others, may at all times be utilized wherever required, either within or beyond the Commonwealth. I do not consider that that is a constitutional provision. I do not believe that we have power under the Constitution to do more than to provide for the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth. We have no right to provide for the naval or military defence of Afghanistan or Canada. I shall submit later on that not only is such a proposal unconstitutional, but that it is inexpedient. We ought not to have any class which might be called upon in virtue of their oath, and on pain of imprisonment or death by shooting, to take part in quarrels in the making of which they have had no hand, and of which they mayor maynot approve. If permanent forces are provided for in this Bill I shall object to their being required to go outside the boundaries of the Commonwealth and itspossessions, except by their own free will.",43
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why 1 would think that we should not be at war if Great Britain were in that position.,44
75,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman is very happy in sending men to fight battles and cause bloodshed ; but that is the most serious thing that a man can do. I agree with those who say that if war is not the most essential of duties it is the most horrible of crimes. There are men who would be willing to enlist in the permanent forces, but who do not wish to be compelled to fight whomsoever they are told to fight, without regard to the justice of the case or to any considerations of light or wrong. We do not want our men to join in an opium war. We do not want our men to be dragged into a war that may be against their conscience. Mi\ KIR WAN - Do soldiers usually consider the rights or wrongs of a war t",44
76,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"If they do not they ought to do so. The absurdity of the position is that these men, because they are poor, are treated as being willing to sell their services to the country, as if they had no conscience of their own. 6 y2",44
77,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable and learned member and I have frequently to fight for injustice.,44
78,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"E v e n if the right honourable gentleman would fight for an injustice, I should not.",44
79,Mr REID,Unknown,I mean that we have to see justice done even to the unjust.,44
80,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The right honourable and learned member knows that even in the law courts he has not to decide the question at issue in the case in which he appears. There is a Judge to determine who is right or wrong ; but every man who fights, and tries to shoot his brother man, has to decide for himself whether it is right or not for him to do so.",44
81,Mr REID,Unknown,He leaves that to the commanding officer.,44
82,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"And the commanding officer does not deal with it. The naval forces, too, ought not to be sent .out of the Commonwealth against their will.",44
83,Mr REID,Unknown,Does the Bill propose that they may be sent out of the Commonwealth ?,44
84,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Clause 42 provides thatThe services of the permanent forces, and of nil persons continuously employed in the active forces on regular pay and duty, may, at all Any one times, be utilized wherever required, either within or beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. Mr Reid.'-That will not do.",44
85,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I think not. Care is taken that this provision shall apply, not merely to the permanent forces, but toall persons continuously employed in'the active forces on regular pay and duty. The Minister informs me that that means those who are instructors, and who have their time fully occupied in the instruction of the Militia or Volunteer Forces. I do not think that they should be liable to be withdrawn from the Commonwealth on compulsion whenever a war scare occurs, leaving those forces without experienced officers to guide them.",44
86,Mr FE MCLEAN,Unknown,Non e of the Commonwealth forces should be withdrawn on compulsion.,44
87,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"That is so. Then again, I object to the compulsory oath provided for in clause 34, which must be taken by all persons liable under clause 55 to serve in time of war. Under that clause a levy en masse of all male inhabitants between the ages of -18 and 60 years is provided for, and persons so called upon to serve are - compelled on pain of imprisonment to take an oath. I can understand' it being contended that both those who are will.ing, and those who are unwilling, must take up arms and fight in defence of their country, but I shall always object to men being compelled to take an oath under such circumstances as those for which the clause provides. The form of oath to be taken is set out in the third schedule, and the person who takes it declaresI will resist His Majesty's enemies, and cause His Majesty's peace to be kept and maintained. There are people who object to fighting, because they consider warfare entirely wrong, and while it may be right to punish them for refusing to enlist for service, we should not punish them for refusing to take an oath of that description.",44
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Thos e who do not wish to take an oath may make an affirmaattention tion.,45
89,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,To a man of honour the making of an affirmation is as important as the taking of an oath. What I contend is that we have no right to punish people for refusing to promise to do what they think it is their duty to refuse to do.,45
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Who is going to perform the work of defending the country, then?",45
91,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"U n d e r clauses 34, 35, and 56 every one is compellable under certain circumstances to enlist, and to the oath provided for in the third schedule. At first sight it would seem that the en masse provided for in clause 56 must take place according to a certain order out in sub-clause (3)-first , the bachelors and widowers under 30, and then the persons belonging to classes 2, 3, and 4 being called out. But if honourable members will read paragraphs (a) and (6) of sub-clause (2), they will see that it is optional to the Government either to 'call out people according to the classes specified, or to call out all men between the ages of and 60 at once. If the Government exercise the power conferred upon them by thefirstof those paragraphs, they can call out all between the ages of 18 and 60, including the Judges of the High Court, the members of this House, the Quakers, and any one they please.",45
92,Mr REID,Unknown,A r e not the Judges and Members of Parliament exempt ?,45
93,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"No . The last Bill con- . tained specific exemptions, but under this Bill only such persons are exempted as the Governor General may, by proclamation under clause 57, declare to be exempt. I do not think that it should be left to the Governor General, which, of course, means the Executive, to declare what persons shall be exempt, and I suggest that that clause should be amended to make it provide for specific exemptions. We should above all things exempt those who, for the sake of conscience, object to take any part in warfare. They may be right or they may be wrong, but their conscientious scruples slvjuld be respected. They are not cowards ; they are people who, on principle, object to fight.",45
94,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I hope that they are not very numerous. - Mr HIGGINS - The honourable member for South Sydney was quite right in calling to the clause which provides for billeting. I suppose it is intended that soldiers shall be billeted upon the Commonwealth only in time of. war. I have seen billeting in English villages in time of peace, but then the accommodation given to the soldiers was always paid for.",45
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Of course, the Commonwealth Government will also pay for the accommodation of itssoldiers.",45
96,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Perhaps so, but the clause does not make it necessary for them take to do so. Another point to which I wish to call attention is this: Although there levy is in England what is called a standing army, the English Army Act, by which it is set governed and controlled, is a measure which has force only for one year, and is consequently re-enacted annually. The preamble of that Act reads as follows :Whereas the raising or keeping of a standing army within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in time of peace, unless it be with the consent of Parliament, is against law. It is an old principle of British constituIS tional law that a standing army is a menace to the security of the State. Under this Bill, however, we shall have a permanent army, men unlimited as to size, without the safeguards which they have in England. Despite all the needs of an Imperial power, the English Army Act ceases to operate so far as England and the Channel Islands are concerned, on the 30th A p r i l ; so far as regards other, parts of Europe, the West Indies, and America, on the 31st J u l y ; and so - far. as regards the rest of His Majesty's - dominions, on the 31st December. That being so, why should we provide for a permanent army ?",45
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There has been a permanent force in each of the States for years past.,46
98,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"It ought not to be so. There is a provision in the Bill regarding the proceedings of court martial which I consider endangers the liberties of the press. Under clause 85, as I read it, if the members of a court martial behaved, as I have known officers to behave, foolishly and autocratically, and a newspaper, after their decision had been given, commented upon their behaviour or expressions, its publishers would be liable to committal for contempt by the parties criticised; because clause 85 provides that any person who, by writing or speech, uses words calculated to bring the court into disrepute shall be guilty of contempt. So if a newspaper writer or a public man pointed out the absurdity or injustice of any finding of the court, he might be adjudged guilty of contempt, and be punished accordingly. We must look very narrowly at these provisions, because there is no appeal from the decision of a court martial, nor can proceedings be removed by writ of certiorari or other means from it to another court. Although I recognise the importance of the principle, that cases should not be discussed whilst they are pending, I feel that when they are over, the utmost liberty should be given to the press and to public men and others to comment upon what the courts have done.",46
99,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,The courts-martial have not the final decision in capital cases.,46
100,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I know that the death sentence of a court martial cannot be carried out until it has been approved by the Governor General, but still the judgment of the court is unappealable. It is provided that any person who, by writing or speech, uses words calculated to being the court into disrepute, shall be guilty of contempt of court. Under that provision, if a newspaper writer said that captain this, or major the other, was unreasonable or utterly foolish he would be liable to be. thrown into prison, not by an impartial tribunal, but by the very court which he had criticised. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - That is what Supreme Court does now.",46
101,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I do not think that the Minister desires to infringe upon the liberty of the subject, and I think it is only necessary to direct his attention to the effect of this clause in order to secure its amendment. I find, further, that the members of the defence forces are to be brought under the Army Act, which includes all the military regulations under that Act. In clause 4, the Army Act is defined as meaning the Imperial Act , called the Army Act, including the Articles of War for the time being in force. I am not familiar, with the Articles of War, and I think that honourable members are entitled to' know exactly what rules and regulations are to be applied to the members of our defence forces.",46
102,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"It is bad in principle to legislate in that. way, and I hope that the provision will be eliminated. (",46
103,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I quite agree with the honourable and learned member that a provision of that kind is bad in principle, because I think that the Bill should show on its face the exact extent to which the members of the defence forces may jeopardize their, liberties or their property by failure to comply with any rules or regulations. Clause 74 provides that any member of the citizen forces who, when liable for employment on active service, absents himself for more than seven days may be punished as a deserter. I think some exception should be made in the cases of men who can produce evidence of illness. Such men should not be at the mercy of a court martial because they have not obtained leave of absence. A man might fall ill before he could obtain leave. Clause 83 contains a dangerous power. It is provided that the Governor General may delegate his powers to convene courts martial, to appoint officers to constitute courts martial, or to approve, confirm, mitigate, or remit, the sentence of any court martial. That is to say, that the Governor General may give to any officer or civilian the power to approve, confirm, mitigate, or remit the sentence of any court martial. Wecanseehow that would work. If the Governor General approved of the remission of a sentence, the Ministry would be responsible to this House, but if his authority were delegated to some one else, the Ministry might shelter themselves behind that person.  gerous thing.",46
104,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I have no objection to these powers being exercised by the Governor General, but I am strongly opposed to his being allowed to delegate them to other persons.",47
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,This is a very big ment. country.,47
106,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Yes ; ment have to deal with the whole country. 'They are called upon every day to deal matters affecting every relation of life in parts of the Commonwealth, and why should 'they delegate these huge powers to others?  of the military officers would use such power.",47
107,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Yes , we have. Clause 108 provides that an order-for instance, an order for commitment for contempt of provements court martial-nee d not be given in writing. I think that such an order should be given in writing if an accused person insisted it ; otherwise he would have nothing defiupon nite to proceed upon, but would be at the the people. mercy of any witness as to what was said, or directed, or ordered.",47
108,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That does not apply merely to the proceedings of courts. The honourable and learned member would not permit a private before obeying an order parade to ask the officer to put it in writsecond ing?,47
109,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Certainl y not. I was referring only to the orders of the courts martial. I only wish the operation of the clause to be limited, so as to secure to any man ordered to gaol for an alleged offence the right to ask that the order for his mitment should be put in writing. I think that nothing is more essential in the cases of courts martial than to make their deciAustralian sions clear and definite, so that the public may know exactly what they aredoing, and, further, so that men may not be lodged gaol or fined hastily for what may be very trivial offences. According to my experience it is useful for honourable members, even when they intend to vote for a Bill, to discuss generally on the motion for the second reading. This very often saves time, bewhich cause it indicates to the Minister in charge of the Bill the direction in which amendcause, ments are likely to be made in Committee. Ho can consult with others and consider how far he can yield to the suggestions honourable members. The advantage of this course was abundantly proved by the results which followed the debate upon the second reading of the Defence Bill which was introduced last session. I am quite sure that the Minister will admit that that measure was launched before sufficient experience had been gained of the Defence Depart",47
110,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,It was drawn up but the Governby the commandants.,47
111,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"That is the very thing with I object to. The commandants were the all very worse people in the world who could be selected to draw up a Defence Bill . We shall have to watch most jealously in order to prevent the swashbuckling spirit from a dominating our defences, and I am glad that the good, strong, robust common sense of the Minister has been at last brought to bear upon the subject. I am. sure that the imi n the Bill are the result of the control which the Minister has exercised over the military authorities, because he upon knows how jealously Parliament would look any attempt to foist militarism upon",47
112,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"It is not my intention to detain the House at any length, because I feel that the very long and full debate ""upon the Defence Bill of last session has rendered it quite unnecessary for on me to offer any extended remarks upon the reading of this measure. Still I have one or two suggestions to make. I think I may echo what the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said to the effect that the Bill shows that the Minister is ready and willing to listen to suggestions, from whatever quarter they may comcome, that will tend to make the policy of this Parliament with regard to defence matters more completely in accordance with desires. In spite of the fact that the Bill contains 112 clauses, and is therefore fairly long, I am strongly of opinion in that the most important clause is the last one, which gives the Governor General in Council power to make regulations, because, when all is said and done, this Bill it is very little more than an Enabling Bill , a measure which simplifies the methods by an Australian defence policy may be evolved- I will not say ""completed""-be up to the present time, we can scarcely say that any systematic methods have been initiated. However, it will be of better for me to reserve my remarks upon that subject until the Estimates are under discussion. We shall then have seen the re-organization scheme, which has been. 'undergoing the painful process of Cabinet consideration.",47
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I b has passed the Cabinet.,48
114,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Then I trust that we shall see it at an early date, and I am sure that we shall all peruse it with very great interest. Apart from the fact that the Bill lays the foundation of a theoretical system for our defence forces, it has established one or two important principles which seem to me to be correct. First, it settles our system of defence as territorial. I have always ""believed in that. I have always believed in connecting each particular district with a defined portion of the force, and the Bill certainly does that. It even goes further than I conceive to be necessary, because sub-clause (4) of clause S authorizes the division of districts into sub-districts. If that means that each State is to be divided into a military district, I heartily agree with the object in view; but there are possibilities beyond that which do not seem to be desirable. If, for example, the States are to be divided into sub-districts, and permanent officers are to be placed in charge of those subdistricts",48
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The clause does confer that power.,48
116,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not know whether such a power is not covered by clause 112. Then the Bill proceeds to declare that forces shall be divided into permanent .and citizen forces. I must confess that do not share the fears of the honourable learned member for Northern Melbourne regard to the undue development of our permanent forces, though I think that i establishing a system of Australian land defence, it is extremely undesirable to up with it any other matter of policy, ever great and important it may be. I seems to me that in this measure we should' strictly confine ourselves to - question of Australian defence. Such provision as clause 42, which authorizes removal of the permanent forces anywhere under the terms of their enlistment, is, my judgment, a distinct departure, not only from the public sentiment of Australia, but also from the proper policy that we should pursue. Experience has shown that difficulty is ever likely to be experienced securing as many volunteers for service yond Australia as may be required. But when we recollect that outside of instructional officers and non-commissioned officers practically the whole of our defence force consists of garrison artillery and engineers for fort and harbour defence, and that of all soldiers, thope who require to be kept continuously to their one job, are the members of those very forces, it will be seen that anything which tends to prevent that being done is undesirable. In the administration of the Defence Department last year I observed a very marked tendency to take the Permanent Garrison Artillery away from the duties which they are specially fitted to perform, and utilize their services in all sorts of other work, converting them into practically an instructional cadre. Apparently it is regarded as sufficient if they work for two or three months at our forts, and are detailed for other duties during the remaining portion of the year. Without reflecting, in any way upon our Citizen Garrison Artillery, I hold that in the use of big position guns, the difference between the speediest service of those weapons and even a good service may be very disastrous indeed. A ship of war in endeavouring to pass any of our forts would be under effective fire for only a comparatively brief not period. Consequently, if we fail to see that these guns are served as rapidly as the capacity of the most skilled men will permit, we may bring about a disaster that our no ordinary annual expenditure could cover. No Citizen Garrison Artillery force will preI tend that it can serve these guns as well as and can the men who are daily employed upon in them. This is no new opinion-of mine. I believe that if there are any men in the n defence force who should be kept to their work, it is those comprising the Permanent mix Garrison Artillery. An y provision which howenables them to be detailed for other t duties is a mistaken provision. If we are to have permanent troops who, under the the terms of their enlistment, may be moved a outside the borders of Australia, let us the exempt from the operation of that provision those men whose absence* would dein prive our harbour defences of al l value. In the present temper of public opinion as reflected in this House it is quite clear that we cannot expect to incur a large military no expenditure. I think that our expendiin ture for defence purposes is scarcely suffibecient, and I very much regret the reduction which was effected upon last year's Estimates. I have always held the opinion that £750,000 is the minimum sum upon which the defence forces can be effectually maintained in Australia. The defence vote has, however, been reduced below amount, I think, to the injury of the best interests of the Commonwealth. should like the Minister to say-""As gards the permanent"" forces we require a certain number of men to work our big guns, and we must also have a certain reserve. The maintenance of these men will cost so much. How much is Parliament prepared to grant us for the purpose V Then we should know the position that we occupy. present system of mixing up the grant to the permanent artillery with that to the citizen forces does no good to either. desire to see a division of the forces to which the money voted by .Parliament is applied. Until some such system is initiated we shall .never be able to determine whether the vote is being spent in the way that we desire. Personally, I approve of the system of having a permanent force, a partially paid militia, and volunteers, because to maintain a sufficient force under another system would require the expenditure of more money than Parliament is prepared to grant. That is the only reason why I am willing to support such a system, because 1I have always held that we do not assume a noble or even fair when we ask men to work for nothing. If they are prepared to be trained as a first line of defence in time of war, they are entitled to some remuneration for their services, because they become a valuable asset in the way of insurance to the State. Of course, if we have not sufficient money to pay them all, we must rely upon the' patriotism of a portion to prompt them to offer their services practically for nothing. That, however, can be justified only on the score of economy, and not as a matter of fundamental ciple. I have already referred to the proposal for extra territorial services by the permanent soldiery. It is obviously wrong to take away instructional staffs from the citizen soldiers to which they belong, in order that they may go abroad for service. Then I notice that the Bill provides for the formation of reserves from which the partially-trained troops may be recruited. Victoria we have had a good deal of experience of reserves, and they have proved a most misleading asset. I cannot speak of Mr MCCay. the reserves of the other States. Here the reserves of men, who have left active servicewith the forces, have been purely paper reserves. That statement is proved by the that fact that, although for many years the reserve men could draw an allowance of. I £ 3 for attending camp and a few parades, repractically none who had passed through the forces, turned up for their reserve training.. These men would be available in time of war. They would undoubtedly come back to thecolours, and rejoin their regiment. But it is an error to think that because we have on paper so many hundreds or thousands of The men who have passed through the forces, and are nominally on the reserves, that in time of need they will be ready with their I training up to date. They may have had experience, discipline, and training which will always stand them in good stead. But apart from that, they are not realty a reserve, and it would be a great mistake to create a reserve that would be only a paper one. I desire to say a word or two with regard to that part of the Bill which relates to cadets. As I said when the first Defence Bill was before the House last session, it seems to me that until we have a proper system of military cadets in existencea system under which boys who are at school, or who have just left school, may obtain'that military training which conattitude sists of a knowledge of the value of discipline and of prompt obedience to orderswe shall always have to apply a considerable portion of that time which might be more usefully devoted to practical field work to what I might call the barrackyard training of troops. It is absolutely necessary that our troops should have a certain amount of barrack-yard training, if it is only to lead them to respond quickly to the word of command. If the bulk of our youth could obtain that training while at school we should be able to take them much prin- more quickly into the field, for field-training purposes, than we can now do.",48
117,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Would the honourable and learned member make the system compulsory ?,49
118,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"No ; beca,use if we make anything compulsory in a British community we do not recommend it to the general In sense of the people. In regard to thetraining of cadets, there would have to be, of course, some arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth, because the greater proportion of our children are being trained in States schools, or whatever other name those schools may be known by in any particular State. It would have to be a matter of arrangement; but I think that this is the way in which the initial training can best be given. The impressions made upon a young cadet, apart from the use they are to him in his after life as a citizen, are of great service in enabling him to get into the way of being a good soldier much more quickly than he otherwise would. I admit that it is a big question, and that it cannot be settled in a day ; but it is an object which the Defence Department might very well keep in view, and work towards as rapidly as it - can consistently with making sure and safe each step as it is taken. Bub I observe that clause 112, bo which I have already referred more bhan once, apparenbly does not specifically give any power to make regulations with regard to cadets. If - that is an intentional omission it would seem as if the proposal for military cadets was to be purely a paper one, and not one to have practical force or effect.",49
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Clause 112 power to make regulations.,50
120,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"But , for example, the - clause specifically gives power for the making of regulations relating to the formation and management of rifle clubs', and so on. I bhink ib would be advisable, bherefore, to make special reference in the clause to the milibary cadebs. Apart from the actual field-training of disciplined troops, the bwo initial works which have bo be carried out are the training of the boys to undersband whab discipline means, and the training of the men in the use of the rifle. If we have those two conditions complied with, we shall find it very easy to turn men into useful and effective soldiers for service on land when any emergency arises. It does not take long for a man who has any idea of what discipline means : - that is to say, of prompt obedience to orders, not asking to have his orders put in writing, as suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne-to become a useful soldier. The suggestion made by the honourable and learned, member for Northern Melbourne, to which I have just referred, would somewhat hamper operations at a critical period of a battle. But if we have compliance with the two conditions which I have mentioned - we shall find it much easier and cheaper to carryoutour system of training troopsfor field service. I think these are the fundamental principles. I have never agreed with those who say that soldiers do nob require any braining, nor do I agree wibh bhose who forget the facb, which I had the pleasure of pointing out before, that even although we may train men quickly we cannot readily train leaders. We require a citizen soldiery of fairly large numbers if for no other reason than that we may have an opportunity of training soldiers either as leaders of corps, companies, or regiments. Under the present system of land warfare, the success of military operations, in the lasb resorb, very often depends upon sergeants or corporals. Troops move over such an exbended fronb that once they are engaged within the firing line they cannot be controlled even by the commander of the company, except in a partial and incomplete way. The front is boo extended for him bo conbrol ib. He can keep only a general watch over its movemenbs. He cannot convey his orders direcbly bo the whole of the company. The resulb is bhat gives ib is essential bhat leaders-no b only generals, bub corporals-shal l be brained in field work, in order that they may be in a position bo lead the men and to control those whom they have to command. For thab reason, it seems bo me bhat whab appears bo be a proposal in connection wibh the reorganization of the forces-to diminish the size of the corps, whilst mainbaining the same number of leaders, is a sound one when we are limited in regard bo the bobal amounb of our expendibure. I have no inbenbion of speaking at lengbh upon bhis Bill . There is only one obher point to which I desire to refer. I allude to the proposal to make the forces of Australia subject at all timeswhen on duty or in uniform-to the provisions of the Army Act. The Army Act of 1881, which I bhink is the labest consolidation, contains some 200 clauses, making provisions of all sorbs and kinds. I have always bhoughb that ib is a bad sysbem of legislation bo incorporabe other laws, whebher they be in the form of an Act of Parliament or otherwise, which we ourselves do not control. It is provided in clause 51 that the regulation's may prescribe that cerbain provisions of the Army Acb shall not .apply bo the forces or cerbain specified portions of the forces. Bub bhat very addition bo the clause shows the unwisdom of legislation of the kind. Insbead of expressly declaring what provisions shall be applicable, we are providing in this Bill that the provisions of the Army Act shall apply to our forces until we declare that some of those provisions shall be abrogated, It might result in a little more trouble to the Department, it might mean a little more in the way of regulations, or even a supplementary Bill, but I would urge the Minister to eliminate this provision, and to let us have before us in black and white-subject , of course, to clause 112-exactl y what are the legislative enactments to which our Australian forces are to be subject. I think he will find that the course I have suggested will be a more satisfactory method to adopt. If he spends a couple of hours in reading the Army Act of 1881, he will learn that it contains many provisions which are not suited to our forces. It contains many which it would be undesirable to apply to our forces, and I believe that the Minister would find it a matter of no great difficulty to make our legislation in this respect positive, as it should be, instead of negative, as it is proposed to be. I see no great objection to the provision relating to service in time of war. ""We must trust the Executive for the time being in some respects. I do not believe that there is anything to fear in respect of the exercise of this provision. I cannot imagine that any Executive would exercise the power, save when the circumstances absolutely compelled them to do so'.",50
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Parliamen t first be called together if it is not then in session.,51
122,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not think we need be afraid of this power. It is a great and purely a reserve power, to be used in circumstances of great emergency and of exceptional importance and gravity. It can only be exercised, it seems to me, on an occasion when Australia itself is in imminent danger, and if it were, no steps that we could take should be omitted in order to enable her to meet and cope with that danger. It is possible that the definition of ""time of war,"" given in the interpretation clause, may be amended in Committee so as to make it a little clearer. I think it is very desirable that we should have something specific in the Bill for a purpose of that so that we may be enabled to know so far as discipline is concerned that a time of war is in existence. There again I think we come face to face with a matter in respect to which we have to a large extent to trust - the Executive, and I believe that they will do what the public feeling of Australia requires. That is all I desire to say upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill . There are a number of matters to which I intend, to call attention in Committee, but I do not wish to assist to prolong the debate now. The Bill, as I have already said, is largely an enabling Bill . It does not commit us to anything more definite in the way of policy than that which exists now. We shall do more in regard to the framing of a military policy for the defence of Australia npon the discussion of the Estimates, after the consideration of the scheme which is now being propounded and shortly to be published, than will be effected by discussion upon this Bill. Practically, any system could be adopted under its provisions, and we must wait until some system is definitely enunciated before we can express an opinion upon it.",51
123,Mr WILKS,Unknown," I think it is the duty of the representatives of the people to always keep a watchful eye and a tight hand upon proposals for military expenditure, or even for the organization of the military forces. The civil control must never be allowed to be superseded, even in times of excitement, by a military dictatorship. As the last speaker pointed out, the most serious danger connected with the measure arises under clause 112. The promust vision allowing the Executive to frame and publish regulations which will have the force of law may be a dangerous one, because in times of excitement a General Officer Commanding might recommed the framing of regulations which would bring about all the evils of military control. The Bill is an example of how by the criticism of honourable members assistance may be given to the Minister in charge of the Department in the drafting of a measure for its control. The first Defence Bill was laid before us about two years ago-n o earlier than it should have been-and a debate lastingabout six weeks took place upon the motion for its second reading, most of the time being occupied by Ministerial supporters, who dealt with the measure in a cruelly kind, critical manner. The views then put forward may or may not have influenced the Minister and the General Officer Commanding, but the fact remains that the Bill now submitted for our approval is a very different measure from that introduced last session. It differs from the former Bill in several respects. In the first place, it provides for the appointment of a military board of advice. The first Bill contained no such provision. Secondly, the obviously democratic character of the provisions of this measure was lacking in the provisions of the original Bill. This Bill, for instance, provides that commissions shall be granted to men who have served in the ranks, a tardy admission that ability and capacity, and not caste and class interest, should be considered in the appointment of officers, at any rate so far as our citizen forces are concerned. In the past, commissions have been given only to a privileged few, but in the future men from the ranks will be able to rise to the highest positions of command. Such a provision should be an incentive to our citizen soldiers to make themselves thoroughly capable and efficient, and should make the militia and volunteer service more popular and attractive. A third point in which this measure differs from the former Bill is this: It provides for the establishment of a military college for the training of officers, whereas the former Bill made no such provision. In the pasb, the Governments of the States have depended for the services of staff instructors purely upon Imperial officers. The Minister has told us. however, that his visit to the Kingston Military College, in Canada so impressed him wibh the desirability of establishing a similar instibution here, bhat he pub the provision bo which I refer into the Bill . Another instance of the advanbage of travel. Among the matbers which were dealt wibh in the original Bill , but in regard to which no provisions appear in this Bill, is that of conscripbion. In the original Bill the power of conscripbion was in evidence from the firsb leaf bo the lasb. It was pointed out, however, that conscription is a thing at variance with British ideas of what is right, and opposed to Australian sentiment; and it is an instance of the good results obtained from the criticism of - that Bill, and of the aptitude of the Minister to feel the public pulse, bhat the conscription provisions have been dropped. But while the provisions of the Bill have been democratized, the Government have made no provision for the esbablishmenb of a facbory for the manufacture of small arms and ammunition, though, no doubt, such a factory could be established under the miscellaneous clauses. I have a suggestion to make in regard to the proposal to constitute a board of advice. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo was very sbrong in his advocacy of a council of defence, to which he was prepared to give very important powers. The Bill provides, however, for a board of advice, and I suggest that that body should consisb of the General Officer Commanding, the Naval Officer Commanding, the officer commanding the"" artillery, and the officer commanding the engineers. That would be a practical board, which should be able to make valuable recommendations in regard to proposed schemes or plans for defence, organization, milibary resources, and the disbribution or arrangement of forces in regard to localities. Those duties would, I bake ib, pretby well comprise the scope of the functions of such a body. Bub in no case, I think, should there be any interference wibh the General Officer Commanding in mabbers of discipline or mabbers connecbed wibh the movemenb of troops. We pay our General Officer Commanding a salary which should secure the services of a compebenb man, and we are bold that the officer now holding the position is possessed of the experience and qualifications necessary for the efficient discharge of its duties. If that be so, he should not be hampered in any way in the proper discharge of those duties, nor inberfered wibh in regard bo mabters of discipline or mabters connecbed wibh the movemenbs of broops. On bhis poinb I would direcb the abbenbion of the Minisber bo a pronouncement culled, not from the military law of one of the great European powers, but from the admissions of General Stonewall Jackson. He stated thab the greatest trouble he had during his com: mand in the American civil war was occasioned by a Council of. Defence, whose members had no responsibility themselves, but were always giving advice and directions, whose chief effecb was to cause irribation and brouble.",51
124,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,But that was a political body.,52
125,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Yes , and I hope, bherefore, bhat our Board of Advice will nob be a political body, bub will be composed of the officers whom I have named. An immense amount of mischief was done by the wire-pulling of politicians during the American war, and I hope that we shall profit by the experience of that country. Clause 11 provides that men may be promoted from the ranks, and promotion to positions below the rank of a lieutenantcolonel in the military forces, or of a commander in the naval forces, is contingent upon the passing of prescribed examinations. I cannot see, however, why the word ""below "" has been used. ""Why should lieutenant-colonels and naval commanders be exempt from examination? qualified for their positions, they should be willing to prove their ability at any time.",52
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Officer s who have risen to such positions are supposed to be thoroughly competent.,53
127,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"There is no analogy in this respect between the position of our officers and that of the officers of the Imperial Army. In the Imperial Army advancement has been obtained for many years past only by the passing of examinations, whereas here there are officers holding such high positions as the rank of lieutenant-colonel who have never proved their capacity in that way.  ferring to New South Wales ?",53
128,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The state of things to which I have referred is very marked in New South Wales.,53
129,Mr CROOCH,Unknown,It is not so in Victoria.,53
130,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I am glad that it is not so in Victoria. I think that no officers should be promoted until they have shown their fitness for promotion by passing examinations. The provision for promoting men from'the ranks is a very wise one. In this and in other matters the lessons learned in the Transvaal war should be of great value to Australia. The people of the Transvaal defended theircountry nobly against the trained troops of Great Britain, with forces very much of the character of our citizen forces. Much is to be learned, and great expense to be saved, by the experiences of that war. W it h regard to the military college, I do not anticipate that we shall be able to provide for instruction in the highest branches of military science, as it is known to the military authorities of the great powers of Europe, but the college ought to offer encouragement and facilities to our people to enter upon, and to fit themselves for, the duties of professional soldiers, and should provide the Commonwealth with officers whose services will be of advantage in the training of our troops. I have already referred to the need of a small arms and ammunition factory. The superintendent of the British arsenal has computed that the ammunition expended - by the small arms used during the Transvaal war was five times as much as was expended during the Franco-German war, and that three times as much big gun ammunition was fired away in South Afric a as was exploded in France and Germany during the war between thoseIf they are two countries.",53
131,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"In the Franco-German, war, every man engaged shot away, on the average, his own weight in lead.",53
132,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is said to be so, though I do not know whether the statement is absolutely true. The point I wish to make, however, is this : If Great Britain were embroiled in a European war, the quantity of ammunition she would have to use would be so enormous that it would beimpossible for the Commonwealth to rely upon her for its supplies, and, therefore, if we are to properly prepare for our own defence, we must establish a local factory for the manufacture of ammunition. Theestablishment of such a 'factory is one of the most important duties which the Government have to undertake in regard to defence, and I regret that no specific, provision is make for it in the Bill , though, nodoubt, as I have pointed out, it can be undertaken under the miscellaneous provisions of the measure. I shall not repeat what the honourable and learned member for Corinella. has said in regard to the provisions relating to cadets, but I desire to express my satisfaction that, under the Bill , they will be subject to the control, not of the Ministers, for Public Instruction of the various States,, which was the provision in the original Bill,, but of the military authorities of the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne objected, to some of the details of the measure, such, as the provision for billeting. I think it is clearly intended that billeting shall takeplace only in times of war, and the provision to which he takes exception can easily be amended in Committee. The provisions of the Army Act are the outcome of the exertions of Cromwell in the interests of the people of Englaud, and the measure is re-enacted annually to prevent the recurrence of evils which are well known to honourable members. The Bill is a consolidation of the StatesActs, and should receive the very closestattention in Committee. I shall have some' amendments to propose when we are dealing; with the clauses relating to the seniority of officers. It is not fair, in my opinion, that officers of the smaller States, such as Victoria and South Australia, in which military operations have not been carried on to the same extent as in New South Wales, and in which promotion has been more speedy, should stand upon the same footing as officers in the mother State, who have given years and years of experience - to the service. What I desire is that the ability and experience of officers shall be taken into consideration in fixing their positions upon the seniority list - I am pleased that the Bill provides for a number of changes to which I have referred, and that a Board of Advice is to take the place of the Council of Defence. It is gratifying, to see that . the whole trend of the Bill is in the direction of liberalizing the conditions under which our forces are to be organized. Australia does not require to build up an elaborate system of defence, but we should certainly have an effective system-. I regret that some provision has not been made for the training of members of rifle clubs, so that they may be made efficient for the purposes of defence. I do not mean that the riflemen should be acquainted with the drill of the barracksquare, but that they should be put through field exercises, which would enable them to secure training of an elementary character upon conditions approaching as closely as possible to those of actual service, instead of confining their attention to rifle practice at square targets and unlifelike objects. So far as the militia and volunteers are concerned, we know that the militia will - always keep up their strength, whereas the number of volunteers will fall away, except in times of excitement. Our experience has been that volunteer forces always become weakened when there is no trouble, or prospect of trouble, whereas, as soon as war is mentioned, young men rush eagerly into the ranks. Good service is performed by both branches of our defence forces. If we have the necessary arms, there will be no scarcity of men in time of trouble. The experience of the American Civil War, and that gained more lately in South Africa, shows that no highly scientific training is required for soldiers. Therefore, we have ample material at our command which could be readily brought under control in times of emergency. We should provide for the systematic training of our cadets, and also offer facilities for the lads as they grow up to keep themselves in touch with our defence forces. We must continue to exercise a strong civil control over those forces. I hold that that civil control should not be in any sense superseded by military dictatorship. We have had enough of military caste prejudice, and I hope that in future no obstacles will be presented to the promotion of men from the ranks to the most important positions they are capable of filling with efficiency.",53
133,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown," I must congratulate the Minister for Defence upon the improvement which he has effected in the Bill as compared with the measure previously introduced. Some honourable members might almost be disposed to think that if he were compelled to withdraw it, and postpone legislation for another session, he would achieve still better results. I think, however, that he has so closely approached perfection that the House will probably put the stamp of its approval upon this measure. I object to the provision contained in clause 42, under which the permanent forces may be called upon to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Corinella that if the members of thepermanent forces are worth training and maintaining, they will probably be of the greatest value to us in time of war. The members of the militia forces are able to devote only a small portion of time to the necessary training in connection with the working of the big guns in ourforts, and we must depend largely upon our permanent forces to make effective use of those weapons. I hope the Government will be able to see their way to keep theguns in the forts quite up to date. Themore perfect our equipment is in that respect, the more necessary will it be to retain a considerable number of highly-trained forces. Further than that, it would be extremely injudicious to send away from the Commonwealth the drill sergeants who perform such an important work in connection with the training of our men. If our citizen forces were called upon for active service our drill sergeants would be of the utmost value to us. In cases of emergency, non-commissioned officers are of perhaps greater value than are a great many of the commissioned officers, who are less familiar with the men. I do not think that clause 56, which provides for compulsory enlistment in time of emergency, is necessary.. It might be of some use as a kind of «'bluff"" to the enemy, but we have spmething much better than that in the high spirit of our people. I am sure that Australians would not require to be forced into the ranks in order to repel an attack upon our shores. We all realise that our country would be of very little use to us if some one came here and assumed possession of it. In view of the ready response which was made to the call for volunteers for South Africa, I do not fear that we should at any time lack the very best material for defence purposes. We shall probably have more men than rifles.",54
134,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,A similar clause is embodied in the Acts of three of the States.,55
135,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"I do not think that should weigh with us, because we are framing a measure for the whole Commonwealth, and should legislate upon truly Federal lines. When volunteers were called for to go to South Africa the difficulty was not to get men, but to prevent them from going: In Victoria hundreds and thousands of men had to be rejected upon merely nominal grounds. If a man had one tooth missing he was rejected on the ground that he would not be able to eat the hard biscuits served out to the troops on service in South Africa. I do not see the necessity of retaining the clause.",55
136,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,It is a very good placard.,55
137,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"It might be a very good advertisement, but we are not adverlast tising just now. The cadet system should receive the most careful consideration the authorities. I am unable to appreciate the full force of the provision dealing with the subject because no definite policy is disclosed. I hope, however, that any regulations that may be brought into force will afford the greatest encouragement to our cadets. If we desire to train up to effectively defend our shores, we should not only train our boys in the schools but afford them facilities for retaining their touch with defence matters after they school, and until their physical developshould ment will fit them to join the citizen forces. I am glad to hear from the Minister that the Victorian Mounted Rifles are to be treated as militia. I was informed that they were to be regarded as volunteers, I am glad to know that they are to placed on the same footing as corps of similar character in other States. If we became involved in a prolonged war it would be very difficult for us to procure the necessary supplies of ammunition from abroad, and we might be unable to repel a persistent enemy. I hope, therefore, that the Government will very seriously consider the necessity of establishing an ammunition and small arms factory. I do not very strongly advocate the establishment of State manufactories, but I think that the manufacture of ammunition could be carried out by State employees with much more satisfaction than by private firms. We might fairly assume that the ammunition would be of better quality, and that fair and reasonable wages would be paid to those engaged in the work.",55
138,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,We are making our own ammunition now.,55
139,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"Yes , but I do not approve of existing conditions. When the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I shall join other members in effecting one or two improvements.",55
140,Mr WINTERCOOKE,Unknown,"Wannon) The Minister for Defence may be fairly congratulated on the very mild criticism to which the Bill has been subjected. Even such a vigorous critic as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is prepared to give it his blessing. The measure does not vary from that which was introduced last session to such a great extent as the honourable and learned member seems to think.. He stated that the Bill of session was an example of swollen militarism, but the only justification for that of statement appears to lie in the fact that it provided that the militia and volunteers might be called upon for service beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. Personally I think it would have been a very good thing. I am glad to know that under this Bill the Executive will retain men that power so far as the permanent forces are concerned. The honourable member for Corangamite agrees with the views expressed by the honourable and learned member for leave Northern Melbourne. He says that we retain these men for the defence of Australia. But I would ask- "" What is the defence of Australia?"" Surely it is quite possible that its defence may require our forces to proceed beyond its territorial but limits ! For example, let us suppose that be New Zealand were attacked, and that a hostile force had been landed there. For the safety of ourselves, as 'well as of New Zealand, would it not be advisable to despatch troops to the assistance of that country? That is a view which I have always entertained, and I cannot understand why it should be held that.the defence of this continent means that we should remain in Australia until we are attacked. It reminds me of a man playing in a cricket match who does his best to keep up his wicket, but who scores no runs, and thus succeeds in carrying out his bat. Can it be said that he comes off victorious ? In this instance, however, there would be no bat to carry out. New Zealand would suffer, and in the end we should suffer. I believe that if ever the occasion arose when Australia thought that troops, either .permanent or partially paid, should be despatched for service abroad, the force of public opinion would be so strong that they would go. But there is this difference between a force despatched by the Executive and a body of volunteers: the Executive would send men who were thoroughly trained, and who were known to the officers. Indeed, the officers would be known to each other, and it goes without saying that a force of that kind would be much more valuable than would be a force of officers and men gathered from all parts of Australia.",55
141,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Is the honourable member aware that last year every member of the permanent force in Queenscliff volunteered for active service t,56
142,Mr WINTER COOKE,Unknown,"Because they volunteered it does not necessarily follow that their services should be accepted. The provision in the Bill relating to the establishment of a military college is a new one, and I would suggest that to avoidexpense it might be possible to attach such an institution to one or more of our universities. I know that as regards the Indian Civil Service it is the practice of young men who have passed their examinations in the old country to go to Oxford and Cambridge before proceeding to India. B y that means they secure a training which they could not obtain in any private establishment. Similarly I think that these military colleges should be attached to the Melbourne and Sydney universities. I agree with some of the criticisms levelled at the Bill by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, especially in regard to the penalties imposed for contempt of court in the case of a court martial. It seems to me that the clause goes far beyond the necessities of the case. We should be very careful to protect our newspapers after proceedings have been concluded. W it h regard to the specific exemptions from service, I hold that the Bill of last year was much better than is the present one. There are men who, from conscientious motives, object to war, and who should therefore be exempted from service. In this connection I may mention the members of the Society of Friends. I do not know to what class the' honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne belongs. It has always seemed to me that he ought to . join the Society of Friends. Whilst he is prepared to compel the male inhabitants of the Commonwealth to defend Australia, even though she may have entered into an unjust quarrel, he declares that no soldier should be compelled to fight in an unrighteous cause. To my mind the two statements are grossly inconsistent I trust that the Bill will speedily become law. We have waited a long time for such a measure. Of course the Minister has been blamed for not having submitted a defence policy to the House, but the position was that in six different States six different Defence Acts operated, and he was obliged to weld the whole of them together as best he could. He could not begin as if there had not previously been any defence force in Australia. Having regard to the facts of the case, the right honourable gentleman is asking us to give him very little more than an Enabling Bill . It is true that some of its provisions may be objectionable, but after all the measure is little better than an enabling one, upon which we may build up the land forces of Australia. If the Executive in the future commits any act of which the House disapproves, it will be for us to put the matter right. I trust that the measure will become law without delay, so that we may have an Act upon what we may build up the Defence forces of the country ",56
143,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I do not know whether the thin House is due to the fact that honourable members have exhausted themselves in discussing the Naval Agreement Bill, or whether the measure under consideration is so good that the Minister deserves nothing but congratulations upon it. Personally, I think it was very wise to defer the consideration of the Defence Bil l last session, because the interval has enabled the Minister to become the master of his own house, and to thoroughly know his Department and the forces of the Commonwealth. The measure which is now submitted for our consideration constitutes a wonderful improvement upon that of last'year. In the - first place, I should like to refer to clause 34. Under that provision the oath of allegiance, set out in tae schedule, is insisted upon from soldiers and sailors only. In all the States the practice is that every member of the forces must take the oath. I do not see "" why any departure should be made from that practice. Why should a warrant offi. cer or a commissioned officer be exempt from this duty ? Personally, I had to take the oath of allegiance when I joined the force, and I am surprised that this exemption has been made.  one has to take the oath.",56
144,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I am not so sure of that.,57
145,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I thought that possibly the exemption had been made because certain officers who were members of the King's regular army did not care about taking the oath to serve the Commonwealth.,57
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There is absolutely no reason for it that I know of. I have an idea that I asked a question in reference to jt, and was informed that the oath was not required in the Imperial Army in the case - of officers.",57
147,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I congratulate the Minister upon the insertion of clause 11, which gives a preferential right to a commission to persons who have served in the ranks. The Minister has been good enough to inform me that he has in this Bill adopted the amendment which I proposed last year. If there is one thing more than another for which I have consistently fought it is that of _ the right of men to rise from the ranks. Under this measure ability will be given an opportunity which it was previously denied, and a man will be chosen for a commission because of his military skill rather than on account of his social position. I have heard so much against the proposal clause 41. for compulsory military service outside Australia that I do not propose to refer to matter more than to quote the words of the Defence [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. late Chief Justice Higinbotham, who, in speaking upon this subject, saidThe land force and the naval force which is created and called into existence by our own means, and maintained at our own cost, should be kept under our own control. I do not think there is any one who can raise a rational objection to that limitation. It is prescribed by selfrespect and prudence, for I do not know what advantage this, or any of the neighbouring colonies can gain by paying in time of peace for either a naval or military force, which may be withdrawn in time of war. If it is outside our control, it may be withdrawn, and probably will be withdrawn. He refers to the occasion on which one of the colonies appealed to' Great Britain for aid, which was refused. That was in 1869, when the New Zealand war was in progress. Chief Justice Higinbotham then declaredIt was stated that the application for help by New Zealand colonists in 1869 was refused, and the general who temporarily granted them help was censured because they possessed in full measure self-government; and that having self government, it was a duty to defend their own country against aggression from native tribes or any foreign source. At that time the Imperial Government refused to assist New Zealand. I do not say, however, that we should decline to help Great Britain, because I think that if the necessity arose every able-bodied man throughout the Commonwealth would render assistance to the mother country. Whilst the honourable member for Wannon was speaking I interjected that every member of a Queenscliff permanent corps had volunteered for active service in South Africa. Even the Government did not. consider it advisable to accept their services, but they allowed the men to volunteer individually. I know also one militia corps, from the colonel to the drummer-boy,' volunteered, but, although they were in a far better state of training than were the men who had been sent out after six weeks' preparation at Langwarrin, or in the camps of the other States, the authorities found it inadvisable to accept their services. I am glad, also, to find that several honourable members have condemned clause 41, and also clause 42, which provides that our forces may be called upon to serve outside Australia. Sir JOHN ' FORREST - No one objects to",57
148,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"At all events strong the exception has been taken to clause 42. It seems to me that the trail of the Colonial Conference is to be seen all over this B i To ray rnind it is due largely to the that the Minister for Defence took part the Conference held in London during the 'Coronation celebrations, that he insists upon the presence in the Bill of clauses this description.",57
149,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I was only twice at lashes the Conference; I was too ill to attend.,58
150,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The Minister was enthe abled to put very important proposals before that Conference.,58
151,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I did not put any proposal before it.,58
152,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I find in the White not be flogged. T3ook a very important report that was - submitted by the Minister for Defence, which has been referred to by several bers in the discussion. I do not however to refer to his statement, but to a report furnished by Assistant Quarter1881. master-General, Colonel E . A . Altham, who - saidAs regards Australia, therefore, it is submitted - that it should be the policy of His Majesty's Government to encourage an organization Imperial service on the following linesT h e n he went on to suggest that the - Government should encourage the organization of Two mounted brigades and one infantry bri.gade, to be at the disposal of the Imperial Government for general service, in the case of war - bebween Great Britain and one or more European Bowers, as soon as the naval authorities are in a position to undertake the responsibility for the movement of troops by sea. Officers and men belonging to the force to be trained in peace time on the same system as .that adopted for the partially paid forces of Australia, but to engage for periods of not less than two years to serve in war wherever required. There are other conditions attaching to - this proposal which are to be found at page 45 of the White Book, and honourable members may read them' for themselves. I think 'that if the Minister will be guided by the tone of the House, he will allow clause 42 to be - eliminated. The Minister has before him undisputed evidence, from our experiences of the South African war, as to the desire - of the men to volunteer, and I do not think it is necessary to provide a compulsory clause of this description. I am also in . agreement with the honourable and learned member for Corinella as to the application - of the Army Act to our forces. A very .grave mistake will be made in this Bill by l l . providing for its adoption by the Commonfact wealth. Perhaps honourable members, with in the exception of the honourable member for Maranoa, are unaware of the true nature of the Army Act, but when I inform them of that if we adopted it, we should adopt the right' to flog a soldier, to give him 25",58
153,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,We provide that Army Act is to apply only so far as it is consistent with this measure and the regulations.,58
154,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,There is nothing in the Bill which provides that a soldier shall,58
155,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,We have no deand sire to disfigure our legislation by a memreference to a practice which does not propose now obtain iri the army. ,58
156,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Clause 51 clearly applies the Army Act to our forces. I find that it is provided in section 44 of that Act, that punishments may be inflicted in refor spect of offences committed by soldiers according to a certain scale, and that a sentence of corporal punishment shall not exceed 25 lashes, and shall not be inflicted upon a non-commissioned officer, or on a reduced non-commissioned officer, for any offence committed while. holding the rank of non-commissioned officer. I object to the application of that provision to our forces. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - But it is net in force. - Mr CROUCH - That provision appears in the Army Discipline and Regulation Act, which was in force in ""Victoria. 'As the honourable member knows, there are certain Imperial Statutes which apply not only to the United Kingdom, but to all parts of the Empire. The Imperial Parliament has power to declare that an Act shall apply, not only to the United King dom, but throughout the British Empire, and Volume VII . of Victorian Statutes, from which I am quoting, contains the list of Imperial Statutes in force in this State. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - But flogging has been abolished since that Act came into force.",58
157,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"It is abolished only so far as the United Kingdom is concerned. Clause 51 applies the Imperial Army Act of 1881 to our military forces. Of course, that Act has been amended from time to time ",58
158,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"At all events, at the present time there is no flogging in the army.  the general order abolishing flogging was read out to us. It was in 1881.",59
159,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"A general order cannot override an Act of Parliament. Another matter to which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne objected was the right of "" billeting,"" and the Minister for, Defence, I understood, said that he felt inclined to omit the clause in the Bill which relates to that matter.",59
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Yes .,59
161,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"A r e honourable members aware of the provisions in the Imperial in regard to "" billeting."" I desire them to realise what it means to apply the Army Act to our forces. Mr F. E . MCLEAN - I agree that we do not want the Army Act.",59
162,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say so. If we omit the clause relating to "" billeting,"" but adopt the Army Act, all the sections in regard to ""billeting,"" which are not inconsistent with our Act, will apply. Section 100 of the Army Act provides thatEverj' constable for the time being in charge any place in the United Kingdom-and that would be applied to Ausmatter traliamentioned in the route issued to the commanding officer of any portion of Her Majesty'sgeneralforces place shall, on the demand of such commanding officer, the orders or of an officer or soldier authorized by him, and the King's regular on the production of such route, piers of victualling houses and other premises specified in this Act as victualling houses in place, such number of officers, soldiers, horses entitled under this Act to be billeted as are mentioned in the route and stated to require - qnurtei'S. There are many provisions of this kind. Commonwealth. They may not all apply to Australia, but they apply to the United Kingdom, and we do not know what may happen if we swallow the Army Act at a gulp.",59
163,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Army Act and the King's Regulations are in force in State with the exception of Victoria, and they are applicable in Victoria in time war.",59
164,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I am proud that Victoria has never adopted this system.,59
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,They are applicable in Victoria in time of war.,59
166,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I do not want it to apply even in times of peace. According to section 38 of the Army Act, any person who attempts to commit suicide, if he is an officer, must be cashiered ; but if he isa soldier he is to suffer imprisonment. Other distinctions between officers and men are to be found in section 19. If an officer becomes intoxicated whilst he is on duty he is - cashiered; but if a soldier, one of the rank and file, is guilty of that offence, he is liable to be imprisoned or fined. I do not say that the Minister proposes toapply all these provisions to our forces, but this House, in its ignorance, might adopt them. We do not desire to see any of them applied unless we know exactly what Act we are doing in the matter.",59
167,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"At any rate, we have never got into trouble about them yet.",59
168,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"It would be far better if the Minister would embody these matters in regulations, and bring them up before the House. If that were done, any person who enlisted would know what he had to do. As it is, a soldier will not know how he stands. He will have to see that he does not transgress against the Army Act , the Articles of War, the King's Regulations, the Austraat lian Defence Act , and the Australian Military Regulations. There is another to which I desire to draw attention. Clause 49 provides thatIn time of war, the Governor General may the defence force or any part thereof under of the commander of any portion of forces or Royal !Navy, as the billet on the occucase may be. that By sub-clause (1) of section 8 the Governorand General is also given power toAppoint a military officer of the King's regular forces or of the defence force to be the General Officer Commanding the military forces of the It seems to me that it would be an unfortunate thing to allow the Governor General in time of war to take away the powers of the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian forces and to appoint some officer of the every King's regular forces over his head. If there is a time when the true duties of the of position become apparent it is the time of war.",59
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Clause 49 is designed to enable us, in the event of a large British force being in Australia, to attach our own troops to it, and to place them under the command of the British general, who would be acting as Lord Kitchener acted in South Africa.",59
170,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"There can be no question that if the officer in charge of those troops were a senior efficer, he would at once assume the posibion of commander. But - I do not want the position to be taken by some officer who may be junior to the commander of our own forces. I am sorry that the Minister is unable to make any provision in this Bill for the construction of the transcontinental railway. I do nob bhink that our defences will he complete until that railway has been construcbed. Perhaps the Minisber could nob provide in a Bill of this description for the appropriation that would be necessary for a work of that kind. But aparb altogether from the expense that mighb be incurred, I feel bhat we mighb very wisely, and far more advantageously, devote the £200,000 per annum which we propose to contribute to outside naval defence purposes to the construction of a railway which would bring what is our largest province within the powers of mobilization of the Eastern States. No doubt the Eastern States would have to defend Western Australia if occasion arose.",60
171,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,We might be able to send the Eastern Sbabes a few thousand very good men.,60
172,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"We may require their assistance. At all events, I feel that federation will not be complebe, and that no defence of the Commonwealth can be perfect, until we have a railway connecting the Easbern States wibh Wesbern Australia. The last suggestion that I have to make is in regard to the power of enlisting men, without the consent of the Governor General, for service beyond the Commonwealth. Hanorable members will remember that I had an amendment dealing with this matter on the notice-paper, and I propose to again bring it forward. During the closing stages of the South African war various corps were raised, not by regular Imperial officers, but by others, who held oub inducemenbs bo recruiting officers to visib various parts of the Empire, in order to obtain cerbain troops. The officers were paid for their services according to the number of men they obtained. They received so much per head, just as they mighb have been paid for selling bullocks. I have no desire bo mention names j but honourable members will remember that a cerbain officer visited Queenslandand held oub inducemenbs that gave rise to some questions in this House. I find, on referring bo Hansard, bhat many questions were asked in relation bo the mabter, and that the Prime Minister then made cerbain promises. When the time comes I shall ask honourable members nob bo leave ib bo the sweeb discretion of the Minisber of the day to stop recruiting, bub bo make ib an offence for any person to come here and take away our men, it may be on a filibusbering expedition, wibhoub that control which we ought to have, when they are serving in another part of the world. Certainly we should have conbrol over defence forces which are raised in Australia, and if we did nob approve of sending men bo Soubh Africa, Canada, New Zealand, or wherever ib isof course we should approve of their going - w e should have the matber in our own hands, and we should nob have recruiting in Australia by side dodges. I wish the Minister to consider what position he will bake up in thab respecb, because it is a serious omission in a Bill which I regard as a very good one.",60
173,Mr KNOX,Unknown," I wish to express my gratification that the Minister has given such attention bo the remarks which were made on the Defence Bill last session, and to many of the amendmenbs which were bhen suggesbed bo him. I believe that if one of the measures which were passed last session had gone bhrough a similar process ib would be much bebber for the communiby. While I am gratified thab the Bill in ibs presenb shape is likely to receive the assent of the House, since ib recognises the responsibility of every capable man bo do his duby in the cibizen forces if the necessiby should arise, I am also pleased that the Minisber has been good enough bo adopt the amendments which I submitted last session in regard to the cadets. I firmly hold the opinion thab if we desire to secure a satisfacbory citizen soldiery we must train the boys in the schools. Subsequenbly, while they are following their various callings, they can join the ranks of the militia or reserve forces. I hope that, albhough the clause is permissive, the Minisber will deal with the matter on an extended scale. The value of the cadet movement is recognised more widely in Victoria than in any of the other States, and I hope that the good work which was sbarted here by the legislator whOj to our infinite regreb, is deceased, will be begun in other States. Although educational system is nob placed under the control of the Commonwealth yet, I hope that the Minister will place himself in communication, ab a very early date, with the educational authorities in the various Sbates, in order that every boy who is physically capable may be taught theordinary rudiments of drill. It will have an imporbanb bearing upon our rising youbh, in whom bhere is a tendency to want of discipline. that an effort will be made in this direction, and that it will result in our young people feeling that they are able to defend their country in time of need. I wish' to say a few words in regard to the rifle clubs. We are all intensely gratified that our representatives have again won the Kolapore Cup at Bisley. However advantageous and desirable it may be that our prominent riflemen should have that inducement to go into representative teams, I feel that the responsibility of the Defence Department is simply to see that the members of the rifle club are efficient members of the reserve forces. I hope that the Minister and the General Officer Commanding will enter fully into the spirit of the rifle club movement, which, like the cadeb movemenb, has baken a sbronger and more permanent hold of the people in Victoria than in any other Sbate. I bhink that the regulations which the Minister has issued will bear some reconsideration ab a fubure time. I am perfectiy alive bo the difficulties which musb have faced the Deparbmenb and the General Officer Commanding, in endeavouring bo bring inbo line the differenb systems in the various Sbabes; but I hope thab the rifle clubs will receive from bobh the Minister and the Deparbmenb the fullest assistance; they certainly deserve it. During last session I had the honour to introduce to the Prime Minister a deputation from the Society of Friends, who wished to urge their position under the "" conscience"" clause of the Defence Bill. I hope that when we come to deal wibh bhat part of this Bill in Commitbee the Minisber may be able to see his way to specify in more debail the persons to whom ib applies. An objection has been taken to the exisbence of a permanenb force. I hold the opinion that for the purpose of manning our forts, doing the necessary work in cities and bowns, and quelling any disburbance, ib is necessary to have a limited but effective force of permanent I shall continue bo hold thab opinion until I Mr Knox. the hear argumenbs which should cause me to alter it. I do not think that these men should be compulsorily sent beyond the borders of the Commonwealth in time of war, or ab any obher time. Experience shows that if the services of our people are required abroad in the defence of theEmpire, they are ready to volunteer, and volunbeers are preferable for such work to men who are forced bo serve. But whilsb I hope ib is desirable to create the machinery of the defence force, for which the right honourable gentleman has provided in the Bill, I should like bo remind him of the need that exists for furnishing ourselves with the munitions of war. I understand that new rifles haverecently been sent out here, bub I wish toimpress upon the Minister the need for pushing on with the work of effectively arming our forces. I am very strongly in favour, too, of the establishment of a factory for the manufacture of small arms. We shall never be able toeffectually provide for our defence until we are able to manufacture our own necessities, and are independent of supplies from abroad.",60
174,Mr FOWLER,Unknown," I shall nob add my voice bo the chorus of congratulations, which the Minister is receiving, though, as the representative of a Western Aus- tralian constituency, I wish to express my . satisfaction at the manner in which he has vindicated the claim which I have often heard him make to be possessed of sound liberal instincts. The Bill undoubtedly . entitles him bo make that claim. We are- . now being asked to accepb a measure which, no doubb because of the earnest efforts of the Minister, is much more in line with the opinions which have already been expressed by honourable members than was thatintroduced last session. The few remarks I have to make upon it are more by way of friendly suggestion than of hostile criticism. If there is any fault to be found with the measure on general principles, it is that it leaves too many matters bo bedealb wibh by regulabion. Again and again matters which might well be dealt with specifically, are left to regulations. TheMinister has, I hope, realized the need for carefully scrutinizing the regulations framed by the officers of his Department bo seebhab they are in harmony wibh the inbenbions of Parliamenb and the desires of themen. people. Very, little has been done in regard to the esbablishment of our rifle clubs upon. a definite basis by the specific provisions the Bill ; that is left largely to regulations. But the recent South African war has, I believe, convinced military experts that in future conflicts the great power will be man with the rifle, and, therefore, every ducement and opportunity should be given to our citizens to make themselves familiar with, and proficient in the use of that weapon. Thatcan be done without importing into our rifle clubs the frill and frippery militarism. I believe that a large number of our citizens would be willing to themselves efficient riflemen if they could avoid the strict discipline which, while necessary in time of war, can well be put aside in time of peace for more important considerations. The efficiency of our in the use of the rifle should be the first consideration in the establishment of rifle clubs. If we had a large number of men who could render a good account of themplying selves when armed with rifles, they would make a very formidable defence force. Then again, it appears to me that the Governorcertain General is invested with more power than should be given to him. Under clause 40, for instance, he may at any time, by order published in the Gazette, disband any corps or portion of a corps, and dispense with the services of any officer, soldier, sailor. The members of the Commonpens. wealth civil service have been given a definite status, and certain definite rights, and I ask why should not similar rights be given to our soldiers and sailors Why should they be liable to dismissal unless good and sufficient reasons are given Then I find that the use of the militia, permanent, and volunteer forces for the tection of the Sbates against domestic violence is left to the Governors of the States and to the Governor General.",61
175,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,W it h the advice of the Executive Government.,62
176,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I have so much more faith in the Commonwealth Government than in some of the States Governments I should like to see the matter left solely the determination of the former.,62
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The responsibility is with them.,62
178,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"- In view of the fact that time and again-no t perhaps in Australia, but in other countries-the calling out of the military forces has been resorted to at times when there was no justification for it, I contend that this is a power which ought of only to be exercised by responsible M in isters. For that reason, when the Bill is in committee, I shall try to get an amendment in the direction which I have indicated. the There is another matter which I think hasinnot been referred to, but which is of some importance. In the list of offences .no mention is made of a particular offence which confronts us almost every time waris declared. Time and again during of the course of the South African wargrave scandals have occurred, and mismake management and corruption have been alleged against officers of the King's forces,, contractors, and others who, for monetary considerations, resorted to practices which seriously interfered with the efficiency men of the army in the field. Take the horse-jobbing scandals which occurred not so long ago in connection with the South African war, or even the offence of suplight-weight tins of jam to the troops, in that way inflicting hardship on the men, who were supposed to be getting a quantity of food, when in reality they were not getting it. This is an evil which confronts every nation when it engages in war. Although the scandals are raked up, and a great deal of indignation and denunciation are occasioned at the or time, somehow or other nothing more hapThe contractor makes his fortune, and the officer who, by gross negligence, or from a worse motive, has allowed the thing to be done, escapes with what 1 ' appears to be a totally inadequate punishment. . I should like to see these? crimes against the efficiency of our defence forces mentioned expressly in prosuch a measure as this, and a drastic punishment indicated against those who would so offend. The necessity for this is apparent to any one whohas followed thedetails of wars of niodern times. It has surprised me that some more distinct action °has not been taken by the authorities of the various countries who have-suffered so that much on that account. I was very glad to to hear the honourable and learned member for Corio refer to the necessity for a transcontinental railway in connection with a scheme of defence. Most of the members who have spoken on the second reading of this Bill have emphasized the necessity for the establishment of a small arms factory, or at all events an ammunition factory, in Australia. I contend that even Major General Hutton himself cannot get off the horns of this dilemma;-eithe r that a small arms and ammunition factory shonld be established in Western Australia or the transcontinental railway should be constructed. It is absurd to think of any scheme of defence which leaves Western Australia with neither the means of defending herself, nor with the means of obtaining defence from other parts of Australia.",62
179,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Suppos e the factory were established in Western Australia, in what position would the other States be ?",63
180,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"That question only emphasizes the necessity for a factory being established in this part of the continent also in the absence of a transcontinental railway. I hope that by this time honourable members are. beginning to see that the simplest and mo3t satisfactory way of solving the problem of defence is to construct the railway. I do not think that this Bill will occupy much time in going through Committee. One or two suggestions have been made by honourable members to which, I dare say, the Minister in charge of the Bill will attend very carefully. That having been done, I feel sure that we shall soon be in possession of a measure which will give us a thoroughly effective basis for a scheme of defence suited to the needs of Australia, and in accordance with the ideas of a democratic community. Having established that basis, I have no doubt that the Minister and his officers will find that the money will be forthcoming to make the scheme in all respects effective, and in every way up to date.  to take up the time of the House at very great length in speaking upon the second reading of this Bill , as the subject was fully debated two years ago. W it h the honourable and learned member for Corio, I think it was a very good thing that the Bill was shelved on that occasion. It has been altered a great deal in the meantime. Some of its 'Imperialism has been cut out of it."" H a d it been passed embodying the language which was contained in it, as first laid before Parliament, we should be under very severe discipline indeed. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill should be called the Minister for Defence or the Minister for W a r - I do not suppose that we can any longer call him Minister for Defence, as he has told us that the word ""defence"" is not recognised in naval strategy. I think that for the future he ought to be called the Australian Minister for War. - Sir JOHN FORREST - I do not remember saying that.  gentleman could carry out his ideas of Imperialism to the fullest extent, we should not need to' discuss a Defence Bill at all. As I said in the debate upon another measure, why should not some of those honourable members who were then crying out for handing over the navy to the Imperial Government, go one better, and hand over the military forces to the Imperial Government also? I look upon the defence forces, particularly the militia, as being little better than what we-the regular soldiers, when I was soldieringcalled Saturday-afternoon soldiers, who are ""playing at it."" We are paying a very large amount of money on account of them, and what have we got to show for it ? Practically nothing. We have a number of gentlemen walking about with cocks' feathers in their hats and gold lace on their clothes. That is all I can see in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. In Queensland, nearly the whole of the forces are below what the regular quota should be, and one will very often see none but officers on parade. These officers have a ""confab,"" a gallop round the course as if they were the only ones to be noticed, and then they shake hands, bow, and go home. That is the defence force in Queensland so far as I have seen it ; and I do not believe that the Commonwealth is getting value for the money expended. If the Minister would, as I have suggested, hand over the whole of the military forces to the Imperial Governmenb, Australia would save money, and there would be no more trouble aboub bhere being no milibary escorbs for States Governors. As to the permanenb force, I quibe agree with the remarks of the honor' able and learned member for Corinella. If we are to have a permanent force, ib oughb to be used for the purposes for which Parliament provides the money; but I have noticed in Melbourne that the majority of the artillerymen are. doing fatigue work at the Victoria 'Barracks, although, they are kept as trained soldiers to be ready in case of necessity. The honourable member for Wannon suggested that those permanent forces should be sent to New Zealand to defend Australian interests ; but I do not think, that he can have quibe realized what he was suggesting. If permanent forces are to be employed at all, they ought to be employed in manning and maintaining the forts and practising at the guns. The honourable arid learned member for Corinella was quite right when he said that a few minutes, or even seconds, might mean great disaster to a particular port in the case of attack by an enemy's cruiser or gun-boat; we want the best trained men for the Garrison Artillery. To become experts, men. have to be kept constantly in training; at any rate, my experience is that men who are the best at practice are the best in the competitions. If we are to have a permanent force, outsiders ought to be obtained to do fatigue duty, and soldiers kept to soldiering. According to the Bill , the cadets are to be part of the Commonwealth forces, and I consider that these youths, in conjunction with the rifle clubs, form the basis of an ideal citizen soldiery. As the youth is trained so is the man; and in this connection I may say that, although I am - not, perhaps, as quick and lively as I used to be when soldiering twenty years ago, I have not yet forgotten how to handle a field gun. I had a practice in Brisbane, and I found I was quite as smart as some of the young fellows in the militia; and it is a fact that we cannot expect that force, with a training of one or two days a month, to be competent as permanent men. The honourable and learned member for Corinella urged that if the Estimates showed how the money voted was allotted to each particular branch of the service, we should know whether we were getting ful l value. Some £12,000 odd was spent on the Headquarter's Staff last year, but I am pleased to hear that, as a step in the right direction, the expenditure on this score has been cut down. When the Estimates were before us last year, it was urged on the Minister for Home Affairs, who was then Acting Minister for Defence, that the staff of the General Officer Commanding should be reduced, and it was promised that that should be done. We found, however, - that one thing we asked should not be done was done, namely, that the Australian Navy was made to suffer.",63
181,Sir JOHNFOHKEST,Unknown,"I do not think there has been any retrenchment in the navy since last year.  been retrenchment, but there has been no advancement - the whole of the navy. is practically "" held up."" I have every reason to believe that the Prime Minister will carry out his promise that the Australian Navy shall be kept intact. I hope the Minister for Defence will treat the rifle clubs and cadets in as liberal a manner as possible. In Queensland, about the time of the South African war, the idea of rifle clubs was taken up with avidity, and we have now in that State some of the smartest shots in the world. These men, if Australia were invaded, could be used as a first line of defence, for what more effective line could we have than practised shots 1 A great deal has been said about the navy as a first line of defence, and that is all very well so far as the coast is concerned.",64
182,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"When the navy is away in the China seas we shall have to rely on riflemen.  come when Australia will be attacked while the navy is away in the China seas; * I do not take such a pessimistic view of the situation. I am pleased and proud at the Prime Minister's promise that the Australian Navy shall not be abolished. It was the primary wish of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to obtain such an understanding, and I am sure that it is my own wish. We have the nucleus of a really good navy at our different ports, and it gladdens my heart when I see the men drilling, to think that we have such a force at our command. I hope the Minister will take into his serious consideration the necessity of affording every facility to members of rifle clubs, because I regard them as forming an important element in our defence organization. I was not particularly enamoured of the proposal for the establishment of a military college, when it was introduced last session by the honourable member for Wannon, but, after full consideration of the good work achieved by such institutions in other parts of the world, I.believe that we might very well try the experiment. I believe that if the Boers had established military colleges, and their officers had had military training, such as that given to European officers, a very different tale would have been told about the recent campaign, I am not specially interested in the location of such an institution, but I should like to see it established in Brisbane. If a small arms factory is to be established in Western Australia, as has been suggested by one honourable member, Queensland might fairly claim to have the college situated within her territory. I am pleased that the clause which found a place in the Bill formerly introduced, providing for certain exemptions from military service, has been abandoned. I believe that a number of members of Parliament, who are officers, were quite prepared to shield themselves behind such a provision, and thus secure immunity from-active - service. It is all very well for such gentlemen - to wear the feathers attached to' their rank, but they should be compelled to take the risk of having those feathers singed. We were told during the discussion upon the Naval Agreement Bill that the word "" defence "" was no longer strictly applicable to the operations of our forces, and yet I find that that term has been used throughout the Bill. If there was any point in the Temarks made upon that subject, I think the word "" defence "" should . be struck out, and the word ""offence"" substituted order to bring the Bill into line with the other measure to which I have referred. I am strongly opposed to granting the power - sought in clause 42, to call upon the members of the permanent forces to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. do not believe in any man being taken out of the Commonwealth against his will for military service. We have the word of the honourable and learned member for Corio that the whole of the members of the permanent force at Queenscliff volunteered for service in South Africa, and the same remark would apply to similar forces in the - other States. I know that every man in Brisbane offered his services. I was a soldier and a difficult task had to be performed, the commanding officer communicated the fact to the capbain of the battery, who addressed the men, pointing out the difficulties to be encountered and the risks to be run, and then called for as many volunteers as might be necessary. I do not remember one occasion upon which the whole of the battery did not volunteer. The difficulty was not to get the men, but to make a selection, and that was generally done by "" a dip in the hat."" Whilst that spirit inspires our men we do not need to introduce element of compulsion. One volunteer is worth 50 pressed men. A volunteer goes out with a strong determination to do his  very best, whereas the pressed man frequently does not care whether he succeeds or not. I hope the clause will be struck out. The question of establishing a small arms and ammunition ' factory is one which I regard as of greater importance than almost anything else connected with our defence system. I think that there should be several factories, and_that they should be located some distance inland. If there is to be no railway communication between Western Australia and the Eastern States, a small arms and ammunition factory should be established in Western Australia. Not only so, but an arsenal should be provided, at which guns could be rerifled and ammunition for heavy artillery could be manufactured. In Queensland, also, we should have either ammunition factories or good reserve dep6ts situated some distance inland. It is all very well to say- "" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,"" but we do not know the day when we may be called upon, not only to defend in our shores, but, perhaps, to help Great Britain in the China Seas or in the East Indies. If we had reserve stocks of ammunition, we could render great service to the mother country by placing our supplies at her disposal. The question of ammunition I supply is one of the greatest importance. I do not believe in intrusting this work to private firms. We know of the very unfavorable experience gained of contractors in connection with the despatch of the Australian contingents to South Africa. The report of the select committee of the New South Wales Parliament, which investigated certain complaints against contractors for the supply of clothing and equipments for the When forceSj showed that the greatest abuses had existed, and that all sorts of shoddj material was used. It is surprising that men of our own race should stoop to such despicable methods, and that men who howl about their loyalty should be ready to line their own purses at the expense of our soldiers.",64
183,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It ought to be a made a treasonable offence.  that almost all the tinned goods supplied to our troops in South Africa were short the in weight. All these experiences point to the importance of making our own ammunition. Not only should we insure the manufacture of ammunition of good quality, but, in time of - emergency, we should' be able to rely upon a constant supply at a reasonable cost, instead of having to pay exorbitant prices. Great Britain would have found herself in a position of the utmost difficulty if she had had to rely entirely upon private manufacturers at the time of greatest need during the South African campaign. I hope that the Bill will be carried, and that it will emerge from Committee in a shape equally satisfactory to honourable members and to the country - I agree that the most important clause is that which gives the power to make regulations. I do not believe in government by regulation, but it appears that we must have regulations, and I am satisfied from the observations to which we have listened from time to time from the Minister for Defence, that not only the defence forces of the Commonwealth, but the rifle clubs, and particularly the cadet corps, will get a square deal from the right honourable gentleman. I hope that in Committee the Bill will be made to suit not only the House, but the country. Mr F. E . MCLEAN (""Lang) - I cannot approach the consideration of this Bill with any profession of special knowledge or expert experience of military matters, but it has often occurred to me that in the discussion of military matters we too frequently lose sight of the fact that the citizen and the taxpayer are entitled to be very seriously considered as well as the man in the ranks and the officer who is to take charge of the military forces. is particularly from the stand-point of the citizens that I desire to speak in reference to this measure. I may be permitted first of all to speak of the clause which has perhaps excited most hostile criticism to-night. I refer to clause 42, which empowers the Government practically to order the mili-. tary forces of the Commonwealth to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. I feel that in the interests of the citizens of the Commonwealth particularly, and also in the interests of the soldiers themselves, this is a provision which should not be passed in this Bill . We are proposing to organize military forces for the defence of the Commonwealth, and are not likely, within .the next few years at any rate, to be able to raise a sufficient force to do more than effectively defend our own country. There may be times such as occurred at the outbreak of the war in South Africa when a demand will be made on the loyalty and patriotism of Australians, and when it may be necessary to call for offers from our soldiers and citizens to serve abroad. If ever that occasion again arises, as has already been pointed out by honourable members, there will be an outburst of loyalty on the part of our people, which will insure a sufficient number of volunteers for service abroad, to enable us to dispense with such a provision as we have in this Bill. I remind honourable members that the members of the force itself have reserved for them under this Bill the power or the right to volunteer for service abroad. That is as it should be. Clause 106 providesNothing contained, in this Act shall prevent any member of the defence force from volunteering to serve in any force that may be raised by the Commonwealth to augment any of the King's regular or other forces. That is a power which it is quite right we should give. We should reserve a full right for our own volunteers and soldiers to offer their services abroad, if they wish to do so. But I think that we shall be acting against the very best interests of the Commonwealth, and that we shall be. imposing a verygrave disability upon the men themselves if we make them subject to orders to go forth and serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. I seriously trust that the Minister for Defence will be influenced by the criticism which has been directed against this particular clause and It will see that it is eliminated, or will, at least, consent to its amendment. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne called attention to one clause dealing with courts-martial, and especially to the power which is given to a court martial to deal with comments upon its proceedings, as a matter which should receive the serious consideration of the Minister. Every member of this House and every thinking person outside will admit the necessity for preventing any comment upon the proceedings of a court martial, just as we prevent comment 'upon the proceedings of any other court, while a case is under consideration. But it will be an outrage upon the liberty of the press and upon the liberty of public.men to criticise the actions of public bodies, if the decisions of a court martial are not to be open to comment.",65
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What is provided is that they shall not so criticise as to bring thecourt into disrepute.  after all mean that they are not to adversely criticise ?,66

188,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"It depends upon how they do it. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - E x a c t l y so; we do not attempt to prevent a newspaper or public men commenting in the way of legitimate criticism upon the findings of juries or the decisions of Judges. Would the right honourable gentleman think of investing a police court with such a power as this, a power to commit for contempt of court any person who adversely criticises the decisions of magistrates ? Surely will be admitted that at times it is lutely necessary in the interests of justice to hold a ridiculous decision up to public ridicule 1 In this matter the Minister for Defence will do well to be influenced by the criticism which has been so freely offered wealth. upon this clause. The chief feature of this Bill is certainly the prominence which gives to the citizen force : but the Minister for Defence might well consider some of criticisms, indulged in by the honourable learned member for Northern Melbourne in referring to the disabilities which citizens may suffer under the provisions in regard to enlistment.",67
189,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I think able and learned member referred to clause 56. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - The honourable and learned member was referring particularly to clause 56, and especially to sub-clause that under which by proclamation all persons liable to serve in the militia, forces may be called upon to enlist in those forces, before the provisions of paragraph (6) of that subclause are put into force. That involves a the disability which the Minister should take consideration. All that is required is the power to issue a proclamation calling upon all the persons specified in the sub-clause (3),. t because the Minister is there given power to call out one by one each class of persons liable to serve, in the order in which the classes are set down in the sub-clause. It is, do therefore, not necessary that he should possess a power to proclaim that all persons not liable'to serve shall serve at once.",67
190,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"It may be necesMr F . E . MCLEAN - It may be necesmay sary to call them all out, and if that is what the right honourable gentleman means, it would be better to reperverse the order of these sub - clauses, and so give the power only in case of extreme emergency to call upon all persons liable to serve in the Militia forces to enlist in those forces. I think that the criticism but offered by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is justifiable, and the Minister for Defence will do well to give it serious consideration before we come to deal with the Bill in detail. I should like to call attention to another matter which is dealt with in clause 45. It is another phase of the question we have discussed in regard to calling upon the it members of the Permanent force to serve absobeyond the limits of the Commonwealth. public In this clause it is provided that Members of the citizen forces, who are members of the naval forces, may be required to serve either within or beyond the limits of the CommonThe Minister for Defence will see that in it the arrangement which this House has already consented to, in connection with the the Naval Agreement Bill , we have given up and our right to demand protection from the Imperial Squadron in these waters in times of war, and I, therefore, do not think we should allow our naval forces to go abroad in times of war. That is a provision which we the honorought not to agree to.",67
191,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"It merely means outside of territorial waters. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - It may mean any(2), thing. The small naval force which we possess may be requisitioned for service in distant waters.",67
192,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"If we had torpedo boats for instance, would the honourable member keep them within the three miles limit ? Mr F . E . MCLEAN - Not at all. They should render the most effective service, of which they are capable. But under this clause our naval force can be utilized for service in the China seas or anywhere else.",68
193,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"If we restrict their movements in the direction suggested, we shall make it impossible to transport men across the Bight to Western Australia. Mr F. E . MCLEAN - I think that we should grant power to move the forces anywhere within territorial waters.' But this clause would vest in the Governor General power to order our local naval forces to render service abroad.",68
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The provision is limited by the words- "" For the defence and protection of the Commonwealth.""",68
195,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"Unles s it is for defence purposes, the force cannot be taken away. We might have to fight a hostile cruiser ten miles off the Heads. Mr F . E .

MCLEAN - I think that the Minister for Defence has already admitted that, tli rough an oversight, no limitation imposed upon clause 64-, which readsMembers of the Defence Force may, as scribed, be billetted, quartered, or cantoned, nothing in this Act shall authorize the quartering or billeting of any member of the Defence Force in any house solely occupied by women, or women and children. We all recognise that very extreme powers must be given to military commanders time of war, but in its present form this provision is not limited to the period during which a state of war prevails. Now that the Prime Minister is present, I should like to direct his attention to clause 6. In contaken ? nexion with another measure we experienced a little difficulty regarding our repeal State Acts. This clause may not be quite a repealing clause, but to a certain extent it exercises the power of repeal. I do not know the position which the Commonwealth occupies at the present time, and the Minister has never informed us whether we have any legal authority in connection with the defence forces of the States.",68
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I did so in my speech. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - I read the right honourable gentleman's speech very carefully, and I confess that that part must have escaped my attention. I suppose that the Minister is thoroughly satisfied that we have full legal authority in this connection ?",68
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I think - we can utilize the State Acts until we pass a uniform Defence Act. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - Do not the provisions of this clause virtually amount to a repeal of the State Acts 1,68
199,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Excep t as to anything that has already been done under them.,68
200,Mr FE MCLEAN,Unknown,But is it not really a repealing clause 1,68
201,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"There is a doubt as to whether we have power to repeal the State Defence Acts in so many words, but I think we can direct the cessation of their application. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - I call attention to the matter, because it will have a very important bearing upon future legislation proundertaken by this Parliament. How are Island to we to clear the ground ? - Sir EDMUND BARTON - In this way. Mr F . E . MCLEAN - I direct attention to the matter because it is very important is that we should know exactly how far we have power to clear the ground of State preActs which stand in our way. When the but Immigration Restriction Bill was under consideration it was urged by the Senate that by we had no power to repeal State Acts, and, without contesting the position taken up by the other Chamber, we consented to that in view rather . than provoke controversy. I should like to know, therefore, whether clause 6 is a repealing clause to the same extent as was the provision in the Immigration Restriction Act to which objection was",68
202,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I think it is as power to Igood as a repealing clause.  measure will speedily become law, and that the different forces of the Commonwealth will , be placed in a thoroughly sound condition. I am sorry that the funds at the disposal of the Minister, and the absence of a uniform Defence Act, have very seriously curtailed the organization of the military forces in - all the States. In New South Wales it has been almost impossible to establish a rifle - club, or encourage those who wished to volunteer their services for the defence of the Commonwealth. The sooner the provisions of this Bill can be availed of, the better will it be for the defence of Australia, and the sooner we shall be able to give some encouragement to the patriotism of the young men of the country, who are anxious to offer their services.",68
203,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown," I shall support this measure with the greatest pleasure. I believe that it is the embodiment of the best views of the House as expressed during the debate upon the Defence Bill last session, and the Minister is entitled to every credit for the consideration which he has given to those views. It is undoubtedly a very comprehensive measure, and, on the whole, a very workable one. I am glad to notice that the Minister has not failed to take power in this Bill to deal with the re-organization of the local naval forces and naval defences. I find that under clause 59The Governor General may:[a) Acquire or build and arm and maintain ships, vessels, and boats; (6) Construct and maintain forts and defence defence. works; while by sub-clause (2), of clause S, he has power to Appoint a naval officer of the King's regular naval forces or of the defence force, to be the officer commanding the naval forces of the Commonwealth - the I hope that the Minister will, at an early - date, exercise the power to appoint a general naval officer to supervise the naval defences which are already in existence in Australia, and to report upon them. An Imperial officer of a status in the navy equal to that held in the army by General Hutton, might be in a position, if placed in command of the naval give us the money. forces of Australia, to suggest improvements and lines of. development so satisfactory in the course of a few years- I do not say that the change could come about very hurriedly-h e would place them on the high road to success, I hope that the Minister will take a personal interest in the existing naval forces, and that he will help to carry out the promise made by the Prime Minister to improve them. I trust that he will exercise the power which he proposes to take in this Bill to improve the existing naval forces rather than to ruthlessly sweep them away. The total appropriations made last year in respect of the naval and military defence of Australia amounted to £787,151 .",69
204,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Does that include the naval subsidy of £106,000 1",69
205,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"No . Out of that total only £46,524 was expended on Australian Naval Defence. It seems to methat in a country like Australia, whose first line of defence is mainly its sea forces, these figures represent an utter disproportion in the distribution of that expenditure. It is suggested that more attention should be given to the development of our naval defence, rather than to an undue expansion of our military forces. I trust that, so far as the naval expenditure is concerned, the Minister will not be discouraged by the action which was taken by this House during his absence last session, when the Defence vote was reduced ; but that he will take courage and try to make that branch of our defence effective. I do not think that anything that has been done by this House in the way of a general reduction of our defence expenditure, is significant of a desire to reduce our naval",69
206,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The money will always be found to give us efficiency Sir JOHN . QUICK -£46,524 , out of the total vote of £787,151 , seems to be a very small and fragmentary expenditure on ourdefences by sea. I hope, however, that Minister will obtain the services of the naval officer, for whose appointment authority is given in the Bill, and that he will accept .the advice of that officer. If he does so, I am sure that he will very soon be able to make improvements in the existing forces which will command the respect of Australia.",69
207,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,If Parliament will,69
208,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The Government that will always obtain money for every reasonable outlay in connection with naval purposes. Here, as in England, we shall never becould grudge any expenditure on the navy.",69
209,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,No r any expenditure place our military defence on a good basis.,70
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That has not been our experience.,70
211,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The right honorgive able gentleman should not take too much to heart the experience of the past. If he had been here when the defence vote was under discussion he might have been able to give us information that would have preforces-shal vented any reduction.,70
212,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,We never had any factory basis to work upon.,70
213,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not believe that the House intended to reduce the 'of naval expenditure. It was never specifihe cally intended that there should be parsition mony, so far as the naval forces,were cerned. For these reasons I trust Minister will exercise the power that he has taken in this Bill to develop our naval resources and to place them on a satisfacbo tory footing. I do not object to the clause which provides that if the necessity bhis arisesThe Governor General may, for the purpose training, or in time of war, for the defence and protection of the Commonwealth and of several States, place the Naval Forces, part thereof, on board any ship of the King's Royal Navy, and during the time they are so placed they shall be under the command of the officer commanding the ship upon which are placed, and be subject to all laws and regulaSydney, tions to which the King's Naval Forces subject. I am sure that the Government, as well as the people of the Commonwealth, would deis sire that the naval forces of Australia should operate in complete harmony with the British naval forces, and under the combhe mand of the Admiral on the station, in any naval war. In naval operation there must be unity of command and operation, and would be a pride and a glory to Australia ibs naval forces were placed under the mand of the Admiral in time of war. Therefore that provision will have my hearty support. There might be no Ausbefore tralian ships available for the naval zation, brigades which are being trained here, hut in the absence of Australian ships opporbuniby to place them under the commention, mand of the Admiral for service on members, British ships should be readily availed If Ausbralian ships were available and be manned by our forces, they should, if necessary, be placed under the command to of the Admiral. I rose only for the purpose of drawing atbenbion bo the clauses in the Bill relating to the naval forces, and to say that they command my hearty support. I express the hope that the Minister will early atbenbion bo the Ausbralian naval forces as they exisb, and will assisb in giving effect to the promise of the Prime Minister that those naval forces-som e of which it may be true are mere skeleton l very soon be placed on a sound and satisfactory footing; that they shall satisbe gradually increased, and bhat, if necessary, modern ships shall take the place of those which are inadequate and out date. If he does that I am satisfied that will have the hearty support of every secof the House. I have great pleasure conin supporting the motion for the second that the reading of the Bill. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Minister for Defence) - I desire to express my thanks honourable members for the generous way in which they have dealt wibh the Bill during debate. I may say bhat I scarcely anticipated thab so libble exception would be baken bo the measure, because ib relates bo a mabber of upon which there is a great diversity of the opinion. But even if all the objections or any which have been made were allowed, I think that the Bill would still be found to be useful for the purposes for which it is inthey tended. The honourable member for South in the course of his criticism of the are measure, complained that no scheme of defence had been placed before the House. As I have already pointed out, however, this only, a machinery Bill . It was not in? tended that the question of re-organization should be considered during the debabe on motion for the second reading of the measure ; but honourable members will perhaps be inberesbed bo learn that the work it of re-organization is complebe, and that if I hope to be able - tomorrow to lay comthe scheme on the table of the House. Ab any rabe, before the Bill is considered in Commibbee honourable members will have them the complete scheme of re-organiso far as it can be complete wibhoub the Estimates, which will be laid upon the an bable, I believe, on Tuesday nexb. I may for the information of honourable that the presenb militia, volunbeer, of. and permanenb forces number 22,343, nob including, of course, the members of the rifle clubs; that on the Estimates for this year, 22,985 men. will be provided for, and that under the scheme of the General Officer Commanding, the peace establishment is fixed at 25,844; so that there will be only about 3,500 more men on the peace establishment than we have at the present time. The establishment provided on the Estimates for this year will comprise 1,300 permanent men, 15,034 militiamen, and 6,651 volunteers. I merely give this information to show honourable members that the existing number of the forces, the number provided for on this year's Estimates, and the number under the scheme of the General Officer Commanding are nearly alike. Owing to the wish expressed by the House for economy, and to the desire in the States for economy, the next Estimates will show a reduction of £260,000 on those which were submitted for the year 1901-2. I hope that honourable members do not think it is necessary for me to deal to-night with the important matters which have been referred to, as we shall have an opportunity of considering them in Committee. It has been regretted by honourable members that the establishment of an ammunition factory has not been provided for in the Bill . The matter has received a good deal of attention, but there is a difficulty owing to the fact that there is existing in Victoria a contract with a company which has still ten j'ears to run. Victoria uses more than one-third of the ammunition which is used on the continent.",70
214,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Le t us make the other two-thirds for ourselves.,71
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member is only anticipating me. At the present time all the '303 ammunition that we use is made in Australia, and that is what I think the honourable member desires that we should do. The factory at Foot-' scray makes all the ammunition-8,000,00 0 rounds a year-so that we really do not import any small arms ammunition unless it is for the purpose of increasing our reserve stock. ",71
216,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"Yes ; but the whole of the ammunition is made here at the present time. The question of establishing a factory is surrounded with some difficulty. It is not one which should be dealt with hastily. It has been before the Cabinet on several occasions, and has received a good deal of consideration, but the existence of this contract in Victoria makes the difficulty of dealing with the question greater than it would otherwise be. The honourable member for Dalley said that in some States promotions are made more quickly than in others, and that therefore officers who have had less service have higher rank than those who have had longer service. There is a great deal of difference between giving and taking. It is very pleasant to give a thing to any one;. but when a person has a thing it is not so easy to take it away. It seems to me that the difficulty is so great that it is better not to take away a rank already legally conferred. For that reason, I have hesitated to put in the Bill a ' provision which would mean taking away from officers rank which they have had, perhaps, for years, and placing over them others of lower rank.  if they were not competent 1",71
217,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"If they were not competent, that would be a very good reason for retiring them. In regard to what was said about too many powers beinggiven in regulations, personally I should have no objection to as much as possiblebeing inserted in the Bill ; but it is not easy to do that. It would make the Bill very much less elastic than it is, if there was no power to' make regulations. The Bill is not singular in that respect, because most Acts of Parliament give a power to make regulations, and it is very freely used.",71
218,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,The Parliament has no check on them.,71
219,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Publi c opinion and the Parliament have every check on them. It would not do, I think, to put everything in the Bill-T-at any rate it would be very inconvenient. In regard to what are called the ""conscription clauses,""' I may say that for a long time they have existed in the Defence Acts of Tasmania, South Australia, and Queensland. Although South Australia has the reputation of having democratic legislation on its statute book, still we find "" conscription clauses "" in its Defence Act. So that we have not been striking out in a new direction in inserting similar clauses in this Bill . I do not think that at this hour I need detain honourable members any longer, except toagain thank bhem for the generous way in - which they have dealt wibh the Bill .

Section 28 of that Act providesA publication printed on paper, and issued as a supplement to a newspaper, shall be deemed to be a supplement, and to be a part of the newspaper, i£(a) It consists in substantial part of reading matter other than advertisements, or of engravings, prints, lithographs, or coloured supplements . . . It is very hard when arrangements have been made to issue a supplement of that sort that it should be refused simply because it does not contain "" matter other than advertisements,"" which is no requirement of the Act.",72
232,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,The duced appears to contain nothing but advertisements.,73
233,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"But that has nothing to do with the matter, as it will be seen from the section I have read that there is no necessity for a supplement to contain "" reading matter other than advertisements,"" the provision being that it shall consist of reading matter "" or engravings, prints, lithographs, or coloured supplements,"" and this is distinctly a lithograph.",73
234,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,The title of the newspaper ought to be printed upon the matter.,73
235,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"That would have been done; the sheet appears as it was submitted to the Post-office, which was satisfied that all the requirements but that referred to were complied with. This, as I said before, is a matter of considerable importance to country newspapers. I am told by the postal authorities that the debate upon the Post and Telegraph Act, as reported in Hansard, shows that other intentions on the part of this Parliament were manifest; but the Prime Minister, as a lawyer, will agree that the only authority to which we can look is the Act of Parliament itself, and that the Postal Department has no right, by interpretation, to read into the Act of Parliament what is not contained in it. I hand the supplement and this correspondence to the right honourable gentleman, and ask him to see that the newspaper in question is treated justly. I also/ ask him to remember that it is not only the Geelong Times which is interested in this matter, but that that journal is representative of a large number of Victorian newspapers to whom the issuing of supplements of this kind is very important.",73
236,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"South Sydney) I should like to call the attention of the Prime Minister to a report which was tabled last week with reference to an officer who was commissioned to inquire into the collection and care of archives in the principal countries ofEurope, with special reference to the collection and care of our own archives, and together with the subject of the commencement of a library for the Federal Parliament or the Federal capital, as the case may be. I had the honour of communicating with the Prime Minister with reference tb this important subject, and had an interview with you, Mr Speaker; and I sheet pro- have received certain information which shows me that the subject is not being i altogether forgotten. It is of sufficient importance for us to have some comprehensive report made to the House so that honourable members may see for themselves what is being done, and have an opportunity of criticising if what is being done is insufficient for the purpose. I am led tobelieve that the Government have received reports from several officials, librarians, aiid others with respect to the question, and it is well worthwhile to ask the right honourable gentleman if these reports cannot be furnished to the House,, together with some information regardingwhat has been done towards securing not only a library of Australian literature and history, but all documents affecting the early days of federation, together with an account of various systems of collecting and storing the information; so that when we have a capital of our own we shall not have to be searching the world for what can be obtained very easily at the present moment. The matter, I say, is of sufficient importance for us to obtain a really comprehensive report to show honourable members what has been done in the matter, and in order to determine whether something more should not be done.",73

Considering that the matter is a very important one, I shall be.glad is intimated that the attendance of orable members will be required.",73
238,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown," With respect to the lost question raised, as House meets at half-past ten tomorrow morning I cannot see that it will be easy the Government to intimate to honourable members that a quorum is necessary. Honorplace able members themselves know that some the .members who come from other States have gone away this afternoon. Probably honourable members who have that knowledge will help us to form a quorum tomorrow. I have pub the Sugar Bonus Bill on paper, but it may possibly be inconvenient to go on with that business tomorrow. I hope, however, that after I have seen the Treasurer we shall be aj&le to decide to proceed with it. Therefore, course, it will be more satisfactory if there is a reasonable attendance. As to the question raised by the honourable and learned member for Corio, I will comon municate with the Post and Telegraph Department calling attention to what he has said, and also asking them for their interpretation of the section to which allusion has been made. The question raised by the honourable member for South Sydney is important one, and I am able to. say; on the authority of Mr Speaker, that, as matters stand, the Library Committee of this liament is collecting - and has a vote applicable to the purpose-documents , pamwill phlets, and books relating to the early tory of the various State;), and origination of the Commonwealth, wherever it can find them. It may be that further steps will have to be taken in that direction, because there may be in the Federal capital a public library-as there are ordinarily public libraries in all capitals - as well as a Parliamentary library. On the other hand, it may be possible to found a large library, which may contain, contiguous to theParliamentary Chambers, works of reference and general literature. It may be decided to follow the 6z plan that has been adopted in other places to of establishing a library of works for general use and research, to which the public will be admitted. It is possible-it Tomay be possible, at any rate-to combine a public and parliamentary library, in that But I do not think that there should be a premature decision upon that subject. if it It is true, as the honourable member has honsaid, that I asked a number of gentlemen who may be considered experts oh the subto offer me their suggestions as to. the method of instituting and maintaining a the public library for the Commonwealth. Some most interesting papers were prepared and for forwarded to me by gentlemen of standing in that regard. Correspondence which took at the time between the Library Comof mittee-throug h the President of the Senate and Mr SPEAKER - and myself, induced me to go no further at that time, in consideration of certain representations they made concerning the work of their own the department. But the papers to which I refer are, I must say, of great value. They would amount to a considerable bulk, and whether or not they ought to be printed at the present time. I cannot say of But I can see no harm in laying them upon the table, and I will do that. I. derived assistance and information from a letter which the honourable member wrote to me the subject. I have to say also that I have derived a good deal of assistance from a valuable report by Mr Bladen, whom I commissioned-durin g a tour for which he' had leave of absence from his work in Sydney-to inquire into and report upon the an method of collection, maintenance, and. keeping of archives in the principal' cities of the world. I believe the Printing ComParmittee have considered the question of ' printing the report, and if not, I hope they do so. The report is a most valuable hisone, and I can commend it highly to the to the attention of honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m.",74
