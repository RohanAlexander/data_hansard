Non-State Business Colleges To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers and citizens Australia respectfully showeth: That the report of the Depanment of Employment and Industrial Relations on Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation, July 1977, page 197, states that, in respect of Stenographers-Secretaries: 'With the exception of new business coUege graduates demand for less experienced and less skilled people in Sydney is in balance with the supply.' Business coUege graduates are exactly what the market wants and employers demand. In one of the fewfieldsof employment shown by the report to be undersuppUed, the Government is effectively reducing the abUity of business coUeges to train enough secretaries and stenographers for the positions which are available. The sixteen technical coUeges in the metropolian Sydney which accommodate 3,220 students in day secretarial studies do not have the capacity to acommodate more than 6 per cent of the 2,435 ness coUeges in the same area who will be disadvantaged by the Government's recent decision to withdraw fees subsidies and Uving aUowances from the end of 1977. 1977 school leavers who wish to undertake a course in retarial studies and thus ensure they obtain a worthwhile position of employment on graduation are being forced to pay fees of the order of $1,400 for the year and also to forgo TEAS Uving allowances. The Government's decision is unfair, unjust, discriminattection ory, unreasonable and capricious. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Comwhich monwealth Government will act immediately to undertake a thorough review of the position of non-State business colleges, guarantee interim funding fonhwith and reverse its decision.

The petition of the underto signed citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as nancy inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient laid down.

The humble petition of the undersigned Citizen Band radio operators respectfuUy showeth: We strongly disapprove of the Citizen Radio Service being short distance UHF only and advocate that 27 Mhz should be allowed to continue as an ongoing service allowing communication within the geographic Umits of Australia (RB14 1.1). We point out that we have paid our Ucence fee under ess and demand a written explanation for its existence.

We strongly disapprove of the distance limitations specified forfixedstations (RBI4 2.1a). Communication on 27 Mhz should be aUowed within the geographical Umits of Australia forfixedand mobUe stations. UHF communication should have repeaters set up and paid for by the Government outside metropoUtan areas. We strongly disapprove with the limitations on aerial heights and acceptable types (RB14.21b, 2.1c) and believe these should be abolished. We consider that the clause (RBI 4.43) 'where the reception of sound or vision of broadcasting programs in being affected by the operation of a Citizens Radio Service station, the Ucencee snail refrain from further transmission on each of the frequencies which cause interference during the operating hours of the broadcasting or television stauons affected adequately covers this situation. We suongly insist that 27.065 Mhz be formally specified as the official emergency channel in the regulations (RBI4). - We strongly disapprove with the technical tariff being forced on us by having to buy an 18 channel modified transceiver from 1 January 1978. We advocate the continuance of 23 channel equipment and 40 channel equipment to be introduced. the provisions of the Income Tax We advocate that the present channel 11,27.085 Mhz be officially named as the AM call channel.

AUSTRALIA'S RECORD ON INFLATION NA",18
7,Mr JULL,AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Bearing in mind the conflicting reports in the Press, this House and elsewhere, will the Prime Minister clear up once and for all just how Australia's record on inflation and unemployment compares with that of the major countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation",18
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"I think a number of utterly misleading statements have been made on this particular subject, especially during two interviews on the program This Day Tonight and on the Willesee show, during the course of last Those interviews tried to suggest that basically in the Labor years matters had been better November, controUed in Australia than in other countries and in the last two years they had been worse controlled. If one examines the facts, one of course willfindthat the reverse is the truth. I should like to make the position quite plain so that honourable gentlemen can know the charges that were made, by whom they were made and how false they were. On inflation and unemployment when Labor was in office, the Leader of the Opposition said: did not hit Australia worse than other countries. it went bad under us it went bad in every Western was stated in country without exception. comThefirstcomment was made on the program Day Tonight and the second, repeating the was made on the Willesee show. Firstly, Labor's The was worse than in many percentage increase in concent in Germany; 11.8 per cent in Japan; 10.8 cent in The averlate age for OECD countries was 11.4 per cent Australia it was 15.1 per cent. and in Government members-Oh ! As I Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Honourable gentlemen should wait, because this is only the first leg in the false trail. It goes quite a way yet. On this basis, inflation under Labor rose to four times the 1962-72 average. In Japan Germany, for example, innation increased at half that rate. I turn now to the second point. The increase unemployment under Labor was worse than many other countries. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition said that it did not hit Australia worse. Let us look at the facts. In 1975 ployment was nearly three times the 1962-72 average. In the United States it was 1.8 times, in gone Japan 1.6 times, in Canada 1.4 times and in the United Kingdom 1.7 times the average for that period. The increase was much worse in Australia than in the other countries I have tioned. In fact, under Labor unemployment rose by 157 per cent in one year alone. What other country can match that notorious and irresponKingdom sible record? Now let us look at innation during this 1,220,000. Government's term of office. On show the Leader of the Opposition said: Japan, Western Europe, North America . . . in those countries it has improved in 1976 and 1977 and Australia it has not. On This Day Tonight he also said: In 1976 and 1977 inflation has gone down in other tries, it hasn't in Australia. The allegation was repeated. But, liking the sound of the rhetoric, he went further and said: Inflation has gone down in all the other Western scarcely at all in Australia. That was said on Willesee at Seven on 27 October 1977. First of all, let us look at the In 1976 and 1977 inflation has not gone down all other Western countries. Ever since the secindustrial ond half of 1975 the average inflation rate for again. the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development area has remained fairly static, the 8 per cent to 10 per cent range. On the latest available statistics, six Western countries, including Sweden and Denmark, have higher inflation$4,000m rates now than they had in the year to August 1975. So thefirstleg of this particular untruth nailed. Secondly, Australia's inflation has come down in 1976 and 1977. Over the last three quarters the increase in the consumer price has been 2.3 per cent, 2.4 per cent and 2 per cent, giving an annual rate for thefirstnine months ofing this year of a fraction over 9 per cent. This is liament, clearly down from the underlying rate of aroundand timeuntruths 17 per cent under Labor in 1975. Let us now look at unemployment under this Government. The Leader of the Opposition said on This Day Tonight: over Canada, the United States and West Germany and . . . they don't have as much unemployment He then went on further, on Willesee at Seven, to say: in Unemployment has certainly gone down in every other in Western country without exception. Carried away again by his rhetoric and by his unemown music, he went further still, and said: You can't quote another country in the world where it has up anywhere near that or at idi. Unemployment has become worse in some other countries. In Canada, from August 1975 to men-August 1977 unemployment has gone from 7.3 per cent to 8.2 per cent. In Japan it has gone from 1.9 per cent to 2.1 per cent. In the United it has gone from 4.3 per cent to 6 per cent. In France it has gone from 860,000 to So, again the untruth is nailed so that the Willesee everyone can see it. These assertions are only some of the multiaU tude of untruths and deliberate distortions that in one would expect. I suppose that I could say that the honourable gentleman is unaware of the facts. Perhaps he would prefer me to say that. On coun-This Day Tonight he flatly denied that two years ago he had signed a statement that would lead to the continuation of uranium mining. Of course, he had signed the Memorandum of Understanding that was tabled in this Parliament and, I countries;think, incorporated in Hansard. He said that no government had ever settled an industrial dispute. Under the guidance of my colleague the facts.Minister for Employment and Industrial Relaintions, this Government has settled a number of disputes and, if it has to, it will do so in The Leader of the Opposition' talked of his Government's contemplating borrowing $2,000m. Of course we all know that it was a loan, not a $2,000m loan. He said that the. Hayden Medibank scheme would cost no ismore than the present Medibank scheme. That is an outrageous assertion because it would cost nearly $700m more in thisfinancialyear. index Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like seeing their leader exposed. They do not like seethe untruths of their leader nailed in this Parwhich he has repeated time again. The Leader of the Opposition has no credibility at all. His last hurrah will be his last election after 10 December, when presumably he will be beaten by somebody else for the leadership. NA",18

If so, why should the papers continue to be subject to this discrimination? Does the Minister recognise that this is Western not only important economically but important politically?",20
13,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,POSTAGE OF NEWSPAPERS,"The arrangement with regard to publications registered with Australia Post is that they must meet certain ditions and criteria. One of the main conditions that those publications must be carried exclusDevelopment. ively by Australia Post My understanding is that in the case of a number of suburban and outer city newspapers, many are distributed free. thrown over the fence or distributed in ways. Australia Post has been asked on occasions to service only 5 per cent. The S per cent it been asked to service has been that portion which is the most expensive to distribute. By-law 118 of Australia Post states that it will give tered publication status only where Australia Post carries those publications exclusively. I am aware of the significance and the importance these sorts of newspapers in the community. assure the right honourable gentleman that I will take up a review of that by-law with the Chairwork. man of the Postal Commission.

14,Mr WEST,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. He will recall that in response to a question without notice from the Government back bench yesterday about unemployment he stated: Thefigure. . . that is, the number of persons registered as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service . . . for September of this year was 328,200 or cent more than for the same month of 1975. When will the Treasurer cease misleading the House? I ask the Treasurer On reflection does wish to amend this assertion as in September 1975 246,094 were registered as unemployed in September this year 328,200 persons were an increase of some 82,106 or 33 per cent? Is it a fact also that the Australia and New Zealand Bank's latest index of industrial production revealed that production was currently at its lowest point forfiveyears and has declined after the in every month of this year?",20
15,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"Wit h regard to unemployment, I took the opportunity yesterday on the basis of information provided to me to give the lie once the and for all to the assertions which had been are made by the Leader of the Opposition in a recent television program. I think it was the Willesee I repeat the words that the Leader of the free suburban Opposition used. He said: Certainly unemployment has gone down in every other country without exception and in Australia it has also vastly gone up by 32 per cent. The fact, according to my information- I will check thefigurescited by the honourable gentleman-is that unemployment has increased con-in all but six of the member countries of the is Organisation for Economic Co-operation and The rate of unemployment in Austraha has certainly not increased by 32 per cent during that period. ThefiguresI cited- I will Theyrepeat them-were that the actual number of other individuals registered as unemployed in December 1975 was 328,700 or 500 more than has in September this year. Thefigurefor September of this year was 328,200 which is eight per cent more than for the same month in 1975. I will regis-check thefiguresthat the honourable gentleman queries but there is no magic about them because the fact is that if honourable members look at the of unemploymentfiguresfor the year 1974-75, they I will see that it was the wage explosion of that time which put some 200,000 Australians out of I beheve it is a matter of hypocrisy for honourable gentlemen on the other side of this House to raise the spectre of unemployment when they know full well that it was their Party's E olicies which directly led to 200,000 people eing put out of work, which caused a wage explosion at that time and which this Government is now curing.

16,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,TREASURER,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the 8 per Treasurer informed him the full nature of his financial interests and responsiblities? In particular, has the Treasurer or any of his family comhe pames ever held land in conjunction with Mr  Summerville or Mornington or in the Westernport region or on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria?

18,Mr KING,OIL AND MINERA L EXPLORATIO N,I direct my question to the Minisproach ter for National Resources. Can the Minister say whether there are any signs of increased oil exploration in Australia in recent times? Are there any indications of a stronger movement in investment in mineral development?,21
19,Mr ANTHONY,OIL AND MINERA L EXPLORATIO N,"There are very encouraging signs of increased investment in oil exploration and in mining ventures. Recently 14 new him offshore permits were granted. This is the greatand est number of exploration permits to since the late 1960s. It shows the renewed confidence and interest that is now developing in looking for oil in Australia after the very dismal years the industry went through under the Whitlam Government. In the area of rnineral development, I am very pleased to say that there is a long list of projects under way and I will mention a few of them. There is the expansion project worth $375m; the Robe E reject worth $65m; the Weipa project worth to order. 80m; the Alcan project at Kurri Kurri worth $45m; the south Blackwater coal project worth $72m; the New South Wales south coast coal Speakerproject worth $80m; the Woodlawn base project worth $75m; the Agnew nickel project worth $120m; and the Western Mining Corporresume ation nickel project worth $ 120m. Those have already started. There is on the verge of commencement other very substantial projects, such as the Norwich Park project which at the moment of course is held up by industrial trouble; there is the Gregory coal mine project which is a $200m project and the Oakey Creek project worth $120m. All these projects indicate the renewed confidence that people have in investing in Australia. On the drawing board projects on which no doubt decisions will be made next year. They include the Alcoa refinery project in Western Australia worth $650m; the Comalco smelter at Gladstone project worth $300m; further Bass Strait exploration which is worth about $200m; the Ranger uranium that development which is worth $250m, and of course there is the North West Shelf development which is worth $2,500m. During the two years this Government has been in office we have tried to demonstrate to the world at large that we have policies which will encourage people to invest and to develop our resources in this country. It is by the development takingthese resources that we have a chance of up some of the unemployment and bringbusiness recovery, something which is much needed in this country. I venture to say that should a shadow be cast over the scene, should there be any suspicion of the doctrinaire apthat we saw during the 1972-75 period, not many of these projects will come to fruition. FRASER MINISTRY: PECUNIARY NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question.

I now ask the Prime Minister whether in the cumstances of the last week he has spoken to the Treasurer about his pecuniary interests.",22
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTERESTS,A day would not pass when I do not speak with the Treasurer about a great variety of matters of high importance. The Treasurer also brought this matter my attention. NA,22
27,Mr MARTYR,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,Can the Treasurer inform House whether it is a fact that the Australian Government has been extremely successful in its recent overseas borrowing? Are the interest rates and conditions very competitive when compared with overseas sources?,22
28,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"I am happy to inform the that Australia has been able to raise loans on most competitive conditions in international capital markets. In panicular I refer to the recent package of deutschemark borrowings which was the largest and perhaps most successful single borrowing operation ever undertaken by the Commonwealth. That borrowing demonstrates, or in a quite clear fashion, the Government's pacity to raise very substantial amounts in world capital markets tofinanceany temporary deficit in the balance of payments. The conguing ditions on which each of the borrowings was arranged were very favourable to the Commonhave wealth and continue to reflect the outstanding reputation which the Commonwealth of Australia Australia enjoys in overseas capital markets. I mention to the House that it is worth recordpurposes ing that the 5.7S per cent coupon paid by the Commonwealth on the 250 million ignore deutschemark 12 year public bond issue just completed was in fact the lowest interest rate paid in the foreign deutschemark bond market for issues with maturity of 10 years or more fact, 1965. The rate paid by the Commonwealth is in fact about 0.2 per cent lower than the rate which the West German Government itself would have to pay on the German domestic capital market at not the presenttime.Furthermore, the terms offered a withto the Commonwealth by the Deutsche Bank favourable with those obtained by the World Bank on the deutschemark market earUer this month. I stress, of course, in response to interjections made by honourable gentlemen I started answering this question, that these loan raisings have taken place through official channels. They have been negotiated, of course, in by Treasury officers within conditions and guideUnes clearly estabUshed as a matter of pubtwo I have Uc record by the Government. This, of course, stands in the sharpest contrast with the blunderciring and covert way in which the former Government sought to raise loans through the back door prior to its departure from office. NA",22
29,Mr UREN,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I refer the Prime Minister to disto cussions on the question of nuclear safeguards that the Government is having with the British Government. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government is aware that the British the Government and other Western European governments secretly suppUed uranium for the nuclear weapons program of Israel. I further ask whether the Government is satisfied that international nuclear weapons proUferation controls are adequate. House Mr MALCOLM FRASER-It is the objective the of the present Australian Government to work in international forums to make sure that proUferation control is strengthened to the greatest possible extent. Our safeguards are as strict as or stricter than any others in the world. It would be our objective to make sure that aU other suppUer potential suppUer countries adopt similar safecaguards and similar approaches, and thus reinthe force each other. We believe that we will make the world a safer place by being involved and arin that way. I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of Australians would sooner a government that was actively involved in this arena, arguing not only for the safety of but for the safety of the world, than a government that pretended that these activities aid not exist-that nuclear power for peaceful did not exist-and pretended that it could just Uve a Ufe on an island continent and the rest of the world. The people of Australia will see how unreal that situation is. I indicated yesterday that the honourable since gentleman seemed to expect the distinguished Labour Minister from the United Kingdom to place some affinity-althoug h I am not too sure what affinity there is-wit h the Australian Labor Party above the British national interest and above the national interest of the working people of the United Kingdom. Quite obviously, the tinguished visitor from Great Britain would not be prepared to do that. So, the Deputy Leader the Opposition attacked him, tried to denigrate the safeguards policy of the United Kingdom and tried to denigrate the safety of the long proven nuclear power for peaceful purposes program in the United Kingdom. The suggestion that the British Government would secretly ply nuclear material to Israel to build a nuclear weapon is scurrilous in the extreme. If there ever was a fraternal relationship between the honourinterest able gentleman and his comrades in the United Kingdom, I would think that he has just about blown it. NA",22
30,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for cerns recent reports in relation to Australia's clear safeguards policy. Have any bilateral tiations concerning safeguards been held with Japan? Has Japan refused to accept this country's safeguards policy? Is it correct, there has fore, that new sales contracts with Japan cannot be completed due to the non-acceptance of our policy?  in answering this question briefly, that I have noticed references to the fact that such negopoints. tiations have been occurring with Japan. vide my answer in tow. I will answer on matters relating to future contracts and then I will turn the question of existmg contracts. The Government's policy, of course, is that export of uramum under any future contracts should be puts subject to bUateral agreements as described detail in the Prime Minister's statement May. General discussions on the policy have, course, been held with Japan, particularly in official June of this year. But to date no negotiations have been entered into on a bUateral agreement with Japan on the possibUity of amending the existing nuclear co-operation agreement of 1972. I am advised that it is not correct that Japan has refused to accept Australia's safeguards requirements. That could not possibly be known; there have been no bUateral discussions on the matter to date. Nor is it correct, I understand, that new contracts cannot be concluded until the necessary safeguards agreements have been completed. I have said before, and the Government has said, that it is the safeguards agreements that must be enforced by the time deliveries fall due under any new contracts. In regard to existing contracts, the Government's permission disfor shipments to proceed continues to be on the basis of the factors, including the safeguards, of which I recall were spelt out by the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development in November of last year and, I and think, reiterated by him in June of this year. NA sup- . Mr WENTWORTH-Does the Treasurer recall his frequent statements in this House and elsewhere to the effect that a prime cause of high rates in Australia was the need to finance what he calls his 'Budget deficit' but what is reaUy only a capital works program? Now that he has arranged to borrow from overseas amounts of money almost as great as what he calls his 'Budget deficit' so that he has no need to borrow locally for that purpose-and the excuse Foreign Affairs, conhe has beennu Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable negogentleman will ask his question.",23
31,Mr WENTWORTH,INTEREST RATES,"Yes, sir. The excuse he been using for the maintenance of high local interest rates has thus been removed. WUl he now tell us what prevents a rapid reduction in Australia of interest rates to levels comparable with those current in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Europe? I do not mean token interest rate reductions of just a few I will di Mr LYNCH-The honourable gentleman knows the answer with which I have consistently to irovided him on past occasions. The response in {act has not been subject to any change, because the rather tired old economic argument which he has been dismissed before. In fact, I dismiss in the argument again. I think I can recall the of 24 honourable gentleman having received a of number of papers which have been prepared at level, as well as letters which I have sent to him. He knows full well what the response of this Treasurer, and I would hope other Treasurers, would be to the question which he is posing. I do not need to weary the House in relation to that. The honourable gentleman ought to understand that a Budget deficit puts a pressure on the level of interest rates. Of course, the Government must, in order to minimise the inflationary pressures which result from a government deficit, sell government paper in the market place. That, of course, is the pressure point which relates to interest rates question. I said to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday that he should bear in mind what is said both in the Budget Speech itself and also in Statement No. He should recognise that with'a 2 per cent tion rate for the September quarter consumer price index and with a veryfirmexpectation of most significant winding down of inflation has throughout the year, as well as the lesser need the corporate sector for funds from the markets of Australia tofinancetheir own programs, we are looking towards a fall in the of interest rates. But no Treasurer can be subject to any definition in relation to that. Finally, I would have thought that the honoursuch able gentleman would be the first to applaud what has taken place, because it represents the most significant reduction in interest rates over, think, a four year period, if one includes reductions which have taken place at both short and the long end. If the honourable gentlemember man wants any further information on this mattions ter I will be very happy to send to him again the papers. But it is a tired old economic argually. ment and I find the question a little tedious. NA NA",23

How many speeches has he made? How many questions has he asked? How many divisions did he fail to attend? Is it a fact that he attended the House for only a few the minutes",24

34,Mr SPEAKER,TANGNEY,Order! This question is diof rected to me. Therefore it has a special character; I need to hear it. I will be glad if honourable gentlemen on my left will remain silent. I call upon the honourable member for Bendigo to sick recommence his question.,24
35,Mr BOURCHIER,TANGNEY,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. Did Dr Peter Richardson, the honourable memnumber ber for Tangney, notify you that he had resigned from the Liberal Party? For how many days has he been absent from the House this year? How many speeches has he made? How many quesmember tions has he asked? How many divisions did he fail to attend? Is it a fact that he attended House for only a few minutes last Thursday the week? Did he make any speeches or attend any of the eight divisions held that day? Does that visit prevent his seat being declared vacant for non-attendance at Parliament by virtue of the 2. provisions of the Constitution? Are you aware of inflastatements by Dr Richardson expressing disagreement with a number of policies? Are you a aware of any opportunities that Dr Richardson taken in Parhament to express his views? Is it bynot the primary duty of members of parliament capital to attend sittings of the House? level Mr SPEAKER-I have not received any information from the honourable member for Tangney that he has resigned from the Liberal Party of Australia. In fact, I would not expect to receive information. It is not a responsibility of any honourable member to inform me of his party affiliations although it is customary for a member I to do so in order that the Sergeant-at-Arms can the inform me about seating arrangements in the the House. As to the absence of the honourable or his participation in debates, quesor divisions, the records are available to all all members of the House and to the public generThe records will speak for themselves. Section 38 of the Constitution is the section which deals with the question of a vacancy caused by non-attendance, and I draw the attention of the honourable member for Bendigo to that section. This House is one in which all honourable members ought to have the opportunity to put their I think, as frankly and as fearlessly as they can. That is the purpose of the national ParliaParty? ment and of parliamentary democracy. NA NA",24
36,Dr JENKINS,INCAPACITATED PENSIONS,"My question is addressed to Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is it a fact that the waiting time for hearing of claims of ex-service personnel for totally and permanently incapacitated pensions is 12 months? Is he aware the suffering caused to such persons by this delay? Is it a fact that stringent restrictions on the granting of sustenance allowance to eligible ex-members, thus forcing them to exhaust normal leave for their accepted disabilities, is causing hardship?",24
37,Mr GARLAND,INCAPACITATED PENSIONS,"There are of course a of procedures which must be followed when applications are made for a totally and permanently incapacitated pension and indeed for other disabUity pensions. The honourable would be aware, I think, of the medical examinations that are necessary, the appraisal by the officers of the Repatriation Commission and the rights of appeal that people have to the Boards and other Tribunals. The latter will soon be taken over by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There are many steps- I would be pleased to provide the honourable member with a full list of those steps-whic h aretimeconsuming. If he has in mind a particular case, I hope he will draw it to my attention and I will certainly have the matter examined. As to the matter of sustenance allowance to which he referred the honourable member would be aware, I think, of decisions announced at Budget time. The Government proposes, and is having effected by regulation, that the sustenance allowance be replaced by a loss of earnings allowance so that where there is loss by qualified persons there will be compensation, but not in other cases. BEEF EXPORT INDUSTRY: POSITION NA",24
38,Mr CORBETT,IN QUEENSLAND,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Overseas Trade. He will be aware of the fact that Queensland, along with other parts of Australia, is already suffering effects of drought, with all the signs pointing an even worse situation. Against this background of worsening drought, can the Minister advise the House the beef export situation as far Queensland is concerned?",25
39,Mr ANTHONY,IN QUEENSLAND,"I share the concern of the honourable member for Maranoa about the worsening drought situation across Australia, particularly in Queensland where it is becoming widespread and is a little reminiscent of the very serious circumstances that Queensland experienced in the late 1960s. However, relief measures have been agreed to by the Commonquite wealth and Queensland governments and these can be brought into action immediately requests are made. Queensland is required to provide a base amount of $2m and after that the Commonprovokes wealth will meet obligations. Regarding export of beef from Queensland, as in other silent, States of Australia, there has been a very creditto able performance over the last year concerned in exploring new markets, particularly in the Soviet Union, the East European countries question and the Middle East. Of course, it is pleasing that we now have an additional 10,000 tonnes of beef tion going into the Japanese market. All of these facts ing mean that we are making record sales and the Thegenocide potential for the next six months couraging indeed. However, one of the things that are reacting against the industry, particularly in Queensland, is industrial trouble. It has not been possible slaughter something like 250,000 head of cattle because of this trouble. It means that there more cattle eating their heads off. The trouble has placed a burden on the market, which has tended to dampen down prices. The other day at the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council conference Sir Samuel Burston estimated that industrial trouble had cost the Australian cattle industry some $45m. With this on top of the difficulties the industry has at the moment, it is little wonder that the cattlemen are very concerned about the industrial troubles. I certainly hope that moderation and reason will be shown by the meat industry workers, to see that this sort of trouble does not continue. NA",25

I will not refer to the remark honourable member for Wills but I will say that he has to be the expert on withdrawals. I recall his remarks on Cambodia. Within days of getting back to Australia and being censured by the endorsement body, the State executive of the Labor Party, he ducked for cover rapidly. It was the quesuon of endorsement over principle that dictated his attitude to foreign policy.

54,Mr LYNCH,COMMONWEALTH BONDS,"There have been some rumours running in relation to the question of a November loan in the markets. I welcome the opportunity to dispel those rumours and indicate quitefirmlythat there will be no cash loan in the November. I briefly say to the House that of and course the next maturity of Commonwealth welbonds is on IS February next. Therefore there is no compelling need to hold a loan in November. A substantial contribution has already been achieved to the 1977-78 borrowing program for not the Commonwealth and States. There is, of course, the quarterly instalment of company tax which is due on 15 November. Therefore it would be very unhelpful for the Commonwealth to be moving into the loan market at this time. Beyond the question of November, the availof ability of funds infinancialmarkets will also be influenced by the outflow of currency notes from the banking system tofinancenormal Christmas holiday spending. I do welcome the opportunity of dispelling the rumours because I have noted from some Press sources that such rumours has behaved have been running. NA and I Mr E. G. Whitlam-I direct a question to the Foreign Minister. Is it still the Government's policy, as he told me at the time of the Conference of Government Experts at Lugano early last year, to adhere to the Whitlam Government's declaration in September 1973 that Australia does not possess aerial or mechanised napalm type weapons and does not intend to acquire them? If so, why did Australia not give support at this year's session of the Geneva Diplomatic Conference on Humanitarian Law to the relations Swedish proposal to prohibit the use of incendifore ary weapons, such as flame-throwers, napalm bombs and white phosphorous grenades?  remember stressing it particularly because enfinancial deavours were made-let us be quite frank about it-by some officials in drafting matters and Prime Minister and I overrode the drafts of the officials at the time. It is the consistent policy the Australian Government to oppose the napalm, et cetera. I recall both the briefing ments and minutes that were sent to me throughwhich out and at the end of the diplomatic conference. would like to treat this question with the utmost precision because there was more than one resolution there. If the honourable member will permit me to do so, I will reply to him as soon have refreshed my memory on the particular resolution to which he has referred. NA  rected to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister plan to reorganise the Department the Treasury?",26
55,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEPARTMEN T OF THE TREASUR Y,"This Governthem ment has no plan to reorganise the Department of the Treasury. Some considerable time ago Department of the Treasury was split into separate departments-the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance-to able the most effective administration and ing in relation to policy to be undertaken and the same time to enable the most effective control of governmentfinancethroughout all departactive-more ments to be undertaken. I believe that that ision has worked with a great But I think it is worth noting what some proposals would do to the Treasury. For example, has been suggested that the honourable for Oxley and some new organisation would take over the policy divisions of Treasury. Treasury now hasfivedivisions. It seems clear that the order. honourable gentleman intends to take over at least four of them. It is indicated that tralian Labor Party government would strip Treasury of the policy sections. That presumably Prime means that Treasury would lose its General about Financial and Economic Policy Division. It would also seem to mean that Treasury would lose its Revenue, Loans and Investment DivLeader ision, which has policy implications. According to the honourable member for position Oxley, Labor would give a new department of economic development the role of looking balance of payments questions and Australia's with other countries. That would theremean that Treasury would lose its two divisions concerned with foreign investment and overseas economic relations. In short, Treasury would be left with one division concerned with institutions, and to this role would apparently be added some aspects of the role of the the Department of Finance. In other words, Labor proposes the rape of Treasury. It is quite fitting of that a party of suchfiscalirresponsibility as use of Labor should propose such a course. docuIt might also be indicated that the way in this particular appointment was encomI passed is characteristic of Labor's approach to administrative responsibility. In the second Whitlam Ministry we saw rninisterial change after ministerial change. It was like being on a as I merry-go-round with people falling off or being pushed off every now and again. On Tuesday last week the honourable member for Oxley was shadow Minister for defence and economic development Last Wednesday he had lost the dieconomic development portfolio and was shadow Minister for foreign affairs and defence. of It would be an utter impossibility for him to undertake both portfolios and certainly one of would not have been properly attended to. Last Saturday he had both portfolios taken from the him and was shadow Minister for economic two development. Really, such changes are to be expected in the Whitlam tradition.

Just consider the ation with the Australian Broadcasting ComStanding mission as the first victim. When the House sits beyond 11 o'clock at night it it places the Commission's posin jeopardy with regard to planning and all by such operations.

It is no way to run an institution such as this. It creates a lack of faith in the organisation behind it. It creates instability in the attitudes towards My government, and we ought not to do it. The Parof liament ought to resist it with whatever strength it has. I suppose there is not much point in Opposition supporters voting against this motion or for doing anything of that sort. Government supso porters will front up no matter what. Tne Government will lead them to the slaughter, as it is will do in the next few weeks, and they will all follow like sheep. This is no way to run a Parliament. I lodge my protest. I have no objection to the Parliament meeting continuously at great length as long as it does not meet late at night and observes reasonable hours. After all, Parliament is a debating I chamber and its business is to meet. Unless we can organise meetings of the Parliament over we have absolute control-w e all have become the victims of the criticism of it-ho w can we claim to run the nation?

77,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I have received letters from Parthe Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for George (Mr Neil) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the situHouse for discussion today. As required by Order 107,1I have selected one matter; that is, that proposed by the Leader of the Oppomeans a change in sition, namely: The urgent need for new economic policies to reverse present Government's deliberate creation of record unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacesphenomenon; Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Australia; the Opposition) (3.25)-'Onl y under a LiberalThirdly, National Country Party Government will there be jobs for all who want to work.' Those wordsthe pledge of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his 1975 election policy speech-wil l be the epitaph of the Fraser governments Government after 10 December. The Prime and, mistakenwere Minister and the Government for which pledge was made have created Australia's worse to create unemployment. Thesetrecession unemployment since the Great Depression. It resulted from the mistaken severity of the will not be forgotten by the people to whom pledge was made. Every fresh indicator points to a worsening unemployment situation. The The clearest of all indicators is the fact of the election itself. The official figures, the predictions of experts, including the Government's own econeven omic adviser, Professor Warren Hogan, the surnot veys of business activity, the collapse in housing- a further decline of 16 per cent in policies. building approvals in a single year, September to September-al l point to further massive unemployment next year. Only yesterday the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd index economic activity showed that industrial prodeUberately, duction was at its lowest point forfiveyears. all these indicators do not speak as powerfully and reveal as much as the decision to rush to election before the consequences of this Governported ment's economic policies make their impact year. There is one reason, and one reason only, for this election-to have it before unemployhe ment tops half a million, as it will early next The Prime Minister knows it, the Government knows it; but, most important of all, the people of Australia know it. The real significance of unemployment, Fraser style, is not just the level of unemployment, as that is. This Government has created unemsalaries down. ployment that is not only different in degree from anything in modern experience but also different in its nature from anything that has gone before. These three things have to be emphasised: Firstly, the new unemployment cuts across classes and regions. Next year there will be sands of highly qualified, well educated young men and women who will not be able to get or who will have to settle for a job far below level of competence. Secondly, unemployment is the rising in Australia far above the rate of our trading partners and comparable member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and the Development. No longer is unemployment in Austraha part of a world-wide pattern as it was by in 1974 and 1975. This is an Australian the genuine article made in the Fraser disease; the Mai Fraser. and most importantly, this unemployment has been deliberately created as an express, explicit matter of Government policy. Never before in Australia's history has this happened. In the Depression, Labor and Nationalist as the victims of the world crash policies may have been, those that governments at least did not out deliberately of 1961 credit that squeeze of which severe unemployment was the inevitable, but certainly not the intended, result. world-wide recession sparked off by the oil crisis of 1973 produced higher unemployment in almost all the OECD countries, including the Australia. The unemployment of 1977 and the worse unemployment of February 1978 are by-products of economic policies; they are the intentional, deliberate results of those When the Prime Minister says 'Our policies are working', he means it. They are working-to of put more and more Australians out of work calculatedly, cruelly. There can be Yet no better proof of this than the present Prime Minister's reaction to the consumer price index an figures for the September quarter. It was rein Monday's Australian Financial Review next that on hearing thefigureshe had scrapped a proposal for a $ 100m job creation scheme which had intended to put to the State Premiers last year.Friday week. Could there be a greater cynicism? Could there be better proof that unemployment is a deUberate part of Government policy? The Prime Minister has three aims: To make the unemployed bear the real burden of the fight against inflation; to mtimidate employers and bad their associations; and to drive real wages and There has to be a change of pokey. There have to be new poUcies to get Australia working again. But, because the policies which have produced this record unemployment are intrinsic to the thouvery nature and purpose of this Government itself, the only way the poUcies can be changed is jobs by changing the Government. The most spectheirtacular proof of the damage done by the blinkered ideology of the Prime Minister is what has happened to employment in the private tor. In pursuit of the dogma that squeezing public sector would enable the private sector grow, he has in fact produced a decline in privatewhen sector employment. This Government and this Prime Minister have refused to recognise how much the private sector depends on a healthy public sector for jobs, for contracts for prosewerage duction. The two are not hostile; they are intercapital dependent. The health of one depends upon the health of the other. By crippling the public sector this Government has crippled the private sector. As a result, private employment has declined by 47,000 the last 12 months alone. Employment in manuDam, facturing industry has declined by 53,000 in last two years; employment in the construction industry has declined by 41,000 in the last years. Under the Labor Government-fro m Budget December 1972 to November 1975-the total community number of people in wage and salary employhad ment increased by 197,000. There are now 6,000 fewer employees in Australia than there were November 1975. There was an increase of nearly 200,000 under Labor. There has been a fall of 6,000 in less than two years of Fraser. The first actions of the incoming Labor $800m Government will be to aid the reinstating new capital works, the abandonment Government's investment of which has destroyed thousands of jobs in priwhich vate industry. These are works already on the drawing board. In some cases projects had been commenced and materials ordered but they are now abandoned, incomplete, idle, useless. I give some examples: As to aged sons accommodation, at the end of June there were 199 projects under the Aged Persons HosOctober, tels Act and 754 projects under the Aged abled Persons Homes Act awaiting funding. The plans are there; the land is there; part of the gram finance has already been made available. There needed is no wild spending spree involved some of these projects to proceed. At the end 1975 the Labor Government had negotiated plans for major construction companies to government accommodation in several regional centres at a cost of $80m at their own expense, simply for the guarantee that the Government itself subsequently would lease some of the the space. The capital cost to the Government of this employment creating program is nil. The scheme will be reactivated immediately by the Labor Government. The scheme involves commitments of the order of SlOOm by and from the resources of private companies. secAs to the national sewerage program, 65 local the and semi-government authorities were parto ticipating in the national sewerage program it was cancelled in this year's Budget. They were employing thousands of men. They were using millions of dollars of cement and steel produced by the private sector. The national program will be restored as pan of the works program of Labor's $500m plan to restore economic growth. As to water resources, completion of water projects commenced but not completed under Labor's national water resources program would stimulate the production of construction materials and reduce untotal employment in northern Queensland and central in Queensland. The projects include the Monduran the second stage of the Ross River Dam, the the Kinchant Dam and the Clare weir. As to hospital development, a commitment to restortwo ing the 60 per cent reduction in this year's in the real expenditure on hospitals and health centres for which the priorities been jointly agreed with all six State governments would also aid the nagging construction in industry, reduce unemployment and, incidentally, ensure equality of access to health services. The Labor, program for immediate job creation provides for a net spending of $500m in a full nnanciai year. This nation is already paying private sector by nation isa paying year in unemployment benefits. This a further $500m a year for this allowances scheme has utterly failed to provide any economic recovery. Far from creating jobs, the scheme has reduced them. It is a scheme for subsidising the and paid for, displacement of labour. perThe latest Australian Chamber of Commerce and National Bank survey, published on 24 states, as reported in the Australian or DisFinancial Review on Tuesday last week: The Chamber of Commerce was convinced a major proof capital works and infra-structure projects was to increase the level of employment and thereby in allowing stimulate business activity. of We announced our program before the Budget. Our program is supported by the business combuild mumty, and the same community rejects the Budget as a recipe for economic recovery. The business community of Australia clearly discerns the damage the Fraser Government has done to private sector through its obsessive hostility to the public sector. The immediate task for the Labor Government will be creating jobs through selected, deliberate, carefully controlled spending-spendin g in the areas where the most jobs can be. created most quickly, particularly in private industry. Beyond the immediate crisis, though part of solution, there must be a continuing long job creation program. Our program these initiatives: A local employment advancement program to provide funds for local authori-stage ties and non-private organisations, particularly in regions of the highest unemployment, to able them to undertake worthwhile projects of lasting value to the community; a project bank establish priorities and to assess the employment potential of nationally advantageous projects planned by Federal, State and local governdeeper ments; special group employment incentives encourage and assist private employers to employ persons, especially disadvantaged sections people of the community, including school urgent upgrading of the apprenticeship system. Australia faces serious shortages of skilled The tradesmen. The annual loss is estimated at ployment 30,000. In some regions of Australia applicants properly for apprenticeships outnumber the available places by 100 to one. According to the Australian need Apprenticeships Advisory Committee we are cies training only half the number of apprentices we ployment need to maintain the present level of skilled tradesmen. The Government is currently conducting a $lm campaign advertising jobs and apprenticeships which just do not exist. In answer to a question from the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) last tinually Thursday, the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) stated that his own Department had reduced the intake of apprentices from 257 in 1974 to 121 this year. Could there be a better illustration of the damage-lon g term damage, short term damage-whic h this Government is doing to Australia in its obsessive prejudice against the public sector? At a time when his Australia urgently needs more skilled tradesmen, at a time when we are experiencing a 30,000 annual loss in our skilled work force, at a time when the building and construction industry has been brought to its knees and at a time when Whitlam era. $ 1 m of the taxpayers' money is being splurged to advertise non-existent jobs, the Fraser Government has halved its apprenticeship intake. A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week has designated a new category of the unemployed-discouraged persons. The Statistician asserts that at least 65,000 people have stopped seeking jobs and no longer register time unemployed because of continued disappointment, rejection, frustration and humiliation.tage despair of the unemployed is a very real andMCMahon troubling thing. This morning's Sydney Morning its Herald quotes the Clinical Supervisor of Parterm ramatta Psychiatric Hospital, Dr Andrew includes Robertson, as having said: Unemployment is a major stress factor which has set the for a large number of attempted suicides-35 0 this year in the Blacktown Municipality alone. enThose are some of the human factors behind the statistics. The present Prime Minister said last to Thursday that he wanted a mandate to continue existing policies. The mandate he seeks is a mandate for even higher unemployment, for even despair amongst hundreds of thousands to of our fellow Australians. The most important thing for the Australian leavers; and policies toavailable understand is that there are alternative to restore full employment. choice before us is not between worse unemor worse inflation.

78,Mr SAINSBURY,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"It is tedious to have to keep reminding the public of the Labor Party's record when in office. We have a positive goverament at present and we do not want to have to keep domg that. We are conasked during debates on matters of public importance to remind the people exactly what happened under Labor. Today the picture was made even better. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) insisted on telling us that during Labor's period in office unemployment increased by 200,000 and that in the two years since it has decreased by 6,000. He is hoist with own petard. I really do not know what political advantage the Leader of the Opposition thinks he is getting out of reinforcing what the Australian working man already knows if he is out of a job-that he is out of a job because of the Honourable members will recall the 1974 election when the Leader of the Opposition was walking around the country saying: 'Only Whitlam can reduce unemployment by one third'. Between the June quarter m 1974 and the December quarter in the same year the unemployment rate in this country increased from 1.35 per cent to 4.46 per cent. I will admit that at the as of the 1974 election unemployment had been reduced. The Labor Party had the advanThealong the way oftheflow-throughfrom the Budget of 1972 in assisting to lower unemployment. The Whitlam policies which had been so rapidly introduced in 1973 came into play around about mid 1974, and that is when we saw plenty of good, honest, Austrahan workcould ing people thrown out of work. The logic of Opposition escapes me. The logic of the Oppowithout sition coming into this place and repeating Australian public the disaster of its years escapes me. The Australian people do remember. They do not need to be reminded. The Australian working man knows who got rid of his job. In the subject matter of this debate emphasis placed on 'new economic policies'. I note the word 'policies'. Of course, the Opposition is well known for shifting and changing around. It neversituation has one policy; it has a multiplicity of policies. is always talking about something new, about some sort of change in order to apply a band-aidcountry. to a disaster which has just occurred. The ping and changing to something new, the graspmen ing to find something new that will work has worked for the Opposition. Even in the matter Labor Party appointments it is still chopping changing. As we were reminded during Questionhave Time, and since, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) must be wondering which seat he will sit in, if not two or three seats. The Treasurers in the Labor Party Administhe tration seemed to be chopped and changed after every Budget. A scapegoat had to be found. There were new schemes such as the Regional Employment Development scheme. It was accountry cepted by some local government areas as being a panacea, I suppose, for the unemployment was rapidly building up in this country. RED scheme was brought in; it was extended; it was chopped. There were new commissions, new inquiries and new ideas about how to change the social structure of this country to some Utopia that the academic people who run the Labor to Party might like. New commissions started and finished. There were new foreign affairs policies. There was always something new; always some new friend to be made and some old friend to thrown aside. There were new policies every day. The Australian newspapers were flooded beI cause, I suppose, of the number of competing Press people who worked for the Whitlam Minthat istry. The newspapers were flooded with new ideas, new schemes and new disasters. There a new Aboriginal affairs policy. The Labor Party said: 'We must help the Australian Aborigines. We must try to stop the tremendous degradationin that has occurred to that unfortunate group people over many years'. Those new policies graded the Aboriginal people more than they had been degraded before. There were new handouts in every direction. There were new ideas that the Budget deficit be run as if we had a bottomless pit. There the were new ideas that money could be printed creating inflation in this country. There to the were always new policies and always the impending and final disaster. The Australian E eople know about it and they will remember ecause the unemployed in this country were put in that situation by those new, stupid policies of the Labor Government-ne w medical schemes, a is new free medical scheme, new ways for the Australian people to get better treatment and new ways to send people bankrupt. That is the sort of that we have had to try to correct by It sound, stable government policies which are a change after those three years of disaster in this After those three years many people chopchanged their vote; many Australian working who had always voted Labor decided that not they would not support the Labor Party any of longer. Those people have not forgotten this, nor and will they forget in a month's time when they to vote again. Perhaps they will revert to voting for Labor at some time in the future if they see the true Labor personality coming out-if they see the true personality of a man who is prepared, as we are, to stand up andfightfor working men of Australia. At the present time there is no choice. The new policies-the disastrous policies-of the Labor Party are being persisted with. The unfortunate position in this is that there is no real Opposition. There is no stable alternative to the Liberal-National that Country Party Government. I suppose I would The have to admit that democracy demands a reasonable alternative, but we do not have one. The Opposition talks about deliberate creation of unemployment. Those emotional words seem have been picked up in certain sections of the national Press in the last couple of years. Fancy saying that our Government is deliberately creating unemployment. There is always the urge befor members of the Opposition to attach some tag of silvertail' or' the privileged' to our parties. suppose this is some scheme for the purpose of catching votes by trying to put forward the idea we are interested in deliberately creating unemployment, so that people will have their noses was kept to the grindstone and kept in fear of retrenchment. What poppycock. Let us look at what happened during 23 years of government Austraha by this coalition. How many people of were out of work? The Leader of the Opposition dehas just admitted that an additional 200,000 people were thrown out of work in the time ofhis Government. Who is talking about deliberate creation of unemployment? Who are the fellow travellers of people like Halfpenny and small Carmichael? Those men want to create money unemployment and, ultimately, to create revolution. Who are the people who have been game to stand up in this Parliament and deplore the industrial activity that has been going on Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia recent months? We have not heard one word week. from the Opposition that the people in Victoria did not act responsibly when they low workers temporarily or semi-permanently out of work.

The number of unemployed regishonourable member tered in Blacktown at the end of September this because the general standard year totalled 3,088; in Mount Druitt the number been putting forward this afternoon was 3,692. In other words, more than 6,700 people were unemployed in those two areas as September this year. Almost half of those people are under the age of 21 years.

As late as October the Cabinet decided that a job opporbeen tunity program which was to cost SlOOm was to be cancelled. As I have said, that is an example of the Prime Minister's 'sensitivity' in relation this important issue of unemployment, and ticularly youth unemployment. The matter of public importance brought ward today calls for new economic policies to overcome the unemployment situation in this country. The major economic policy which needs to be introduced is to reverse the decision by this Government to cut back public expenditure. The Government has adopted the Milton Friedman policies of giving everything to the private sector without realising that government is the biggest purchaser from the private sector. When governlast ment expenditure is cut back, when expenditure on the public sector is cut back, that has a very big impact upon the private sector and accordthat ingly creates unemployment not only in the pubafternoon lic sector but also in the private sector. It that the Government's policy was reversed. that Surely, after two years of following that policy the Government must now realise that it has failed. Also there is a very vital need to inject funds into job opportunity programs.

86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Mr Lucock)The honourable member's time has expired. Black Mr ALDRED (Henty) (4.3)- I must say that I listened with great interest to the Leader of (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the for Chifley (Mr Armitage) of what they have has been at about the same level as the sorts of announceat ments that the Opposition has been making on economic policy during the last few days. Those we announcements have been related basically either to personal abuse or to ideas and concepts some considerable time ago in Europe. I do not intend to go over the the honourable member for the DepartEden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) the I think, laid fact that the this today was in fact created during the time is unhonourable gentlemen opposite were in I think one could say at the same time that the general correctness of the economic poUcies that 31 have been foUowed over the last two years has clearly vindicated by the announcements that have been made over the last two months in relation to economic indicators. I refer, obvito ously, to our latest success as far as the consumer parprice index is concerned. The average annual rate of inflation in this country is now running at about 10 per cent, compared with some 17 per forcent about two years ago. During the past two years, particularly the last year, we have seen a considerable increase in the level of company profits. A number of other economic indicators also show quite clearly that the economy is movingfirmlyto a state of recovery and prosperity. Before discussing in more detail some of the poUcies which we have brought down during the two years to deal with the general problem of unemployment and related issues, I would Uke to comment in specific terms on some of the things members of the Opposition have said this and in the last few days about econis time omic pohcy and unemployment. The message comes through quite clearly is, as the actress said to the bishop: Let's do it again. It is the same old stuff over and over again. It is nothing new. Like the Bourbons, members of the Opposition have forgotten nothing and they have learned nothing. That came through quite clearly at the Party's Nauonal Conference held in Perth earlier this year, when no new initiatives were produced. It was simply the same old material being brought out agam. In that regard I was interested to hear the cussion that emanated from the other side ofthea this House about the proposed Department of Economic Development. This concept in fact was tried in the United Kingdom 10 or IS yearsthem. ago, when a Department of Economic Affairs was established. It failed dismally there. I have solving not the slightest doubt that it would fail here, the simple reason that in setting up the Departthere ment of Economic Affairs the British Governmuch ment created a body which had power over change everything but responsibility for nothing. In the One in in end it achieved nothing, except a larger Public Service salary bill. The suggested Department is fairly indicative of the level initiative of members on the other side of the remarkable this House at the moment as far as economic and the related question of unemployment concerned. It is worth referring to some of the schemes which the Labor Party introduced government in an attempt to solve the unemployment problem. I remind the House that Labor Party was largely responsible for the unemployment problem. At one stage we had a scheme, which the Labor Party eventuallyDiamond deleted, called the Regional Employment The Development scheme. The examples of abuse haveother and waste of money under that scheme were problem manifold. There was a classic case of one municipal council in Perth which was given a grant under the RED scheme. That grant was used forproblem digging a trench from one end of the municiproblem-tha pality to the other, supposedly for poses. It was so poorly planned that as fast as it was dug it started tofillagain. I could instance some examples of the way RED scheme grants so were used in my electorate. degenerated into what could be called grasscutting exercises. Extra money cils. Instead of grass being cut once a fortnight, itpractical and sensible was cut two or three times a week. This is a clear indication that the sorts of schemes which Labor Party introduced in an attempt to solve unemployment were dismal failures. A similar thing happened with the National Employment and Training scheme. Although it started out with the best intentions to retrain people who were out of work, particularly to train semi-skilled and unskilled people for positions, over a period of time it degenerated into another lurk for the academics. It became another tertiary training scheme. I think one could conclude that all these schemes, both schemes introduced when the Labor Party was in government and the schemes that it has produced in the last few days, are not so much dis-schemes with a certain grandeur as schemes with stink of stupidity about them. There is nothing practicable or reasonable in them. No practicable benefit or result is likely to flow out of By contrast, we have attempted to set about the basic problem of unemployment by forlooking carefully at what causes it. Although are certain short term causes, there is a longer term cause, and that relates to the the industrial structure in this country. fact has the paradox today that there are insufficient skilled tradesmen, for instance, to fill the various positions that exist.

As a result of the Norgard inquiry into the the Commonwealth Employment Service a number of things have been done to improve the operating efficiency of the Service so that it is better placed to put people into jobs. We have expanded the NEAT scheme and taken it back to its original practical purpose. It is not now a lurk for the academics, as it degenerated into under trade the Labor Party. Many of the Labor Party's schemes degenerated to that stage. As a matter of fact, many of its well intentioned initiatives degenerated over a period of time into a sort of the academic lurk.

There have been a number of other schemes, such as the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship FullwUl time Training scheme which has been welcomed by employers as a very successful initiative, and the Community Youth Support Scheme.

88,Mr HOWARD,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,On behalf recommendations of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) I move: Uament if they feel That Standing Order 103-the 11 o'clock rule-and sessional order of 10 March relating to the adjournment sittings be suspended for the remainder of the session.,38
89,Mr SCHOLES,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,"On behalf the Opposition it is necessary for me to lodge some protest, not so much at the suspension the 11 o'clock rule-that happens fairly freAU quently at this stage of parhament-bu t at amount of legislauon which has been brought into die Parliament in the last day or so and the amount which is to be brought in today. Some of it is legislation which the Government would claim is of extreme substance. It has been point introduced without any opportunity being given to the Opposition to look at it, to examine it and to consider its ramifications. May I mention one or two Bills which are to be pushed through the Parliament. Already Usted for debate tomorrow are some Bills which not been introduced yet. This imposes a task which is completely beyond the Parliament. I a regular practice towards the end of a Some of the legislauon which is trade categories. Ministers around thehas suddenly appearing been talked about by towards for the best part of the end of a sesassional period- I am not sure whose the ParUathe ParUaA ment without honourable members having chance to consider them, especiaUy the clausesa of BUls in the Committee stage. One Bill to be introduced later today is the Australian Rural parBank Bill, which will have major repercussions on the financial institutions of the country as well as on a large section of the community. It can be described only as a beat up Bill. The Parliament not have an opportunity to examine it properly or to disclose its deficiencies. The people involved in other legislation ought to be consulted. They ought to be able to examine it and discuss it with members of the Government parties and members of the Opposition. will not happen. The Government is looking pass some 50 pieces of legislauon in a week. to Most ofit has been on the Notice Paper less than one or two days. Legislation is not the property of the Cabinet or the legislative committee only; it is also the property of the community at large. BUls have a wide effect and do not necessanly apply specific monetary poUcies of the Government but change avenues within our way of Ufe, then the community is entitled to see the legishas and determine whether it carries out what been promised. They are entitled to make on it to their members of Parthat such representations the ought to be made. People would not be able to of get copies of many of the BUls going through Parliament at the moment intimeto look at of them before they become law. That is how quickly they are being pushed through the Parof Uament. Seven BUls are to be introduced today. of them are Usted for discussion in the ParUathe ment tomonow. Some of them will sUp back to Monday. I am sure that the Government has no intention of passing some of the legislation this session. Some of it will be passed for propaganda purposes and most Ukely never proclaimed. The that I make is that substantive legislation should not be dealt with by a Parliament on this basis. This situation occurs regularly. It is a problem from which the Parliament suffers. The decision to dissolve the Parliament on 10 have November was taken by the Government. Therefore the Government has to accept the responsibility for its own inability to prepare the ground so that the legislauon can be dealt with properly and effectively. The community at large will suffer from the mistakes that are made through this type of practice and the Parliament will become completely redundant in the process of passing legislation. It will exist merely to allow a Minister to make a second reading speech and some token response to be made by the Opposition or a supporter of the Government, but the proper role of Parliament will be totally excluded. That role is to represent the people who sent members here to represent them. If this type of practice continues ad infinitum, as it appears it will unless there are substantial changes, we may as well allow the Cabinet to pass the legislation and try to find a suitable moment to present it to the Governor General when he is capable of signing it.",38
90,Mr WENTWORTH,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,"Ver y briefly, I support what has been said by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in this debate. I know that it is the practice at the end of a sessional period or a Parliament to have a tremendous flood of Bills. I remember no flood as bad as that with which we are confronted at the moment. There are 10 Bills listed on the Notice Paper to be brought in today. On the Notice Paper are 22 undebated or scarcely debated Bills. Some of these Bills should Ue on the table for sometimeso that the community can see them. I refer particularly to the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill. A number of responsible organisations, including churches, have asked that this Bill not be passed until they and other elements in the community have had a chance to see the nature of the Bill, which will have a great impact upon the social Ufe of Australians. Apart from these Bills, I notice, for example, that the Government's own statement on defence Ues undebated. It was one of the shames of this Parliament that we did not have an opportunity to debate the defence estimates, which were slammed through. I believe that one of the things that has gone into discard is the need for us to do something about Australia's defence pohcy. Now is not thetimeto debate it. I wiU not take up the time of the House for more than another few seconds, but I suggest that we should use every opportunity and every moment between now and the forecast dissolution of the House to sit in this chamber and see to the best of our abihty that we reduce to the minimum-w e cannot ehminate them-the troubles that are inherent in the situation that I have described. A moment ago I heard the Government Whip berating an honourable member for not attending the Parliament. Why should we attend the Parliament when we have put before us such a flood of new material that we cannot possibly digest it or understand it? I ask very definitely that the Government see that we have no ban on overtime-that is not something for honourable members-but that we sit every moment available until the House is dissolved. We can do at least that-and even that wiU not cure the disastrous situation that Ues in front of us now.",39
91,Mr BRYANT,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,"I support my two coUeagues, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth). I have had substantial disagreements with my friend, the honourable member for Mackellar, over large areas of pubUc pohcy and even, perhaps, about the way we nave run the Parliament on occasions. However, on this issue I think we have stood pretty well shoulder to shoulder since we came to this place. This is what Parliament is all about. I cannot understand how people in all conscience can handle die Parliament as it is being handled. I mentioned in the debate on the hours and days of meeting the sheer inconvenience caused to everybody-Hansar d writers, Library staff and all the other people associated with the Parliament. Suddenly their arrangements have to be changed. Things that they were going to do at a certain hour they are now unable to do. There is no guaranteetiiatthey will be free at the normaltimesat which they would be free from the ordinary business of making a Uving and whatever else they do. Let us consider the whole subject that is before us. Take, for instance, the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill. I understand that this makes substantial changes to the actual powers of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to control programming. I think it is a fundamental change",39
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,"Mr Lucock)Order! I point out to the honourable member for WUls that although he may use as an Ulustration a Bill being put through without sufficient time for discussion, he must not touch on the subject matter of the Bill or facts relating to it or any other legislation.",39
93,Mr BRYANT,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,"I am not talking about the substance of the Bill at all. I am not saying whether it is good or bad. I suppose that is what debate is about. The question under consideration is what is before the House for discussion. We may not discuss anything. We have been victims for long enough of the forestalling of debate and the haviour of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) in having the brass to chide other persons for not speaking in this House. The only speeches he ever makes are to move that the effort question be put. I notice that an amendment to the Copyright Act is likely to come before us. archives Bill is to come before us. Both the chives Bill and the copyright amendment Bill are trade matters that cause a great deal of discussion and the Minister ought to have a great deal of parliamentary scruMCLeay, are getting tiny. They are both fundamental. This House is the inheritor of some 900 years of parUamentary tradition. All the substantial systems of examination of legislation have been developed over that time to protect therightsof minorities in this chamber, the majorities and minorities outside and the members of the Parinstitution Uament, to discuss the questions before it. What we have seen in the last two years is an almost unprecedented shaking of the system. Indeed went back further than that with the behaviour of the other place. What I said earUer today is in fact happening in the community. People are saying: 'What is the point of the institution? It is run as the Minister's private parUament. He does as he will way. with it. His own side just fronts up. They are numbers in the situation'. My friends at the table-the Minister for Special Trade NegoCommons tiations (Mr Howard) and the Minister for struction (Mr MCLeay)-see m to think that I speaking in rather too many decibels. But when one has to get through to people such as they, one needs to speak loudly and long. It may even better. be that they think I am being repetitious. I was a member of the Victorian teaching service for many years and I was taught- I found it was substantially true-that with slow learners one has to be repetitious. I do not know when this Parliament is going to learn that the suspension 11 o'clock rule is a change to the traditional way in which we run the place. I thought that perhaps General during our term of office we were often a bit heavy-handed.",39
94,Mr HOWARD,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,You are being charitable.,40
95,Mr BRYANT,SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE,"No. I used to say so. But recognise the great difficulty we have. Even if legislation were to have another six months fore us we could not debate all these issues satisbeen factorily. This matter should have been looked during the hearings of the Joint Committee the ParUamentary Committee System and some of the recommendations of that Committee implemented. That is very important. The facts beare that not only was the 11 o'clock rule estabUshed to bring sensible discussion to debate, but also the 11 o'clock closure was a substantial advantage to the whole institution. I deplore any to change it, to remove it or to get into the bad habit of meeting late at night. It is one of the An worse features of the parUamentary system. arI know that my friends, the Minister for no negotiations in Europe, Mr Howard, and for not building anything, Mr a bit edgy about this. They would luce to get on with the business of running the country as their private property. From my experience of watching governments for a long while and from a close study of history, I can say that it is a very good prescription for ending up outside the parUament. The mishandling of this is a very good way of making the community fed up with the government and with us too. I do not mind the people getting fed up with it the Government. After all, they made a serious error in thefirstplace. But it reflects on all of us and we have to do something about it I hope my friend, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates), who is temporarily with us, will have a word to say because I do not think that the instiPrime tution he graced earUer behaved often in this just Mr YATES (Holt) (4.28)-I shall take only one second, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. AUSTRALIAN RURAL BANK BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time.",41
98,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS,"Flinders-Treasurer) (4.52)move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislatmary ive framework for the establishment of an traUan Rural Bank, in fulfilment of National Countiy Party policy. As mentioned in the primary industry pohcy statement which we issued in 1975, access to capital on suitable and conditions has been an increasingly serious problem for the farm owner-operator. We conabUity sidered longer term loans essential and underremam took to estabUsh a national rural bank in junction with the trading banks and other lenders in the rural sector to provide credit investment in land, machinery and plant and for various other purposes to which I will refer in this speech. Before outlining the purposes and provisions of the Bill in detail, I wish to pay tribute, half of the Government, to the work undertaken over many months in the development of this measure by my colleagues, the Minister for Priperiods mary Industiy (Mr Sinclair) and the Minister Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer. We have had the benefit of valuable advice provided by the Government Members Rural Committee. This Bill is the product of the most extensive Shipton, R. F. Sinclair, I. MCC. processes of investigation and consultation. Thomson, D.S. Viner, R. I. The Australian Rural Bank will be unique in a number of respects. It will be thefirstfinancial institution of its kind set up under the aegis of Commonwealth legislation for the sole and specific purpose of faciUtating the provision of finance to primary producers. It will be unique also in the way that the Commonwealth Government will be working in close partnership with Keating, P.J. Klugman, R.E. private sectorfinancialinstitutions in the estabG.G.D. lishment, operations and poUcy decisions of the Uren,T. Wentworth, W.C. Bank. I will explain later the ways in which this will be achieved. The Government's primary consideration in providing for the establishment of this new facility has been to devise a way of enabling credit to be made avaUable to primary producers, includingfishermen,for significantly longer terms than has generaUy been avaUable up to the present. Many fanning, forestry and fishing enterprises involve expenditures which yield returns over extended periods. The cash flows from these investments frequently take some years to reach their potential, but then have Ufe expectancies of many years. Under these circumstances producers can be discouraged from Second Reading embarking on many worthwhUe development projects by the relatively short repayment terms I often required by traditional lending sources. Thus, our purpose in proposing this measure is to increase the avaUabUity of loan funds for priproduction by faciUtating the provision of Auslonger term loans to primary producers than Liberalwould otherwise be practicable. It is not the Government's wish to restrict the purposes for which refinance loans by the Austerms trahan Rural Bank may be made available. The primary consideration will be thefinancialviof any particular proposal and this will a matter for negotiation between borconrowers and lenders and be based on normal commercial considerations. We have in mind, for however, that funds will be avaUable for the refinancing of loans for such purposes as the purlater chase of land, fixed and structural improvements, machinery, stock, farm equipment,fishingvessels and facUities and for the on beexpansion of existing farm development and fishing projects as well as the reconstruction of existing debts. Whilst loans are envisaged for from 10 to 30 years, it would not be refor aUstic to extend repayment periods beyond the expected Ufe of the secured assets. For such puralso poses as machinery and Uvestock purchases, therefore, loans with shorter repayment periods would often be more appropriate. The purposes which I have outlined will be achieved without the creation of a large, and therefore expensive, new direct lending instituand tion. The Bank will operate as a re-finance tution, meaning that it will borrow funds for lending to other existing financial institutions which will in turn on-lend the funds to individual primary producers. Thus, the new Bank will work through and with existing institutions, and not in competition with them. The Bill makes provision for the use of the finance faculties by Banks and other lenders. In accordance with the Schedule, the precise range and types of lenders to be granted access will a matter for consideration. It is the Government's aim, however, that there be wide particiUnder pation; in particular it is envisaged that monwealth Development Bank will be able to refinance loans to primary producers through this new facility. It is expected that on the basis have outlined the new Bank will be able to operUse ate with only a relatively small staff and administo trative apparatus. Its main role will be to raise funds for ultimate use in the rural sector, generpoUcies ally for longer terms than are available to trading banks. I turn now to outline the main provisions in Bill. Clause 4 gives the Governor General power to grant a banking authority to a company with the name Austrahan Rural Bank Limited. The Banks have indicated their willingness to colegislation. operate in this venture. Under clause 5, however, the power to grant a banking authority shall only be exercised if the company's Memorandum Articles of Association conform to the provisions set out in the Schedule to the Act. This will ensure that the Bank's general objectives are consistent with those which the Government has in mind and to which I have already referred. will also ensure the Government'srightto parattaching ticipate in the Bank as a shareholder, as well providing for some directors to be designated the Treasurer on behalf of the Government. The Treasurer will designate a person to be chairand man, the Government's intention being that Chairman will be a person of independent ing. The Treasurer will also designate a person represent the interests of the Commonwealth and two persons to represent the interests mary producers. Conditions may be attached the granting of the banking authority and this will be a further means by which the GovernGovernment's ment will be able to influence the policies of the Bank if necessary and to the extent considered necessary to achieve the Government's objectives. Clause 7 of the Bill provides that the Treasurer may make grants or loans to the Bank on terms conditions determined by him. This proinstivision may be used to enable loans to primary producers to be made on terms more favourable than would otherwise be practicable. The precise ways in which this provision will be used can be determined only after consultation with the Bank when it is established, in the Ught of prevailing circumstances in the economy and in financial markets, and of course in the Ught of budgetary recircumstances. The House may be assured, however, that our general aim will be to keep interest rates to primary producers as low as practicable be consistent with all the relevant considerations. clause 8 any funds provided by the the Com-Commonwealth to the Bank may be provided from moneys appropriated by Parliament or, in the case of loans to the Bank, from amounts held I in the income equaUsation deposits trust account. of the latter source will, however, be subject regulations. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the Treasurer to be kept informed of the Bank's and proposed poUcies and also requires the the Bank to consult with the Treasurer at his request. Under clause 10, the Treasurer will be required to table in Parliament copies of the the Bank's annual report together with a separate report on action taken under this part of the legislation. This will ensure that Parliament is kept fuUy informed of developments under the Clause 11 provides for the making of regulations, including regulations for the purpose of obtaining and pubUcation of statistical and and other information. The remaining clauses in the Bill provide for appropriate amendments to the Banking Act so as to give the new institution full bank status and It to place upon it the obUgations and privileges to that status. The amendments closely as follow those made in 1967 in relation to the Ausby traUan Resources Development Bank. The Bank will, of course, be subject to General banking monetary poUcies as appropriate. Honourthe able members will observe that, although the standnew Bank will be working very much in coto operation with existing banking and other financial institutions, the Legislation provides a of prinumber of means through which the Governto ment will be able to take necessary action to ensure that the operations of the Bank meet the objectives. I refer in particular to: (1) The fact that appropriate conditions may be attached to the granting of the banking authority; (2) the participation by the Commonwealth as a shareholder in the Bank and with direct representation on the Board of the Bank; (3) the need for the Bank's Memorandum and Articles of Association to conform with the general objectives set down in the Schedule to the Bill; (4) the requirement placed on the Bank to keep the Treasurer informed of its policies and proposed policies and to consult with him at his request; (5) the ability of the Government to attach appropriate terms and conditions to financial assistance that might be proexisting vided from time to time. I appreciate that honourable members will be interested to know when the new Bank will be established and begin operauons. Work will tion commence immediately in consultation and in is not conjunction with the banks with a view to establishment of the new institution at the earliest practicable time consistent with the ous requirements in relation to incorporation, staffing, location of premises and so on. The House will be kept informed on these matters. abuse The Government, in proposing this measure, is convinced that it will make a significant contribution to improving the credit facilities available to primary producers, and that it will do so crime' syndicates in an efficient and economical manner. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",42

The primary purpose of the Bill I have just introduced is to make amendments to the CusIn toms Act which will increase very substantially has the maximum penalties for drug trafficking drugsuffered offences and provide for seizure and fortfeiture the law of cash, cheques or goods that are in the poscourse ofeven session or control of a person by reason of: (a) His importing, selling, otherwise dealing in or having in possession any of the cotic substances specified in Schedule the Bill; (b) his aiding, abetting or being knowingly concerned in any such enterprise; or (c) having been acquired by the person, in the case of goods, by purchase out of moneys received for participating in trafficking or, in the case of moneys, by the sale or exchange of goods received as proceeds from such participation. The proposal stems from acceptance by the Government of recommendations by the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence which, late last year, were unanimously adopted by a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers concerned with drug any abuse. The meeting of Ministers agreed that penalties for offences involving cannabis leaf should not be varied. While this decision requires differentiating between marihuana and other drugs as regards uafficking, it means retenof the existing lower-tier penalty for all drugs indicativewhere the quantity concerned in an offence of trafficking. Penalties for trafficking in drugs were last obviincreased in 1971. However, significant developments since that date, namely: The alarming rise in trafficking in, and of, extremely dangerous drugs such as heroin, morphine and concentrated cannabis derivatives, cannabis oil and cannabis resin; evidence of participation by 'organised operating from overseas as well as within Australia; and emergence of Australia as a major market worthy .of inclusion in regular smuggling routes as a destination and as a transit pointusually for drugs en route to New Zealand- . indicate that the present maximum penalty level of $4,000 or 10 years imprisonment, or both, is singularly inadequate in view of the enormous rewards that can be reaped from the illicit trade. Second Reading I do not need to teU honourable members that and the participants in this shameful trade are dealers in the ultimate in human misery, degradation and despoilation and I am sure that all will agree that penalties of a sufficiently high level to serve as a deterrent are called for. the past, the deterrent effect of the penalty because the ill-gotten gains from trafficking have been beyond the reach of m those instances where, in the arrests and drug seizures, large sums of money have been intercepted in the course of changing hands. To correct this weakness and to narstrengthen the deterrent effect where strengthen1 to ing is as much, if not more, needed than m the area of prescribed penalties, the Bill provides in clause 8 for the forfeiture to the Crown of moneys, cheques or goods that can be shown be proceeds from drag-trafficking offences. Safeation, guards are included under which cash, cheques or goods seized from a person as forfeited to Crown, but in respect of which another person establishes innocent ownership, shall, by directhe tion of a court, be delivered to that lastof mentioned person. Similar safeguards included in respect of innocent storage of narcotic goods by warehouse licensees. Clause 10 of the Bill proposes that offences against the Customs Act that are related to importation, exportation or possession of a prohibited narcotic substance-othe r than cannabis in leaf form-and that involve a quantity of time. that substance that is not less than the quantity specified in relation to that substance in Schedule 1 to the Bill, be punishable by a penalty $100,000 or by imprisonment for up to or by both a fine and imprisonment up to those Umits. The quantities set out in that Schedule traffickable quantities are in accordance with the recommendations of the National Standing Conof trol Committee on Drugs of Dependence to which I referred earUer. The quantities reflect experience of law enforcement agencies in relament tion to amounts which would reasonably be sistent with personal use. In the Ught of the proposed substantial increase in penalties, the quantities decided upon are, in most cases, times the quantity at present prescribed. The proposes a number of other amendments to the Customs Act which are more of a general 'houseinterest keeping' nature. These include: Amendments dealt with in clauses 3,4 which are consequential to Australia's adoption last year of the Brussels Definition of Value. The 'Brussels' system reUes on normal commercial documentation and does not control require 'Customs' invoices. Amendments proposed by clauses 5 and 6 which are designed to provide greater flexibility for regulations to govern the grantconcessions ing, operation and transfer of licences missions in respect of goods subject importsexport restriction. In co-operation with the Treasurer, by clause 7, a restructuring of provisions setting out the general requirements in relation to exports to provide a basis for eliminating need for export Ucences under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations by up-gradwaived. ing the export entry as the sole control document. Although the proposed amendments require cession entry before export, instead of within three days grace, any apparent disadvantage to to exporters is outweighed by,firsdy,the eUminconsequential to the passage of this Bill, of export Ucences and, secondly, by the introducthe tion of a system under which regular exporters may, subject to observance of the conditions of system, furnish to Customs periodic returns exports instead of shipment-by-shipment enare tries. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first Second Reading of up to Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Minister for 25 years, Primary Industry) (5.12)- I move: as That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain the approval Parliament for the Government to enter into an agreement with the Queensland Government the to amend the existing Brigalow Lands AgreeAct 1962. Under this Act, which was first conenacted in 1962, and subsequently amended in 1965 and 1967, the State is obUgated to repay loans, together with interest, made to the State four by the Commonwealth for the purchase and Bill development of the brigalow lands. The period of the loan extends over a 20-year period with at concessional rates. In a similar manner, the settlers in these areas are required to and 9 repay loans made to them by the State. In recent years, the settlers have found themselves infinancialdifficulties. These difficulties have arisen through causes outside their own and have largely resulted from the disastrousfinancialsituation in the beef industry generally. To assist these needy settlers, the Commonwealth is wUling and very happy to grant to the State Government, in respect or perof repayments to the Commonwealth, on the to condition that simUar concessions are made avaUable by the State to the settlers in the brigalow areas. It is proposed that a 12 month moratorium on repayments by the State will apply. Principal repayments will be deferred and the spread over following years and interest which would normally accrue over the period will be The concession is being provided by the Commonwealth on the condition that the State Government agrees to extend a simUar conto settlers, according to need, for an averthe present age two-year period. The period over which the repayments are made, at present, is 20 years. The Commonwealth has agreed to extend this period to 27 years, in relation to the State's commitment to the Commonwealth, on the condition that the State sirnilarly extends the repayment period applying to the settlers. The Government believes that this concession, together with other means of assistance available to beef producers, will be of material assistance to those needy settlers in the brigalow areas of Queensland. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. BEEF INDUSTRY (INCENTIVE PAYMENTS) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",44
100,Mr SINCLAIR,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for incentive payments to be made to beef producers who carry out certain recognised animal health husbandry procedures. The provisions of the Bill will help to alleviate the very serious cash flow position of beef producers, while serving the national interest by mamtaining essential animal health activity. The period during which the scheme will operate is related of procedures between 23 September 1977 22 September 1978. The Bill provides for eligibility criterion, which is the ownership of or more cattle kept for beef production on June 1977. EUgible persons may be paid $10 per head, to a maximum of $2,000, in respect recognised procedures which include dipping and other treatments for external parasites, drenching and other treatments for internal parasites, tuberculin testing and blood sampling and vaccination for bruceUosis and spaying of male cattle less than two years of age. Provision is made for the Minister to accept other disease control measures as recognised procedures. This will enable approval of cedures not specificaUy mentioned but which fall within the spirit of the Bill. The Bill provides partnerships, compames and trusts will quaUfy for payment as if they were individual owners. order to expedite payments and achieve adminprivate istrative economies, claims will be accepted in a form approved by the Minister. Claim forms will be printed and distributed as soon as possand ible. It is intended that claims will the Department of Primary Industry, Canberra. The completed claim will include a declaration by the owner. Provision is also made for supporting declarations in respect of eUgibiUty and, when appropriate, in respect of performance of the procedures themselves. The Bill provides penalties for false declarations. There is also provision for appropriation of the revenue. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading",46
101,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING COMMISSION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main provisions of this Bill to amend the Australian Shipping Commission Act are designed to encourage a regime of equal opportunity for competition in coastal trades between the Australian Shipping Commission and private and shipowners, and to enable the Australian National Line to undertake shipping services for the carriage of goods between places in a State where that State authorises the Commission to provide such services. The opportunity has also been taken to effect a number of minor amend to the performance ments to the Act. and The Australian Coastal Shipping Agreement a basic 1956 expired in September 1976 and the SO Government has considered the effectiveness of 30 this Agreement and whether any useful purpose would be served by entering into a new agreeof ment. The main purpose of the Agreement was to facUitate trade and commerce in coastal shipping by ensuring the continued operation of ships by private shipping companies and the Australian Shipping Commission, and to ensure fethe maintenance of competition between the private companies, and between the companies and the Commission. FoUowing discussions with private shipping interests and the Commission, the proGovernment concluded that a new agreement was not necessary but that certain amendments that to the Australian Shipping Commission Act were desirable to ensure that ANL enjoys no special In advantages or suffers any disadvantages vis-a-vis shipping interests. The amendments only proposed are therefore designed, among other things to provide a situation of equal competition equal opportunity as between ANL and pribe lodged with vate shipping companies. I propose to refer only briefly to the principal amendments to be effected to the Act. An exmission planatory memorandum that is being circulated gives details of all the amendments contained this Bill. Secuon 17 of the Act is being expanded. This section currently provides that the Governfunctions ment may direct the Commission to operate a particular service in the pubhc interest. If such direction is given and the service incurs a loss, Commission is entitled to reimbursement of the loss. However this provision does not enable other shipowners to be offered the subsidised eration. There will be added a requirement that if such a direction-to provide a particular vice in the public interest-is issued, the Minister must at the same ume set up an inquiry into alternative services, and the form and amount assistance that such alternatives might need. Where a service is considered necessary in pubhc interest all Australian shipowners and other forms of transport will have the opportice tunity to compete for that service. All possible ways of handling the cargo will be explored and a proper commercial evaluation made of the best way to solve the transport problem involved. A new section 17A will be inserted the Commission to earn sufficient to pay dividends in respect of its coastal operations to the Commonwealth on a basis that puts the Comtime. mission on a footing with comparable private enterprises. The Minister will nave power to instruct the Commission as to the target dividend it should aim for in respect of its coastal operations, and the Commission will be required report to the Minister during the trading with proposals to correct the situation should appear that the target will not be achieved. These requirements would place additional presenting pressure on the Commission to operate in a mercial way. Section 30 is to be amended to require the Commission to pay interest on borCapital rowings from the Commonwealth at the going rate paid by privatefirstclass borrowers. This in fact the position now, but it will be expressed court. specifically in the Act. Under the amendment section 36 the Commission will be required to pay State and Territory taxes as well as Comcharged. monwealth taxes. Under its present legislation, the Commission is not empowered to trade intrastate. However following extended negotiations between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments, the Queensland Government recently legislated to authorise the Commission to operate intraAustraUan state shipping services in Queensland following its decision sometimeago to allow the Comunrestricted access in the general cargo trade from Brisbane to north Queensland ports. in A new section 16A will be inserted to enable the Commission to carry out the powers and relating to intrastate trading conferred by a State government, such as Queensland. The a service between ports in Queensland will be prothe vided by the Line's vessels which currently operate regular services between southern ports, Brisbane and north Queensland, but are presently opunable to accept cargoes from Brisbane to northern ports in the State. This will provide residents serof north Queensland with the benefits of an alternative transport system previously denied them. The Bill also provides an opportunity to of make a number of minor amendments of a procedural or consequential nature to the Austrahan the Shipping Commission Act which will bring the provisions of the Act into line with present pracand make for uniformity with legislation in relation to other Commonwealth transport undertakings. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA to require SUPREME COURT AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first Second Reading",46
102,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Bennelong-Minister for Special Trade Negotiations and Minister Assistto ing the Prime Minister) (5.20)- I move: year That the Bill be now read a second time. it This BDI and the Northern Territory Supreme Court Amendment Bill 1977 which I will be shortly are introduced so as to permit comthe making of regulations fixing fees to be charged in the Supreme Courts of the Australian Territory and Northern Territory. In the past, fees have beenfixedby Rules of Court is which, of course, are made by the Judges of each to The previous Labor Government had a policy that, generally speaking, court fees should not be In pursuance of that pohcy the Judges of the Austrahan Capital Territory and Northern Territory Supreme Courts amended the Rules of each Court to abolish most fees in these Courts. This Government beUeves that court fees should be imposed, so that those who have recourse to the courts will contribute towards their cost. When this matter was raised with the Judges, the Capital Territory Judges pointed out, quite properly, that the question of court fees appeared to have some political significance cause of the difference of view between the vious Government and this Government, and that it may therefore be more appropriate fees to be imposed by the Executive Governdevelopment ment. The Government respects the position of the Territory judges in not wishing to be involved in a matter of this kind that might be the subject of political difference. Accordingly the present Bills are brought in. I would add that the Federal Court of Australia Act and the Family Law Act each empowers the making of regulations to provide for fees payable in respect of proceedings in the ordination Federal Court of Australia and in the Family councils comprised Court of Australia and other courts exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. The proposed amendments to the Territory Supreme Court Acts therefore bring them into Une with conservation the other courts created by the Parliament in this respect.

In commending this Bill to the House, I draw attention of the House to the contents of the ond reading speech made in respect of the Auswealth's traUan Capital Territory Supreme Court Amendstandards ment Bill 1977.

ENVIRONMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr MACKellar, and read a first time.",48
104,Mr MACKELLAR,NORTHERN TERRITORY SUPREME," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill designed to allow for grants of financial assistance to the States for projects related to the environment. Honourable memand bers wiU be aware that the Commonwealth's to berole with respect to protection of the environprement and conservation is essentially concerned with national poUcies, and that the States have for the authority and the responsibiUty for the and implementation of programs that deal with environmental issues at the grass roots level. In most cases it is the States that nave the legislative powers to monitor and enforce environmental standards. They also have the appropriate agencies and estabUshments in these areas. The role of the Commonwealth is to assist the States as far as possible and as far as is desirable in providing the means for coof policies for the environment. Honourable members will know that there are of Commonwealth and State Ministers through which common standards and common policies with respect to issues relating to and the environment are debated and decided. A recent initiative pursued by the Government through the Australian Environment Council is the decision to move towards comprehensive and co-ordinated regulation for the export and import of environmentally hazardous chemicals. The responsible State and Commonwealth Ministers have agreed to the establishment of a national body to assess the environmental effects Second Reading of potentially hazardous chemicals and to recommend the appropriate controls to Federal State authorities. For some years now the has also taken the lead in providing special purpose grants to the States to assist them in undertaking activities within a varthe iety of environment and conservation poUcies. secThese grants are a reflection of the Commonresponsibility to encourage national and national poUcies, where it is judged that these are required in the interests of have just the States and the Commonwealth. One matter that is of great significance is the of national parks and nature reserves. A project where the Commonwealth has been able to provide substantial assistance is the natural resources survey now being undertaken jointly by the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania in the south-west area of that State. It is designed to assist the State in making appropriSecond Reading ate and responsible land use and management decisions for this unique area of Australia. This particular project is an exceUent example of Commonwealth-State co-operative action of a kind which we would wish to encourage through joint consultative arrangements and the grant of funds for special purposes. The need for prompt effective Commonwealth and State actions monitor the quaUty of air in our major cities is well established. The Commonwealth has prothe vided funds in the past to assist in the establishfence ment of monitoring stations as a step towards setting up of a national program of air quality monitoring and the compilation of comparative data. This is an on-going program and our conher sultative arrangements will be underpinned year through the grant of further financial ance for this important initiative. In the current financial year amounts are lateenhance included in the Appropriation Bill the States for air quality monitoring, soil conserconsequential to vation, and nature conservation. this present Bill is to aUow for these grants to be ments from the oldoftothe disbursed to the States. Honourable members placed in a disproportionatelynew will be pleased to know that the Bill will provide a-vis others transferred to the new the mechanism not only for these three programs this year but also for others that may be deemed necessary in subsequent years. In other words, is a standing piece of legislation that will be available to provide a proper and convenient means for the Commonwealth to assist the States financially with respect to matters relating to environment. The Bill provides for the Minister to agree with a State uponfinancialassistance and, acting jointly with the appropriate State Minister, to approve projects relating to the environment. Agreements made under this provision in the Act will be laid before each House of Parliament, as is the customary procedure. It is in essence a simple Bill, but it is, nevertheless, a significant pohcy decision which emphasises again the Government's concern to work co-operatively with the States, through well established means in the interests of responsible and rational management of the environment. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Keith Johnson) adjourned. DEFENCE FORCE (RETIREMENT AND DEATH BENEFITS AMENDMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1977 Bill presented by Mr MCLeay, and read a first time.",48
105,Mr MCLEAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY SUPREME,"Boothby-Minister for Consame struction and Minister Assisting the Minister Defence) (5.30)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends both the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. First it introduces significant improvements reversionary benefits arrangements of the deforces retirement benefits and defence the force retirement and death benefits schemesthose benefits which are extended to the family of a contributing or retired member upon his or death. Second, it incorporates an amendment this to the commonly known 'no detriment' proassistvisions of section 25 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act. The effect is to these provisions in respect of certain for grants to contributionsofficers entrant who elected to limit their the old DFRB scheme, with a reduction in benefit expectation, The purpose of but who, because conversion arrangethe scheme, were worse position visscheme. The Bill also seeks to rectify a series of techniit cal deficiencies and anomaUes in the legislation which have come to light with the benefit of experience in its operation. Foremost amongst the Uberalised reversionary benefits provisions are: the A. the non-cessation in the future of spouses' pensions on remarriage; B. spouses whose pensions had previously been cancelled on their remarriage may be granted pensions at such rate as the DFRDB authority determines where it is satisfied that the spouse is in necessitous circumstances or that the grant of a pension is otherwise warranted; C. in the case of spouses of deceased DFRB pensioners, the grant of discretion to the DFRDB authority to award a pension where the marriage took place after the member's retirement- a benefit largely analogous to that currently avaUable under the DFRDB scheme; and D. access to pension entitlement, subject to the prescribed conditions, for spouses of deceased DFRB and DFRDB pensioners where the marriage was contracted after the pensioner attained 60 years of age. These provisions devolve from changes made to reversionary benefits in the PubUc Service superSecond Reading annuation scheme. Thus, the defence and pubhc service prescriptions will be very largely on the footing, so maintaining the longfor established principle of common treatment amongst the general body of former employees of the Crown. Turning now to the amendment to section 25 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act, I shouldfirstexplain that the Act to already contains 'no detriment' provisions to protect certain late entrant omcers transferred the new scheme against any possible of their pension entitlements for which they were contributing at the ume of transfer. This Bill a minor expands those provisions for that group of matters character officers to place those who limited their contribuDRFDB tions under the former scheme in a comparable comed the position to those who did not. The reason for this member representative provision is that amongst the conversion armade a very practical and rangements from the old to the transferees had their contributions to the former scheme equalised on the basis of 5.5 per the aggregate pay received in the past from adjourned. which they made their contributions. So it is therefore clearly equitable that the 'no detriment' provisions should apply uniformly all. The amendment is to be effective from the date of commencement of the present scheme- 1 October 1972. In conclusion I turn to the amendments designed to overcome anomalies and technical defects in the DFRDB legislauon. Let make it quite clear that a cardinal principle of the transfer of all serving members from the DFRB Works to the DFRDB scheme was that the new range of following benefits was not to be additional to those promentarytheStanding vided in respect of service under the former which scheme but in substitution of those benefits. There was to be no double counting. So, to avoid dual payments, any benefits before 1 October 1972 in respect of service which benefits also become payable after that date were to be recovered or used as an offset against pension and associated benefits payable under the DFRDB scheme. The pre-October 1972 benefits to which I refer are gratuity; ferred pay; certain pension payments for periods of service which were able to be paid under old scheme to some classes of members whilst serving but which, on transfer to the new they could convert to full DFRDB pension entitlement for those same periods; and DFRB thatRecommendation commutation payments where members again out the commute in respect of their DFRDB pensions officers derived from both initial DFRB and subsequent DFRDB service. Certain provisions of the Act dealing with users these matters have been found to be defective in carried that they do not adequately reflect the policy intention. The amendments concerned, which are to rectify these deficiencies, will therefore construction apply from the date of commencement of the DFRDB scheme. In providing for retrospectivity in this way, no pensioner will be required to any moneys to the Commonwealth or suffer a investigations reduction in his existing pension benefits. It merely provides beyond doubt statutory sanction to for what has been done to date in conformity diminution with accepted pohcy. The remaining machinery amendments are of and serve to consolidate some relating to the administration of the scheme. May I say that we have welconstructive initiatives of former organisations. They have realistic contribution.

106,Mr MCLEAY,COMMAND," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the proposed work which was referred to the ParliaCommittee on Public Works and on committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of Glenbrook Royal Australian Air Force Base Headquarters Operational Command. The development proposed will include working paid accommodation for RAAF operational comfor mand, permanent hving accommodation for senior non-commissioned officers, airmen and airwomen currently accommodated at Penrith, renovation of existing hotel building for officers mess and quarters and some working acdecommodation, construction of new police dog training section and isolation compound. The the Committee in reporting favourably on the proposal made three recommendations in relation to scheme, recreational facilities. These are: No. 3. The Committee recommends the RAAF carries out a comprehensive survey throughService and in consultation with Service welfare to establish what recreational facilities are suitable to a modem integrated defence force. Recommendation No. 4. The Committee recommends that a comprehensive survey of the views of prospective of senior NCO messes and other ranks' canteens be out in order to determine what minimum standards are required for airwomen's recreation facilities. Recommendation No. 7. The Committee recommends the of the work in this reference with the exception of the separate airwomen's recreation building. In regard to these three recommendations, the pay Department of Defence will undertake further into the provision of recreational facilities on the lines recommended by the Committee and will be in contact with the Committee again to resolve these matters. The further recommendations of the Committee include: Recommendation No. 5. The Comminee recommends provision of two new tennis courts and two squash an estimated addidonal cost to the development $100,000. The Government accepts this recommendation, and the proposed faculties will be incorporated in the development. Another recommendation is: Recommendation No. 8. The Committee recommends that the departments concerned re-examine the possibility of providmg modern automatic fire detection to sleeping accommodation, particularly the refurbished hotel building. This matter will be re-examined as recommended by the Committee. The third recommendation is: Recommendation No. 9. The Committee recommends that carpet be provided to office areas in the combined equipment/barrack store complex and the ters/medical/dental centre in heu of vinyl tiles. The provision of carpet to these areas may not be entirely appropriate, but in view of the time factor, I am not able to give afinalopinion on this question. The recommendation will be further examined, and the Committee advised of the outcome. The total estimated cost of the proposal including the cost of the tennis and squash courts recommended by the Committee is $8.4m at June 1977 prices. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.",50
107,Mr MILLAR,COMMAND,"I wish to make a brief observation on a point on which the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) touched, namely, the provision of recreational facilities for airwomen. As a member of the Standing Committee on Pubhc Works, I would certeinly not like an opinion to be formed that the Committee has determined to ehminate this special accommodation for airwomen which is provided in the form of private recreational facilities. The Committee certainly holds the view that consistent with contemporary lifestyles separate recreational facilities could be redundant. That point was put at a pubhc hearing at the Royal Austrahan Air Force base at Edinburgh. A response from the RAAF of a persuasive nature was forthcoming, but it did not completely dispel the Committee's view that a thorough survey of the personnel involved could estabUsh whether these facilities that are traditionally provided may be somewhat redundant in our contemporary society. The thrust of the Committee's recommendation was, therefore, to establish once and for aU the whether the Air Force could quite properly courts at adopt a mildly paternalistic attitude which of would ensure that young entrants to the Air Force at least would be given some form of refuge so that they could deterrnine the Ufestyle to which they might wish to adjust. So the Committee would naturaUy be eager to have a response from the RAAF on the information that it seeks. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The proposal is for the construction of a comprehensive beef cattle research laboratory complex comprising the following main groupings of buildings: The laboratory, admimstration and central plant buildings, an animal building, a food preparation building, a caretaker's residence and aflammablestore. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $5.44m at June 1977 prices. The Committee has reported favourably on the proposal and, upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.",51
109,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ROCKHAMPTON,"One could be forgiven for being cynical about the speed with which the Government has dealt with this matter. It was only yesterday that the report of the Standing Committee on PubUc Works was presented to the Parhament and was ordered to be printed. Today the expediency motion to carry out the work has been moved. I reaUse the tight timetable because of the announced election date. It is interesting to note that this facility at Rockhampton is not isolated from two other facUities. The Committee reported on one in its fifth report of 1973. That was the high security off-shore animal quarantine station at Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I repeat that date-1973. It is more than four years since tiiat report was presented to this Parliament. That faculty still does not exist. The Committee, in its sixth report of 1974, reported on the need for an animal health laboratory at Geelong. All that has happened there so far is that some site work has been done. The Government neglected to include in the mates this year funds to provide that muchinsects. needed facility. So one could be forgiven for being cynical about the speed with which this expediency motion has been brought into the Parliament.

If you read paragraph 17 on page 4 of the report, Mr Deputy Speaker, you willfindthat both the off-shore animal quarof antine station and the Animal Health Laborathe tory at Geelong are mentioned. I do not think am straying very far from the report. It seems me that the motion that it is expedient to proceed with the work is based ontiiereport. I mention that because it is important that it be understood that Australia, a very large cattle producing nation, is very dependent on suitable breeds. you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, our country stretches from the tropics to the temperate zone and much of its area is not ideal pastoral The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation needs the new facility at This is Rockhampton so it can continue its genetic animal research and to determine the beast that is adapted to the poor pasture lands, the most resiswere tant to external parasites such asticks,the most resistant to internal parasites such as worms and, have come as scientists say, with the best appetite, that is, the ability to hve on poor pasture but still proof duce quite an amount of flesh. The need for this facility is undoubted. It doubtedly tied in with the Animal Health oratory at Geelong and the off-shore animal quarantine station. May I highlight that by ring to a question answered by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in this House yesterday. Mr colleague, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), raised the question of an announcement that there had been an outEstibreak of bluetongue virus among Australian The Minister in his answer said that he was not sure about it being bluetongue but said that certainly some virus had been found. The insects had to be sent to America and South Africa to be analysed because the facility which are the PubUc Works Committee recommended in 1974 does not exist. The report of the Pubhc Works Committee contains a great deal of inforI am pleased that you have read it, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I know of your great up the interest in cattle breeding in Australia. As the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) indicated, the work is to cost $S.44m. When the Committee was in Rockhampton hearing eviit was confronted by a number of people who seemed to be under a misapprehension as to the facihty was all about. Certainly parts of the facility, as you will understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, will replace existing facilities at Belmont station. There was a great deal of misunderstanding by some of the witnesses as to the role of CSIRO in this area. I reiterate now that was no indication to the Committee that CSIRO was engaged in anything other then genetic research. There was a thought in the minds cattle breeders in the north of Australia that Austrahan Government, through its agency, I the CSIRO, had set itself up a stud. Nothing to could be further from the truth. It is for this reason that the report, on which the motion suggesting expediency is based, does not raise in any great way the need for the CSIRO to become a body of extensionists-peopl e who carry out As research and then propagate it throughout the community. In effect it is compiling a handbook of the traits of various cross-breeds of cattle, land. starting with the bos indicus. why there is a need for the off-shore quarantine station, as stated in the report. best The animals with which CSIRO are working imported into Australia, some in the 1930s, zebu, most in the 1950s. No new genetic strains of bos indicus, brahman of Afrikander cattle into Australia since, simply because the lack of an off-shore animal quarantine station. I cannot stress too strongly the need for the Government to proceed with projects other than is unthe proposed works at Rockhampton. Frankly, I LabcompUment the Government on the speed with which it has been able to consider the report referfrom the PubUc Works Committee, come to conclusions about the recommendations of the Committee and within a space of less than 24 hours recommend to Parliament that work proceed. speak on behalf of all the cattle breeders Australia when I say that I hope that the Governasked ment proceeds just as quickly with the construcVice-Chairman tion or this facility and does not procrastinate it has done with the other two works. It is quite true that other problems are volved in the cattle area, but cattle breeders need history to have a genetic strain of stock turn off their properties with a higher than nordeferred the proposal mal meat content and which do not suffer distress because of the heat. Genetic research is being done at Rockhampton in very cramped, which referred uncomfortable and, as I viewed them, most unCommittee satisfactory conditions. The sooner the Govern the ment provides proper facilities, as should exist there, the sooner it can engage more scientists to study more cattle and conduct experiments in given more congenial conditions. The sooner informadence the Committee tion resulting from that research becomes available to the scientists of CSIRO, the earlier it will be disseminated amongst the cattle breeders Austraha. I make one final appeal to the Government. would not be so unkind as to suggest that the Rockhampton proposal is window dressing for an election campaign. Far be it from me to sugand gest such a thing. I am sure the Government quite sincere in its intentions. Certainly it has moved quickly so far. I hope that it moves to the facility built as quickly as it has moved bring this motion before the House. The Minister might take it on board to get on to his Departwould ment or whichever department is responsiblethe Department of Foreign Affairs or the how Department of Health-to make sure there is an immediate start on the off-shore animal quarancentral tine station. The cattlemen of Austraha have been crying out for it for the last four years. the last two years this Government has done absolutely nothing about it, and that is rather tragic. I make that appeal on behalf of the cattlemen of Australia. I am sure they will be most interested to see how the beef cattle research laboratory proceeds after they have seen how the other two-the off-shore animal quarantine station and the Animal oratory at Geelong-hav e not proceeded. This Government, with a Cabinet of farmers, has not done anything about these facilities the cattle producers of Australia.",52
116,Mr CARIGE,ROCKHAMPTON," I thank ment the ParUamentary Standing Committee on Pubform. It could lic Works for its recommendation that a beef sector. cattle reseach laboratory be constructed at Rockhampton, and I congratulate the Government for moving with the speed with which it has anything. I moved in proposing that the work proceed. The in honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) me to pass on his congratulations to the of the PubUc Works Committee, as the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). I do so. The honourable member inthrew in a few barbs and said that the Government was electioneering. He should look at the which they can ward hisofGovernment this proposal. When it was first put forprocrastinated, and in fact on three different now occasions. Finally it was the present Government the matter to the PubUc Works so that it could go to Rockhampton and fully investigate the proposal. I appreciate fact that the Committee visited Rockhampton and for two days Ustened to the evidence to it. I also appreciate the remarks made by the honourable member for Burke about the evireceived. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial of Research Organisation laboratory in Rockhampton is of major significance to all beef cattle I breeders in Australia, not simply those in the isolated areas of central Queensland. It is of major significance to people who are importing exporting cattle. It is of major significance to is those producers everywhere in Austraha improving the genetic strain of their animals. It is a Uttle get Uke-and I know how the people at Belmont feel to occasionaUy- a prophet not being recognised in his own area. I suppose, Mr Deputy Speaker, it be Uke trying to teach your producers in South Australia how to raise jersey cows and to influence the breeding of those animals. That is precisely the reaction at the moment in Queensland. The people there are saying that the scientists cannot teach them anything Over further about their particular breeds. I welcome the Government's decision to go on with this project at this time, not purely for electioneering purposes as the honourable member for Burke said, but because it is of major significance to the whole industry. This Government saw the need for it. I question why the previous Government, if it saw the need, did not act Health Labbut deferred the matter. Mr Keith Johnson-We were too busy having on behalf of elections.",53
117,Mr CARIGE,ROCKHAMPTON,"My word, the Labor Govern the had an election oh its hands and it deferred project again in 1975. That was true to its never find money for the rural Mr Keith Johnson-We never had time to do",53
118,Mr CARIGE,ROCKHAMPTON,"Well the Labor Government was had time, almost to ruin the beef industry. seemed to do that with great speed and great diligence. I rose only to thank the Committee handing in its report and to thank the GovernbuUt. ment also on behalf of the producers and the scientists in the central Queensland region for exstruction) pediting this matter.",54
119,Mr SCHOLES,ROCKHAMPTON,One cannot let pass statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Carige) relating delays in matters referred to Pubhc Works Comand mittees. I seem to recall that a project which would have thought important to all animal experts-the animal health research laboratories it. - wa s approved by the Pubhc Works Committee and this Parliament in 1975. The works have reached the stage where the designs are now not? complete. Mr Carige-It might have something to do with the quality of representation.,54
120,Mr SCHOLES,ROCKHAMPTON,"I think that is true and as it a matter of vital importance to the National Country Party, I would accept the quaUfication that the preoccupation of the National Country Party with the milling industry as opposed to rural industries is most Ukely the reason why the project has not been funded this year. It is important that Austraha makes sure that it is selfsufficient in protective mechanisms, both in research and preventive areas and in proof of eradication areas. I suggest there is why the Government should be censured for its faUure to proceed with what is the major project in this area, a project which could be called into the use in a very short period. I think it is important that we look at the answer given to a question directed yesterday the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) as to what I hope is only a minor incident. The fact that in order to examine and identify a virus it is years, in at necessary to send such specimens as are collected Australia, overseas for examination. We do not have the married naval personnel necessary facUities in Austraha. Irrespective of what anyone might say, if there is an outbreak of an exotic disease in Australia the cost to community and the country itself will be $50m month while we prove eradication. To prove eradication we have to send the specimens and some instances the animals out of Australia for testing. I think that every honourable member understands the importance of the project. What I am complaining about is that this project deemed to be not urgent in 1970 when it was fore a government of a simUar colour to this Government and was not proceeded with. There talk about representation in this place. The It National Country Party and the farmers' organisations ought to be pressing for this projfor ect. It does not matter where the laboratory is It is vital to the industries concerned.",54

The honourable member for Burke will remember what the deficit was, and we inherited Mr Keith Johnson-It was very nearly as big as the deficit the Government has now, was it",54
122,Mr MCLEAY,ROCKHAMPTON,"It was just double the deficit we have now. We had to look at everything that would increase the deficit, and cut our cloth acis cordingly. No one doubts the need for these things. It is a question of what we can afford. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA ROCKINGHAM AREA, WESTERN NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",54

PUBLIC SERVICE (PERMANENT HEAD-DUAL APPOINTMENT) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 October, on motion by Mr Street: That the Bill be now read a second time.",55
127,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"The of Opposition does not oppose this Bill; yet it is intrigued to know, as many people will be ping intrigued to know, why the Bill is necessary. Bill authorises the appointment of one person hold or to act in the offices of Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade and Secretary tp Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. am told that the announcement was made July that the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, Mr MCKay, was to be Acting bureaucracy, Secretary to the newly created Department the Special Trade Negotiator. The instrument of appointment was pubhshed in the Gazette on July 1977. On 15 September there was shown under the heading 'Appointments and acting appointments as Permanent Head' what there appeared to be an instrument of appointment oflevel Mr MCKay to the office of Secretary to the newam of Department. On the following day a correction was made which stated that no such appoint(Mr The Bill provides that a person who is Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade may be appointed to act as Secretary to the new I Department without affecting his tenure in the whenDepartment of Overseas Trade. In essence, this apparently means that there is a Mr MCKay who a bitis Secretary to the Department of Overseas toTrade, and he is to hold the same position in the ParUa-Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. Legislation is necessaiy because there has been some doubt over the legaUty of one person being the permanent head of two departments. In other words, in this legislation we are correcting some ambiguity, some anomaly, possibly some kind of shernozzle. I am told that the Governor General intervened and questioned the legaUty of the dual appointment. I also am told that the PubUc Service Board has been concerned about dual appointment ever since it was anI recall, and there are other people in House now who will recall, that there have precedents for this kind of situation. Apparhaveently, a Mr Fred Green was at onetimeperand manent head of both the Department of the mem-Army and the Department of Air for a short time. That was back in the late 1960s. The appointment of the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard) and the establishment of his Department have been widely 1977 criticised. Many people in this Parliament believe, and certainly some spokesmen in the media take the same view, that the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Anthony) should have lost his portfoho and the new Minister should have had the prerogative of embracing the entire area trade. There seems to be a very great possibUity that we are moving into an area of overlapwhich could be disastrous not only from the Thestandpoint of ministerial obUgations and reto sponsibUity but also from the standpoint of the dupUcation of permanent heads. Even if there the were to be separate permanent heads there I would be a number of responsibUities and obUon 17gations which would have a common denominator. Also, in the dimension of the entire we could find ourselves getting into of overlapping situations. 17 The New Minister for Special Trade Negotiations was supposed to deal exclusively with the European Economic Community. Already seems to be confrontation at the ministerial about the overlapping that is occurring. I concerned that it might occur also at the level of the Department, especially at the level of departmental head. The Minister for Special Trade Negotiations was described originally as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations with the European Economic Community. I am told that the Minister does not see his bnef as being confined to the EEC. He has thrown offthe title and already is endeavouring to spread out. This could have very serious impUcations and I believe that it is important to air the misgivings that are very much in evidence at present. There is obviously room for conflict between the Minister for Overseas Trade and the new Minister who has responsibUty for trade matters relating to the EEC. There does not appear at any level to be sufficient clarificaton or definition of responsibility for the Ministers, the permanent heads or the departments. The creation of that ministry caused this Government to have the same number of departments as the Australian Labor Party Government had in 1975-76. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be able to recaU that Government was criticised consistently for having too many ministries. With the creation of this new ministry, it is important for us to evaluate whether it is a new ministry with new merit and with a capacity to contribute anything worthwhile. I want to make some reference to the public attitude that has been expressed about this matter in the media. I refer, firstly, to the Australian Financial Review of 18 July. I read in that paper: Creation of a Ministry of Special Trade Negotiator zling for more reasons than this. The EEC is far from Australia's major trading panner. The Commumty is in fact declining as a market tralian products, despite the British entry. It goes on to give some figures in support of contention. It states: Australian exports to the EEC have fallen from 20.3 per cent of our total exports in 1972-73 to 14.8 per financial year. In respect of imports it says: Imports from the EEC have been steady at around year'sfigureof 27 percent oftotal imports. It goes on: If a Depanment and a Minister for Special Trade Negotiations is required it must surely year took 36.6 per cent of our exports. I do not know whether or not the newly on yesterday's appointed Permanent Head will concern himself has with Japan, or whether or not the Minister will concern himself with Japan. Clearly, there is this grey area of ambiguity. I would not be surprised if conflict emerges. Worse still, I Minister, it is Ukely that we will have overlapping which will cost the taxpayer a great deal and add to bureaucracy. I will quote further from that Australian Financial Review editorial of 18 July. It says: The new Department of Special Trade Negotiator will no doubt shortly acquire all the trappings and staff of other government depanments. The new depanment is an obvious competitor with Doug Anthony's Overseas Trade National Depanment. In fact, between the Department of Overseas Trade and Australia's Special Ambassador to the EEC, one would have thought that any trade problem could be adequately dealt with. It continues: If the Overseas Trade Department was not doing its job it should have been hauled into line. It says further: Mr Fraser has chosen instead, with little justification, to create a new department and one which will require the minister to spend a fair amount of time travelling around Europe. I think this is fair conjecture. What is imphed in this whole proposition, the matter now before the House concerning the clarification of a problem concerning the appointment of a new department head, is the establishment of a new department. We should be asking ourselves: Was it necessary at aU? Was there some inadequacy in respect of the activities of the existing Minister for Overseas Trade and his Department? If so, probably there was a need to getridof the Minister. But was there any justification to set up yet is puzanother ministry, yet another permanent head, yet another bureaucracy? Never in Australia's history has there been a dual role, have there for Ausbeen people going off with separate responsibUity for separate parts of our potential export that market areas. We are creating a precedent and I believe it is beholden on this Parliament to consider seriously whether this has been made cent last necessary by the new ramifications concerned with the establishment of the European Economic Community on the one hand or whether on the other hand, it has been made necessary by last virtue of the inadequacy of the Minister who prevaUs at the present time. The article in the Australian Financial Review continues: be for Japan, which last notIf fallen the Overseas Trade Department and Mr Anthony have down on their job (and Mr Fraser certainly does not suggest this) the kindest interpretation that can be placed aberration from Canberra is that Mr Fraser chosen torewardthe man regarded as the golden-haired boy of his ministry. I think the last part is an overstatement. He is the declining-haired boy in many respects. Nevertheless, the point that is made is in sharp reUef. The Australian Financial Review was not on its own in this respect. The Australian had somesoludon thing to say about the matter as well on 19 July. tion It said: . . . there will have to be an increase in the vice structure to support the new department. It made far more sense to have given Mr Howard Overseas Trade, leaving the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, important Department of National Resources, which mineral, water and energy resources. It continues along that line. I think it makes very significant point in that regard. The article goes on: . . . it is a sign of the erosion of Country Party and the strength of Mr Fraser that a Liberal minister taken over such an important area of overseas trade with the EEC. It would not have happened in Sir MCEwen's day. All honourable members know that to be the fact of the situation. There is all this by-play between coalition members. The Opposition could make poltiical capital out of that if it was so inclined but that is not the point. The question of trade at stake. It is not a matter of making a poltiical point about whether the ministry is duplicated, whether the heads of department are dupUcated or whether the bureaucracy is duplicated. Clearly what is at stake is whether or not Australia is going to have an efficient trade partment; whether-if we go right back to the grassroots level-w e are going to have the chimreflection neys smoking, although that is anti-environmenMinister, tal; whether we are going to have the production in this country and work opportunities for the masses of unemployed people who are now to reaching unprecedented proportions in is Australia. Why should the unemployed or the trade prospects of Australia be put at risk jettisoned because the Prime Malcolm Fraser), as the head of the Liberal Party, wants to make some point against the leader of the National Country Pary and cut down to size by getting a new Minister to take over this Uttle side-swipe of the whole operation. I think that is a disastrous situation. I do intend to labour this point but I refer to the tude expressed by the Age, one of the most table newspapers in this country. The Age of 19 July said: Mr Howard does not appear to have been demoted transfer to a highly specialised I do not think he has been demoted but he may be if it does not work, and it might not work. depends on what kind of sabotage or lack of cooperation might be in evidence. The article his Mr continues: If anyone has been eclipsed it is the Deputy ter and Overseas Trade Mmister, Mr Anthony. It may be that his health has not been sufficiently restored to allow him to lead arduous trade negotiations m Europe. would have been to appoint Mr Howard as Minister for Overseas Trade (with instructions to give special attento Europe) and leave Mr Anthony with his increasingly significant other portfolio, National Resources. Public SerI believe that the Age has made a good point. would have Either the Minister for Overseas Trade, the the Deputy Prime Minister, can cope adequately covers with his Department or he cannot. That appears to be the point of the whole exercise. Obviously a the Prime Minister would not have appointed somebody else tp hive off a part of the operation if the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for influence Overseas Trade, had been capable of doing it. A has simpler solution would have been to have found as that a man who was capable of doing the whole operJohn ation. Always in Australia's history we have had such a man. We have not had one with a dual role since 1901. For thefirsttime it seems that we have a Minister for Overseas Trade who cannot operate without a secondary subjective, probably sycophant, Minister and heaven knows is what his role is in the whole of the arrangement. Never before have we had a situation in which we have had to have a second departmental head, a second bureaucracy. Maybe sickness is involved. I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister who is the Minister for Overseas Trade, is not desick, but I believe this development, the subject of this legislation, is a reflection. If it is not a on the incapacity of the Deputy Prime who is the Minister for Overseas Trade, if it is not a clear indication that he cannot do his job, it must mean that the Prime Minister wants cut the National Country Party down to size. It not good for a coaUtion government to have division which will result in productivity being and impaired, employment opportunities being Minister (Mr undermined and so on. In today's Australian Financial Review there him are some comments about Mr Howard's role in the entire situation. The comments are to the effect that Mr Howard might not be going to be not that crash hot anyway, that he has come back to attiAustraha and made some statements about what repuis happening within the European Common Market and all that kind of thing, but it does not seem to be working out too well and he might be at risk. We might even be putting at risk a new by his departmental head whose position we are clariand less influential post. fying tonight by this legislation. There are a lot of things being put at risk at the present time. The It Australian Financial Review had this to say: Howard sought to put a brave face on the outcome of talks, though his failure to take home any substantive concessions from Europe can hardly help his Government in Prime Minisits forthcoming election campaign. . He said that he had agreed in principle with the commission to hold another round of ministerial level trade talks If so a simpler in Brussels early next year. But even this attempt to inject a ray of hope into the look was deflated by Mr LoeffI will tell honourable members in a moment who Mr Loeff iswho said that he 'knew nothing' meeting. So Mr HOWARD - that is the name that is used in this article, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - ha s come back to Australia saying: ' I have not done too well yet fellows, but there is a new prospect looming up'. But there is that Mr Loeff saying: ' I do not know of any prospects'. Mr Groom-Who is saying this?",55
128,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"I am going to tell you; just be patient. Mr Loeff is saying: ' I do not know of any prospects at all. I do not know of any new round of talks at all'. That newspaper article reads: Mr Josephus Loeff, the senior commission official who represented Brussels in the recent high level talks with ing Australian delegation, said that the EEC . . . I have identified the man and that is what the honourable member wanted me to do. I am only making the point that this second-row Minister has come back with all the trappings of a minisance try, a departmental head and a bureaucracy, and has said: ' I have not done too well going back'. But Mr Loeff who is obviously very significant in the whole of the scenario is saying: Order! 'We do not know of any second round of talks at a few most all'. Let me turn to the Canberra Times of 19 congratulate interesting July. Mr Cotter-That is a reputable newspaper, it not?",58
129,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"What do you trunk Head' about it yourself? Mr Cotter- I just said: ""That is a reputable newspaper'.",58
130,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,I think it is a reputable newspaper. If the Liberal Party members do not beheve this let them stand up and say so. I heve it is one of the best newspapers in Australia. They have asked me. I am telling them It is a good newspaper. It is a newspaper with national characteristics. It reports this Parliament as effectively as any newspaper in able Australia. Mr Cotter-Can you believe it ah?,58
131,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"You teU me whether fair you believe what it says in its editorial of 19 July m respect of this matter. It says: The immediate objective of the appointment of Howard as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations the proposed trade conference later this year between Australia and the Community seems to centre on the sale of outAustralian uranium as a lever to obtain access to the Community for Australian agricultural produce, notably meat, dairy products and sugar. It is laudable enough to use a lever in our desire to export primaiy products. The article goes on of arrangements for such a to say: Mr Fraser's approach is of course seen by the Europeans as a direct attack on the Community's common agricultural policy. The ploy of a pointed trade-off, which Mr Fraser is apparently deterrnined to pull off, is seen in some quarters as, in addition, a politicalisation of the trade in uranium at a time when the United States President, Mr Carter, is using the same approach to retard the development of the fastbreeder reactor and, through this, the spread of military nuclear technology. Mr Cotter-Good stuff.",58

133,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"Let me put it to you to a visitjudge what you think it is worth.

135,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not be surprised if what you have said is pretty close to the mark. I think you have been befairly indulgent, and quite frankly I have made most of the points that I wanted to make and I my view. think I have made them tellingly.",58
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION,I think the honourmember also was helped by a few interjections that came from the other side.,58
137,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"Yes. Mr Deputy Speaker, I regard you as having been more than in this whole situation. If you will aUow me to continue I will certainly comply with the point that you are making. I have here many Mr newspaper cuttings which made the kind of point and of that I have made. I do not intendMr Cotter-There is a Ubrary fuU of them.",58
138,Mr LES JOHNSON,LEGISLATION,"I will table them if you like. What we are really dealing with is a total schemozzle. The taxpayers outside are not impressed with the fact that the Government involved through this legislation in the establishon ment of yet another department. It has all the trappings associated with yet another rrunistry because the present National Country Party Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister of this country, cannot do his job in 1977 as it has done since 1901. We on the Opposition side areexclusively. very concerned about the dubious objectivity which is involved in the appointment of this min-special istry.

The whole purpose of thisnoteworthy exercise is to redress that mistake. We are about a government mistake. That is the superHughes. ficiahty of the whole scene. I am putting to the House that the mistake is far broader. The misIn take is at the expense of the Australian taxpayergovernment and clearly demonstrates a rift between the eral Party and the Countiy Party.

As the honourable member for Hughes pointed out, the instrument of appointment was published on 17 July 1977 only to be withdrawn immediately after when it became apparent that in some abway this contravened regulations relating of to such appointments. A correction was pubUshed subsequently. The Bill provides that a person who is Secretary to the Department of situOverseas Trade may also be appointed or act as to the Department of the Special Trade without affecting his tenure in the hold or to Department of Overseas Trade. of The honourable member for Hughes made of the estabUshment of a new departRather than establish a traditional departhead, the Government had Fraser) to adopted the perfectly step of utilising not the talents of the head of Trade Mr the Department of Overseas in respect of Government, more than any other government, has demonstrated clearly that it has no particular sympathy for the thatincreased bureaucratization of the forms of The Bill comes through quite clearly as being a very logical step to ensure the best may be derived from the existing estabHughes lishment rather than to engage in the type of empire building exercise which has characterised the Public Service and government instrumencement talities in the past.

If there is any inconsisand tency between the provisions of the Bill and Public Service Act of 1922 or the Remuneration Tribunal Act of 1973, the provisions of the Bill will prevail. There is also provision clear that nothing in the Bill overrules the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which provide for continuity of appointment to perAll manent head positions, the names of which have been changed.

The honourable member for Hughes took considerable license in departtioned ing from the substance of the Bill which, as I initially, is simplistic in the extreme.

We heard from the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), who has now left the chamber, a lengthy, tedious and repetitious speech which was amply padded by newspaper editorials. As you observed, Mr Deputy Speaker, they had nothing to do with this Bill. As was said: observed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter), it was interesting for us on ter. the Government side to hear tonight the which was forthroming from the Opposition by means of newspaper editorials.

It was illuminating to hear the support for Australia Australia's leading newspapers which was given continuingneeds by the Opposition on this occasion. that The speech of the honourable member for was repetitious. I am reminded of the fact that he was once Minister for Housing. It was then said of him that he could talk under wet but could not build a house.

It was issued by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 17 July and in it he announced the appointment of Mr Howard as the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations. The Prime Minister Mr Howard remains Minister Assisting the Prime MinisHe will work in close collaboration with the Ministers for support Overseas Trade and Foreign Affairs. It is quite clear that there will be no confrontation there. The Prime Minister then went on to Mr Howard's appointment has been made because to be represented at the highest level, on a basis, if the bilateral trade problems facing Australia and the EEC are to be resolved adequately. The need for this high level appointment became clear during my discussions in Europe with the President of the Commission and with heads of a number of European Governments. The decision to appoint a Minister to lead these negotiations demonstrates the importance which Australia places on its trading relations with Western Europe. Later in that Press statement, the Prime Minister himself said: His role will extend to other areas in the international commercial field, where problems of interest to Australia could profitably be discussed with the EEC. It is very clear from that statement- I have bored the House by reading all of it-that none of the so-called fears expressed by the honourfact able members for Hughes is realised or realisAustralia. able.

143,Mr HAYDEN,LEGISLATION,"This Bill, when enacted, will authorise the payment to the Queensland State Government of $24.8m in this year as a special grant. Of course, the payment that amount is established according to the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Queensland is the only State which claims before the Commission now. The Comtion monwealth Grants Commission was established to compensate the more disadvantaged States that in spite of the disadvantages they would be able to provide a better level of pubhc services for their residents than otherwise would be case. It is generally said, in a somewhat coarser way, that the poorer States are claimants beforeGovernment. the Grants Commission. Queensland, I repeat, is the only claimant State now. In the Ught of the nature of the role of the Grants Commission it is clear, in spite of to the contrary by the Queensland State Govern-pacity ment, that the ability of that Government to improve the standards of public services falls considerably short of what other States are to provide. What I am really moving towards saying very simply is this: At the Government level Queensland is poorly adrriinistered. It is administered by an uninspired group of men of indifferent quaUty. The consequence is that the standard of pubUc services in that State is mostly well below the Australian average. The Premier of Queensland Ukes to favour in a generous fashion by periodicaUy making comparisons between what he has done andfor his State and what is done in South Australia by Mr Dunstan. When one analyses the comparative performances, one realises that there is not only room for a great degree of embarrassment on the part of the Premier of Queensland. The is that Queensland lags badly behind South That is a consequence of poor administration in Queensland. We must bear in mind that Queensland is particularly fortunate in that it is well endowed with mineral resources. In turn, that allows the Queensland Government to Third Reading derive a great deal of additional income from revenue from mineral development, mainly royalty charges and transport charges. Other revenue sources are generated within the economy as a result of the influence of mineral development. In short, Queensland has this advantage over a State such as South Australia which is particularly Umited in the availability of mineral resources. In spite of that, South Second Reading Austraha makes a greater spending effort in supon motionport of its pubhc services. The important feature here, very simply, is that Queensland is spending less than South Australia and would be spending a great deal less than that again if it were not for the completely fortuitous circumstance that mineral ofresources are providing such a large addition to revenue in that State. What it means simply is that South Australia is a far better administered State. Almost exclusively the fruit of administrathere is the product of hard, creative and enterprising work by able men. There are no forsotuitous advantages being reaped from vast mineral resources, as there are in Queensland. I cannot make that point strongly enough. I am a the Queenslander and I am disappointed that our State is so poorly adrriinistered by the State Mr Hodges-But the people are not disappointed. claims Mr HAYDEN- I am disappointed that the cafor improving the standards in that State is not being tapped in the way it ought to be. The honourable member for Petrie says that the able people in Queensland are happy. I suppose he measures the degree of happiness by the success with which the Queensland Government can rig its boundaries. It is just about to rig the Party out of existence in Queensland. That something upon which he can cogitate after 12 November. The important point I want to here is that if Queensland was administered group of men as able, as inspired and as enterprising as the men who administer the Uc affairs of South Austraha, Queensland with the resources available to it would have the standard of pubhc services of any State in the Commonwealth. When I say 'public services' am talking about the faculties that governments provide. Let us look at the substantial port that assertion. First of aU, the living standards in Queensland are not as good as they ought to be, in spite of the remarkable natural wealth of that State. I take two simple indicators to make that comparison. I refer,firstly,to permunity sonal income per capita. In Queensland in the period 1970-71 to 1974-75 the level was $2,530. These are the latestfiguresprovided by the Grants Commission. The Austrahan average was $2,750-that is, more than $200 per person betand ter than the average in Queensland. In vices. Queensland personal consumption expenditure per person was $1,790, but the average in Australia was nearly $2,000 per person. Again, the average Queenslander was some $200 worse off than the average Australian. That is the of record which was achieved between 1970-71 and 1974-75 by the Queensland Government. There is a long term situation in which the [ >acity to enjoy Ufe, the standard of living, agged considerably behind that of the rest Australia on average. This is a remarkably in the 1950s. depressing result for a State which is as potenThere tiaUy rich as Queensland and which has such enormous latent ability to provide the best Uving standards of any State in the Commonwealth. Let us look at some of these pubUc service cUities. After all, they very much estabUsh level of prosperity and personal comfort which State will be able to achieve and reflect the of regard and concern with which government administrators attend to their responsibUities. Education is probably one of the most important measures in that area as a social indicator of social concern of government administrators and of the opportunity for improvement for people within society. Education expenditure per capita in Queensland is $ 151, as against on average in Australia. ThefiguresI am giving are for 1975-76. When we look at the situation in South Australia we discover that the average amount spent on education there is $194 per capita. Liberal means, in very simple terms, that if the is Queensland Government were to make an equivalent effort in thefieldof education to that stress being made by that forward-thinking and by a inspired government in South Austraha, the Queensland Government would have provided pub- $90m more for education than it has in its 1975-76 Budget. There is no consolation at all best for any Queenslander to be aware, as we mostly are in Queensland, that we have the worse stanI dards of education of any State in the Commonwealth. Queensland spends less per person on education than any other State in the evidence to supCommonwealth. They are some of the contrasts that I wanted to make, but there are more. There is a tendency for many people in Queensland to believe that we lead the Commonwealth in the provision of comhealth, hospital and welfare services. It is easUy understood why that general impression should be around. Labor governments in the 1940s and 1950s gave primacy to the development of community health and hospital services displayed a great concern about welfare serI Ulustrate this point by saying that accordingly public hospitals were established in Queensland by a State Labor government. They were retained in Queensland subsequent to their being destroyed in other States. PubUc hospitals sort had been set up earUer by the Chifley Labor Government but subsequent to their having been set up by the Queensland State Government. caThey were subsequently destroyed in all States has except Queensland by the Menzies Government of during thefirstfew years of the Menzies period is a lingering belief that, because a system of free hospitalisation was preserved in Queensland, that State stUl leads in the provision of community health, hospital and welfare serfavices. Well, it does not. If we spent in the Queensland as much per person as was spent on a these services in the State of South Australia, sort another $22m would have been spent in that area. That is the degree to which we are falling behind the other States. That is the level by which standards in that important area of comthe munity health, hospital and welfare services have fallen short of those provided in States Uke they provide South Austraha. AU these things are put together in the latest $ 169report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I am now referring to Table E-4, as it is designated: 'State Expenditure on Certain Social Services from Consolidated Revenue and Special Funds: Net Expenditure 1975-76'. ThatUnder this categorisation wefindthat on a per capita basis Queensland spent $275.23; South Australia, however, spent $335.58. It matter of simple arithmetic to establish that if the Queensland Government had been as concerned about people, had been as committed to improv-important ing the facilities that need to be provided to public sector if they are to have better standards,Queensland; and had been as concerned as the South Ausing tralian Government, then in the 1975-76 Queensland budget another $127m would have ment. been provided for that explicit purpose. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr effects Hodges) is suddenly silent-and why not? The facts which are available from official sources show beyond any doubt that we have an incom-both petent, uncaring inadequate State Government in Queensland. We have a government which is certainly committed to preserving the interests foreign multinationals, which are extracting exporting enormous profits from which is not committed or concerned enough to ensure that some of that wealth that rightly belongs to the people of this country is redispopulation tributed to the community to benefit at least people of Queensland. I repeat that in ance Queensland we are languishing well behind the performance which has been estabUshed by the travels South Australian Government. I suspect that the Premier of Queensland probably does not understand, if I can move to another point, the way in which he has been manipulated by the present conservative coBrisbane, aUtion Federal Government. It is undeniable that in real comparative terms common with the States generally, is worse off as a result of being treated much less advantageously than was the case under the last Laborprovided Government Budget of 1975-76. Other State Premiers-for instance, Mr Dunstan-hav e prowould tested loudly, clearly and in a quite convincing way, but the Premier of Queensland is someamount thing of a fellow traveller of the national Government. Let me give evidence of that. Total payments to or for the States in 1975-76 amounted to 10.9more per cent-almos t 11 per cent-of gross domestic production. In this Budget for 1977-78 they are down to 10 per cent. That is, the States are disadvantaged in real comparative terms by some $920m. That is a substantial amount of money. sincerely trust that the honourable member Petrie, who would Uke to camouflage these mat-located ters and who desperately wants to conceal the way in which this conservative coaUtion national Government has disadvantaged the States, will explain this situation. In the case of Queensland it means that that State is some than it would have been if it had been treated as is just a generously as it was in 1975-76. In specific terms, wefindthat, in relation to programs such as the national sewerthe age program, in 1975-76 it attracted $ 13.8m for it attracted only $lm in the foUowyear. That program has an important contribution to make at a time of high unemployIt is a labour-intensive program and it is a program which would have specific multiplying in its demand for resources if it were allowed to proceed. The sorts of resources which are required are both material and labour. In cases demands would be made in areas where resources are idle. So we could put to productive work idle resources, which would allow of stimulation for economic recovery to get under and way without aggravating inflationary forces in the State, but any way at aU. Queensland is a vast State with a decentralised which is sparsely spread in many theareas. Roads are of absolutely crucial importand should be regarded as one of the greatest assets of the State. Yet the further north one on the coastal road the worse its condition becomes; the further one goes into the interior, the more appalling the condition of the road becomes. In both cases the further one goes away from Brisbane the greater is the neglect. That is, the further one moves away from George Street, where the Premier holds court, the more apparent becomes the neglect in the proQueensland, in vision of roads. If in this Budget the present Government had as much for roads in a real comparative sense as we did in our last Budget, $75m more have been made available for road projects than was made avaUable, and a substantial of that would have gone to Queensland as extra expenditure. One of the important points here is that Queensland has the resources avaUable-bu t they are idle-whic h would allow road development to take place than is taking place. Furthermore the selfishness displayed in the development of Queensland road projects is Ulustrated by the heavy concentration of government expenditure on roads in the electorI ate of the Minister for Local Government and for Main Roads, Mr Hinze. That electorate is in a highly populated area near Brisbane. That is occurring to the neglect of the rural areas of Queensland-the important productive areas of Queensland which contribute so much to the export income earning capacity of the State and, $147m worse offindeed, of the nation. Queensland is a dry State. That is a common problem in this nation. Yet as far as I am no protest has been made by the Queensland Canberra. Premier at the announcement by his comrade the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and Leader of the National Country Party that more Commonwealth funding will be made duran available for new water conservation projects. This is sad news for important areas of benefit-cost Queensland. It is bad news for the Monduran dam project outside of Bundaberg. The no Queensland Government, because of limited resources-if it were more competent than it it were as competent as the South Austrahan Government is, it would have more resources, but that is another point which I have already made-and in the absence of sufficient support from the national Government,findsthat the Monduran dam project is being delayed and thatcoaUtion importantfinancialobligations which the national Government has a responsibility to discharge are being neglected by the national Government. The consequence is that the connection tween headwaters works and reticulation projwhen ects is unable to proceed. So it is almost a white elephant which is costing money to the people Queensland because of interest payments loans which went into the capital development this project, but nothing is being generated productively to earn income to pay those charges because the program is nearly frozen into of the immobility because of the neglect of the national Government. I repeat that the Queensland certainly Premier is not hammering this issue not condemning the national Government. Perhaps he is not fully aware of the impUcations of this neglect by the national Government. In Townsville, the largest centre in the State outside of Brisbane, there is a desperate need financial support, nationally and at the State level, to provide more water conservation projimportant ects to serve the city. If there is not an immediate undertaking to do this the growth of Townsville could be brought to a dead halt. Indeed, even water conservation projects such as the second stage of the Ross River dam and the Burdekin The River dam were to start tomorrow, the city tions, would still have to impose water restrictions, probably as early as 1979. In the absence of commitment, State or Federal,financiallysupand porting stage two of the Ross River dam and the Burdekin River dam, the expansion of Townsworking ville, the most important industrial centre Queensland outside of Brisbane, will be brought to a dead halt. It is shameful that the city TownsvUle finds its industrial development imperUled because of the indifference of both aware George Street, Brisbane, and Parks Place, The Labor Party has made it quite clear that a Labor government would commit itself to prono viding the necessaryfinanceto allow the Mondam to proceed as rapidly as possible. We would take immediate steps to complete the analysis of the Burdekin River dam. On the basis of that being favourable-w e have doubts about that at all-w e would proceed to negotiate a cost sharing arrangement with the is, if appropriate authorities, that is, the State Government and the TownsvUle city authorities. The growth of an important industrial centre such as TownsvUle should not be delayed in the way it is currendy being delayed because of the irresponsibUity ofboth the national conservative Government and the State conservative it believes coaUtion Government. I move on to another area which is directly related to this matter of the economy of Queensland. Of course aU of these things flow befrom the Bill which proposes authorisation, the Bill becomes enacted as law, of $24.8m to Queensland as a special grant. Why a special ofgrant for Queensland? Why Queensland, the on only claimant State before the Grants Comof mission? I made the point earUer that it is because of the indifferent, at best, standard of administration in Queensland. The performance economy in that State, despite aU its clear natural wealth, is not as good as it ought to be. It is dismally inferior to that of a State at all. He is such as South Austraha. One area in which the State's economy suffers is the area of industrial relations because of the provocativeness of the State Government in this area. It is provocative largely for poltiical for reasons. A great degree of conflict and division occurs which has a significant economic cost. It is to note that the only State with a worse industrial record than Queensland is Western Australia. It has a Premier who is someif what simUar in makeup and who is of the same poltiical outlook as the Premier of Queensland. States with the best record in industrial relameasured in terms of working days lost per thousand civilian employees, are the Laborany governed States of South Australia, Tasmania New South Wales. Let me put the statistics on record to estabUsh that point. The number of days lost per thousand civilian emin ployees through industrial disputes in Western Austraha between January and July 1977 was of nearly 409. In Queensland the number was more than 228. In Victoria it was more than 206. In New South Wales and Tasmania it was about 151. In South Australia fewer than 46 working days per thousand civilian employees were lost through industrial disputes. That is imponant and mdicates the son of result that can achieved through enUghtened industrial laws and enUghtened government, especially in relations with the industrial movement. That is another area in which Queensland has government a dismal record. It is the produa of the narrowmindedness and the poltiical opportunism of the Queensland Premier. I am not denying for a minute of course that he does not have quite vious personal qualities. After aU, he is the Premier in the Commonwealth who is so beloved by his people that he must wear a bullet-proof vest in pubUc. While the Prime Minister (Mr this Malcolm Fraser) sets his sights on union leaders, the Queensland Premier sets his sights on nothif ing much lower than an archbishop, and cerwere tainly nothing lower than a dean. So we find poltiical purposes theologians, atheists and munists lumped together in Queensland as the threat to the soUdity and the security of the ciety. I suppose the next people in the firing line will be the vegetarians and the antimeasure vivisectionists. About the only group which will be safe will be the flat earth movement, and is only because the Premier believes that movement is conect. Let me not be personal about the Premier. Let me refer to the opimon of the Premier's distincgovernment tive quaUties by none other than his personal friend, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Country Party in this Parliament. In July in Queensland the Deputy Prime Ministive ter described the Premier as, in inverted comequally mas, 'unreasonable, selfish and unchristian'. think the Deputy Prime Minister should have the last word on the matter. He, after all, knows better than any of us. One other matter ought to be referred to cause it was attended to briefly in the second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner). It concerns the Federal Governof ment'sfinancialsuppon for local government. The Prime Minister especiaUy seeks to presume that his Government has been more generous than any preceding government in the provision offinancialassistance for local government. certainly asserts that his Government has been more generous than the last Labor Government was in the provision offinancialassistance local government in its 1975-76 Budget. Let us expired. look at the official record. I refer to Budget No. 7 for 1977-78 which is entitled 'Payments Or For The States And Local Government Authorities'. I refer to table 98 at page 113. The grand total, excluding aUocations for roads, being the summary of Commonwealth Governbe ment payments to or for local government authorities in 1975-76 was $275,046,000. In its 1977-78 it feU to $203,967,000. So, even in money terms, without allowing for inflation, the national Government's total support for local fell substantiaUy. A more relevant measure is a comparison of the allocations as a proportion of gross domestic obproduct in each case. In 1975-76 the Labor only Government provided 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product as direct assistance from the national Government to local government. In year's Budget the allocation is 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product. What that means is that the present conservative coaUtion Government to provide as much in real comparative forterms as the Labor Government provided in com1975-76 it would have to double its total aUocation to local government. Instead of providing sojust on $204m, it would have to provide nearly $408m. That is the measure. That is not only the of what the Government should have done; that is the measure of the way in which that financial support to local government by the that national Government has been cut back. Again this has most undesirable consequences for the economy because this is a time when local can play a most vital role in helping to get the economy under way again. But how can we expect anything other than this narrow minded, inadequate response from a conservacoalition Government in Canberra and from the Government in Brisbane? This I year there will be more unemployment than there was last year. Next calendar year it will be him even worse. That is acknowledged by the Queensland Premier. For aU that, in this recent beBudget he reduced from $69m last year to $50m this year specific allocations to relieve unemployment- a 30 per cent reduction; in real money terms a $25m reduction in the allocation relief for the unemployed. How fair dinkum is the national Government? How fair dinkum is the Queensland Government? How poorly does the record of the Queensland Government compare with the record of achievement of the South He Australian Labor Government?",61
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION,"Mr Orummond)for Order! The honourable gentleman's time has Paper Mr HODGES (Petrie) (9.12)-There is no To doubt that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) is one of the most vociferous bers in this House. He has always been heavy words and Ught on action. I am sure that being heavy on words tonight in his criticism the Queensland Government will win him no result friends whatsoever. It just shows how much of tune he is with the people of Queensland. present his party in Queensland holds one out 18 Federal seats. The Queensland Opposition Petersen. led by Tom Burns has 11 members in a Paliament of 82. It is often referred to as broken-down cricket team. It cannot even proThere vide a twelfth man. Of course, one can stand the honourable member being a little of tune. He cannot make up his mind. He is too preoccupied with whether he is economic spokesman for the Opposition, whether he is to take the portfolio of Treasurer, the portfolio economic manager or the portfolios of Defence and Foreign Affairs combined. The people of Queensland are thoroughly satisfied with the State coalition Government. They will reflect that satisfaction come Saturday week, 12 November. The people will have their say then, and all of the loose words that have been spoken tonight by the honourable member for Oxley will be meaningless. The people heve rejected the Austrahan Labor Party in December 1974 in the State election, and they repeated their action in December 197S in the Federal election. They will do it on 12 November in State election and again on 10 December in the Federal election. The honourable member for the Oxley imphed that Queenslanders are less than astute. They will not forget those words. pipeline. Queenslanders have their feet firmly planted the ground. They know what they are doing, that will be reflected in their vote in the two forthcorriing elections. They will not forget the comments of the honourable member for Oxley. The honourable member had the temerity to stand in this Parliament tonight and tell us extra money should have been spent in Oxley Queensland and how the Queensland Governexpect ment should run its Budget. Let me remind him that when he was Treasurer of this nation budgeted for a deficit of something like $2.8 billion- a large deficit, to say the least-and only three and a half months the deficit was program. heading for $4.5 billion. Yet tonight he had the temerity to tell this House what the Queensland Government should be doing with its Budget. Ifl remember correctly, inflation was running at 4.5 per cent when the Labor Government came to power in December 1972, and it was running at 17 per cent when it left government in Corporation November 1975. The Labor Government ber meminherited an unemployment figure of about on100,000. When Labor left office thefigurewas his about 260,000. There was a wages explosion of under Labor. All of these issues came about as a of the bungling of the Labor Party when in out overnment. I suggest to the honourable memAt er for Oxley that he might need a bullet-proof of vest in Queensland, not the Premier, Mr BjelkeIt is my view that the Queensland Government the will be returned with a handsome majority. has been an unbroken period of 20 years underof stable government for the State of out Queensland. The Government has developed the State's resources of coal and bauxite well. Queensland has a stable sugar industry and other primary industries. It has developed a road of network that certainly needs work done on it, but this will take time. The electrification of Brisbane's rail system is proceeding now at a time when electrification will be viable. It was not proceeded with when the Labor Party wanted to develop it 20 years ago. There were then insufficient people to provide the necessary support for such a system. Hospital and medical services are being developed m the State and I be that they are second to none. Queensland is the most decentralised State in Austraha, with one million people living in south-eastern Queensland and a further one million people the spread throughout the remainder of the State. There arefirstclass port developments right up coastline. Schools have been built, and a multitude of other services and programs are in the on It is my view that the people of Queensland andwant stable government. They have expressed that in Federal elections; they have expressed it previously in State elections; and they will do it on Saturday week, when in my view the Labor Party will be lucky to get 35 per cent of the total what vote. So much for the honourable member for talking about gerrymanders. What can he with 35 per cent of the vote? It is my view that that is roughly the proportion his party will he get. The Queensland Government will be returned because of its record- I repeat 'because of after its record'-and because of its forward pohcy I refer now to the speech made by the honourable member for Oxley in this House yesterday. He ought to be ashamed of that performance. It was a savage speech. Indeed, I beheve that it was a merciless speech. It was unwarranted and it was a deceptive attack on the Utah Development in particular. The honourable memconveniently made no reference in that speech to the massive benefits that - flow to Australia and to Queensland as a result of operations of Utah in Queensland. I noticed he made no reference to the rail freight revenuesCorporation that flow to the Queensland GovernmentIndeed, something like $56m in 1976. He made no men-I tion of the taxes and royalties of some $21 m flowed to the Queensland Government in the same year. A letter from John Bailey of Brighton,because Victoria, which appeared in the Australian The Financial Review yesterday, set out quite clearly the position in relauon to the Utah Developmentwill Corporation. Mr Bailey quotedfiguresfrom the annual report of that company for the year day ended 31 October 1976. If the honourable member for Oxley has The visited the central Queensland operated by Utah, as I understand he has, I am House byfrom surprised and ashamed that this man can put for-About $ 14m was ward such a story.

But let us look at amenities that are provided-squas h courts, golf course, shopping centres, swimming pools and so forth.

146,Mr HODGES,LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member for Bowman interjects, that is the average. Thatto average wage does not include management job wages and salaries. Mr Armitage-How much did Utah send back overseas this year?",67
147,Mr HODGES,LEGISLATION,"I shall move on to that matter in just a moment. Labourers earn about $12,000 a year and semi-skiUed people earn up to into $20,000 a year. I wonder whether the able member for Oxley has talked to the men and women in those townships, the labourers and the plant operators, as I have done. They extremely happy. He ought to go and talk to management again because I can assure him it is contented as well. As a Queenslander, I strongly resent the words the spoken in this House yesterday by the honourthat able member for Oxley. The Utah Development has achieved much for Queensland. if we examine its annual report to which referred earUer, wefindthat about 60 per cent that of earnings went in tax to governments. I hope the honourable member for Chifley is Ustening only 40 per cent went to shareholders. estimate for this year is that S3 per cent of earnings will go to governments and 47 per cent go to shareholders. What the honourable member for Oxley faued to tell the House yesterwas that there are total assets of the order of $500m invested there, with the Utah Development Corporation having invested about $43 Sm. situation, as I understand it, is somewhat coalfieldsthat are difierent the the distorted view conveyed to this honourable member for Oxley. paid to Australian shareholders with the approval of Board. I should Peak Uke the honourable member for to listen him to and to the there who receive wonderful support company. They would run him out of A substantial portion of the $117m that was repatriated would have gone into the developof the Norwich Park coalfieldsonly for the theactions of the seamen's union. I noticed that the a honourable member for Oxley had nothing to say about this particular matter. Norwich Park will be developed at a cost of about $250m. What about the job opportunities that that will not provide? I do not hear the honourable member for Chifley being quite so outspoken at this stage. I remind the House that the job opportunities that would arise from the development of the Norwich Park coalfieldswould not be confined that particular area. Indeed there would be opportunities such as those that arise now in workshops in Newcastle, Port Kembla, Sydney and other centres as a result of Utah's other operations in central Queensland. So the 3,000 jobs that were referred to as directly involved in Utah's operations in central Queensland would be increased to many more thousands, taking account all the ancillary works that go to honoursupport that wonderful development. I wish to turn now to the fact that the States of areAustraUa are doing very well under this Governthement. Indeed, there was no mention by the that honourable member for Oxley in his earher speech as to just how well the States are doing. When one examines the general revenue assistQueensland ance, that is, the tax sharing assistance that Government has provided to the States, it will noticed that in 1976-77 about $3.6 billion went to the States. In the same year, for section specific purpose payments, about $2.4 billion went to the States. Thesefiguresare to be increased substantially to about 18 per cent financial year and will total, for both generaldisadvantaged. revenue and specific purpose payments, $7,241.7m. This is a substantial amount of State, money whichflowsto the States. I mention this in particular because too much criticismflowsto the Commonwealth from the States. Whenever State government cannot carry out a program, it invariably says that the Commonwealth GovernStates ment is not providing adequate funds. I think is reflected m the condition of the State budgets. I wish to refer now to the healthy condition the six State budgets. In 1976-77 New South Wales had a deficit of $0.5m, Queensland had a deficit of $lm and South Australia had a deficit of $0.1 m. Queensland's deficit of $ 1.02m on its Revenue Account was arrived at only after cating $Sm of the State's personal income tax sharing payment in 1976-77 for use in 1977-78. The budgets of the other three States were: toria, a surplus of $9.1 m; Western Austraha, a surplus of $3.4m; and Tasmania, a surplus of $1.6m. Indeed, shows examination of the State budget estimates for 1977-78 again shows a veryProspect healthy picture. The States have reduced their taxes. That is entirely their business. Of course one of the great advantages of the present Government's federalism pohcy is that it allows the State governments to do as they will. All the State governments have decided to reduce payroll tax in the 1977-78financialyear. I not saying for a moment that this should not done: I support such a move. Practically all States have reduced probate duty, stamp duty, land taxes and gift taxes. As I say, that is the business of the States. But one does get a little tired of the way in which the States bleat every time they do not have sufficient funds. The Statesby must be honest with their electors and tell when they cannot carry out a project. They should not continually blame the mission Commonwealth. I wish to refer briefly to the rate of growth of the State Public Sendees. It is my view that while the Commonwealth has reined m in this lar area and cut back on the number of monwealth employees, the States have not been expired. of the same mind. I think this is an area at which the State governments ought to look very seriously. The provision of $24.8m will be a great boost to that State's this finances. The Commonwealth Grants Combe mission examines the position. I think one would agree that if a particular State wants to be a 96 or claimant State-and Queensland is the only claimant State at the moment-the four less populous States of Queensland, South Austraha, this Western Australia and Tasmania should not be In this particular case the Government of Queensland, the only claimant is to receive $24.8m in 1977-78. It is more expensive to provide services to smaller cities in outlying areas in a vast State such as a Queensland. Indeed a State such as Queensland cannot raise taxes as easily as can the standard of New South Wales and Victoria. So this thispayment is compensation to Queensland for being a disadvantaged State. I trust that the people of Victoria and New South Wales will not of mind this, as I believe it would be unfair if the people of Queensland had to pay higher taxes in order to enjoy a reasonable standard of hving. In conclusion I want to mention a matter that affects my electorate. It is on rare occasions that I menallotion anything of a parochial nature. VicDr KLUGMAN - When were you last there?",67
148,Mr HODGES,LEGISLATION,"If the honourable member for would like to come with me I will show him around. Let me add that his political party is having difficulty infindinga candidate. The honourable member can come and campaign for a candidate any day of the week and every day of of the week between now and the Federal election. The matter I want to raise concerns the augam mentation of what is known as the Hornibrook beHighway, a project which will cost about $9m.

149,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"The Bill before us embodies the recomstopped. mendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I suppose those recommendations to be accepted, but I find them very hard to folwealth. low and I think they could be open to criticism. We have had the report of the Grants ComQueenslanders mission for only a httle while. It was presented 25 October and therefore most honourable members would not have had a chance to study it. On page 107 of the report the Grants ComQueensland mission makes a recommendation which appears to me to be very ill-founded. If honourable memWhat bers look at the details of the report I think they will come to that conclusion. I want to particularly to the fact that Queensland, under bushranging Premier, which is the only way in which I can describe himMr Armitage-Is that Bjelke-Petersen?",69
150,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"Bjelke-Petersen. Under its bushranging Premier, Queensland able to ehminate its death duties-othe r States have not been able to do this-and yet we have nonsense talked by Queenslanders in this House Commission? about how Queenslanders are so heavily taxed and about things of this character. If one looks at page 42 of the Grants Comthe mission report one will see that the Commission has expressed doubts about the facts of the case and makes quaUfications there. It is a great pity that the Commission did not follow these that qualifications, because it is a Queensland, which has been able to do this, should be given a grant for which other States have to pay. I am a bit sick of the people from the New South Wales in this House and in the Sentrahanand ate who will not stand up for their own State and who let it be bled white by States such Queensland. Bjelke-Petersen is a bushranger. Let what has happened. Queensland has abolished death duties and we are paying for it. Because that the Premier has been able to attract to Queensland a tremendous amount of investment from other States. Mr Hodges-Goo d luck to him.",69
151,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"The honourable member says: 'Good luck to him.' That is fair enough for a Queenslander but, as a New South Wales person, I say that this is bushranging. I am ashamed of my New South Wales colleagues who let this go on. It is time somebody stood up for New South Wales and stopped this bushranging. I can well sympathise with the people from Queensland. They are priming the parish pump with great success and they are getout of that pump. It is time this was have Mr Millar-They are producing a lot of",69

Perhaps it is be that cause of inefficient administration in refer Queensland; I do not know. What is happening its in Queensland is very much like what happened on a smaller scale with the Channel Islands when they became a tax refuge and they profiteered at the expense of the rest of the British Isles. This is a bit of blatant profiteering, to abolish death duties and to use money which is being paid has been under Uiis grant. Mr Hodges-Are you criticising the Grants",69
153,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,Yes. I am criticising the Grants Commission. I started off by criticising Grants Commission and I do so because apparently the Grants Commission has been very naive. It has been sucked in and has not realised whatwent was happening. This is just Uke the scandal on with the Channel Islands and the scandal that their taxes they gotBy British economy. reducing or elimmating all the hot money to come to them. In Austraha we have free trade between States under section 92 of the Constitution we have a single currency. Inside the Auseconomy there is no way of putting a rein as upon a State which starts bushranging as Queensland is now doing. us look at Mr Armitage-It is a tax haven.,69
154,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"It is a tax haven. This is of Uke some of the Norfolk Island scandals. Queensland is a tax refuge and a tax haven. It is making money out of that. Look at what is happening on the Gold Coast. Look at the way m which money and investment are flowing into the Gold Coast, as evidenced by the tremendous skyscrapers and things hke that. This is all sucked out of the rest of the States of Austraha which want to be fair and which keep up their necessary revenues. Queensland by cheating-it is cheating against the rest of Australia-is making a great deal of profit from this operation. I think it is utterly scandalous that this House should be voting money to a State which has behaved in that way. As I said a moment ago, I am ashamed of my New South Wales colleagues, who will not stand up and fight for their own State, who allow their own State to be pillaged by Queensland in this way. That is what is happening and that is the truth of the matter. Because Queensland has aboUshed death duties it is profiteering at the expense of aU the other Australian States. Mr Hodges-They can do the same.",69
155,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"Maybe death duties have to be aboUshed in other Australian States. That may have to be done. It may be less expensive to the other States to allow this anomaly to roceed than to abolish what is received in those §tates by way of death duties. Queensland is sucking the Ufeblood out of the other States of Australia by this type of bushranging and profiteering in which the Premier of Queensland has indulged. It is about time it stopped. Queensland is a claimant State. It is a State where, as I have been reminded by Queenslanders a few moments ago, there are tremendous natural advantages. There has been the immense bonanza of open-cut coal. BjelkePetersen did not put the coal there. It just happened to be there. It was great luck. I believe that Queensland has rather mishandled its opportunities but its opportunities in natural resources are so great that even though Queensland has mishandled them, there is still a great deal left. Queensland has had a tremendous bonanza fall into its lap, and it is still a claimant State. bauxite. Look at the Gladstone complex which is being paid for largely by Commonwealth money. Look at the extra grants that are being given to featherbed Queensland, right, left and centre. The tragic thing is that members from New South Wales will not stand up for their own State. They are prepared to ditch their own State in this and in other ways, and it is time something was done about it. From time to time over the last 20 years I have protested and raised my voice in this House against this. I have been alone. My coUeagues from New South Wales have always abandoned me when I did this. I have had no supportMr Cotter- I wonder why?",70
156,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"I will tell you. It is because they are a lot of sheep. They are all looking for votes in the small States and are prepared to ditch New South Wales. New South Wales was the oldest of the States and it was the richest of the States. It was quite right that in the early days New South Wales should support the other States as a parent suports his children. This wasright,but the time as come now when New South Wales can no longer carry the burden. I would say that we have a very inefficient government in New South Wales but we have had a different kind of government over the past ten years and the burden still has been there. New South Wales can no longer maintain the burden of the high taxes and the high charges that it has to bear in order to subsidise the smaller States. I go to Sydney, and I still pay my toU over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Is there any toU to cross the Tasman Bridge in Hobart? None at all, because we subsidised its construction. Western Australia receives an immense bonanza because it draws its road money on the basis of area. Where does it spend most of its money? On suburban freeways in Perth. The traffic runs freely because the freeways have been paid for by Sydney motorists but Sydney motorists have trafficjams all the time. I return to the Bill. We must accept, because we have not had time to study it, the report of the Grants Commission. We have had it in our hands for only a few days and the Government has seen fit to railroad this Bill through the House quickly without the members of the House having any opportunity to read the foundations on which this Bill is built. Although I have read it, I think that very few other members have read it. We are accepting uncritically the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I say that the Look at Grants Commission has not looked at the whole position properly. It has not drawn attention in this report to what is happening in Queensland as a result of the aboUtion of death duties which has not occurred in other States. This report says nothing about the extra wealth which is flowing to Queensland as once itflowedto the Channel Islands. Queensland has cheated the rest of the States. It has done something within the boundaries of a common currency and trade area which the other States are not doing. Because it has been able to do this, Queensland has drawn to itself wealth from the other States. This is thing which any competent commission should have analysed and said something about. I read this report. There is not one word in the effects of this iniquitous, unilateral aboUtion of death duties. Mr Braithwaite-Why should there be? It only at came off at the beginriing of this year.",70
157,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"Exactly so. My friend Australia, asks why should there be; it has appUed only from the beginning of this year. Apparently he has not looked at page 107 of the report and that some of the grant is for the corning year. mterest. Why has he not said so? Why did the Commission not say so? I think the Commission has been grossly neUgent in not said before, it is time we had a look at these things. It is terrible that Bills are railroaded through this House. Here we have a Bill which we have not had a chance to read fully, formUhons mulated on the recommendations of a report which is over 200 pages of close print and which was given to the Government only on 25 October. It has not been considered soberly this House, and I venture to say it has not been read by the members who have supported the Bill in general. That is true. They have not chance to study it and I do not blame them. Mr Armitage-They have not read it.",71
158,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"They have not. I do not blame them because there have been other things before this House, and in the last week what chance do people have to look through 200 page report and examine it critically? Mr Hodges-Tur n to page 42.",71

160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REDISTRIBUTION BILL, Maybe Order! The honourable member will address Chair.,71
161,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. When there are disorderly interjections sometimes I cannot help but answer them. I hope you will be able to repress the interjectors as well as call me to order. Once again I come to the point. Queensland is a rich State. In many ways is the richest of all the States. It has tremendous natural resources and advantages. place to Uve. It has everything §oing for it yet it is the only claimant State. This is a shame and a reproach to Queensland, and it is a shame reproach to the Grants Commission that we are expired. not able to bring the matter to some kind of proper and logical consideration. Queensland somehad a bonanza of copper at Mount Isa. It has a smaUer bonanza of uranium at Mary Kathleen. have It has the tremendous bonanza of bauxite at it aboutWeipa, which has caused a Commonwealth finance bonanza of industrial development at Gladstone. There will be a lot more development Gladstone. The Premier of Queensland has appealed to foreign compames to bring in capital. This is not altogether to the advantge of but it certainly is to the advantage of Queensland. It is a case of the man who is selfishly following his own interests being able to seen get something at the expense of the national Mr Armitage-And we will have to pay the saying so. As I have dividends.",71
162,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"I do not very often agree with my honourable friend, but I am afraid that for years we will have to pay hundreds of of dollars a year in dividends on coal which should have belonged entirely to Australians and when those dividends should have come entirely to Australians. It is not good by enough to give these concessions to compames, even if a government does get a short term profit out ofit. Yes, Queensland does get a short term had a profit, the Premier gets something for Queensland; but he betrays the national interest of all Australians while he does so. It is true that New South Wales has some coal prospects in the Hunter Valley. Perhaps they are not as great as those in Queensland, but they are a there. New South Wales has had no real bonanza over the past .20 or 30 years, as some of the other States have had. Victoria has had the oU and gas bonanza. Western Austraha has had the ore bonanza and it will get the off-shore oU I bonanza. Queensland has had the bonanzas about which I have talked. Tasmania is hmping. I do not know what has happened to Tasmania. its only bonanza is to be able to be the feather-bedded by the Commonwealth Government at the expense of New South Wales. It is a real bonanza because it gets this tremendous feather-bedding. It gets aU sorts of payments and they are made from New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, Victoria. These things are happening. New South Wales, which quite rightly in the itpast should have contributed and did contribute to the development of the smaUer States, conIt is a good tinues to be victimised",71
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,Dr Jenkins)and a Order! The honourable member's time has,71
164,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL," I will say only one or two things about the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). That would be probably the longest three minutes I have ever witnessed. I will say no more about that. In speaking on this Bill the honourable member referred to the fact that nowhere at all in this handsome book-the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commissioncould he find any mention of probate and succession duties. I refer him to page 42, sub-section 4.7, entitled 'Probate and Succession Duty'.",71
165,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,That is not what I said at all. I will take up this misrepresentation later.,72
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,Order! The House will come to order. I call the honourable member for Capricornia to speak without assistance.,72
167,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will deal with the honourable member for Mackellar later. The honourable member for OxleyMr Armitage-He will deal with you, brother.",72
168,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"Hooray , Rent-a-mouth. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), instead of speaking to the actual Bill, politicked and carried on here tonight as though he were electioneering; so I beg the indulgence of the Chair in that I feel that we all will have to do the same thing because ofhis tirade. The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Commonwealth Government to make a grant of $24.8m to Queensland, comprising a completion grant of $ 10.8m and an advance grant of $ 14m in respect of the year 1977-78. The Government accepted the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommendation and the grant was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 1 August. That is what the Bill is all about. The honourable member for Mackellar called the Queensland Government a pack of bushrangers and said that Queensland had a bushranger Premier. In fact, what he was saying was: Why should the Queensland Government be so astute and the New South Wales Premier and Government so inept? That is also what he was saying about all the other Premiers and all the other State Governments throughout Austraha. There is no reason in the world why we should be apologetic for having 20 years of stable government in Queensland. That is how we came to have the vast development that we have in the southern region of Queensland. That is what is worrying the honourable member for Mackellar. I do not know why he is worried about it, because I am led to beheve that he has bought substantial properties there and I am led to beheve that he bought them only after the Queensland Government abolished death duties. So I do not know why he is complaining tonight about the Queensland Government.",72
169,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,That is entirely untrue. How could you learn that?,72
170,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,I learned it because you told me.,72
171,Mr WENTWORTH,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,I did not tell you any such thing. That is a bloody he.,72
172,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"The honourable member for Mackellar saw fit to chaUenge the integrity of the Queensland Premier, the Queensland Government and the members representing Queensland. Surely to heaven the honourable member for MackeUar can take it when it is given back. He cannot question the integrity",72
173,Mr JAMES,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"He can, but it was not true.",72
174,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"The honourable member for Hunter would not have a clue about what goes on in Queensland. The only time he came up there was when he was with the PubUc Works Committee, and I welcomed him there then. The Queensland Government makes no apology whatsoever for aboUshing death duties. If the honourable member of Oxley, who spoke at great length about the aboUtion of death duties which came into force on 1 January 1977, beUeves that it was such an iniquitous decision that was taken by the Queensland Government-the honourable member for Oxley raved on about taxes in other States-wh y can he not be honest about the whole thing? He held up the Don Dunstan South Australian Government as the greatest government in Australia. He said that South Australia is the most progressive State in Australia. Let us have a look at some of the facts. Even though Queensland has abolished death duties, the people of Queensland pay $ 189 per head in State taxes. What do the people in South Australia pay? They pay $237.20. Let us have a look at what happens in New South Wales-this grand State of New South Wales. The people in that State pay $284.40.",72
175,Dr KLUGMAN,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,Because we subsidise Queensland.,72
176,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"How do you subsidise Queensland? If Queensland had not been a member of the Federation Queensland would have returned to its taxpayers this year approximately $lm. That is what the Queensland Government could have returned to its taxpayers, because that is what went out of Queensland. When honourable members opposite rave on about what is going on should have a look at the tariffs imposed on Queensland. There is no way in the world that any special grant could compensate Queensland for the enormous tariffs which are imposed protect industries.",72
177,Mr JAMES,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,What about sugar?,73
178,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"The sugar industry is the stabilised industry in Queensland. Honourable members opposite rave on about these things. We make no apology whatsoever most decentralised State in Australia. Other honourable members particularly the honouryears, able member for Oxley, went on and slated the Queensland Government. Why should the Queensland Government hang its head in has shame? It is a stable government and it attracted foreign investment. It not only attracted foreign investment but also went overseas and raw product. The Queensland Government has nothing to be ashamed of there. It has opened new mining ventures throughout Queensland. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) only today expanded on the new projects that are coming forward in the very near future.",73

I do not the official are there for not to fabricate figures in this place. If they want to they can find them out from the MinisThey canfindout from anywhere. There is reason to fabricate them. Western Australia is another State that the honourable member lampooned. In Western Australia 252,000 man days were lost. That is not a badfigurewhen compared with what happened in New South Wales. What happened in South Austraha? Some 151,000 man days were lost.",73
188,Dr KLUGMAN,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"That is better, is it not?",74
189,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"That is a better figure still by the same token let us look at the work force that State. Why did the honourable member for Oxley ask us to look at the track record in South Austraha and New South Wales? What a great track record! Let us get the up to date figures look at what is happening now. For the months of June 1977 New South Wales lost toria 21,000, Queensland 21,000, South Austraha 24,000, Western Austraha 76,000 and Tasmania 3,200.",74
190,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,What is uie point?,74
191,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"What is the point? The point, case the honourable member does not listen to parUamentary debate, is that his great colleague, the honourable member for Oxley, came into Chamber and politicked like crazy because State election campaign is on in Queensland. never ceases to amaze me how he gets this found feeling for rural Queensland and for metropolitan Queensland. Where does he find He went for a safari up the east coast of Queensland with the State Leader of the sition and suddenly came back with a new wealth of knowledge.

193,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"Anthony is well aware of what is going on up mere. I am talking of the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland. The honourQueensland able member for Oxley tied himself in with him tonight. The Leader of the Opposition Queensland said in front of the television weeks ago: 'Do not trust the National Party. Do not trust the coaUtion. They are pandering south-east corner'. The honourable member for Oxley expanded on that tonight. He went on and on about it. When he went back to the provincial areas he lampooned my Party again. He said: 'AU they are worried about is looking after the western areas. They are not worried about the provincial areas of Queensland'. It is amazing how these people twist and turn whenever there coUeagues. is an election campaign. The honourable member for MackeUar tonight criticised the Queensland Government for diUgendy going about its duty. He criticised it because it has been in office for so long and because but it is a stable government. What did the in Queensland Government do? It became a claimant State. It has everyrightin the world to become a claimant State. There is no reason in the world why it should not have become a claimant and State. What happened in New South Wales?

195,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"The honourable member for Prospect was probably a leader in changes of government. He is never quite sure about which side of the House he sits on. Because of those in changes the New South Wales Government did not exploit what it had. It could not hold what it had in New South Wales. In fact New South this Wales is now losing its population to a Queensland. There is no doubt in my mind why It Premier Wran is so worried. He is worried benew cause the people of New South Wales are movnoning to Queensland. They are moving up to the it? Gold Coast, the area about which the honourable member for Mackellar spoke, and to the OppoToowoomba area, which the honourable memfound ber for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) because they are good areas to Uve in.

196,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,Fro m the remarks of some of the members of the Opposition here tonight one tend to think that they are on our side. They have been criticising the Queensland Government for being so efficient. That is all they are proving. They are proving that the Government is very efficient and that it is concerned about Queensland.

212,Mr CARIGE,REDISTRIBUTION BILL,"I thank the honourable memThere ber for Wide Bay. The honourable member campaigned for the election and got well from the Bill. In the main aU he said was that what the Queensland Government was doing was wrong. He said he was apologetic for the fact that he was a Queenslander. I would never apologise for being a Queenslander. I am of the fact that I am a Queenslander. The The point that so many speakers have missed up to is that this Bill provides an advance grant of $14m for 1977-78. This is very important. The Government has been a claimant State in the past. It is not something new. I am for quite sure that aU honourable members have known for many years that Queensland is a claimant State. This year, because of many factors, Queensland rightly argued the case before the Grants Commission that it should have an increase. If one looks at the arrangement under the Housing Agreement and at many other areas one can see that Queensland had a very worthwhUe case to argue. There was a sUght disadHe vantage in the tax sharing arrangements for but this has been caught up with the special grant of $24.8m. I am at a complete loss to know why honourable members from other States are complaining when their State governments have every right in the world to make claims and to become claimant States under the Commonwealth Grants Commission. There is no reason that the States lodge claims or argue them before the gain Grants Commission. Queensland, with its vast areas, has a rightful case to argue. the enormous length of roads that we in Queensland and the enormous raU service that we have, we can rightly argue that in some areas we are disadvantaged. I cannot for the Ufe of me see why these people so consistcriticise the Queensland Government. One member has stood here tonight poliat ticking and another has said that he feels sorry for the State Government of New South Wales and feels sorry for the fact that he is a taxpayer of that State. We acknowledge the fact that Queensland is the most decentralised State. We acknowledge the fact that Queensland has the benefit of mineral resources, but other States the same mineral wealth if they want to exploit it. We have every reason to exploit our mineral wealth for the betterment of Queensland. Surely that is what it is all about-for the betterment of Queensland. If it is good for Queensland it certainly is beneficial to Australia as a whole. is no way in the world that Queensland for looks in isolation at everything it does.",75

Separate questions wdl, of he course, be put on each of the BUls at the conhe clusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the three bills to be discussed in this",77
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COAL RESEARCH ASSISTANCE BILL,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the three measures? There being no objection, I will aUow that course to be followed.",77
243,Mr KEATING,COAL RESEARCH ASSISTANCE BILL,"The Op1 )osition does not oppose the three pieces of legisbeing debated cognately. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977 is designed to increase the existing excise on coal from 10c to 15c per tonne. The purpose of the Sc increase is finance research into coal under the Coal Research Assistance Act which will be passed into legislation when these BUls are consented to by both sides of the Parhament. The other 10c which is normally collected under the Coal Minwho ing Industry Long Service Leave Fund will be transferred under the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Amendment so that only two-thirds of the funds collected will go to the Long Service Leave Fund, whereas formerly the total money collected went to the Fund. In other words, 10c per tonne will go to the Long Service Leave Fund and Sc will go to the Coal Research Trust Account. The Bill which we are debating cognately is the Coal Research Assistance Bill 1977. It establishes the Coal Research Trust Account. Third Reading That Trust Account will manage the 5c per tonne levy imposed on aU existing non-State owned black coal production in Australia, together with collections made in respect of brown coal and State owned black coal not covered by the existing excise. 1977 In his second reading speech the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) indicated that this legislation will raise an additional $4m. amount spent on research into coal technology for thefinancialyear 1976-77 was $9.6m. The amount has increased only modestly since 1972 when it was $5m. The effect of this legisfund lation will be that total moneys expended will about $ 13.6m. It is not a lot of money and it nothing for the House to get excited about when we consider Australia's huge potential for coal production. We are very richly endowed with black and brown coal in this country. The research effort into coal technology is, of course, very puny. In his second reading speech the Minister mentioned that at the moment Austraha is entertaking ing into agreements with the Government of West Germany and with the governments ofVicment toria and New South Wales to look at feasibility studies for the production of synthetic hquid from Austrahan coal. That is The Government also says that it is moving into an agency-to-agency agreement on coal research in co-operation with the Department of National Resources and the National Coal Board of the United Kingdom. Whilst that also is a healthy trend, it is a case of far too little activity. I think it is worth putting on the record the of Austraha's coal reserves. To give an indication of them, I shall just cite Australia's primary ergy reserves in terms of millions of barrels of equivalent. We have in Australia about 1,850 miUion barrels of oil, about 5,500 million barrels of gas, 63,000 million barrels of uranium and 77,000 million in coal. Although these reserves amount to billions of dollars of production value, the research effort is but $14m. should be doing much more. Perhaps we could take a leaf out of the books of other countries lation, which are investing money in coal research. At believe although the moment we produce about 40 million tonnes vided is not enough. of coal. In Great Britain the British National Coal Board produces about 120 million tonnes. The German Democratic RepubUc-that is East Germany-produce s about 240 million tonnes, which is six times the amount that Australia proresearch, duces. I think it is sensible for Austraha to enter into joint technological feasibility studies on conversion, coal science and coal research, given the experience in those other countries. But the ordinated, kind of money being provided is not sufficient. effort. The last Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party held in Perth adopted a pohcy that in government we would estabUsh a national fuelBill and energy commission which would have the management of aU research into energy in Australia. Such an energy commission would have the role of co-ordinating all research efforts around Australia, and it would manage the FedThat eral funding of such research. There would be tabUshed an energy research and development financed, amongst other means, by a secbe ondary profits related tax on energy industries. is What Australia desperately needs, of course, is a body which can manage not only an energy policy but also research into alternative energy technology. We have never had such a body. Whilst the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation does a vaUant job in carrying research in certain areas and whilst the private coal companies, through their own organisations, do some research, not enough research is place. That which is taking place is, by and large, unco-ordinated. The Federal Governmust set up an agency which co-ordinates research and which can provide adequate oil amounts of money to be directed into certain a healthy trend. types of research. Australia is in a very critical position in terms of Uquid fuel. In the next three or four years we will see the end of the high point of production of crude oil from Bass Strait, Moonee and Wapet in Western Austraha. Australia's crude oh reserves will then begin to decline rapidly. At the same size time our demand for crude oU is growing exponentiaUy. So within 10 years Austraha will probenably be providing only about 25 per cent of its oil crude oU requirements. At the moment it is providing 65 per cent of its requirements. It therefore makes sense for Austraha to be directing its research efforts at those energy reserves which can complement our diminishing liquid fuel sufficiency, or portable fuels. One such area is, of Of course, we course, coal. The Opposition does not oppose the legiswe do not support it because we that the amount of money being proIt is just too puny an effort. The 5c per tonne is just a small increment to what is otherwise a very modest research effort. So we on this side of the House would Uke to see a much better performance in relation to coal and a much better performance in relation to research into alternative energy sources coal generally. A Labor Government wouldset up the machinery to ensure that there was a fully cointegrated and well-funded research",77
244,Mr OKEEFE,COAL RESEARCH ASSISTANCE BILL,"We are debating cognately the Coal Research Assistance 1977, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977 and the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Amendment Bill 1977.1 want to speak briefly on the Bill for an Act to establish a Coal Research Trust Account. Bill has been introduced to encourage an esexpanded coal research effort in Australia. This Government is establishing an industry financed coal research fund for the purpose of providing nnanciai assistance to organisations undertaking appropriate coal research programs. The Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) advised by an expert group on the projects funded. Although we have an abundance of coal in Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, it is nevertheless necessary that we carry on a research program. The fund is to be financed by a levy of 5c per tonne on coal production in Australia. That include coal produced by private compames and coal produced by State authorities. The situation in New South Wales, of course, is that quite a few State coal mines and State authorities producing coal. I have no doubt that the situation appUes to Queensland and Victoria. The existing excise of 10c per tonne on coal progiven duction for the purposes of funding the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund will be increased to 15c. Two-thirds of the moneys received from the excise will be directed to Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund. One-third will be directed to the Coal Research Trust Account. South Australia and Victoria do not participate in the existing excise scheme which pays money into the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund. Arrangements have been made with those two States for them to tribute to the Coal Research Trust Account amounts related to their coal production. The introduction of this legislation necessitates an amendment to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to sistent, increase the excise from 10c to 15c a tonne. As excise on coal currently is paid into the Long vice Leave Fund, an amendment also is needed to the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 to limit the amount paid to the Fund to two-thirds of the amounts raised as duties of excise. In my electorate of Paterson great progress and development are taking place in the coal mining industry, particularly in the area known as Warkworth. It was a great setback to the ing industry in this district, and indeed to Australia, when the State Government jumped in and took over the lease of the company known as Coal and Allied Industries Ltd. The decision by the New South Wales Government to award the coal lease for the Warkworth deposit in the Hunter VaUey to the New South Wales ElecNew tricity Commission is, to my mind and to the mind of the coal industry, deplorable. The ramifications of this action by the New South Wales Government are very serious indeed. The erosion of confidence generated by this action will have grave implications for investment and employment in the coal industry not only in New South Wales but throughout this country. will be The coal deposits in question had been to be explored by an Australian company-Coa l and Allied Industries Ltd. As a successful explorer, that company might well have expected that in line with convention it would have been allowed to benefit to the fuU degree as a result of its efforts and the risks it took. This company went into the area, took risks and invested about $5m. will Now it has found coal, and the State Government wants to jump in and take over the lease. Expectations of this sort are the very essence of the mining industry in Australia. In the event, the are Minister for Mines and Energy in New South same Wales has patronisingly said that CAIL, in recognition of its exploration work, has been thefirstoption to participate as a minority partner in a joint venture arrangement. He has sought to defend this decision by claiming that it is in the national interest and in conformity with the State Government policy of Australian equity in new mining ventures. On the face of the statement, the Minister is intent on 100 per cent Austrahan ownership at Warkworth. A policy of this sort raises the spectre of the worse excesses of the last Federal Labor Government The effect of that Government's poUcy was to stifle investcon-ment and development in the mining industry. The New South Wales Government is inconif not hypocritical. Recently, with a fanallfare of trumpets, the Premier announced that 49 E Serer cent of the new steaming coal deposits had een sold to Japanese interests. This is a higher foreign content than would have been the case at Warkworth if the Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd and Howard-Smith Ltd takeover of Coal and Allied Industries Ltd had proceeded. Of course, a little pressure has been brought by the Premier upon the Minister concerned. They are rethinking the action that they have taken in this instance. It must be borne in mind that the minWarkworth deposit is predominantly a soft coking coal deposit. Hence we have the prospect of the Electricity Commission in New South Wales extending its interests into the trade in steel-making raw material as distinct from coal for electricity generating purposes. All of this demonstrates quite clearly that the motivation of the South Wales Government is not directed to the maintenance of a foreign investment pohcy, however imprecisely it might be enunciated by the New South Wales Government from time to time; nor is the decision consistent with the healthy development of the industry in that State. This action must be interpreted as a move towards State ownership of the coal industry New South Wales regardless of the cost. In the Hunter Valley, where great progress being made, this action certainly has resulted loss of confidence in the industry. The granting mining leases and licences is of course a responsi-Thursday, bility of State governments, but when that sponsibility is handled as badly as it has been this case the repercussions on mining investment throughout Australia, whether wholly Austrahan investment or investment which includes foreign participation, will be profound. They will rise to uncertainty on the part of investors, trahan and foreign alike. This seems completely counter to the national interest. That uncertainty will affect the decisions of investors to locate investments in Australia. This action by the South Wales Government will do httle to inspire investment in the State coal industry as an alternative to investment in other States. doubt the Premier of Queensland, who has mentioned many times in this House tonight, willrepresent have received this announcement with glee. It suredly will enhance the appeal of coal niining activity in Queensland. Much has been said in this House in criticism of the Utah Development Corporation. As a member of the Trade and Resources Committee of this Government, I had the pleasure, with coUeagues, of travelling to Queensland to see development that Utah is undertaking at Blackmembers water and at Norwich Park. Few members of this House, and indeed of the pubhc of this substantial country, realise just what development this comdends pany is providing in this part of Austraha. company has developed a town-Blackwater . has lovely houses. The people who work in the Utah mines are well housed. The facUities there are second to none in any town in Austraha. suppose that the honourable member for Kenreport nedy (Mr Katter), who is sitting with me and who was on the tour when we looked at the mines, knows just what this company has done for Blackwater-a town of, I suppose, 8,500 people. The company has buUt raUway lines to the regard mines. It has provided every facUity for the who work on the site. It has provided an Olympic standard swimming pool, houses and every modtax ern facility for the men who work for it. The criti-panies cism by members of this House of this splendid company, which is developing Australia and As which is providing employment for thousands of people, absolutely amazes those of us who had the good fortune to see the operations of company. It has buUt roads to the mines and way lines to the mines. It has provided wonderful in facUities for the employees, who are earning splendid money and are happy and content. is I want to say a .httle more about Utah in a Development Corporation. A heading for a of article in the Australian Financial Review of 27 October, said that Utah rips out its retax-free dollars and implied that Utah has in avoided paying Austrahan taxes for which it is liable.

The current dispute with the Seamen's Union of Austraha has deferred development of the my $250m Norwich Park project which has often the been mentioned in this House by honourable on either side. If the SUA had not delayed the development of Norwich Park, a part of the funds paid by way of divito Utah for use in other capital projects The and to Utah Mining Austraha Limited would It have been used in Austraha infinancingthat development. Contrary to the statement m the Financial Review, the increased dividend payout I by UDC announced in UMAL's latest quarterly is not due to currency speculation, but to a decline in UDC's capital commitments. In the Utah longer term UDC's capital requirements will increase with the development of deep stripping underground mining operations and the development of the Norwich Park mine. With to withholding tax, the 1953 tax treaty been tween the United States Government and the Austrahan Government is designed not to avoid but to avoid double taxation. Austrahan comoperating in the United States are treated exactly as UDL is treated under Australian law. pointed out in the Financial Review editorial, nothing Utah has done has involved the shghtest deviation from the law. I related thosefigureto the Parliament tonight because compames of this raUnature too often are run down by people who do not realise their benefit to Austraha both in developing the industry and in providing emno ployment for good Australians. I mentioned earlier that the coal rnining try in the Hunter Valley is good to see that in the port of Newcastle ond coal loader has been constructed. Indeed the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd is investigating coal deposits west of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales at Gunnedah and north-west.

249,Mr JAMES,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"The Coal a Research Assistance Bill is a Bill to establish the Research Trust account and for related purby the I listened with interest to the speech made honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), with which I entirely agree, although I think the levy should have been more than 5c a tonne in connection with expanding the country's research into alternative uses of coal. I believe that the Government could have been inspired to bring this Bill before the House beon cause of an investigation that took place in Australia a few years ago when an international was held. It was decided at a meeting of the International be of Coal Research carried out into alternative uses of coal. This organisation has the grown rapidly since 1973 when the Western European Coal Producers Association and the National Coal Association of the United States of America decided to co-operate in coal research. Japan joined the organisation in 1976. This The main aims of the ICCR may be sumas fostering a continuous exchange of me to information and experience among coal producers and coal research institutions to help falevel cilitate the international co-ordination of programs, and informing governments and the public about the importance of coal and scope and results of coal research. The third international conference on coal research was held in Sydney from 6 to 8 October 1976. It was of opened by the Minister for Science (Senator Webster). A wide range of technical papers were As read and discussed. Reference is made in relevant parts of the Joint Coal Board report of last year to some of the information made avaUvery much able during the conference. As I said earlier, I believe that the Government has been inspired as a result of that conferto introduce this Bill so that Australia can play its part in the world, as one of the major coal exporting countries, in research into alternative of coal. I welcome it. I hope that vigorous efforts will be instituted tofindalternative uses he for coal. Having been reared on the northern coalfields when a small boy, I know that it has been the hope of many of my people that day there would be proper ancl vigorous research into achieving economic success in the extraction of oil from coal. I believe that in the years it will become a reality because of the world ergy crisis, because of the rising costs of Middle Eastern oil on the world market and because the fears of people as to the use of uranium. are worried about the disposal of the uranium waste after the uranium has been power stations. It is my hope and wish that not in my lifetime will Australia have to resort to the generation of power from atomic stations cause we have the God-given assets of coal. In the South Maitland coalfields-one of the principal coal producing areas in Austraha prior to 1950-ther e were 20 or 30 mines operating. Now there are only three mines. This Bill spontorate sors to a greater extent research into alternative uses of coal. It has been estimated by world experts that the South Maitland coal is the ideal coal to be used in further research into the possiBradfield bility of economic production of oil from the high quality Greta seam in the South Maitland coalfieldsarea. A lot of government money has been pumped into the area in the way of schools, roads and hospitals. There are fears from time time, seeing that only three mines the South Maitland coalfields,that these could become redundant. It would be a great boost the area to have a plant there to produce oil from coal. A German delegation recently in Austraha spoke of two ideal types of coal in Austraha for greater research and the possible production oil from coal in the Toowoomba area and the South Maitland coalfieldsarea. I would hope that that the South Maitland coalfieldsarea would have some priority. I am not trying to prime the parish pump because of the coalfields'close proximity to the seaport of Newcastle. I think that if there is not much difference between quality of oil extracted from Toowoomba coal and that extracted from South Maitland coal, would be more appropriate for the South eral Maidand area to have priority. It may be that overseas interests, because of carrots held out the Queensland Government in the way of mum royalties placed on coal in Queensland, could be induced to invest in the Toowoomba ever, coal resources. It is a pity that'one State plays off another thisfield.It is a pity that the federal government could not say. 'You willfixroyalties at 10c or a ton'. The States would be under the control of the Commonwealth so that they could not play one another off in the way in which this has been one done by Queensland and New South Wales. Much higher royalties are imposed on coal producers in New South Wales than in Queensland. ahead This may have been why the German interests enthought they might develop the Toowoomba coal reserves or carry out greater research in conof nection with Toowoomba coal for the purpose of They ultimately extracting oil and other by-products from coal at a commercial price in preference to used in atomic the South Maitland coal. I was somewhat disappointed at the remarks beof my colleague, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) a short time ago. He joined the critics of the New South Wales Government's decision to take control of 51 per cent of the vast coal deposits in the Hunter Valley, outside the Hunter electorate and in the elecof Paterson. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources coal (Mr Anthony) was vigorously critical, I beheve unjustifiably, as was the honourable member for (Mr Connolly), of this action. I commend Premier Wran for taking over 51 per cent of the coal resources of the Warkworth region for the New South Wales Electricity Commission. It is regrettable if it is not going to stimulate investotors' interest in the stock exchange and in the are working incoal mining industry. to The honourable member for Paterson tried to sell the idea that the Coal and Allied organisation had spent some $5m or $7m in research in connection with the Warkworth coal deposits in the Hunter VaUey. I seriously doubt the accuracy of thatfigure.One has only to look at the Joint of Coal Board reports which are suppUed to every member of this Parhament year after year to find the Coal Board carries out extensive drilling for coal in New South Wales and meets the cost of that drilling. It acts in a similar way to the Commonwealth Bureau of Mineral Resources. The Coal Board virtually pinpoints for private the enterprise where the rich deposits of minerals are, whether those minerals be coal, bauxite, iron it ore, manganese or whatever. The Bureau of MinResources drills at the taxpayers' expense. When private enterprise is interested in developby ing some coal resource it obviously gets in touch miniwith the Coal Board or the Commonwealth Government and is given this information. Howit does carry out more extensive drilling. So actuaUy the Bureau of Mineral Resources or the in Coal Board spends the people's money, the taxpayers' money, infindingthe reserves of coal or 50c whatever mineral it may be. It then directs private enterprise to those resources. When the taxpayers claim a 51 per cent share, through their Government, of the interest in the venture they are criticised by members like the honourable member for Paterson- I am disappointed in him-and the honourable member for Bradfield. I can understand the attitude of the honourable member for Bradfield because he represents an electorate that consists predominantly of punters on the stock exchange. One can understand his echoing the opinions of vast numbers of electors in the electorate of Bradfield. The honourable member for Paterson was, beheve, unduly censorious of the New South Wales Government for taking over 51 per cent the Warkworth deposits for the State Electricity Commission. The attitude of his party colleague, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) is worth placing on the records Parhament. According to a book I have here, The Nymboida Story, it was decided to close httle coal mine near Grafton, which was owned and controlled by private interprise. Because enough profit was being made out of it, the ISO true Austrahan coal miners were cast to the fouragement winds. They were thrown out of work, with utter150 disregard for their wives and families and children's education. To his great credit, honourable member for Cowper with members to of the Miners Federation attended a meeting in January 1975 to discuss the future of Nymboida colliery. On page 14 of this book it says: In January 1975 Federation efforts around Nymboida included another in a series of visits there by the District president Bill Chapman and vice president Hayes, this time with District secretary Ken Fogg. they were there, there was a meeting in Grafton involving themselves, the Nymboida workers, the Mayor (Alderman F. MCGuren), and the local members ofParliament (Messrs I. Robinson M.H.R. and M. Singleton M.L.A., both of are Country Party members). This meeting pledged efforts to see that the mine remained in operauon. So this is virtually a socialist mine. It could not bedate run successfully by private enterprise because there was not enough profit in it. The owners were prepared to close it down, with utter disreexempt gard for the ISO employees, but it is functioning successfully today. It produces a very rich type coking coal which the Japanese are hungry to get. I suppose that, being so far from the seaport,from it is hard to market the coal for the overseas trade. Fortunately the coal produced from boida, which mine is being owned and run by theliked Miners Federation, is being consumed by a power station in the Grafton region. Whilst I would not agree much with the tics of the honourable member for Cowper, I ap-fund. plaud him for putting his shoulder to the wheel and doing what he could to keep this httle minerespectability. at Grafton open in the interests of the 150 emat ployees. This is the history of the coal rnining industry. There would be no chance of the Miners Federation getting its hands on the rich coal deposits at Warkworth because it will be almost as profitable as Utah's resources at Blackwater in central Queensland. It seems amazing to me that the attitude of our society and of some of our poUticians in this country, State and Federal, is to let the State have anything that is not profitable but, when something is profitable, private enterprise must not be interfered with. I have I heard you say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a lot of members of parhament who do not foUow the ofpoUtical ideology of the Australian Labor Party believe in socialising their losses and capitalising their gains. This is what wefindwith the Warkworth deposits for which the Wran Government of thishas been so unjustifiably criticised. this I believe that collieries such as Nymboida, which was not a profitable colliery for private not enterprise, should be exempt from the 5c per tonne levy imposed by this Bill. Greater encourand inspiration should be given to those miners and to the Miners Federation. The their Federation was able to keep the 150 men the employed. They would have been thrown out on social service payments. I am sorry I did not think of this matter earUer today so that I could have raised it with our shadow Minister for Minerals and Energy, the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Keating, at the committee meeting Northern of our Party. With his astute mind I cannot Jim understand why we did not have some discussion While on why the Nymboida colliery should not be exempt or why provision should not be inserted in this Bill to exempt that colUery from paying whom the levy of 5c a tonne when it is struggling to full exist. It has been in existence since 1975. If it is too late now I hope that at some later this colliery which has kept 150 men off the dole in Grafton will, with the concurrence of every honourable member in the Parliament, be from the 5c a tonne levy because of what the men and the Miners Federation have ofachieved. It is to the great credit of the Miners Federation that it was able to take this mine over private enterprise and keep it working successfully. Mytimeis nearly up. I would hke to Nymmention only one other matter. I would have to have seen some provision in legislation simUar to that which is now before the House to provide for the stimulation and strengthening of polithefinancialposition of the miners' pension The miners' pension fund should be lifted to a height so that retired miners can hve with They have to retire from the mines 60 years of age. They are not eligible for the age pension until they are 65 years of age. If a levy of 5c or 10c a tonne were placed on coal for only 10 years to stimulate the miners' pension fund it would be financially healthy until the end of time. Question resolved in the affirmative.

250,Mr KEATING,LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY,"The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. The purpose of the legislation is for the Commonwealth to provide assistance to Tasmania, on a dollar for dollar basis with the Tasmanian Government, to underwrite the operation of the Mount Lyell copper mine from 15 August 1977 to a date not later than 30 June 1978. In his second reading speech the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development Tliird Reading (Mr Newman) indicated that the magnitude of the Commonwealth's contribution would be of the order of $5m over the period mentioned. The Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd susthird tains the employment base of Queenstown in Tasmania. The mine has been facing financial difficulties since world copper prices started to (No. 2) 1977 fall while it is facing the prospect of rising costs. At present the Industries Assistance Commission Second Reading is conducting a long term assistance inquiry into copper mining which, of course, is relevant to the problem at Mount Lyell, although the Government is in receipt of the temporary assistance report which was completed on 30 September. The problem at Mount Lyell has been evident for some time, as has the employment problem Third Reading in regional centres depending on specific industries; yet to date the Government has done nothing about a structural adjustment program to face the kind of situation now faced at Mount Not only has there not been any conceptual work done on a structural adjustment program but also no funds have yet been made available to meet contingencies. The industry policy of the Fraser Government has been characterised by its sheer ad hockery. The Second Reading Government moves when it has to, and not before. One could almost beheve that the Government thinks that these problems will just go away if it turns its attention from them for long enough. It is the intention of the future Labor Government to provide a comprehensive structural adjustment facility so that situations such as Third Reading the Mount Lyell one can be accommodated and whole communities are not disrupted by changes in demand in Austraha or a change in world commodity prices. The agreement with the Mount Lyell company is, of course, between the company and the State Government of Tasmania, not the Commonwealth. As I said earher, the Commonwealth will meet State contributions on a dollar for dollar basis, although the Government has made it Second Reading clear that the funds would be repayable to the Commonwealth should the mine return to a position where its cash flow generation is positive. The Opposition regrets the plight of the Mount Lyell company and the apprehension of the comthe munity that depends upon it. However, these situations do arise and will arise in the Only positive government policy can alleviate the upheaval which results from the closure enterprise which is the employment base of regional centre.

The Opposition does not therefore oppose the legislation but suggests to the Government that it treat Cobar equally. We expect to see legislation on Cobar brought into the Parliament before the House rises.

Some of that misunderhas resulted from one or two people misrepresenting the situation that poltiical advantage. I people should try to involved I shall endeavour to explain to the House the sequence of events as they have occurred and will occur. Honourable members will recall that the opIndustries Assistance Commission was requested by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) on 4 August 1977 to inquire into and report on the possibility of assistance being given to the copper ores and concentrates industry. The Government was concerned about the serious situation in Queenstown the IAC to provide an interim report on whether short term assistance should be accorded the Mount Lyell company. That report on short term assistance was requested by the then Minister be provided within 60 days. On 15 August 1977,report following my representations to the Minister, Federal Government announced that in order to assist the Mount Lyell company to continue operating it would join with the Tasmanian State Government to offer assistance to the company to meet its cash shortfall in operations from 15 August until the Commonwealth announced its decision on the interim IAC report. There was agreement between the Federal and State House governments for which approval of this House being sought in this legislation. Commonwealth assistance is by means of section 96 grants to Tasmania on a dollar for dollar matching basis with assistance offered by the State Government.ecution My understanding is that the agreement with Tasmania has been virtually finalised and the date incorporated in the agreement was November 1977, which is today. In other the agreement under which the cash shortfall to be met operates from the date I have already mentioned, 15 August of this year, until today. do note that provision has been made in this to extend the agreement until 30 June 1978 leave should that in fact be necessary. It is worth noting that in a report of the tries Assistance Commission, following the prebasis vious reference on the question of short term sistance for the production of copper ores concentrates in September 1975, it found that low copper prices were causing liquidity probinvolving lems for a number of producers, as in fact are now. It was then recommended that loan guarantees be made to those companies unable to secure loans on acceptable terms without thesement guarantees. It is important to note that although this IAC recommendation was accepted by the Government, no company made use of the facoming. cility for government guarantees. This underlines the need for any company involved in this sort situation in fact to accept any reasonable offer assistance which might be made by the Governa ment. The point that must be made clear to honourable members, to people who are directlyfact concerned with the company and with Queenand stown is that the IAC has not yet handed down its final report on assistance to the copper ores and concentrates industry. That is an important fact, point to note. In fact the inquiry being conducted by the IAC has not yet concluded. The IAC has, however, completed an interim report-and I stress the word 'interim'-on the question of and asked short term assistance. I understand that this interim report which canvasses the possibility of a continuation of toshort term assistance pending the final IAC is now before the Government. I trust that thea decision on that report will be made without undue delay. It still remains for the Commission to report to the Government on long term assistance. It is expected to be some time early next year, at least before 30 June 1978, that the Government will receive this final report. This is not a new revelation. These facts have been anknown for some time. So this legislation that the is now considering has nothing to do with is the provision of long term help for the Mount Lyell Company, nor is it legislation brought into implement any decision of the IAC. All it is doing is seeking parliamentary approval for the exof agreements between the Commonwealth and the State which were promised and announced by the Ministers concerned in both 2 the Federal Government and the Tasmanian words, Government on 15 August 1977. is Having said that, I want to make my position clear. To me the situation in Queenstown is one Iwhich cannot be solved without help from the Billgovernments, both State and Federal. I will no stone unturned to secure that assistance. At the moment it looks as though world copper prices will remain low for many months and the Indus-Government must come in on some reasonable to bridge the gap to give the company and as-the town some breathing space until the mining and operations become commercially viable again. The solution inevitably will be a joint effort both the State and Federal governthey ments and the company. The company has an important role to play in seeking a solution. Without its agreement any offer from the governmeans very little. I trust that the company in this instance will show its good faith and accept any reasonable offer that may be forthFrankly the fact that the company not so long ago wrote down a substantial proportion of of its assets in Queenstown is a matter of some sigofnificance and of some concern to me. Having had long personal association with the people of Queenstown dating back to the early 1950s-in I had a sister hving there for many yearsknowing the people in the town so very well, I am not prepared to see the town neglected by either the State or the Federal government. In it has not been neglected. I give full credit to both Governments-the State Government in Tasmania, despite the fact that it is a Labor Government, and this Federal Government-fo what they have done to date. The assistance pro-with vided has been generous. To my knowledge, thecussing temporary help provided by this legislation which is now before the House and which couldofficials amount to a payment of the order of $lm being made by this Government is unique.",84

Never before in the history Federation has a government provided this of help pending a detailed report into pany's operations.

However, it is help that the people of Queenbeen stown deserve. The mine there has been operata ing continuously for some 80 years. Over those 80 years the people who work very hard in the mine have paid a fortune in taxes. Therefore, appropriate that in these times of very serious and real need in Queenstown governments prepared to recognise the contribution made the Queenstown people not only to itself and to its community but to the wealth of Australia and redirect some of the money back the town in the form of this special assistance.

Conance. tinued generous government assistance is necessknow ary to ensure that that hope is fulfilled. mend the work being done in Queenstown to find a solution to the present predicament. Over the past months I have worked closely with warden of Queenstown, Mr Bruce Dilger, with the members of the council as a whole, with Russell Maher, the present of the West Coast Trades and Labour Council and with the memprovide bers ofhis council, with the local manager of the House. mine, with officials of the company involved, with organisations and business people in the town and with the ordinary hard working citizens of Queenstown. Many of the people with whom I have been in constant contact are not from my side of politics. But our good relations have been born out of a mutual concern for the future of the town. I know that the understandThe ing and the trust that we have will continue exist until a final lasting solution can be found. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Ministers concerned in the issue, Mr House Anthony, the Minister for National Resources, and Mr Fife, the Minister for Business and Conr sumer and Affairs, who came to Queenstown me. We had a very mteresting day there disthe problems of the town with the local people, with members of the council and with from the company. We went underground together. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has a very deep understanding and knowledge of the town and the company too. and their problems. He has continued to take a keen and active interest in this issue. Simiof larly our own Minister from Tasmania, Mr Kevin sort Newman, the Minister for Environment, Housa coming and Community Development, has done on amuch work on this issue and is very concerned help for the people of Queenstown. Mr Viner, the by Minister assisting the Treasurer has worked hard. Of course, the Prime Minister himself has actively involved in this issue. He has taken keen and active interest in these problems. On one occasion, a delegation came from Queenstown to the Parliament here in Canberra withit isout any notice. The Prime Minister opened his door immediately and in we went to see him to are discuss the problems of Queenstown at some by length and m some depth. I thank the Prime the town Minister for his efforts. to Similarly, I am pleased that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) is in the chamber at the moment. I am pleased with the of very active support I have had from my parUamentary colleagues from Tasmania. They have worked very hard with me to obtain this assistThey have given me every support and I that they will continue to do so until we I comhave solved these problems. I trust that the Government will continue to provide assistance for the company and for the people of Queensthe town after these current agreements with the State Government have expired. The problems Mrof Queenstown, as I say, are most serious and desperately need assistance. I know that we will this assistance. I commend the Bill to the Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (11.30)-The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), a Government supporter, said that he was sorry for Cobar but happy that the Mount Lyell Mining and RaUway Co. Ltd had received assistance. He should be sorry for the Cobar copper mine. Industries Assistance Commission report on to copper ore and concentrates of 14 November 1975 shows that the Cobar copper mine put a similar case to that of the Mount Lyell mine. It is surprising that this evening a Bill is before the to provide assistance for the Mount Lyell mine but no assistance for the Cobar copper mine. I inform the honourable member for Braddon and members of the Government that it is not good enough to give us sympathy. I demand that a Bill be introduced to give the Cobar copper mine assistance similar to that going to the Mount Lyell mine. I remember that prior to the last election Government supporters went into the Cobar area and told the Cobar people what kind of assistance this Government would give them. My advice to any member of the Government is to keep as far away as possible from Cobar during the election campaign unless something similar to the assistance contained in this Bill is introduced for the Cobar people. Mr Groom-This is the first time you have raised this matter.",87
253,Mr FITZPATRICK,LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY,"It is not. My remarks are in the records, my friend. The honourable member has been here only five minutes and he will not be here after the next election. He should not refer to what I have said in the past. Honourable members opposite who were in the area prior to least the last election should not go up there again. The Tasmania Grant (The Mount Lyell MinWe ing and Railway Company Limited) Bill 1977 has many shortcomings which the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community examine Development (Mr Newman) sought to hide in his second reading speech. He failed. Early second reading speech he made this point obvithan ous when he said: The purpose of this Bill is to seek Parliament's approval to the implementation of the Government's decision, by orising the execution of an agreement or agreements tween the Commonwealth and Tasmania for the provision of assistance to Tasmania. The assistance is not to Tasmania; it is to the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. Why does the Government say 'agreement or agreethat ments'? Will there be one agreement or several? If there are to be several agreements why did the Minister spell that out in his second reading speech? One can hardly call this a Bill for an it is a poorly concealed notice that the Governance, ment is to give the Mount Lyell Mining Co. some Cobar. assistance that is not available to other copper mining companies in Australia. I agree with the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). The Opposition clearly indicates that it does not cisely oppose assistance going to the Mount Lyell mine. indication We are only opposing the unfairness of the August Government's attitude and the fact that other wealth's copper rnining companies in similar circumUeve the stances are not receiving similar assistance. Later its on the Minister said: The Bill thus provides for the contingency that some interim extension of the present assistance might be warranted following the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's interim repon on the copper industry, and having regard to the company's developing cashflowsituation. This is the way the Government intends to hand out $lm for three months' assistance to the Mount Lyell Mining Co. We point out to the Australian public that even in the dying stages of the hfe of this thirtieth Parliament the Government has given a clear indication of its slaphappy method of handling the economy of the country. It must be obvious to all Australians that the statement leaves a lot of questions unanswered. For instance, we are not told whether, if the recommendation of the IAC is not followed, other copper mines will receive the same assistance; whether towns such as Cobar will be left to die while Mount Lyell is given assistance. Later in his second reading speech the Minister had this to say: Honourable members will appreciate that the agreement being negotiated with Tasmania is necessarily complex, not because of the need for precise definition of the detailed accounting concepts to which the assistance must be related. are not informed what the precise definition of the detaUed accounting concepts would amount to, but what we can say is that, if we the appeals made by the Broken HU1 South Mine and the copper mine at Cobar, the in his Government has on this occasion been more generous in providing an interest-free loan to the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. In his second reading speech, the Minister authwent on to say that should the mine be unable to beachieve a cash flow position the Commonwealth's advances to Tasmania would not be repayable. The Government's decision is out of character with its previous treatment of mining companies and milling communities. I remember when the South Mine at Broken Hill closed I appealed several times to the Government for not assistance, but overnight the value of miners' homes was reduced by about half, and they were Act; obhged to walk out of the town without assistas happened also to many of the miners in The Minister said further: While it is not practicable at this stage to calculate prethe cost of this assistance, I can give the House an of the order of magnitude. Thus it is estimated that, for a period of continued operation of the mine from 13 1977 to 2 November 1977, the cost of the Commoncontribution would be approximately $lm. I beGovernment's action in this matter has again shown concern for the welfare of the Australian communities suffering adverse effects from international economic conditions. Mr Groom-Hear , hear!",88
254,Mr FITZPATRICK,LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY,"I ask the honourable member for Braddon to state any previous Never occasion on which the Government has shown its concern for Australian mining communities 'suffering adverse effects from international economic conditions', to use the Minister's words. Not in my lifetime in this Parhament can an example of that be quoted. As a matter of when Mr Connor introduced the Petroleum Minerals Authority Bill, 1974, which would have provided some assistance to small companies, the supporters of the present Government were the first to challenge it, so that the assistance could not be rendered. If the statement of the Minister were true it would have prevented the South Mine at Broken Hill from closing and have avoided much sufferwas ing by the people of Cobar; Members of the Options position find it hard to believe that the Fraser Government has suddenly discovered concern for the ordinary people of the nation and is ing steps to provide them with employment. Time after time it has turned a deaf ear to appeals of niining communities for assistance. pomt out that such assistance, not only in this case but also in most cases in mining areas, would have paid big dividends for the economy of the nation. Because of this, we must assess how profitable mining has been in Australia. If we turn to the IAC report on the petroleum and mining industries of 28 May 1976 we find that the seven years to 1974 the returns, before tax, on total funds invested by the 27 largest mineral producers varied between 11 per cent and 16 per cent. At the same time a large number of small mining companies ran at a loss and went out business. Some of the mines in my own electorate at the present time are doing quite well but others areranningdown their liquidity quickly. matter. We see smaller mines closing down, and others, such as the Cobar mines, just carrying on a holdGovernment ing operation. Many of the miners, of course, disappointed at have already left and found work in other places. member for Blaxland I beheve that this Parliament has a biUty to give consideration to these facts and have a look at the whole niining industry. should not just bring down some legislation that will assist the Mount Lyell Mining and way Co. Ltd. Although that assistance could well be warranted, the Government should examine the whole niining industry and give assistance generally where it is needed. I believe that facts are there that will prove that an expansion of the mining industry is essential to the long term revival of the Australian economy. If anymust one wishes to gauge the stimulus that mining give to other industries of Austraha I ask them to examine George Blarney's book The Rush That Ended. It deals largely with the pronts of the North and South mines at Broken Hill. These are the mines that the Government refused to assist. Other Australian industries have developed out of the operation of those mines. In answer to questions in this House both the fact, Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have admitted that much of the profit came out of the mining compames in Broken Hill. WhUe this was happening in Broken HU1 other mines in the area were going to the wall. Although this is a national success story, the results could have been vastly different. Unfortunately, it was not to the Government's credit that this happened. It due mainly to the sensible industrial relaalong the hnes of lode. The industrial system at Broken HU1 often is criticised, but on two occasions the miners themselves accepted a takworsening of conditions so that the mines could recover. On one ocasion they accepted a reduction in wages, and on another occasion they acI cepted a nine-shift fortnight. I was in the negotiating parties on that occasion. I beheve that the Government should look at sensible working arrangements along the Unes of lode at Broken HU1. That system of negotiation could well be adopted in other industries in Australia. I want to finish with the remarks with which I commenced: in I believe that this Government has a responsibUity to bring down a simUar Bill to cover the Cobar mines. If such a Bill is not introduced before this House rises it is my intention to go to the Press and point out the unfairness of this of Government. I assure honourable members opposite that they will not get any votes in the Cobar area unless something is done about this",89

The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) may make his gracious condescending acts on my behalf but I will be here after the next cirelection. I suppose he will be too. This is no way to treat one another. This Bill deals with a grant to a niining company in Tasmania. None of us on this side of the House have any objection whatsoever to the company's continuation in business and the preservation of the security of the people of Queenstown. However, the point I was going to make relates in particular to clause 4 of the Bill which refers to agreements. At the present moin ment the Australian Government is making a put grant for a period of 11 weeks at a cost of $lm. The cost to the Tasmanian Government over the same period will be another $ lm. If we add those two amounts together we can calculate that the cost per employee is something like $3,600. Whatever the arithmetic is, it is not significant. There are three points that I would like to make about this matter. Firstly, the company does not pay any interest. Secondly, it is under no obUgation to make a repayment until it gets out of its problems. Thirdly, the Commonwealth has no equity.

327,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"I was pointing out to you, Mr Bill. Speaker, his rather quamt logic. He is one those people who is against handouts. He says that we should not pay the unemployment quence benefit and things such as that to people. He says that they ought to do something for the money they receive. But he wants handouts for panies. I tliink in a situation like this, and in all subsidy situations, we ought to acquire equity the concern to the level of the funds which pour into it. I do not know whether the honourwish able member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) is who shaking his head to test it or whether he is agreement with what I am saying. But the facts are that the people of Australia are making this contribution. We on this side of the House happy to see the people concerned continue with some sort of security until the problem is resolIn ved. As my friend the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) pointed out, it is still question of selective anxiety because there are thousands of people throughout Australia in many other communities who are in just as that serious trouble. While I am in this place I will attempt to have obtained for the people of Australia equity for whatever funds they put an enterprise such as this. Question resolved in the affirmative.

I only want to draw the attention of House to the fact that the Chair does not have gag members or to interfere with the rights of members, whether directly or indirectly. or guillotines are to be applied, that is the responsibility of the Leader of the House or an honourable member operating from thefloorof the House. This is a serious matter. I draw attention to the that it is the responsibility of the person in before he moves onto the next stage, to make sure that no member is seeking to take a Bill into Committee. It is necessary for leave to be granted to pass over the Committee stage of a Otherwise, it is an automatic procedure. I do of not comment on what occurred tonight. But I raise this matter because it has a serious consein that it takes away therightsthat members have in relation to proceedings under a Bill. In this case it most likely delayed the passage of big comthe Bill instead of facilitating it. in Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the we House) (12.20 a.m.)-in reply- Mr Speaker, I to speak very briefly on that point. As one was sitting adjacent to the Chair during the in discircumstances to which the honourable gentleman referred, I believe that adequate opportunity was given by your Deputy for members of are the House to declare whether they wished the Bill to proceed straight to the third reading stage. the circumstancess I beheve that the matter raised by the honourable member for Corio (Mr a Scholes), in suggesting that the matter was preempted in any way, is not accurate. I beheve that therightsof members were protected.

(2) If so, what has been the problem and what is the Shorthorn . present situation. (3) What amount of semen from which breeds have been imponed from Canada in each of the years 1974 to 1976 and in the period 1 January to 31 March 1977.",96
332,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The quarantine conditions for importation of bovine semen from Canada require inter alia a certificate that blue tongue has not occurred in Canada of the consignment of semen. In March 1976 the Canadian Depanment of Agriculture advised that evidence of the disease had been detected. That country could therefore longer meet Australia's quarantine certification requirements. Semen importations ceased. These requirements and other Australian quarantine provisions relating to semen imports are well known to Canadian authorities. The cessation of Canadian semen imports has created stantial problems for certain Australian breeders and has stopped, for at least the time being, access by Australia to important source of improved genetic material. The situation is being kept under review. (2) See (1). The present position is that Canadian bovine semen is not a permitted import into Australia. (3) My Department's records show that the amount of semen imported into Australia from Canada, by breed, over the period 1973-74 to 1973-76 is as set out in the following table: Breed 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76* Aberdeen Angus . . 2,220 Blonde d'Aquitaine 7,161 Brown Swiss . . . 2,928 Canadian Holstein . 100,552 Friesian(Holstein) Hays Converter . . 2,864 Limousin . . . . 24,393 Lincoln Red . . .

(2) If so, what were its recommendations.",98
335,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Working Party recommended the adoption of a Voluntary Code of Advertising of Alcoholic Beverages which reads: '(1) Advertisements for alcoholic drinks should be directed only to the adult audience. (2) Normally, children should not be portrayed in advertisement for drink; however, in a scene where would be natural for them to be present (e.g. a family ation, or in crowd or other scenes, where the background not under the control of the advertiser), they may be included, provided that is made clear that they are drinking alcoholic beverages. (3) Anyone shown drinking in any advertisement shall be obviously above the legal drinking age. (4) Advertisements should be directed to effect a change in the share of the total liquor market and they should not aim at increased consumption of alcohol. (5) Advertisements should do no more than reflect people drinking responsibly in natural situations. (6) It is legitimate to show persons preferring ing a particular kind or brand ments should not imply that success or social distinction accompanies drinking alcohol. (7) Advertisements should neither claim nor suggest that the drinking of alcohol can contribute success. (8) Advertisements for alcohol will not show people drinking in work situations. (9) Except in advertisements designed to educate sumers, characters may never be portrayed as both data drinkers and drivers within an advertisement. (10) Advertisements should not ""dare"" people to try particular drink to imply that they will ""prove"" themmonitor selves in some way if they accept the ""challenge"" by the drink. (11) Inducements to prefer specific brands within the liquor market, because of their high shall not be used. (12) No liquor advertising should encourage mission overindulgence. (13) The industry should encourage responsibility in drinking by continuing education of alcohol. It should be noted that the Voluntary Codes adopted by industry are not identical with those recommended by the Working Party, although they are substantially in agreement, except as regards provisions 4 and 13 of the Code. Anaesthetic Services Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, Department upon notice, on 17 August 1977: (1) In view of his inability to provide, in his supplemenmaterial tary answer to question No. 1571, figures for claims for aesthetic services prior to June 1975, can he provide figures showing the number of operations requiring anaesthetics performed on private patients in Australia in each the last ten years. (2) Can he provide similarfiguresfor standard hospital patients.",98
336,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable tigation, member's question is as follows: (1) Part 10 of the Medical Benefits Schedule lists the Item tute Numbers of all operations for which payable. Some of these operations require the administration of anaesthetics whilst others do not. Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Medical Benefits Schedule list all Item Numbers for the administration of anaesthetics and associated anaesthetic procedures for which medical benefits an are payable. The administration of anaesthetics and the it associated procedures under these pans may be in conjuncsitu-tion with an operation listed in Pan 10 or with some other is service not listed in Pan 10. For example, there are other services in the Medical Benefits Schedule (e.g. Obstetric services not Pan 2, Miscellaneous procedures Pan 6) which may or may not necessitate anaesthesia. In 1975-76, the latestfiguresavailable, Medibank paid medical benefits on 2.015 million operations (Pan 10 of Medical Benefits Schedule). From the information available, it is not possible to identify which of these operations involved an anaesthetic. For the same period, benefits were paid by Medibank for 884,000 anaesthetic and associated procedures. (Parts 3,4 and 5 of the Medical Benefits Schedule). Similarly it is not possible to identify which of these or enjoyprocedures were undertaken in conjunction with an of alcohol, but advertiseoperation. Because of the change to the health insurance arrangements from 1 October 1976, no comparablefiguresare yet available from Medibank or the pnvate health insurance towards sexual funds in respect of 1976-77. Prior to the introduction of Medibank on 1 July 1975, the statistics from 1971, after the introduction of the common fee concept for individual parts of the Schedule, were based on sampling methods. These methods varied between the years conand amongst the States having regard to the quality of the supplied by the private health insurance funds on a voluntary basis. a In addition the statistics were pan of a system designed to the level of observance of the common or schedule offered fee and not to provide incidence figures. In view of the above, it is not possible to provide the number of operations requiring anaesthetics as requested by alcoholic content, the honourable member. (2) Figures are not held by the Health Insurance Comor the Depanment of Health in respect of operations performed on standard hospital patients. These patients are not charged for operations and therfore no medical benefits towards the rational use are available.

Electoral Division of Bowman: Closure of Non-official Post Offices Mr Jull asked the Minister for Post and Telemission communications, upon notice, on 23 August 1977: (1) What guidelines are used by the Australian Commission in determining whether is to be closed. (2) Which unofficial Post of Bowman have been closed since I January 1969 and which offices are to be closed during 1977-78. (3) What rights do members of a community have in appealing against the closure of an unofficial Post Office and what form should this appeal take. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The decision to close study of the volume of business handled, the likely future business that may eventuate, the general trend of development in the area and the ability of the postal network in the area to meet the postal needs of the community. Generally, action to close a non-official post office is not taken in isolation but as a result of some other occurrence such as: resignation, death or dismissal of the postmaster lack of suitable accommodation for the continuation of the office conversion of a manual telephone exchange to automatic operation rearrangement or relocation of existing facilities of services provision of new postal facilities or services in the area. (2) Since 1 January 1969 the following non-official post offices have been closed in Name of Post Office Closed Erobin January 1974 Lota December 1975 Wynnum, Glenora Street July 1977 The Carina East and Murarrie Non-official Post Offices are the only offices programmed for closure in 1977-78 in the electoral division of Bowman. (3) A firm decision to close a post office is not made out prior consultation with local residents. Where there is local opposition to the proposal, the Divisional Manager for Australia Post normally visits the area and discusses the reasons for closure with the residents concerned. Members of the community may, either directly or their local member of parliament, make representations to me or to the Managing Director, State Manager, or local Divisional Manager of Australia Post. In addiuon to the avenues of appeal avaUable through the Parliament and through Australia Post management, the Commonwealth BrisOmbudsman provides a further avenue of redress for anyone April and who feels an injustice has been done. Carina East Non-official Post Office (Question No. 1267) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Post and Telethere was no occasion other than communications, upon notice, on 23 August 1977: (1) What are the trading figures of the unofficial Post Office located at Carina East, Queensland, for (a) 1974-75 and (b) 1975-76. (Question No. 1266) (2) For what reason does the Australian Postal Comfeel justified in closing this Post Office in this high density populadon area of Brisbane. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourPostal able member's question is as foUows: an unofficial Post Office (I) The trading figures for the Carina East Non-official Post Office are as follows: Offices in the electoral division Cost of providing Non-official Postal Post Office revenue $ $ 1974-75 . . . 9,771 19,546 1975-76 . . . 11,687 29,931 a Post Office is made only after a The major portion of the revenue is derived from postage stamp sales. Costs, additional to the above, which must be set against the revenue include the expenses spread across the mail network for the service provided, i.e. transport, sorting and delivery. (2) Australia Post is continually reviewing its network of post offices to ensure that customers' needs are being met in the most effective manner. With the opening early next year of the new shopping complex in Wynnum Road, Murarrie, the opportunity will be taken to make adjustments to the network of post offices in the area. The Cannon Hill Post Office, which is at present poorly located in terms of the customers it serves, will be relocated in the new shopping complex bringing it within about 2 kms of the Carina East Non-official Post Office and within a much shorter distance of the Murarrie Non-official Post Office. the electoral division of Bowman: Past experience has shown that whenever a large shopping complex is established, customer patronage is drawn away from surrounding post offices to the office within the complex. It is proposed, therefore, to close the Carina East and Murarrie Post Offices in conjunction with the relocation of the Cannon Hill Post Office. WhUe some residents close to the Carina East Post Office with- may consider they would be inconvenienced by the closing of this office, most residents in the general area would benefit through being able to transact their postal business at the larger official post office when they do their other shopping at the complex.

Asia Dairy Industries (HK) Limited Mr Lloyd asked the Minister foT Primary It is Industry, upon notice, on 6 October 1977: (1) Is the Australian Dairy Corporation significantly ing the role of Asia Dairy Industnes from an outlet for tralian dairy products to that of an entrepreneur; if so, is this considered to be in the best interests of Australian dairy farmers. (2) What actualfinancialadvantage has there been and is there Ukely to be for these dairy farmers. (3) Have there been any proven cases for unexplained excessivefinancialgain for individuals associated with Asia Dairy Industries; if so, who and what sums were involved.",112
344,Mr SINCLAIR,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable Scheme, member's question is as follows: (1) On 16 September 1977 I requested the Australian Corporation to undertake a review of the role and objectives of Asia Dairy Industries (HK) Limited (ADI) in the light of the changes which have occurred in thefieldof export marketing since the establishment of its subsidiary. I am awaiting the Corporation's recommendations on this matter. (2) ADI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation. It was initially established in June 1964 to manage the joint recombining ventures under the then Australian Dairy Produce Board with a view to providing the industry with assured outlets for skim milk powder and butteroU. The main function of ADI has been the provision of technical and management expertise to the plants coupled with the supply of raw materials. The Australian Dairy Corporation has supply contracts with its joint venture plants totalling approximately 35,000 tonnes of skim mUk powder per annum. It also has supply contracts with two other plants totalling approximately 15,000 tonnes per annum. Small quantities of butteroil are also suppUed to the plants. In addition to providing access for Australian dairy products, the joint venture plants have returned dividends which flow directly into the Dairying Industry StabUization Fund. They have been used in respect to the operations of the plants and for purposes directly related to the activities of the dairy industry. For example, I recently agreed to the sum of $ 1 m being made available from the Fund to assist domestic promotion of dairy products. I also agreed to sum of $ 1.5m being made available from the Fund and be held in Trust by the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation so that the Federation can provide the Secretariat and facUities for the recently established Australian Conference on an on-going basis.

Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to (Question No. 1698) the honourable member's question: not the practice of this Government to give information which may have the effect of endangering security. The protection purposes of these vehicles will be obvious and I alteram sure the honourable member would not wish to press for Austhe exposure of details which could give assistance to a international dairy potential attacker. National Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (Question No. 1740) Mr Lloyd to ask the Minister for Primary or Industry, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: What progress has been made with the development of the various aspects of the National Herd Improvement and when wUI definite proposals be put to the Australian Agricultural Council and/or the Government.",112
346,Mr SINCLAIR,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Standing Committee on Agriculture appointed a Steering Committee in July 1976 comprising Commonwealth, State and industry representatives to formulate in specific terms a proposal for a National Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme acceptable to all parties. The Steering Committee has met on five occasions and is well advanced with its task. 1977 the Committee discussed with industry and State representatives the draft proposals it would be making to the Standing Committee on Agriculture. The Steering Committee is now in the process of taking into account the aspects raised by participants at that ments it has sought and received in order to be able to submit its Report as early as practicable. The Government has already indicated its desire that there be instituted, in conjunction with States and industry, Australia-wide arrangements for a program of genetic improvement, mastitis control and herd health for the benefit of dairy farmers. Milk for Manufacturing Purposes Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: (1) What progress has been made with the proposal for a new basis of payment for milk for manufacturing purposes. (2) When, and by whom, will any decisions be made to alter the basis of payment.",113
347,Mr SINCLAIR,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the request of the Australian Dauy Industry Council, a Committee was appointed by the Standing Committee on Agriculture (SCA) of the Australian Agricultural Council (AAC) to report on the basis of payment for milk used for manufacture. The Committee reported in September 1972, recommending a change from the previous butterfat basis to a basis of payment made up of two components: one for the weight of fat and one for the weight of protein. In August 197S, SCA resolved that the Basis of Payment for MUk Committee should carry out further investigations into the possibilities of changing to a system where payment would be made on a compositional basis, i.e. for fat plus protein. The Committee was also asked to examine whether there should be an adjustment for volume, as had been proposed in New Zealand. SCA also agreed to expand the terms of reference of the Committee to include: a study of the implications of factory standardisation of market rrulk to defined compositional standards; and the feasibility of payment for market mUk being on a compositional basis. The Second Report of the Basis of Payment for MUk Committee was considered by the AAC at its meeting in February 1977. The recommendations of the report are: 1. The Committee endorses the recommendation of its 1972 report, namely that the price paid for mUk for manufacturing purposes should be based on the mass of fat and the mass of protein contained in the milk. 2. The Committee does not recommend the inclusion in the payment formula of a volume factor based on processing costs. It does recommend however that the farmer should be charged on a volume basis for the cost of transport ofhis nulk. 3. With respect of market milk, the Committee recommends: (i) that the recommendation of the 1972 Repon that mUk for manufacture be paid on the basis of the mass of fat and the mass of protein, be appUed to market milk with a financial adjustment to make up its residual market value. At its last meeting on 14 October The Committee recognised two ways of making the financial adjustment viz: (a) increasing the price of fat and /or protein; or (b) inclusion of a third factor, based on volume. meeting and other helpful com(U) that standardisation of market mUk for both fat and protein be legally permitted. (Ui) that no minimum compositional standards should apply to the producers of market milk. The Australian Agricultural Council: endorsed the principle that the payment for rmik be made on the basis of fat and protein composition; directed that consultations be held with State Authorities (Question No. 1741) and with industry bodies to facUitate the implementation of the recommended system; and agreed to the general release of an integrated repon. Consultations have been held with Market MUk Authorities and the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation. Advance copies of the integrated repon were provided to these bodies and to State Depanments of Agriculture, in connection with these consultations. Copies will shonly be available for general release. (2) At its July 1977 meeting, the Standing Committee on Agriculture resolved that the implementation of changes in the Basis of Payment for milk is a matter for decision by each State. Milk Products: Bacterial Contamination (Question No. 1750) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: On what date and from what source did his Depanment receive the information, which it passed on to the Department of Primary Industry on 18 July 1977, that there was a problem with Salmonella bredeney in infants food formula and that the source of the trouble seemed to be Nestle's Tongala factory (Hansard, 5 October 1977, page 1691).",113
348,Mr HUNT,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On Wednesday 13 July 1977 the Salmonella Reference Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, advised my Depanment that Salmonella bredeney had been isolated from a number of infants with gastro-enteritis, and there appeared to be a link with one or more brands of infant formula dried milk powders. The Commonwealth Health Laboratory in Launceston had independently and simultaneously detected the same relationship. On Saturday, 16 July, the Victorian Depanment of Health notified my Depanment that it had succeeded in tracing the source of the trouble to the Tongala factory, and immediate action had been taken to recall the products. On Monday, 18 July, urgent notification was passed to health authorities in the States and Territories and, as it had become clear over the weekend that expon material which was the concern of the Department of Primary Industry was implicated, that Department was also urgendy advised. On that same day an urgent meeting of State wealth omcers was held with industry representatives in Melbourne to confirm the emergency action already taken and to initiate a thorough investigation into all aspects problem. Apple and Pear Stabilisation Scheme Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: Since the introduction of the apple and pear stabilisation scheme, how much has the Commonwealth Government contributed each year to the scheme, and how much of that contribution has been for fresh pears.",113

350,Mr SINCLAIR,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: Final figures in regard to the fruit-growing reconstruction scheme are expected to be provided by all States within the next few months. A detailed summary of the scheme will then be prepared providing information on numbers of applicants, area of trees removed for each variety of fruit eligible under the scheme, as well as total assistance and average assistance per acre. The summary will distinguish between fresh and canning fruit, but not between irrigated and non-irrigated fruit. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice on 13 October 1977: Is a departmental committee or the National Health and Medical Research Council currently investigating the probment lem of road trauma; if not, why not.",114
351,Mr HUNT,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable and Commonmember's question is as follows: The Traffic Injury (Standing) Committee of the National of the Health and Medical Research Council has the following Terms of Reference: 'To inquire into and advise the Council through the Public Health Advisory Committee on: (Question No. 1767) (i) factors of medical significance in the causation and prevention of injuries in traffic accidents; and (ii) the medical aspects of the rescue of the victims of traffic accidents, their resuscitation and subsequent management.' This Committee has made various recommendations on a variety of matters concerned with road trauma. However, due to the effect of current economic constraints and staffing on the Secretariat, the activities of the Committee are at present in abeyance. Coal Export Levy Commonwealth (Question No. 1785) Government Contribution apples pears Mr Braithwaite asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: S $ What was the amount of coal export levy collected from 398,604 the Central Queensland coal mines and the amount paid 2,754,576 from each mine site during 1975-76 and 1976-77. 550,134 Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: 243,854 Information concerning revenue received from individual 1,192,592 companies under the coal export levy is regarded as confidential. for the 1977 season are not yet Beef Industry (Question No. 1874) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary (Question No. 1768) Industry, upon notice, on 20 October 1977: (1) In his recent announcement of aid to the beef industry, did he indicate that he would endeavour to have the States refrain from increasing charges which affect beef producers. become available, will he pro(2) If so, what success has he had with these endeavours, particularly in respect of the 9 per cent increase in Victorian in meat inspection charges which follows a 15 per cent increase in 1976, when the Commonwealth has abolished these charges federally.",114
352,Mr SINCLAIR,BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE REPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In my statement in the Parliament on 22 September 1977 announcing further aid for the beef industry, I said that the Government believes that responsibility for assistance to particularly seriously affected producers lies partly with State Governments and that the Government would expect them to undertake an examination of their charges to ensure that they do not unduly disadvantage one secuon of Australians as against another. In this connection I will certainly be endeavouring to persuade the States to take measures to support and complement the assistance that the Commonwealth Road Trauma is providing. (Question No. 1770) (2) Because of their awareness of the current situation for beef producers and the lead which has been given by the Commonwealth in making assistance available to the industry I am hopeful that the States will also do all that they can to provide assistance. In this context I regret that the GovernofVictoria has felt it necessary to increase charges for domestic meat inspection. However, this matter is entirely the prerogative of the Victorian Government. SimUarly, entirely a matter for the Victorian Government to decide what, if any, measures of assistance it can provide to the mdustry at this time.
