1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he has seen the report in today's Argus concerning the treatment of the crew of the steamer Queen Helena, which arrived recently from New York. It is there stated that, owing to the action of the Customs authorities ih sealing the stores, the crew were without provisions for many'hours. To make the case clear, I will read the letter addressed by the captain to the Collector of Customs on the subject. It is as follows :Sir,-On the arrival of my steamer, Queen Helena, at Williamstown from New York, at 4 p.m. on the n t h inst., all our stores were sealed up. I pointed out to the boarding officer that it would be after hours when the ship got up to Victoria Dock, and that he had better let me have enough stores for the crew's supper. He said no, and that there would be an officer on. the dock to open up the seal. On arrival at the dock at 5.30 p.m. every one had gone. I went up to a boat loading for China, where a Customs-house officer was working, and told him how I was situated, but he replied that he was sorry, but could do nothing tn the matter, and that there would be no officer about until next morning at 8 o'clock. The consequence was that my people got nothing to eat fro m noon on the n t h until on 12th. I have been twenty years in command of British steamers, but have never received such treatment in any port I have visited before. Will the Minister see that, while the present barbarous law remains on our statute book, Customs officers arc at hand to allow ships' stores to be opened when necessary in order to supply the crew with food ?",12
2,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"The newspaper announcement is the first I have heard of this matter. I had an interview with the Comptroller-General on the subject this morning; but it had not before come under his notice, and he went off immediately to investigate it. In a preliminary report, which reached me just before the meeting of the House, there is a very serious conflict of testimony between the officer concerned and the statements in the captain's letter. The charge made by the captain is a very serious one, and the whole incident most regrettable. I have, therefore, given instructions to have the facts of the case fully investigated, so that I may judge as to what further steps are necessary. PAPUA (BRITISH NEW GUINEA)",13
3,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I notice that the Papua Bill now stands a long way down on the notice-paper, although its consideration in Committee has been almost completed. Does the Prime Minister intend to abandon the measure this session? Mr RF.ID - No .",13
4,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman intends to go on with it?,13
5,Mr REID,Unknown,Yes . CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.,13
6,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Fro m a statement in yesterday's newspapers as to' what it is proposed to do during the remainder of the session, it would appear that the Government desire to pass the Appropriation Bill before other important matters which have yet to be dealt with have been taken in hand. The constitutional usage is that all the important business df the session must be disposed of before the Appropriation Bill is passed. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.:-No .",13
7,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That has been the practice. In any case, I should like to know from the Prime Minister how soon he intends to deal with the Arbitration Bill and the question of preferential trade, ahd 9 a.m. when he intends to fulfil his promise in regard to the appointment of a Royal Commission on the Tariff.",13
8,Mr REID,Unknown,"The newspaper statement Yours, & c , to which the honourable member alludes was E. RlTSON, Master. intended to be a statement, not as to the course of business for the remainder of the session, but covering the events of the succeeding three or four sittings. I am not quite sure that there is any such usage in regard to the Appropriation Bill as the honourable member suggests. I will not say that there is not such a usage, but I am not sure that there is any constitutional difficulty in the way of passing an Appropriation Bill before all the business of the session is completed.",13
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Appropriation Bill was put through last year before a great deal of the business of the session was finished.,13
10,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should be very loth to countenance such a rule as the honourable member suggests in connection with the conduct of business in the Federal Parliament, because there is a very great difference between the position of the Senate, and that of the second branch of the Legislatures of the States in regard to Appropriation Bills, BILL. since they have no power of suggestion in regard to amendments, such as exists in the Senate. The Senate, having the power to make suggestions in regard to Appropriation Bills, it is only reasonable that its members should be given a fair amount of time in which to exercise it, if they desire to do so. The exercise of that power would not be possible if the Appropriation Bill were sent to them in the closing moments of the session. We should show a proper regard for the rights of the other Chamber in reference to measures which come clearly within their constitutional province. Viewed broadly, the usage to which the honourable member for Bland has referred is the proper one, and I 'have no wish to break in upon it. This Chamber will act wisely in not allowing' Appropriation Bills to pass away from its control, while important business remains to be transacted. But whilst regarding that as a wise rule, and one to be observed, 1 think that honourable members will agree with me that we must not go to the other extreme,' and leave the passing of the Appropriation Bill to the last three or four, or perhaps the last two, days of the session, in the expectation that it will be passed hurriedly through another place by the suspension of their Standing Orders. I have no desire to ask the House to pass the Appropriation Bill while there is any business of serious importance still in this Chamber. The honourable member for Bland and myself have practically come to this agreement, that we may fairly take the Appropriation Bill into Committee. There is, however, one part of the appropriations which I think honourable members will readily agree to assent to in the form of a Bill , and send the measure on at once to the Senate- I refer to the appropriations for public works, which are separate from the ordinary appropriations for the year. I have received very urgent representations from the Sydney Trade and Labour Council, urging that works which have been authorized by Parliament shall be dealt with as soon as possible.",13
11,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I suggested some months ago that those Estimates might be passed in advance of the ordinary Estimates.,14
12,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am sure that my honourable friend and honourable members opposite will place no difficulty in the way of that Bill passing through all its stages without delay. I hope indeed that they will help the Government to forward it to the Senate as soon as possible, and I intend to ask them to allow it to be put through all its stages today. Now that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill has been disposed of, there is not a great deal of work for the other Chamber to do; but I should like to avoid any slackening off of the pace there, because they have had a very slack time all through the session. I ask honourable members, in the interests of putting useful works i.n progress with the least possible delaya matter which appeals to the good feeling of everyone in the Chamber-to pass the necessary Bill through all its stages to-night. I promise, however, that the Appropriation Bill proper shall not be taken further than the Committee stage-whic h will leave all its items open for discussion-until other serious business has been transacted. With regard to the appointment of the Tariff Commission, I am happy to say that, despite press' reports to the contrary, the leader of the Opposition has intimated to me his willingness to assist me in securing a thoroughly representative and satisfactory Commission, and in return I can only assure him that the matter will be treated as one of grave urgency. I am making special efforts to settle the personnel of the Commission, which is the first step to be taken, and not an easy one. Now that the subject has been divested of any party significance, I think that we shall be able to come to an agreement on this very important matter without delay. At a later stage,  reply to the honourable member for Bland, stated that the Appropriation Bill would not be passed through Committee until all the serious business before the House had been disposed of. I should like to ask him what Bills he regards as serious.",14
13,Mr REID,Unknown,"As a rule, the serious Bills are those which take the least time to pass; but I am not going fo answer my honourable friend in that way. I look upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as a serious measure- a very serious measure. But there are some other subsidiary measures, such as the Trade Marks Bill, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill , the Papua Bill , and the Defence Act Amendment Bill, to carry out a scheme of which Parliament has already practically approved, which need not delav the Appropriation Bill , in view of our obligation to place it before the Senate within a reasonable time before the prorogation. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The Prime Minister has not yet referred to two or three important measures. I desire to ask him whether he has made any arrangement as to the date upon which the Manufactures Encouragement Bill shall be further considered, and whether he has arrived at any understanding as to the date upon which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat may be permitted to deal with his motion respecting preferential trade. I should also like to know if he can make a definite statement as to when the Tariff Commission is to be appointed.",14
14,Mr REID,Unknown,"I really begin to feel that I am called upon to make a large number of Ministerial statements.' Still, I recognise that I owe it to every honourable member, regardless of the position he may occupy as a leader or otherwise, to give him the fullest information I can with reference to the public business. I can assure honourable members that tKe fact that tKe Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and the motion relating to preferential trade were not mentioned, does not at all mean that those matters are not to receive attention. Unfortunately, owing to an illness in his family, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is not here, an'd I certainly propose to afford him the promised opportunity to proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. pose to consult him as the honourable member in charge of the Bill-and as promised, I shall give honourable members proper intimation-as to the time at which the Bill will be further considered. The honourable member for Ballarat and I are . in communication with reference to the motion relating to preferential trade, and the Government propose to afford the honourable and learned member an opportunity to bring forward his motion at an early date. So far as the Tariff Commission is concerned, I think that I have already giveii all the information that* can be furnished at this stage. It would be simply absurd - practicall y impossible-to fix a date for the completion of such an extremely difficult task. Everything depends upon the difficulty or ease with which fit and proper men can be secured to act as members of the Commission. NA MEMBERS - whether  notice of the leader of the Opposition to a paragraph in today's Age, on which I desire to ask him a question.",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Question s can be asked of private members only in relation to business of the House of which they have charge. I do not know any business of which the honourable member for Bland has charge, but only in the event of there being such business on the notice-paper, and the question concerning it , may the honourable member for Grey proceed. TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS.",15
16,Mr EWING,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I wish to know if the Postmaster-General has taken any steps in regard to the retirement of telegraph messengers who, if in the Public Service of New South Wales prior to Federation, have, under a State Act,' to retire on reaching the age of twenty years, or, if appointed after Federation, have, under the Commonwealth Act, to retire on reaching the age of eighteen vears.",15
17,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"As my honourable friend must know, this matter is under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. Representations have been made to t'he Commissioner, but great difficulty is experienced in finding employment for all the messengers who reach the retiring age. Of course, a large number of boys enter the service at the ages of fourteen or fifteen, and upon reaching the age of eighteen, have to leave the service, unless I pro- other employment can be found for them. There is such a large number of boys, and we have such a comparatively small service, that it is difficult to find employment for all the lads who are qualified to perform other work than that upon which they were engaged. The Public Service Commissioner, however, is using his best efforts in that direction.",15
18,Sir JOHN QUICK,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Will the Minister consider the advisability of framing a regulation if there is any power to do so-pro viding that telegraph messengers, upon attaining the age of eighteen, shall have preference for employment as telephone assistants and letter-carriers.",15
19,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I shall consider the matter, and see_ if it is possible to make some such arrangement for t'he employment of the large number of messengers who have no doubt faithfull y served the Department, and who are entitled to preference in employment.  the Postmaster-General is in favour of giving the boys preference over persons outside the service-othe r things being equal?",15
20,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I certainly think that, other things being equal, a boy who has faithfull y served the Department should receive full consideration. At the same time we have to administer the law, and any regulation that may be framed will 'have to be in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act.",15
21,Mr EWING,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I wish to ask the Minister whether, in the event of cases of injustice being submitted to him, he will bring them under the notice of the Public Service Commissioner, with a view to his applying a remedy ?",15
22,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I shall be only too glad to bring any such cases under the notice of the Commissioner. I know of many instances of hardship in my own district and elsewhere, and I shall do my best to prevent young men who have faithf u l l y served the Department for a number of years from being dispensed with. PUBLIC SERVANTS ' INCREMENT S.  Prime Minister has any statement to make regarding the question asked by the honourable member for Boothby with reference to the increments to which public servants are entitled.",15
23,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I think that there has been some misapprehension upon this matter, and I shall endeavour to clear it up. I understand that the increments which were really referred to by the honourable member for Boothby were those to which officers are entitled under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act.  they are entitled under the States Acts.",16
24,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The increments accruing under the States Acts involve a very serious question of law, upon which high legal officials have given- I have not seen the text of their opinions, but I have perused a precis of them-conflictin g opinions. The question being one of law, I think it is highly probable that we shall have to refer it to the present Attorney-General. Therefore, with reference to the increments under the States laws, I am sorry to say that I cannot give any definite assurance, because the legal position has not been clearly ascertained. So far as the increments under the Commonwealth Act are concerned, there will be no difficulty whatever with regard to payment.  obtain the opinion referred to as soon as possible ?",16
25,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I think that, in view of the fact that the two predecessors of the Attorney-General seem to have given opinions upon the subject, which are not in harmony, it is advisable that we should seek his opinion as soon as possible? LEPERS IN QUEENSLAND.",16
26,Mr WILKINSON,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has received the information for which I asked him recently with regard to the extension of leprosy in Queensland ?,16
27,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,I am sorry to say that we have not yet received an answer from the State authorities. We asked for the information some time ago. PROVISIONAL PATENTS.,16
28,Mr ROBINSON,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"for Mr HARPER) ject? asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether he is aware of serious delays in deal- - months ing with applications for provisional protection with at the Federal Patent Office, and, if so, will he make such arrangements as will prevent such delays, which, it is said, are causing serious loss to applicants for patents for inventions?",16
29,Mr MCLEAN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I have to stateThere have been no serious delays in dealing with applications accompanied by. provisional specification. Although 1,157 provisional specifications have been received in the Patent Office in less than six months, nothwithstanding the enormous work involved in organizing a new Commonwealth patents system, no less than 471 of these provisional specifications have been accepted. Considerably more than this number would have been accepted but for the fact that, upon investigation, a large number of informalities have been"" discovered, owing to applicants or their agents having failed to comply with the requirements of the law. In many instances applications have eitSer been improperly signed or not signed at all, whilst in others the applications show no title to the invention for which they desire to obtain letters patent. The applicants, or their agents, have been notified of these informalities, and asked to give them immediate attention; but owing to a number of these people living in places beyond the State, some time elapses before these informalities can be rectified. A strong disposition was evinced, by Parliament, when the Patenfs Bin was being debaTecl, that the Patents Office should not place insurmountable difficulties in the path of the poor inventor, consequently the Commissioner has used every effort, where an applicant has filed his own application, to enable him to deal with his own case. No possible loss can accrue to an applicant by the non-acceptance of his provisional specification, seeing that Ee is in no better position after such acceptance than he was at the date of the filing of his application. The acceptance of a provisional specification gives an applicant no rights against the public. TEMPORARY EXCISE OFFICERS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.  Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Were Messrs. O. V. R. Adams, F. Plumstead, Simmons, W. A . Simpson, and Ringwood employed as temporary excise officers in the Customs Department of the State of South Australia for lengthened periods, extending over two years in some instances? 2. Were not these officers employed at various times in the country districts attending distilleries ? 3. Do not the regulations governing the employment and remuneration of all classes of officers provide that when any officer is absent on service away from his head quarters he shall receive certain allowances to cover travelling expenses, subsistence, &c. ? 4. Were the above officers paid the allowance under the Regulations? 5. If not, what is the justification for the Public Service Commissioner to vary the law on the sub6. Will the Minister see that justice is done to these officers-al l of whom were discharged some ago and have not been re-employed, presumably to carry out another Regulation dealing Temporary officers and their tenure of office ?",16
30,Mr MCLEAN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I have to state1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. The payment of an allowance, as provided by Regulations, refers only to cases where an officer, being stationed at one place, and his ordinary duties being at such place, he is temporarily placed on duty in some other place. In the case of these officers, their ordinary duty was at the distilleries where they were placed, and such were their headquarters. 4. They were allowed board and lodging in addition to their salaries. After reaching their stations they did no travelling, and were not entitled to any travelling allowance. 5. The law has not been varied. Permanent officers appointed to country stations are dealt with in the same way. They are not paid travelling allowance after reaching their station. 6. Under the circumstances, as explained above, it does not seem that the persons mentioned are entitled to any expenses beyond those which have already been paid. ENGLISH MAIL CONTRACTS.",16
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"the Postter, upon noticemaster-General, upon notice I. Whether he has made'any inquiries or has any knowledge as to whether the Orient Company propose to make Largs Bay and Fremantle ports of call for their steamers after the present contract expires on 31st January? 2. Whether he .has made any inquiries or has any knowledge as to the Orient Company's intention as to continuing the present regular nightly service and the existing time-table to and from Australia?",17
32,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The answers to the right honourable gentleman's questions are as follow:1 and 2. The Postmaster-General has no nite information as to what the Orient Company propose to do in the e respects after the present contract expires on 31st of January next. He has, however, been informed that the manager of the Orient-Pacific Company in Australia thinks that the present call at Adelaide may have to be discontinued in the event of no tract being entered into.",17
33,Mr CARPENTER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Does the Government intend, when arranging for conveyance of oversea mails at poundage rates, to maintain a regular despatch alternately with the fortnightly sailings of the Peninsular ancl Oriental steamers, thus insuring a weekly service ? 2. Will the Government, other things being equal, give preference to those steamers calling at the chief ports of the Commonwealth, as at present ?",17
34,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is the intention of the Government, when arranging for the conveyance of oversea mails at poundage rates, to maintain as far as the circumstances will permit a regular despatch alternating with the fortnightly sailings of the Peninsular and Oriental steamers, and to insure as far as possible a weekly despatch of the mails. 2. Yes. NEW HEBRIDES MAIL SERVICE.",17
35,Mr CULPIN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice What other lines will the subsidized New Hebrides service connect Brisbane and the Islands with?",17
36,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is intended that the Sydney-Solomon Islands service will call at Brisbane. If that service is continued to any other islands they also will be brought into direct communication with Brisbane. As I explained yesterday, the New Hebrides steamers cannot call at Brisbane, owing to it being so far out of the line of' route. NEW GUINEA MAIL SERVICE.",17
37,Mr BAMFORD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"the Prime Minis1. Whether it is intended, when completing arrangements for the contemplated subsidized mail service to New Guinea, to make the service from Sydney or Brisbane to New Guinea? 2. Whether he is aware that a weekly service as far north as Cooktown is now in existence, and that another seivice from Sydney or elsewhere south to New Guinea will overlap the fortpresent service, thus considerably and unnecessarily increasing the expense? 3. Whether, in view of this, he will consider the advisability of so arranging the contemplated service as to connect with the existing service at Cooktown ?",17
38,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The answers to the hondeorable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. Yes. 3. The present proposal is to make Thursday Island the starting and terminal point for the British New Guinea service, withpower to change to Cooktown if experience shows that the con-, latter port would be more advantageous. POST-OFFICES, QUEENSLAND. Motion (by Mr WILKINSON) agreed toThat a return be laid on the table showing :1. The monthly average number of letters delivered from the post-offices at Boonah, Caboolture, Esk, Laidley, Rosewood, and Nambour, in the State of Queensland. . 2. The monthly average number of newspapers, magazines, and parcels delivered from the same offices. 3. The average number of mails made up and despatched from these and other places. 4. The value of telegraphic and telephonic business (monthly average) transacted at each of the offices named. Return to cover the year ended 30th June, 1904. NA AND SALE OF TOBACCO. In Committee (Consideration of Senate's Message resumed from 10th November, vide page 6842), Motion (by Mr Frazer) again proposed - That the Committee concur in the resolution submitted by the Senate.",17
39,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"New England) Since this resolution was submitted to the Committee, I have carefully perused the speech delivered by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, with a view to ascertaining how far the position which he placed before us was supported by facts. While I do not claim to be a constitutional lawyer, I am of opinion that his dissertation upon the Constitution shows conclusively that we have no power to nationalize' the tobacco industry. In my judgment he has altogether misinterpreted the provisions of the Constitution. He has dealt with this matter as though we were empowered to legislate upon every subject which had not been specially transferred to the Federal arena under that charter of government. I claim that we are bound by the provision of the Constitution, which sets forth most distinctly the various matters with which we can deal. Unless the States empower us to legislate upon matters other than those which are therein specified, we are quite unable to deal with them. It appears to me questionable whether, even assuming that the tobacco industry were nationalized, we could raise the enormous profit which the honourable member evidently anticipates. He has given us no indication of the data from which he draws the conclusion that a State monopoly in tobacco would return an annual profit to the Commonwealth of more than ,£600,000. honourable member states that a certain quantity of tobacco is imported into the Commonwealth, upon which he apparently estimates the amount of profit which we should receive. He saysI find from research that the annual profit upon imported tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes within the Commonwealth would be ^572,029, £ 3 '6,439. and ; £ > 5 7 respectively. He does not say what the cost of production of tobacco is, or what would be its selling price. He contents himself with saying that he finds, ""from research,"" that the annual profit upon the articles in question aggregates so much. ought to make a clearer statement than that. He continuesThese sums aggregate ^1,001,325. He does not inform us how he arrives at the profit what is obtained even upon the locally-produced article.",18
40,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But I explained the reason why. . Mr LONSDALE - Surely there is some means of showing how that profit is arrived at. When we are asked to alter the policy of the country by undertaking the nationalization of any industry, it should be made absolutely clear whether or not the undertaking is likely to prove a success.",18
41,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Will the honourable member vote to obtain that information by means of the appointment of a Royal Commission ?,18
42,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"A Select Committee, appointed by the Senate, is already inquiring into this matter. Under such circumstances, I ask is it necessary to appoint a Royal Commission? Personally, I do not believe in spending money unnecessarily upon such inquiries. If it can be shown that there is any reason why the Select Committee, which is at present engaged in investigating the matter, cannot obtain the information desired, I would not 'be adverse to the appointment of a Royal Commission. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie continued The profit on locally-produced tobacco, added to the foregoing amount, increases the profit to ,£2,005,750 annually. If we deduct the Excise and Customs duties now received by the Commonwealth, less 3 per cent., from the amount, in order to allow for the cost of the collection of our Customs and Excise duties upon tobacco, we shall derive a profit of ^673,454 per annum upon nationalization. From his own figures, I find that the value The of the manufactured tobacco, cigars,, cigarettes, and leaf imported into the Commonwealth is ,£780,000. In addition to that, there were 802,237 lbs. of leaf produced in the Commonwealth 'during last year. The honourable member expects the present combine, after paying Excise and Customs duty, together with the cost of manufacture and production, to obtain a clear profit of ,£673,000, which would mean a total clear II2 8 profit of at least £[2,000,000 upon raw material valued at not more than £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £[900,000. To my mind, that is an utter absurdity. He points out that in 1900 the manufacture of tobacco in France yielded a revenue of Surelv he .£13,215,799, whereas the amount of the duties collected in England aggregated only £10,500,000. At the time, I regarded his figures as somewhat strange, and accordingly took the precaution to check them. As a result, I discovered that he had selected the year 1900, because it had yielded the lowest revenue derived from tobacco in England for many years. It is a most extraordinary fact that the highest revenue from this source was obtained in r 9°3-4",18
43,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Fro m where does the honourable member derive his figures?,19
44,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Fro m the "" Statistical Abstracts of British Trade,"" which can be seen in the Library.",19
45,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The returns for 1904 are not yet to hand.,19
46,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I can assure the honourable member that they are, and may be perused in the Parliamentary Library.",19
47,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The figures which I quoted were those given by the chief excise officer in Victoria before the Select Committee pointed by the Senate. They were the latest figures available three months ago.,19
48,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Th efiguresto which I refer can be seen in this building. There is no need to go anywhere else for them. Instead of the revenue derived from tobacco in England in 1901 being £[10^500,000, it was £[12,813,578. The receipts for 1903 total £12,451,000, and for 1904, ,£[j.2,627„ooo. I do not blame the honourable member for the selection which he made; but it is unfortunate for him that in 1900 the revenue derived from tobacco in England was the lowest received for many years.",19
49,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Eve n allowing that, the revenue obtained from that source in England is considerably below that which is obtained in France.""  the honourable member for Kalgoorlie correct?",19
50,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They are correct so far as the year 1900 is concerned.,19
51,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The difference does not amount to a great deal.,19
52,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It represents over £2,000,000. To me that is an extremely small sum. From what I have said, it will be seen that the honourable member's argument concerning the increased revenue derived by France completely breaks down.'",19
53,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Franc e receives from tobacco more than £1,000,000 in excess of the revenue derived by England and that from a smaller population.",19
54,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No ; the difference represents only £[700,000 or £[800,000. The honourable member went on to speak of the monopoly existing in Australia. There may be a monopoly, but, so far, the public do not appear to have suffered from its operations. He, and others, have put forward the argument that competition in this case is an evil, and that we should it, and yet the protectionists are always telling us it is undesirable that there should be no competition in any industry.",19
55,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We object to cut-throat competition, which leads to employees being practically starved.",19
56,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is singular that the honourable member refrained from plac^ ing before the Committee any figures relating to the wages paid in France. Perhaps it did not suit him to make any reference to them.,19
57,Mr IFRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I spoke until the time aN ap- lowed me under the Standing Orders expired. I could not do any more.,19
58,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But it is, to say the least, very strange that the honourable member should not have referred to the wages paid in France.",19
59,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Did I not state that the figures which I quoted were based on a manufacturing price of 2s. per lb., and that there was an allowance of is. 3d. per lb. in respect of the difference in cost of manufacture in France and Australia.",19
60,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member spoke of the cost being 2s. per lb., as against 9d. per lb., but he did not tell us how a profit was to be derived from the undertaking - He then went on to sneer at the gentlemen engaged in the industry in Australia. He saidTheir names will indicate that they are good Australian citizens, who take a big interest in the welfare of the people of this country. Upon the 13th April, 1904, I find that the following persons held the respective shares assigned to them in the States Tobacco Company :-Loui s Philip Jacobs, of St. Kilda, 28,350. I suppose that the honourable member wished to suggest that Mr Jacobs and others whose names he gave were foreigners. I made inquiries to ascertain where the shareholders in this company came from, and was informed that Mr Jacobs is a native of this city, whilst Mr Cameron, to whom he also referred, was one of the founders of the firm of Cameron Brothers, which was established here thirty years ago.",19
61,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What about Kronheimer of Hamburg? .,19
62,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Mr Kronheimer was also one of the original shareholders in the firm of Cameron Brothers. It is immaterial, so far as the point at issue is concerned, whether he came from Hamburg or not. We endeavour to induce foreign capitalists to invest in industries in Australia, and when they do so the honabolish orable member would sneer at them. "" Kronheimer "" may be a foreign name,. but "" Jacobs"" is not; while the Messrs. Dixson, who were mentioned by the honourable member, have been carrying on business in New South Wales for very many - years. It will be found that the shareholders in this company have been engaged for a number of years in the industry in Australia. The honourable member asserted that the State monopoly in France was an advantage to the workers, and proceeded to show-the benefits they had derived from it. Whilst he was speaking, I inquired how many women were employed in the industry there as compared with the number of men engaged in it, but he was unable to give me any satisfactory information on the point. I have since investigated this aspect of the question, and find that in France, in 1902, there were 14,941 women employed in the industry, at an average wage of 3s. 3d. per day of ten hours, while there were only 1,746 men, who received an average wage of 4s. 1 i d . per day, employed in it. In Austria in 1902 were 36,029 females employed in the industry, who received an wage of ios. per week of fifty-two hours, while there were only 4>377 males, who received an average wage of 11s. 2d. per week. These figures do not include the wages paid to boys and girls, for they come under the heading of apprentices, who re ceive ss. 8d. per week. It will thus be seen that the State monopoly in Austria has not done much for the women. In Australia in 1903 there were 1,380 females, re-, ceiving an average wage of 3s. per dav of eight hours, and 1,514 males, who received an average wage of 6s. per day of eight hours. These figures show that there are more men than women engaged in the industry in the Commonwealth, and that the wages paid are higher than those which ob tain in France or Austria. Then I would point out that the revenue we derive from the trade under existing circumstances is almost as much per lb. as that received from the tobacco monopoly in France, while the revenue per head is a little more.",19
63,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We are a much' richer people.,20
64,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Does the honourable member suggest that our revenue would be increased by the establishment of a State monopoly in tobacco? In France the revenue per lb. in 1902 was 3s. if d . , and 6s. 8Jd. per head, while in Austria it was 3s. 8 j d . per lb., and 3s. 2 j d . per head. In Australia, however, the revenue derived from this source amounts to 2s. iod. per lb., and 7s. per head. In other words, the revenue which we derive from that source is very much larger than that obtained from the State monopoly in France or Austria.",20
65,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There is a greater spending power in Australia than there is in France.,20
66,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But the point we have to consider is whether the revenue from tobacco would be improved by the creation of a State monopoly: The honourable member for Kalgoorlie asserted that the local combine were destroying the tobacco-growing industry in the Commonwealth; but as a matter of fact they are endeavouring to encourage it.,20
67,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then the honourable member admits that there is a combine?,20
68,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am simply taking the honourable member's word for it . It is immaterial whether there is a' combine or not, as long as it does not injure the pubthere lic.",20
69,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"And they are doing that. average Mr LONSDALE - They are not. There has been no increase in the price of tobacco to the retailer, except that which took place immediately after the imposition p f the duty. Before there was any combine in existence the price was increased in consequence of the imposition of the Federal Customs duties, but there has been no further increase.",20
70,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Customer s do not get a box of matches with every box of cigarettes purchased as they used to do.,20
71,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I . always thought cheap things were good, but my protectionist friends have looked upon dear thingsas desirable. The whole speech delivered by the honourable member was a series of contradictions. He did not show that there really was a monopoly in Australia.",20
72,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think I did.,20
73,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"So far as some matters were concerned, he would not say that there was a monopoly. In dealing with the tobacco-growing industry he went back to the condition of affairs in the eighties, and sought to show how t'he output had fluctuated from time to time. May I point out to him that there was an increase in the production of colonially-grown tobacco at the time of the American war, owing to the shortage of American leaf. Then, again, colonial tobacco was used in New South Wales for the treatment of the disease known as scab in sheep.",20
74,Mr FEAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Onl y the refuse was used.,21
75,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Colonially-grown tobacco was used for that purpose, and as soon as the disease was stamped out there was naturally a decrease in the consumption of the local article. How can the honourable member say that the tobacco-growing industry in Australia is being destroyed by the combine? As a matter of fact, it is being destroyed in France, as the result of the State monopoly. The growers there receive no protection of any kind. During 1902 the price of locally-grown leaf in France was 3 j d . per lb., whilst that of the imported leaf was 5 d. per lb., and 44 per cent, of the locally-grown leaf was used. That accounts for the excellent quality of the tobacco produced by the State monopoly in '- that country! It is of such good quality that, when a Frenchman had smoked a Britisher out of a railway compartment in which they were travelling, he thought that he had avenged Fashoda. He said that if the French troops would only smoke French tobacco the British Army would never face them. This is an indication of the sort of stuff which is turned out by the State monopoly, and which Frenchmen have to smoke. In 1903 the price of the locally-grown leaf in Australia was 4d. per lb., whilst that of the imported leaf was iod. per lb. Notwithstanding this, the imported leaf was, for the most part, used in the manufacture of tobacco. If ' the manufacturers will iod. per lb. for the imported leaf, aithough they can obtain the local article for 4d. per lb., it stands to reason that the foreign article must be infinitely superior. No man would give iod. per lb. for tobacco leaf i could obtain an article of the same quality for 4d. per lb. We have also to remember that there is a duty of is. 6d. per lb. on the imported leaf, which brings the total cost up to 2s. 4d. per lb. Would any one say that the manufacturers would pay that price if the local article, obtainable at 4d. per lb., would produce equally good tobacco? There must be some good business reason for the pre1 ference shown for the imported leaf. It is certainly not due to the fact, as suggested by my honourable friend, that members of the tobacco combine are interested in plantations in the United States and elsewhere, "" which are worked by black labour,"" and desire to draw their main supply from those sources rather than from local growers.",21
76,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is an absolute fact.,21
77,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Surely the honourable .member would not expect any man of common sense to believe that these business men would import leaf all the way from America, and pay a duty of is. 6d. per lb. on it, simply that black labour might be kept in employment, when they could grow it in Australia for 4d. a lb. The honourable member must think we are fools if he imagines that we are prepared to accept such arguments. He may deceive himself, ancl those whom he addresses from public platforms by making statements of this kind, but when he puts them before x the Committee he must expect to have them analyzed. I hold that his assertions are utterly absurd.",21
78,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What does the honourable member have to pay for good tobacco in Melbourne? - ,21
79,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"So far as I am personally concerned, all tobacco is bad. It is a matter of business with these cute Yankees, of which we have heard so much. They do not throw their money away, but try every means to make a profit on its expenditure.",21
80,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They have not to pay excise.,21
81,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Excis e must be paid on tobacco, whether manufactured from the colonial or t'he imported leaf, so that there is nothing in that objection. Every effort has been made' to encourage the growing give of tobacco in suitable country in the New England district, such as the Moonbi Ranges, where the soil is said to be good for tobacco. The manufacturers have not set themselves against the production of f he tobacco leaf locally, but have, on the contrary, spent money in trying to develop the industry. To my mind, it is impossible that these men should be making a profit of nearly £[700,000 a year. I have not had time to go thoroughly into figures, but the statements of t'he honourable member for Kalgoorlie are opposed to common-sense. There is not yet a monopoly in the tobacco business, because in Victoria there are one or two factories which do not belong to the combine, while there is another in South Australia, and I think others in other Slates. A Mr Arnell, of the firm of Dudgeon and Arnell, when examined before a Select Committee of the Senate, stated distinctly that his business had not been injured by the combine, of which his firm, was not a member, and that the price of tobacco had not been increased. The two tobaccoes which went up in price were one; made by his firm, and another called "" Derby,"" but in each case the increase was due to the duty. So far as I can understand, the combine has not affected the position of the retailers, supposing there to be a combine in existence, though that is not proved by the evidence hitherto taken by the Committee. Neither have the general public been injured. I understand that Kronheimer Limited are the distributors for all the manufacturing companies in the combination; but the circular lo which reference has been made has been issued by them, not to retailers, but to business houses. No retailer has been interfered with in regard to prices.",21
82,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The combine is offering inducements to retail tobacconists to keep up prices against the consumer.,22
83,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"-It is desired to keep prices at what they are now. The honourable member when speaking upon this question, said that if the industry were nationalized, smokers would not get their tobacco any more cheaply than they do now. They would probably get a worse article; and the growers would not gain any advantage, because in any case the industry must be conducted on business lines. If it were under the control of the Government, its managers could not refuse to use imported leaf, and manufacture only the colonial leaf, because, if they did, the consumption of tobacco would fall off, since smokers would not like the article which was being manufactured. With regard to the dismissal of hands, I understand that commercial traveller^ were taken off the road by some of the firms, but that they have been found other employment.",22
84,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Not by the same firms. Forty-five were dismissed.,22
85,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They have been given other employment by some of these firms.,22
86,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What is the source of honourable member's information?,22
87,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"My information is all right. I have heard that Kronheimei vices. Limited have increased their staff of travellers, because they have a larger deal with now.",22
88,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,B y how many?,22
89,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not know; I tue, am not acquainted with the details of their business. I understand, however, that very few travellers were stranded. If the honinstead orable member had given me information on the subject, I could have made inquiries. I am altogether opposed to the nationalizamotion tion of the tobacco industry. It is silly to suppose that the profits made by the combine are as large as they have been stated to be, and the Government certainly could not conduct the industry as cheaply as it is being conducted by the business men now connected with it . It is impossible for a Government to compete with private individuals in manufacturing. From the information which I have obtained, wages here in the tobacco industry are higher, and the hours of labour shorter, than elsewhere, while the' revenue obtained by the State is as large as the profits of the industry in France. Personally, I think all tobacco bad; but I understand that, according to the taste of those who smoke, the tobacco we get here is better than that made in France. I think that in every way it is more in the public interest to let matters remain as they are than to make the tobacco industry a Government monopoly. We could have dealt with the subject more satisfactorily if the' honourable member for Kalgoorlie had told us on what his figures were based, so that we might check them. I think that he will admit that his speech was absolutely bald. No one can test the accuracy of his statements, or determine whether his estimate of profit is at all correct. I cannot conceive, however, taking into account the cost of raw material, of manufacture, distribution, and excise, that the profits can be as large as they have been stated to be. I shall oppose the motion.",22
90,Mr FOWL ER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," The honourable member for New England has criticised the proposals of the honourable member for Kal goorlie with his usual vigour, and with characteristic enthusiasm. He has told us that he is not one of those unfortunate people who contribute to the revenue indirectly by the consumption of tobacco and the use of intoxicating liquor; though it the seems to me that he would be improved as a politician and a humanitarian if he would take unto himself one or two mild little",22
91,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable business to member dirink and smoke?,22
92,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Occasionally . Although the honourable member is a paragon of virit would be an improvement if he could discuss questions of this kind from the point of view of one who has practical experience, of regarding the industry as one to be suppressed in the most violent way possible. H is chief reason for opposing the seems to be that the tobacco monopoly is not an evil, because it is not inflicting any hardship on the community, prices now being the same as they were before it came into existence. He allows it to be inferred, however, that if it became a serious evil he might change his opinions.",22
93,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Not in regard to the inadvisability of nationalizing the industry.,23
94,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable memgoorlie ? ber's present position is inconsistent with that which he assumed last night when the proposed prohibition of the introduction liquor into New Guinea was under dislike cussion. It was shown then that no evil has been done to the natives by the system now prevailing in the Territory, but honourable member looked forward to a Lime when evil would be done, and he was anxtistics ious to prevent that time from arriving. ask 'him to be consistent in this matter, to look forward to a time when the tobacco monopolists will carry into effect the policy which monopolists all over the world have at heart.",23
95,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Las t night we were cussing the evils done to individuals by liquor trade,",23
96,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The arguments advanced were on the lines which I have indicated, and the honourable member must see that he is inconsistent. Even if tobacco monopoly is not at the present time a public *evil, it will, like monopolies the world over, try to extract the utmost profit from the community, so soon as can do so with reasonable safety. At present it is on its trial, and is beginning to collect its forces. It takes for a combination such as this to get to work to effect its Durposes. I can understand the argument of the honbacco, orable member for New England with rebe gard to some monopolies, which he conquality tends should remain the property community, as a whole. But when he discovers some radical distinction between the proposed monopoly and natural monopolies I am totally unable to follow himA nado tural monopoly may be a perfectly healthy one, whilst an artificial monopoly may entirely unhealthy. We have to apply comsome mon sense to matters of this kind, and contend that the honourable gentleman, who believes in the creation of certain polies for the benefit of the community, ought to apply exactly the same method of reasoning to the subject we are now. cussing. I do not intend to traverse the figures which the honourable member has quoted so plentifully.",23
97,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They are indisputable, and the honourable member knows it.",23
98,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Althoug h I have had a great deal to do with figures during my career, I regard them with suspicion when they are brought forward as evidence.",23
99,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What about the figures quoted by the honourable member for Kal ,23
100,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I always remember the statement made by a sagacious professor of of Edinburgh, who declared that statistics, mince pies, depended for their good quality very much upon the individual who concocted them. Whilst I have no doubt the that the honourable member for New England, so far from having concocted the stahe quoted, derived them from what I he regarded as a safe and sound source, I and wish to make a few general observations which I think will go far to prove the unsoundness of his conclusions. The State monopoly of the tobacco industry is no new idea. It has been found entirely advandistageous by other communities, whose in the telligence is at least equal to our own.",23
101,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is it not a relic of the middle ages?,23
102,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We have some relics of the the middle ages that we preserve with a great deal of reverence. The present proall posal is upon the lines of schemes in other parts of the world, the operation of which it have been attended with advantage to the general community.",23
103,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That depends upon the a little time point of view.,23
104,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member is not a connoisseur in the matter of toand, therefore, very little weight can attached to his sneers directed to the of the tobacco manufactured under of the the State monopoly in France.",23
105,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,He is right all the same.,23
106,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In the case of tobacco, as in that of liquor, taste has very much to with the judgment passed upon the article consumed. Although I do not conbe sume much liquor or tobacco I know that brands that I would not care to touch I are highly esteemed by others, who have as correct a taste and as much intelligence as monoI have. French tobacco is manufactured in a manner entirely different from that followed in English-speaking communities. In disalmost every country modifications are made in the system of manufacture, in order to suit the national taste, so that what might seem highly objectionable to others is regarded by them as of the highest possible quality. Doubtless, the consumers of tobacco in France regard English-made tobacco with as little favour as the smokers across Channel look upon theirs. At any rate, the people of France have shown no inclination to do away with the monopoly. They are evidently satisfied with the quality of the tobacco, as shown by the revenue that is yielded by the monopoly, and we have a right to assume that the position is one which is not likely to be changed in a hurry.",23
107,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What happened in Germany when at attempt was made to restore the State monopoly there?,24
108,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am not acquainted with the position of affairs in Germany. Perhaps the honourable member will enlighten us when he addresses the House. As the proposal now before us has already run the gauntlet of criticism in another place, it need not be debated at very great length. Most honourable members interested in the subject have probably read the very able speeches made in another place, notably that delivered by Senator Pearce.",24
109,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable member agree with all the figures quoted by that honourable senator?,24
110,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As I have already stated, I regard the figures quoted in such cases with a certain amount of mental reservation, until I have had an opportunity to inquire into them. Senator Pearce made out an excellent case, one that was certainly good enough to induce 'his fellowsenators to adopt his proposal for further inquiry. I trust that honourable members will endorse the action of the Senate, and sanction an inquiry into a series of proposals which are of some interest to the community as a whole, and upon which they are entitled to receive the fullest information at an early date. .",24
111,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," Whils t the able speech delivered by the honormember for Kalgoorlie excited my admiration, and I think he is to be commended for the trouble he took to obtain information for the purpose of fortifying his arguments, I am not altogether prepared to accept tflie figures quoted by him, no doubt - in perfect good ifaith. The statistics quoted by the honourable member for New England do not agree with those placed before the Committee by the mover of the motion. They appear to indicate that there is something wrong somewhere.  honourable member for Kalgoorlie are absolutely correct, as applying to a particular year.",24
112,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That year happened to be a particularly bad one, so far as Great Britain was concerned, and the honourable member did not quote the French figures lor the same year, but took another year, which did not offer a fair comparison.  member's fault. His figures were not faked.",24
113,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not suggest that. I have already given the honourable .member credit for perfect good faith. It is possible, however, that he may have been misled, and I doubt whether we can accept his figures as absolutely reliable. I have been looking up some authorities upon this subject, and I have arrived at the conclusion that the nationalization of the tobacco industry will not remedy the evils which exist under what is admittedly a great monopoly, and as such most undesirable. A comparison which I have made shows that in the matter of taxation, we levy upon tobacco in the Commonwealth a duty equivalent to two or three times thet value of the article, whilst in France the taxation imposed is equivalent to five times the value. The wholesale price of the cheapest tobacco sold in Australia is about 2s. 6d. per lb., whereas in France the cheapest tobacco is quoted at 2s. iod. per lb. Therefore, under a State monopoly, the cheapest tobacco is deaier than the lowest-priced article amongst us, even under a private monopoly.",24
114,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Surely that tobacco is not intended for human consumption?,24
115,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not pretend to speak as an authority, but that is the information given to me.",24
116,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think that the average price is about 6s. per lb.,24
117,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I understand that the "" Yankee Doodle "" and "" Havelock "" brands are sold at 4s. 6d. per lb. to retailers.",24
118,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No ; the prices are higher than that. The wholesale price of aromatic ""Yankee Doodle"" and ""Havelock"" is 4s. 9d. I believe that the darker qualities of the same brand are slightly cheaper.",24
119,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Thes e figures I give on the authority of Mr Max Hirsch, who gave them in the course of a public lecture, and I have not seen them challenged. The quality of tobacco most largely consumed within the Commonwealth-suc h brands as ""Havelock"" and ""Yankee Doodle ""-is '- sold to retailers at 4s. 6d. per lb., and the most popular French tobacco realizes about the same price. Therefore, I do not see that any particular advantage is conferred upon the French consumer.",24
120,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We are likely to obtain a purer article under the State monopoly.,25
121,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Experienc e in France would indicate that quite the contrary is the case, because it is universally admitted that French tobacco is of the vilest quality.",25
122,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not so.,25
123,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"VThat is stated by all the authorities I have consulted. It is said that no one with any self-respect would ever dream of smoking French tobacco. I am informed, on the authority of an expert member of this House, that some of it is almost as deadly as lyddite to ' those. who come within the range of its odour, and that the Japanese have been seriously thinking of importing it in large quantities for use against their enemy. They find, however, that, brave as the Japanese are credited with being, even under the most adverse conditions, none of their soldiers are sufficiently brave to smoke this particular tobacco. That statement may be the result of a little stretch of imagination, and honourable members are at liberty to seriously regard as much of it as they choose. There is, however, a general consensus of opinion that French tobacco is uniformly of vile quality. I do not think that the Commonwealth would be likely to benefit much by the proposed change ""from the point of view of' quality. Notwithstanding the great difference between the population of Australia and that of France,. I find, according to Mr Hirsch's statements, that the former derives a revenue of 3s. o j d . per pound from tobacco, whilst the latter receives about 3s. if d . per pound. It will be seen, therefore, are raised by the various speakers. that from a revenue stand-point there is not a great deal of difference between the two countries. But as a matter of fact, as no private manufacturers or dealers are allowed to make any profit upon the sale of tobacco in France, the State profits there ought to be two or three times greater than is the revenue obtained by the Commonwealth from this source.",25
124,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Private dealers make a profit in retailing. I understand that persons are licensed to retail.,25
125,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"So far as I can understand, tobacco cannot be sold by private persons in France for profit. As I have shown, however, the advantage is only slightly greater in France from that standpoint. In regard to production, it must be remembered that there is an enormous difference between the population of Australia and that of France. Yet we find that in Australia the production of tobacco is between two and three times greater than is the production in France. I can only surmise - that the great majority of its citizens prefer to smoke imported tobacco.",25
126,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Where did the honourable member obtain his figures?,25
127,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Fro m various official records. From the latest official data, only very recently to hand, it appears that in France the revenue per pound is 3s. if d . , and per head 6s. 8Jd. In Australia it is 2s. i o d . per pound, and about 7s. per head.",25
128,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Franc e does not import very much tobacco.,25
129,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then a large proportion of the population must be non-smokers. If we take France as an example, I do not see that any advantage is likely to be gained by the adoption of the change proposed, so far as wages are concerned. In that country the wages paid are alleged to be 40 per cent, lower than those which rule in Australia, whilst in the matter of hours the operatives engaged in the tobacco industry there are required to work one-fourth longer than are those engaged in the industry in Australia.",25
130,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The amount of leaf produced in France in 1901 was about fifty-five times as much as that produced in Australia.,25
131,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have not the means immediately to hand to check the accuracy of that statement. The honourable member will have an opportunity; at a later stage, of replying to all the points which I admit that all monopolies. are evils.",25
132,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What would the honourable mrmber do in regard to the existing tobacco monopoly ?,25
133,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have a sovereign remedy for getting r i d of that monopoly- a remedy which would be more effective than State control, or any other artificial means which can be adopted. I suggest to those who are in the habit of using tobacco that if they wish to destroy the present mono-poly they should discontinue smoking. After all, free production and free exchange are the great panaceas for all the evils of monopoly.",25
134,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Is the honourable member aware that one of the biggest tobacco mo-, nopolies in existence is to be found in land?",26
135,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But what about the duties upon narcotics, which are operative in Great Britain?",26
136,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They are not very high.,26
137,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Of f hand, I am not able to check that statement. was in the United States-whic h home of great tobacco trusts- a number of people were suffering from leprosy, and special Commission was appointed to quire into the cause of the spread of the disease amongst the white population it had been alleged, was due to excessive indulgence in smoking. In its report Commission stated that in one of the States in which its members had visited the bacco factories, they had discovered that only two factories did not employ leprous Chinamen in the manufacture of cigarettes and cigars. From that moment I thought it would be wise to discontinue smoking, and I have not since indulged in the habit.",26
138,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If there were no smokers in Australia, the non-smokers would be quired to pay an additional £1,300,000 anto nually.",26
139,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Not necessarily. There is such a thing as having a smaller expenditure. I fail to see that posal to bring the tobacco industry under State control would overcome any of the evils which exist, or cheapen tobacco to the consumers.",26
140,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would provide the Commonwealth with the handsome profit which now finds its way into the pockets the monopolists.,26
141,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Possibly , but I am not a Socialist, and do not believe in State engaging in industries which can very much better conducted by private terprise under natural conditions of free competition. I cannot the motion, because no argument has been advanced to justify the change which is sought to be effected. I do say that a change is not desirable, but, my opinion, we need a change in a different direction from that which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has suggested.",26
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I should like to call your attention, sir, to the fact the House. that there are two motions upon the ness-paper which seem to conflict with another. The first proposal asks assent to the decision of the Senate that, in order to provide the necessary money for Engthe payment of old-age pensions and for other purposes, the Commonwealth Government should undertake the manufacture and sale of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes. The second has reference to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into and report upon the position of the tobacco When I trade in relation to the production, manuis the facture, and distribution of tobacco. In dealing with this motion it seems to me that a we are anticipating a debate upon the proinposal relating to the appointment of a Royal Commission. I desire to ask whether which, that is not so?",26
143,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I would point out the that I have very little to do with this matter. The Order of the Day relating to the toGovernment manufacture and sale of tobacco is the first upon the business-paper, and although Mr Speaker has given a ruling, in which I subsequently concurred, that it was not competent to anticipate debate, surely that could not be used as an argument in a case of this character. Otherwise it would be possible, when a notice of remotion appeared upon the business-paper, completely block discussion upon the subject in question. I would further point out to the right honourable member that, as Chairman, I have been directed by the the proHouse to take this matter into consideration, and, therefore, it would not be competent for me to decide in the direction the price of which he desires.",26
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It seems to me extraordinary that we should be asked to deal in a definite way with this proposal, of and subsequently to debate the question of the desirableness or otherwise of appointing a Royal Commission to investigate it. the The question of the control of the tobacco be industry and the revenue that we receive enfrom the trade is one of very great importance. I do not suppose that there is any support industry which is surrounded with greater difficulties than is that of the growing and manufacture of tobacco, and to call upon not the Committee before any investigation has in been made to agree to the establishment of a State monopoly is to ask us to adopt a most unbusiness-like and unprecedented course. This is one of the most extraordinary propositions that has ever been submitted to I agree that it would be reabusisonable to appoint a Royal Commission to one inquire into the working of the industry, us to because the report which the Commission would furnish would assist us to arrive at a proper decision. I do not know on what evidence another place was induced to agree to this proposal, but certainly no information has been submitted to us, showing that it would be a wise step to take.",26
145,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,A Select Committee appointed by another place is now inquiring into the working of the industry.,27
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is all the more reason why we should defer our decision until the report of the committee is available. Surely no honourable member would be prepared to vote blindly for such a proposal.,27
147,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There are none so blind as those who will not see.,27
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No doubt the honourable member has studied this question so carefullythat he is prepared to create a State monopoly without further consideration. There are others, however, who desire that the whole matter shall be carefully investigated before the Commonwealth is asked to embark upon what would be really a speculative undertaking. Practically the crux of the whole question is whether we can produce as good a leaf as is obtainable from other countries which are celebrated for their tobacco, and whether we can grow it in sufficient quantities to meet all our requirements. There is not much to Ibe said in favour of the creation of an industry which would interfere with the revenue of the country, and at the same time have to import all the raw material. During my term of office as Treasurer of Western Australia, a tobacco factory was established there, but I never regarded it as of rmich importance to the State, as we lost a large amount of revenue. It seemed to me that we could have done very well without it.",27
149,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But the right honourable gentleman took that view of the industry simply from the stand-point of State Treasurer,27
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is so.,27
151,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The factory has since been closed.,27
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Now that we have Inter-State free-trade, the position is very different. As a result of the establishment of the tobacco f actorv in Western Australia, the State lost annually a considerbut able amount of revenue.",27
153,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have heard it said that Western Australia ic well suited for the growth of tobacco.,27
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have seen tobacco growing in Western Australia, but I should be inclined to say that, owing to the dryness of its climate, that State is not very weir suited to its production. The lands in the tropical parts of Australia are not as moist as are those on the northeastern side of the Continent. I do not suppose that any honourable member will contend that the proposal to create a State monopoly is a matter of such urgency that we should agree to it without careful consideration. I would suggest that we refrain from dealing with the question until we have arrived at a decision in regard to the motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission. That would be a reasonable course to pursue. I invariably hesitate to vote against any motion for the appointment of a Select Committee or Commission to gather information for the guidance of the House, and I think that we should act wisely in agreeing to the appointment of the Commission for which the honourable member for Boothby has moved. The proposal immediately before us. however, appears to be a haphazard and mischievous one.",27
155,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then another place must be a mischievous House.,27
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member must surely think that we are in the sere and yellow leaf, if he imagines that we are ready to rush the Commonwealth into this project without any investigation.",27
157,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable member has rushed into riskier projects which have turned out well.,27
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not think that the honourable member can cite any case in which I proposed that before any inquiry had been made, the State should interfere with a large industry conducted by private enterprise.",27
159,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There were a good many private water-carriers in Coolgardie when the right honourable member brought forward his scheme to supply that town with water.,27
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There is no doubt that those carters reaped a good harvest prior to the completion of the scheme; when they entered upon the industry they knew that it was not likely to be a permanent one. The proposal now before us involves interference with immense private interests. Those engaged in the industry have expended large sums on their plant and buildings, and I have no doubt that if we created a State monopoly, we should have to grant them compensation. It has not been suggested that those who have invested their capital in the industry should be told that after a certain date their plant must be thrown aside and their workers ""thrown out of employment without compensation being granted to them.",27
161,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We should take over the men.,28
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It seems to me that in this, as in other cases in which the State has interfered with private entferprise, compensation would have to be paid. When hotels are closed, in accordance with the decision of a local option poll, that course has to be pursued, in fairness to the proprietors and licensees. It seems to me that an easy way out of the difficulty would be for the House to deal with the motion providing for the appointment of A Royal Commission before arriving at a decision in regard to the question now before us.",28
163,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That means of overcoming the difficulty in which the right honourable member finds himself will not be available if I can help it.,28
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We know that there is a saying that certain persons rush in where others fear to tread. If we act with caution in dealing with this matter we shall give satisfaction, not only to the people of Australia generally, but to those who are directly interested in the industry. No attempt has 'been made to prove that the enterprise would be a source of profit to the Commonwealth, and in these circumstances I sincerely trust that the motion will not be carried. Progress reported. PRIVATEMEMBERS ' BUSINESS.",28
165,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," A difficulty has arisen now, for the first time in nearly four years, as to the meaning of the standing orders governing private members' business, and I invite the House to lay down the rule that on all occasions motions shall share with general' orders of the day the time devoted to private business, as the latter always share the time with motions. The intention of the Sessional. Order seems be that orders of the day, general ness, and private members' noticesof tion shall share equally the time devoted to private business; but the wording is rather imperfect. If the House agrees to my suggestion, Mr Speaker and the Chairman of Committees will act accordingly.",28
166,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," It seems to me that the present method of dealing with private members' business is unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it leaves only a short time for the consideration of either a motion or an order of the day, as the case may be. I think it would be better to allow the private members' business entered upon to be taken right Lhrough until completion, or until the time allotted for private members' business had expired. Under the present arrangement we have not a sufficieint opportunity to deal completely with any business, although we enter upon the consideration of a great number of subjects.",28
167,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I will propose a change next session. I do not think the present arrangement satisfactory.,28
168,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would be well if the Government and the Standing Orders Committee took the matter into consideration.,28
169,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As this is the first occasion on which difficulty has arisen, I would point out that the Sessional Order relating to private members' business appears to contemplate an equal division of time on Thursday afternoons between notices of motion and orders of the day. While, however, the Standing Orders provide that orders of the day shall be called on two hours after the meeting of the House, and so equally divide the time when notices of motion are taken first, there is no corresponding standing order providing that when orders of the day are taken first, notices of motion shall be called on at the expiry of two hours. As this is the first occasion on which the point has arisen, I call the attention of honourable members to it, and unless it is otherwise desired, I propose to allow the consideration of orders of the day to be continued. Do I understand that it is the desire of honourable members that private members' time shall be shared equally between orders of the day and notices of motion? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",28
170,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am very glad to to have the matter decided, so that the Chairbusiman of Committees and I may know what moto do on future occasions. Remaining orders of the day postponed. LIMITATION OF DEBATE .",28

It is not my desire to occupy the time of the House at any length, and I wish also to avoid anything which may resemble undue comment'on the proceedings of honourable members. But it must be apparent to most of us, as it is becoming apparent to the people of Australia, that the time occupied by our discussions is so great as to prevent us from accomplishing the business which we wish to transact, and which we have been sent here to perform. The life of the first Parliament had a duration of about two years and a half, and that Parliament was in session for upwards of two years of that time.  took place during the first session of that Parliament.",29
172,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It was understood that the discussion of the Tariff would occupy a considerable time. I was not a member of the first Parliament, but I have read the Hansard reports of its proceedings very closely, and I think it must be admitted that the discussions on the Tariff were unnecessarily prolonged. The Tariff, however, has not occupied the attention of this Parliament, and the amount of work done is altogether out of proportion to the time We have been in session.  able member has been here.",29
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I take my share of responsibility; but I have not been one of the chief offenders.,29
174,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member has never offended.,29
175,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"This Parliament was elected in December last, and has been in session for nearly nine months, which is too long a period, considering the amount of. work which has been accomplished. If the Federal Parliament is to be in session almost perpetually, some of us will be faced with a very serious position, and the personnel of this House will be very materially changed. All but those of us who live in Melbourne-and who can attend to their ordinary business during the day, coming here in the evening-ar e even now put to serious inconvenience, and if we are to have I almost perpetual sessions, the representation of the people will ultimately be confined almost entirely to the members of two classes-member s of the wealthy class, whose time is at their own disposal, and for whom the remuneration offers no material attraction, and members who are prepared to give up all their time to Parliamentary work for the sake of the allowance of .£400 per annum-me n who are prepared to live absolutely on the game, or what are known as professional politicians, though I do not wish to use the term offensively. ",29
176,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There are many honourable members who will not be able to continue in politics if our sessions become practically perpetual. But if this Parliament is to truly represent the people of Australia, it must contain a large proportion of those who are in active commercial life, and who, though not prepared to give all their time to public business, because they cannot afford to do so, are yet willing and able to render valuable public service. The House of Commons contains 670 members, and the British Parliament deals with the affairs of one-fifth of the globe. That Parliament generally sits from about the middle of February to early in August, with occasionally what is known as an autumn session, lasting from six to eight weeks. Yet the first Federal Parliament had a session of nearly a year and a half, while the first session of the second Parliament has lasted nearly nine months, and is likely to continue for another three or four weeks. What have we to show for this long session ? The Arbitration Bill has every prospect of being passed, but it is practically the only useful measure with which we shall have dealt; the other measures which have been under consideration having occupied but little time, and some of them being measures which might very well have been postponed for future consideration. The trouble which is facing us has faced the Parliaments of nearly the whole world. I have gone through some of the works which have been published on this subject, and I find that in Portugal the deputies are allowed one hour in which to speak on miscellaneous matters.before passing to the Orders of the Day, while in many of the States of the American Union the sessions are limited. In Indiana, the session is limited to sixty-one days, and in Colorado and Georgia to forty days. In six States and two Territories the limit is sixty days, in Maryland eighty days",29
177,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But those are State Parliaments.,30
178,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Some of them deal with the affairs of a population larger than that of the Commonwealth of Australia, and dispose of a larger revenue than we have",30
179,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Indi a n a has greater population than ours.,30
180,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The population of the city of New York alone is nearly equal to that of the Commonwealth.,30

183,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not the of the House of Commons.,30
184,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The practice of the House of Commons is very much worse, because they apply the closure when they desire, as our American friends express it to ""bulldoze"" the House and pass a Bill been curtailed to one hour's length. through. I do not desire to see that sysidea tem introduced here.",30
185,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They have to obtain the consent of the Chairman of Committees, and a Minister has to move the motion for the application of the closure.",30
186,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I think that what occurred in this House the other evening should be a lesson to us. It is most objectionable for the Government to have to put its foot down, or for a Speaker or a Chairman to be compelled to apply the direct closure to an honourable member. a That procedure is certain to arouse feelings of animosity which should not find any place in this Chamber during the discussion of important public questions. The closure is the most objectionable means that can be employed to bring a discussion",30
187,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is the most sensible if proper safeguards are provided.,30
188,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I know of no honwe orable member who would complain more to loudly than the honourable member for if the closure were applied to him. I have seen it resorted to only twice, once of in the Parliament of Tasmania, and, once own in this House, and I do not wish to see it again. In the Italian Parliament, the which has to deal with matters quite as important as those which engage our atten- tion, honourable members are allowed to write their speeches, but are restricted in the reading of them to fifteen minutes. I think that it would perhaps be of advantage if honourable members in this iChamber were to write their speeches, because there is no doubt they would, by that means, be able to make their utterances very much more effective. I have taken some trouble to obtain information upon this subject, and I think that the facts placed before hontime, orable members should be sufficient to an hour show that this question is not a new and that it has had to be of faced wherever Parliaments have met. I have not the slightest desire to deprive honto disorable members of fair and reasonable conliberty of speech, but I think that in the interests of honourable members themselves it would be desirable to place a time limit practice upon speeches. Honourable members must agree that many speeches which have extended over two, three, and four hours would have, had much greater effect, and would have been listened to much more , closely by honourable members, if they had My is that this motion should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration during recess, so that an order may be framed and submitted to the at all ? House next session. I think that the leader of the Government, or of the Opposition, or any honourable member who has to introhonorable duce an important subject, should be alus lowed unlimited time for that purpose. For instance, if the leader of the Opposition desired to move a motion of want of dence, I should give him absolute freedom, and, similarly, I should place no restrictions upon the leader of the Government in his' reply. My experience in the Federal ancl States Parliaments has shown me that not the leaders who are responsible for the long speeches that are delivered. I would restrict all other honourable members to threefor Darling? quarters of'a n hour, or, if honourable members think one hour preferable, I should object to that extension. Furthermore, think that the honourable member who closes a debate should be free from restriction. If the course I suggest were adopted, debate upon any subject need extend over more than two or three days.  member suggest so far as the proceedings in Committee are concerned ?",30
189,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not that honourable members should be permitted to speak three or four times, or occupy an unlimited time, in Committee. One address upon any given subject should Honourable members frequently make Committee speeches on the motion for second reading and second-reading speeches in Committee. During the consideration of the Arbitration Bill the Speaker the greatest trouble in restricting the debate to the measure under discussion, and the Chairman of Committees had an equally difficult task in keeping honourable members to the question before the Chair. interests of the good government of Auspractically tralia, and for the credit of this House, something must be done to put an end to the great waste of time that has been tempt. involved in our proceedings.",31

In Tasmania the feeling of bitter disapno pointment at the proceedings of this House, and at the small amount of work performed by the Federal Parliament, is almost universal. I have ascertained that an equally strong feeling exists in Victoria. This Parliament is not conducting its business in the manner which the electors think were led to expect it would.",31

198,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,When did that happen ?,31
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not intend to be led into making any personal reflections.,31
200,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We have not forgotten the long speeches which the Prime Minister used to deliver when he was in Opposition.,31
201,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Once more I ask the honourable member for Bland to accept my assurance that I wish my proposal to applv to the supporters of the Government equally with members of the Opposition or those who sit upon the cross-benches. Had I submitted this motion five months ago, I am inclined to believe that very many who are now opposed to it would have pronounced themselves in its favour. The best interests of the Commonwealth demand that we should introduce some system under which our business may be very much expedited, and a stop may be put to the enormous waste of time which goes on at present. I maintain that unless we bring our sessions within reasonable limits, we shall banish from this Parliament the very class of men whom we most desire, to see here. Personally, I wish all classes of the community to be represented. At present, however, many individuals who would prove worthy representatives of the workers are unable to enter this Parliament because of the financial sacrifice demanded of them in the maintenance of two homes.",31
202,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,W h v not increase the salaries of honourable members?,32
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Instea d of increasing the present salaries, I should rather see them reduced to £ 3 0 0 a year, and our sessions limited to six months. I am also in favour of adopting the system which obtains in some of the States of America, of fining each honourable member £ 2 for every day that he is absent from the House during the session. I should like Standing Orders Committee to consider whether, by limiting the length of the speeches of honourable members, we should not shorten our sessions, and whether by fining absentees we should not insure regular attendance of honourable members, with the result that business would be ducted in a very much better way. I hope that the House will give this matter its serious attention, and thus rescue this liament from the well-merited opprobrium which is now being cast upon it.",32
204,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," Personall y am quite in accord with this motion. think that a good deal of time is needlessly absorbed by honourable members in making long speeches. I am even prepared to go further than the honourable member for Franklin. Under certain circumstances, am quite in favour of the application of the closure. I do not think that any priagree vate member should be able to move a.n honourable member be no longer heard, but I should be quite satisfied to see power vested in any Minister who is in charge of any Bill which may be immeBarrier diately under discussion.",32
205,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That practice would create a very bad feeling.,32
206,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But honourable members should recognise that the public business must be transacted. In the New South Wales Parliament any honourable member used to be at liberty to move that an honourable member be no longer neard. I do not think that that is a proper power to place in the hands of members generally. In the case of a Minister, who is in charge of a Bill, however, the position is very different. After a discussion has proceeded for some time, if there be any suggestion Of "" stone-walling""",32
207,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"What is "" stone-walling "" ?",32
208,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In the House of Commons, when a debate has been in progress for some time, it is competent for the Minister in charge of the measure under discussion, to ask the Chairman of Committees, or Mr Speaker, whether, in his opinion, the discussion has been continued long enough. Should the Chairman or Mr. Speaker entertain that opinion, the motion is put to the Committee, or to the House.",32
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is determined upon division, is it not?",32
210,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Most decidedly. Of - course, I am not prepared to vest that power in a Minister without providing that the he shall first obtain the consent of the Chairman or Mr Speaker. That condition would afford some guarantee that the motion was not ""submitted for party purposes, but because the subject had been sufficiently dethe bated. I heartily support the motion. I am aware that the honourable member for conMelbourne is very strongly of opinion that when a quorum' is not present in the Chamvery ber, the Clerk of the House should be emParpowered to immediately draw attention to the fact, and that the bells should be set ringing. I am not prepared to go so far I as that, because I do not know that it is I necessary to have a quorum present at all times. In Committee, honourable members should have an opportunity of speaking as many times as they choose, but I think that some restriction should be imposed upon I the length of their utterances.",32
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, I to some extent with the motion of the that honourable member for Franklin; but I think that both he and the last speaker wish that to proceed to extremes in this matter. I am quite sure that the honourable member for would be one of the first to raise his voice in most violent protest if an attempt were made to give effect to some of his suggestions.,32
212,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not think that the honourable member has a right to say that, in view of my statement to the contrary.",33
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Judge d by his recent attitude, I am inclined to think that the honourable member would be violently antagonistic to such proposals. I am surprised to hear him advocating the application of the guillotine as it is practised in the House of Commons at the present time. I am amazed that an honourable member who professes to be in favour of liberal measures should advocate a procedure which recently resulted in the maiming and crippling of the Opposition there, when some Bills of the most vital import to the country as a whole were under consideration. There is no analogy between our position and that which obtains in the old country. In the Imperial Parliament, honourable members have to look after the affairs of a great Empire. The discussion of Britain's foreign policy absorbs most of their attention, and they have to husband their time in a way that we have not to do in Australia. Nevertheless, I frankly confess that in view of recents events, something must be done to curtail the long speeches of honourable members.",33
214,Mr STORRER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is the honourable member referring to events of past years?,33
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No . There is no analogy between the events of pastyears and the inane drivel to which we have had to listen hour after hour in this Parliament. There is all the difference in the world between fighting for a great principle, and the deplorable waste of time which has recently been witnessed in this Chamber. There are occasions in Parliament when obstruction becomes a sacred duty-occasion s when the Opposition believe that measures are being passed which are diametrically opposed to the will of the people.",33
216,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Who is to decide when that time arrives?,33
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Opposition must determine that question for themselves.,33

221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I think that the time has come when honourable members should be prevented from talking to empty benches for four or five hours at a stretch when there is nothing at stake, and when the only object which they have in view is that of making speeches to be reprinted from Hansard, and scattered broadcast over their electorates.",33
222,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is done by honourable members on both sides of the House.,33
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I.a m aware of that.,33
224,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then why attack any honourable member individually?,33
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am referring, not to any particular honourable member, but to any one who indulges in this practice. It seems to me that the habit is growingthat there is an increasing number of honourable members who address their electorates through the medium of Hansard, and avail themselves of a cheap way of advertising at the expense of the country.",33
226,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is a very costly way.,33
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I believe that an outside printer would charge far more than does the Government Printer for the re-printing of these addresses, and I am not sure that the practice to which I refer does not savour of an attempt to sweat private printing firms. I do not think that honourable members opposite who are so strongly in favour of unionism, and all that relates to labour, should take advantage of the Government Printer in the way they; do. The time of the House could be devoted to a better purpose than that of enabling honourable members to address their constituents. There is always the public platform open to those who' wish to place their views before the electors.",33
228,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not a fair statement to make.,33
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But it is a fact.,33
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,No n e of the representatives of New South Wales adopted that practice in connection with the selection of the seat of Government.,33
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I believe they did. I am happy to say that I have not availed myself of this system, but I may The whole House in this respect seems to be demoralized. I submit to the honourable member who moved the motion, as well as to the honourable member who replied to him, that it is easy for the public to provide a. remedy - I have heard many persons complain of the waste of time that takes place, and of "" the degradation of Parliament,"" as they term it ; but the remedy is in the hands of the people themselves. The secret of the whole matter is that the people have returned to this House three parties so equally balanced that they neutralize each other's efforts, and render it impossible for any effective work to be done. of affairs cannot be remedied by any rule of procedure which we may adopt. Even if we amended our Standing Orders in the way suggested by the honourable member for Franklin, we should find that those who wished to block the business of the House, or to prevent it from being conducted in a proper way, would still be able to do so. None of the proposals made by the honourable member would overcome the difficulty.",33

233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I would remind - the honourable member that there is no of analogy between the United States system of Government and that of Australia. Ours is an entirely different system. There is no such thing as representative and sponsible government as we understand it in the United States. In a Parliament, where most of the work is carried Grand Committee - where they have a miniature Parliament within in which honourable members may speak a hundred times on any question if they denot sire to do so- I can well understand that limitation may be placed on the speeches quate majority. delivered in the larger Assembly, whose duty it is to pass the measure which has been perfected in the smaller one. Grand Committee of Congress is about as large as is the whole Parliament of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, there is analog)', between that system-and our own.",34
234,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Does not the honourable member think that if we placed a time limit of one hour upon all speeches, the length of our sessions would be reduced ?",34
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not know tion be now put."" that it would. Limitations of this kind are imposed in the Legislature of New Zeaguillotine. land, but there is no limitation to the number of times that a member may speak. Those who desire to make long speeches are, therefore, able to get over the diffipassing culty by delivering them in sections. understand that there is a time limit twenty minutes to speeches made in mittee, but when a member desires to OCCUDV further time he resumes his seat after twenty minutes allotted to him has expired, and, later on, speaks for another twenty minutes. I am assured that the limitation of debate in the Parliament of New Zealand leads really to a very small saving of time. The only course open to us is to impose a limit to speeches which extend over so long a period as four That state or five hours. I do not think that we should allow any one-the Prime Minister or any other honourable member-to speak in this House for four hours at a stretch. If an honourable member cannot, say what he has to say in an hour and a half or two hours, he had better leave it unsaid. The country would be all the better for his having left unuttered those views which he could not express in a speech of two hours' duration. Any proposal in the I direction of limiting the right to make Consuch unduly protracted speeches will receive my cordial support j but I am not prepared to support the adoption the extreme measures urged, to my very great surprise, by the honourable member for Barrier. I see no necessity for any Parliament in Australia to resort - reto the political guillotine. The real remedy is for the .people to so arrange the state of parties in the House that effective out in government will be possible.",34
236,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But a small minority a Parliament, can block business.",34

239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In such circumstances they can carry it on only until such no time as the Government says that it shall stop.

240,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is the political,34
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is something very different. The political guillotine simply enables a Government to secure the of a section of a measure or porI tion of the Estimates without rhyme or of reason. I do not suggest anything of the Comkind. The method of shortening debate which I have just indicated is one for the which provision is made by the Standing Orders of every Parliament in Australia except our own, and it has worked well. We have not exhausted the possibilities of our own Standing Orders. We are working under a set which is obsolete, and should have been abolished long ago. Another place has already adopted new Standing Orders, and there is a draft set awaiting our consideration, which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.",34
242,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would take us six months to pass a set of Standing Orders.,35
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That has not ibeen the experience of other Parliaments. The first business of the next 'session should be the passing of new Standing Orders. If we obtain ^a new set of - reasonable rules of procedure, we shall very quickly be able to limit debate.",35

245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member was putting up a stone wall against - an unreasonable proposal in the Tariff Bill . He availed himself of a standing order under which it is possible, on the motion that the Chairman leave the Chair to discUss any subject. I do not know of a mode idiotic standing order, and I understand that it is peculiar to the Parliament of South Australia, from whose rules of procedure it has been copied by us.",35
246,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"At one one of the Standing Orders of the Queensland Parliament. , Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It should not exist in any orders. By a simple alteration of our Standing Orders, we Should be able to rid ourselves of the trouble of which the honourable member for Franklin complains. But the people must take the composition of the House into their own hands, and return a Government to power with a sufficient majority to enable it to control business and deal with it with all possible dispatch.",35
247,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I think we owe a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Franklin for having brought this matter before the House. I pay but little attention to his assertion that he has met persons in all parts of Tasmania who are opposed to this or that practice. Tasmania is full of persons who are opposed to everything. of them are opposed to anything to which a few men in the neighbourhood tell them 'they should object. In every part of Tasmania, with the exception of the West Coast, men are to be found who arte Barnums and Napoleons. They consider themselves to be the genii of the earth; they think that the ordinary men are returned to this House, and that the great men remain in the State. A person cannot remain in * a public house for ten minutes without finding twenty men who are prepared to say that the representative of tine district does not really represent it, and that the right man to return is one of those who is drinking with him. What the man on the street says about this Parliament is unworthy of consideration. When the elections come round, the people reject the candidate in the whom, they do not believe, and the members of this House are the best that could be selected from a population of nearly 4,000,000. They have been opposed by at least an equal number of candidates for legislative honours, and have not been defeated, so that what the man on the corner believes is immaterial to us. He has a kink in his brain. In America such men - are known as ""Western kinkerites,"" and we need not trouble ourselves about them. I recognise, however, that there should be a time limit to our speeches, for every honourable member should be able to say all that he wishes to say in an hour, or an hour and a half. The honourable member for Franklin spoke of what is done in the United States. In time it was Congress the mover of a motion is allowed an hour in which to speak in support of it, and if he speaks himself for only half an hour, he may allot the balance of the time amongst his supporters. When the hour has expired, his opponent gets up, and he in like manner farms out as much of his hour as he does not occupy himself. Then the mover 'has another hour in which to reply.",35
248,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Are speakers allowed to reply to interjections? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The time occupied in replying to interjections counts in the hour. I think that it would be a good thing if we allowed movers of motions in the House to occupy an hour in introducing them, and an hour in replying, and imposed a limitation of ten minutes on speeches in Committee. It would not then take long to get through our business. I see nothing to admire in long speeches, Some though one side offends as much as another in this matter. Everything depends upon whether members are on the Treasury benches or in Opposition. With regard to. what he said about professional politicians, I ask the honourable member for Franklin if he would like to see the Chamber full of amateurs, men who come here for an hour, and then go away to attend to their own business, leaving the professionals to keep a quorum ?",35
249,Mr MCWILLIAM S,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The commercial community ought to be represented here. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is a need for professional politicians as there is for professional doctors and professional lawyers. One would not employ a student who had not gone through the dissecting room to perform a delicate operation on his w if e ; he would call in a man of professional standing, such as Dr Fitzgerald. The people of this country paid guineas to hear Madame Melba sing when she was a professional, but they would not pay sixpence to hear her when she was an amateur. I hate this talk about professional politicians. Was not Gladstone a professional politician ? Are not Balfour and Chamberlain professional politicians? Every man who has made a name for himself in British politics has been a professional politician. The amateur is an automaton who does what the Prime Minister wishes him to do. He is a mere "" job popper."" We want professional politicians. The experience of the last three and-a-half years shows that for the next fift y years to come the sessions of the Commonwealth Parliament will always last for more than two or three months. The American States Parliaments, to which the honourable member for Franklin has referred, have only local laws to attend to. Parliaments of Ohio, Iowa, and Indiana legislate only for their respective States.",36
250,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But the Commons does not sit for more than six months in the year. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The House of Commons is an anachronism, and Englishmen are beginning to find that out. How could 600 or 700 men do any work if they all talked? In a few years there will be local Parliaments for England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, with an Imperial Parliament to deal with matters of Empire concern. This Commonwealth Parliament must realise its position, and its members must be paid decent salaries. Those who will stay here to-night to keep a quorum, and will be here again at half-past 10 I o'clock tomorrow morning to make a House, are not the men who draw incomes from businesses. They are men who come from the other States, and are dependent upon their allowances. The salaries paid to us are ridiculous. The time is not far distant when Parliament will, by a secret ballot, elect the Ministry, for a period of three years, and there will be no premature dissolutions. When that happens, members will be paid decent salaries, and they will be professional politicians, who will devote their minds to the best interests of their country, and not to the obtaining of wealth. The best men whom Australia has produced did not make a dollar for themselves. The late Sir Henry Parkes never made a dollar for himself. Neither did Daniel Webster, the best Treasurer that the United States ever had. The fact that a man makes dollars does not show that he has brains. It only shows that he is a monopolist, who grabs what other men earn.",36
251,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Robertson) The honourable member f o i Franklin had good cause to bring forward this motion. I have sat here now for many months, and I know that one gets brain-weary listening to the speeches of honourable members.",36
252,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We listen to the honourable member's speeches.,36
253,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have spoken at considerable length on several occasions, but never without having had something to say. I do not speak for the pleasure of hearing my own voice, nor do I repeat myself a dozen times over. . The long speeches which take place in this Chamber do no credit in .most instances to those who deliver them. The Mr KELLY - That is not fair.",36
254,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is my opinion. House of,36
255,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We may hold the same opinion about the honourable member's speeches, but we do not express it.",36
256,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am certain that the honourable member holds that opinion of every one's speeches but his own.,36
257,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then the honourable member is quite wrong.,36
258,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member for Kennedy speaks perpetually. If there is one member more than another who is a nuisance, it is he.",36
259,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member must not say that.,36
260,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"- I withdraw the statement if it is unparliamentary. However, I did not rise for the purpose of being disagreeable; I rose to protest against the inordinately long speeches which we sometimes hear, and the perpetual repetition in Committee of arguments delivered in . second-reading debates. The proposition of the honourable member for Franklin appears a reasonable one. He would allow both the leader of the House and the leader of the Opposition to speak at length, and would confine other honourable members to a limit of three-quarters of an hour, or an hour. If an honourable member has prepared his speech, he can speak with excellent effect in half an hour, but if he has had no time for preparation, he will often occupy three or four hours. If honourable members know that they have only a short time in which to speak, they will give more time to the preparation of their speeches, which will, in consequence, be more readable, and more creditable to them. The great waste of time takes place in Committee. The handbooks published by Mr Lucy of the proceedings of the House of Commons, by Mr. Bradlaugh, Mr Justin MCCarthy,, and others, show that the discussions in conmittee in the House of Commons are conversational in their nature, whereas we have in Committee what are practically second reading speeches. Possibly, if the reporting was not so good, we should have fewer speeches. I am certain that if the newspapers took but little nothe of our proceedings in Committee, the speeches would be fewer. For the most part, honourable members wish to advertise themselves. I protest against these long sessions.",37
261,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member is not here very often.,37
262,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Althoug h the honourable member is one of our most regular attendants, he occupies more time than is his due, and .owes his notoriety greatly to the fact that he makes so many speeches. Although I am not here so often as he is, I am not absent when business is being done; I am always here when I am wanted. When no business is being done., however, I absent myself to attend to my personal affairs. When I entered this Parliament, I threw up everything, took an establishment in Melbourne at considerable expense, and began to live here regularly. however, that I was only wasting my time by doing so, the session being of inordiLimitation [REPRESENTATIVES.] of Debate. nate length, and therefore discontinued the arrangement. If Parliament met in Sydney - instead of in Melbourne, I should be able to attend, as many Melbourne members do, long enough to get my name recorded, and I then go away again to look after my business. There is very little in being a regular attendant in that way. The great virtue of a member of Parliament lies in his bringing common sense to bear on the business of the House. The honourable member may not carry this motion, because very few great reforms are carried when first introduced; but it will pave the way for better arrangements next session. Possibly when the Standing Orders are considered, steps might be taken for a reduction of the quorum, at least in Committee. Moreover, a standing order to prevent obstruction, and what is known as stone-walling, might be passed.",37
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not think any Parliament in the world has as good an attendance as this Parliament has.,37
264,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Honourable members have been very regular in their attendance, in spite of the fact that there are few Parliaments whose members are called upon to sit for such long periods as we are. Our thanks are due to the honourable member for Franklin for having brought this matter forward, and I hope that the Prime Minister will place some suggestion before the Standing Orders Committee which will have the desired effect.",37
265,Mr FOWL ER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, The honourable member for Robertson has given us to understand that he is not one of those honourable members who would be affected by the adoption of a standing order following the lines suggested by the honourable member for Franklin.',37
266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I should be affected in just the same way as the honourable member.,37
267,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member also assured us that he does not adopt those methods of advertising upon the floor of this House of which he has accused other honourable members; but I am not sure that he can be entirely acquitted of offence in that regard. The motion affects us all to a certain extent. I am quite sure that we are all, at times, inclined to attach undue importance to our remarks.",37
268,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then why does the honourable member obiect to my saying so? I found, Mr FOWLER - The honourable member was at special pains to impress upon us that he was not in the habit of speaking at greater length than was necessary, but I do not think that he is to be held less blameable upon that score than are other honourable members. Whilst I am quite in sympathy with the object of the honourable member for Franklin, I am not sure that he can accomplish what he desires by the means suggested. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that if honourable members desire to waste time, they will findthe means to do so. evil that afflicts this Parliament is one which lies too deep to be reached by the means sug'gested. I have been fairly regular in my attendance in this House from the opening of the first Federal Parliament, and I have watched the proceedings very carefully. It appears to me that time has been wasted mostly when principle has been lost sight of, and party interests have loomed up too prominently. We require a more radical reform than that proposed by the honourable member for Franklin. With the honourable member for Darwin I look forward to the time when Ministers will bp appointed by a method different from that now adopted. I hold very strong ideas upon that subject, and I intend to take action early next session, a view to bringing about a reform. I believe in Government by majorities, I contend that Government by mere party majorities is bad. Although some of our speeches might well be shortened, I do not think it would be wise to restrict honourable members in Committee, because I have"" frequently noticed that those honourable members who do the most work, and accomplish the best results, are required to address the Committee very frequently. Ponderous speeches, that extend over many pages of Hansard, and are reprinted for the benefit of certain constituents, might very well be curtailed.",37
269,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is rather rough on the honourable member for Darling.,38
270,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not think it is fair to apply to any honourable member, remarks which I am making in quite an impersonal manner. I could point to many honourable members who have a tendency to offend in the direction I have indicated. Possibly I may have spoken at undue length once or twice; but I am not by any means worse offender. I think we might improve our present methods, and I suggest that the Standing Orders, which I understand have been thoroughly revised, should be submitted early next session. In the light of the experience we have gained, we should be able to shape them in such a way that they would tend to expedition in the transaction of business, without unduly curtailing the rights of honourable members.",38
271,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I congratulate the honourable member for Franklin upon having brought forward this question, although I do not quite agree with the The method he proposes. I desire to direct attention to one matter which has a general bearing upon the subject under discussion. I ' have noticed that sometimes full y three-quarters of an hour of our time has been occupied in , dealing with questions asked without notice. I do not say that these questions are not useful, but I think that if a. question is worth asking it could, nine times out of ten, be placed upon the notice paper, so that an opportunity might be afforded to the Minister to furnish a concise answer.",38
272,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why could not the replies be printed and circulated without being asked in the House? That is done in the Imperial Parliament.,38
273,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I would have no objecwith tion to such a procedure, or to questions Whilst being asked, if they are placed upon the notice-paper.",38
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Minister s could refuse to answer questions without notice.,38
275,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We can scarcely ask Ministers to take upon themselves that responsibility. Our Standing Orders are so framed that it seems to me that Ministers would expose themselves to a charge of discourtesy if they systematically refused to answer questions asked without notice. I hope that' honourable members will agree that questions without notice should not be addressed to Ministers except on special and urgent occasions.,38
276,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I rise for the purpose of supporting the motion. I think that instead of having been referred to, as I have been, in rather severe language by some honourable members opposite, I should have received their thanks for having been largely instrumental in causing this matter to be brought before the House. I am inclined to think the that the proposal will not have any practical result, and, therefore, that the time occupied in its discussion will have been to a very large extent wasted. The motion is not of a practical character. If it would have the effect of hastening tjhe adoption of new Standing Orders it might be of some use. It is time that the new Standing Orders, which are supposed to have been approved of by the Standing Orders Committee, were adopted. present we are in the hands of Mr Speaker, who looks after us exceedingly well; but I think it is a pity that we have not more definite and satisfactory rules to guide us. I entirely object to the insinuations have been made with regard to the motives which have actuated some honourable members in addressing the House at length. What right has the honourable member for Parramatta, or the honourable member for Robertson, to insinuate that other honourable members have occupied the time of the House in addressing their constituents, or in stone-walling? I have a distinct recollection of honourable members who are now sitting upon the Government side of the House keeping us here during the last Parliament for very long hours, repeating arguments ad nauseam. If I have been an offender in the matter of long speeches, I think that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat occupies a good second place. I claim the right to speak until I am satisfied that I have made myself clear. I am not desirous that honourable members should be attacked by brain-fag, as the result of listening to me; but as no limit is placed upon the length of our speeches, I do not know that I am committing any particular sin in taking my own time in expressing my views. If the Government so many political sins that I could not enumerate them within less than four-and-ahalf hours, honourable members opposite who placed them in power are indirectly to blame for the length of my speech. I think that the honourable member for Parramatta hit the nail on the head, when he said that the large amount of time occupied by honourable members in addressing the House, and the extreme length of our debates,' was due to the peculiar condition of parties. I do not believe that there is any desire on the part of honourable members to waste time, but that the cause of all the trouble has been the unsettled state of our political life during the last eight or nine months. Even if we had had more stringent Orders, and the length of speeches had been limited, we should not have been able to transact any more business. The honourable members for Franklin and Parramatta have the remedy in their own If those two honourable members will cross Mr Spence. over to this side of the House and assist us to bring about an appeal to the country the electors will be afforded an opportunity of returning to power a Government with a At working majority. I repeat that, during the present session, the House has not been in the humour to transact business. The same spirit prevails in every Parliament in which there is practically an equal diviwhich sion of parties. Where a Government possesses a strong working majority, the Opposition can do little more than act the part of watch-dogs; but when parties are evenly divided, it ,is the duty of the Opposition to endeavour to displace the Ministry. I felt so strongly in regard to the wickedness of the present Administration that I was recently obliged to occupy about eight hours in delivering two addresses. At the same time. I entertain no desire to make long speeches.",38
277,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Thre e of the honourable member's constituents have succumbed to those speeches.,39
278,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Most peculiar ideas have been suggested during the course of this discussion. It has been implied that it is wrong for honourable members to take an active part in Committee work, and to circulate what they may say-whic h to them may seem worth circulating-amongs t their constituents. I am one of those who think it is desirable that Hansard should be distributed among the electors. I can quite have understand the desire of the Government to keep the people in the dark, because it is the only way in which they can retain their positions. I deprecate the suggestion that honourable members deliberately talk to their constituents, or that the circulation of their addresses is a procedure to be condemned. I should like to see Hansard in every household throughout the Commonwealth. I desire the electors to be brought into close touch Will our parliamentary proceedings, and that object can be accomplished only through the medium of Hansard. The honourable member for Robertson has affirmed that some honourable members talk for the sake of gaining notoriety 'and of getting Standing their remarks reported in the newspapers. I would remind him, however, that the newspapers very rarely mention my name. I regard that as a great compliment. ""Upon the recent motion of censure, when I spoke hands. for four and a half hours, only four lines were devoted to the report of my speech in one of the big Sydney daily newspapers. The press carefully suppresses any utteroccasions ances of members of the Labour Party, and consequently we cannot be charged with medium. speaking in order to obtain reports in the newspapers.",39
279,Mr WILKS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Tocsin reports the honourable member.,40
280,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No newspaper reports our remarks. We are here to do the best photograph reproduced. we can in the interests of the people as whole. Though we may view matters irom different stand-points, it is not for orable member to suggest that we are ated by unworthy motives. The fact we have not done much work during present session is entirely due to the equal question, and division of political parties. Honourable members upon this side of the House have endeavoured to remedy that state of things, but without avail. I say that this House is capable of doing good business if it in working order. The Government, howlatures. ever, cannot control their own supporters. It is difficult for them to 'maintain a rum. Under such circumstances, how can we expect to do I support the motion, but to make it effecdent tive I think we should have an assurance from the Government that an opportunity Christmas. will be afforded us of adopting our own Standing Orders as soon as possible. Of course, no such opportunity could be provided during the present session, but at an early date next session the matter m i g n r t e discussed.",40
281,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I am own. very much opposed to this motion, but because I am anxious to make long speeches. Probably I have occupied less time in this House than has the average honourable ber. As a matter of fact, upon occasion have I spoken for more than an hour, and that was during an all-night sitgreat deal. ting, when I took a hand in the proceedings, just as did the honourable member for Robertson, when, as a member of the OpI position, he indulged in ""stone-walling."" I am quite prepared to accept his statement that I am a nuisance in this Chamber. I merely goes to prove that my criticisms have pinched him very considerably at various times. His statement, however, will not affect my future conduct in the slightest degree. I shall continue to give expression to my views, irrespective of whom they may offend, or whom they may please. The greater honourable member has charged some honStanding Orders. orable members with talking to their stituents through Hansard. I can recall upon which he himself has addressed his constituents through the same",40
282,Mr HENRV WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have done so upon several occasions.,40

The particular pamphlet upon actuwhich the honourable member's photothat graph was printed contains a speech the having reference to the black labour in travelling through Queensland I have had occasion to make use of several extracts from it. In this House honourable members must realise that, we occupy a very different position from were that occupied by members of States LegisThe latter come more or less constantly into touch with their constituents. quoBut what is the position of representatives of distant States in this House?

287,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But the honourable member travels in a very different manner. trust that this motion will not be carried. I have worked under Standing Orders where the closure and the guillotine have been in t force-wher e the closure was applied first must of all by a two-thirds majority of the House, and subsequently by the decision of a majority, consisting of thirty members out of a total membership of seventy-two. Independent of party feeling, which ran very high at different times, there was no source of irritation than were these Whenever the closure conwas applied it gave rise t'o a feeling of bitterness which lasted several months, and I am satisfied that the adoption of a similar standing order by this House would have the same result. From time to time differences of opinion occur among honourable members, but I can safely say that no honourable member of this House entertains any feeling of personal ill will towards another. If we introduce drastic Standing Orders, enabling the gag to be applied, we shall inevitably give rise to much bitterness.",40
288,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is what wish to avoid.,41
289,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not see how the honourable member would be able to avoid it . The time limit fixed in the New Zealand Parliament is easily evaded, whilst the political guillotine and the closure have led to many bitter scenes in the House of Commons. I would remind the honourable member that even if the motion be carried it will not convey any instruction that new Standing Orders shall be brought forward without delay, so that the debate upon it amounts practically to a waste of time.",41
290,Mr WILKS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is only a declaration of principle.,41
291,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But the principle involved is a bad one. What an honourable member may say in this House is a matter between himself and his constituents. If his conduct in this House injures any one it must injure himself.,41
292,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But are we to put up with this state of affairs for three vears ?,41
293,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"So far, I hold that no debate has been unduly protracted. There is no honourable member to whom I listen with greater attention than the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and yet he makes longer speeches than does any other member.",41

Mr HENRY WILLIS - The course proposed by the honourable member for Franklin would remedy that state of affairs.",41
298,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not think that any remedy is necessary. I oppose the motion, because I feel that it would prevent honourable members occupying responsible positions from placing much valuable information Ibefore the House. Where the parties are almost equally divided, an Opposition can prolong debate and harass a Government, no matter what rules of procedure are in operation. Probably, the only way to get over the difficulty would be I to introduce the guillotine, but I , for one, da not favour anything of the kind. I have known a Government to say that so many pages of the Estimates-providing , perhaps, for an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds-shoul d be passed within a certain time. After this declaration has been made, I have seen two or three supporters of that Government waste the time of the Committee up to within a few minutes of the hour at which the question was to be put, so that members of the Opposition should not have an opportunity to offer any criticism. Surely this House would not be prepared to agree to the application of the closure under such circumstances. Some one may say that the responsibility for putting such a standing order into force would rest with the Ministry, but it would never be applied except by a Government possessing a substantial majority. I trust that the course proposed by the honourable member will not be adopted, for it would tend only to engender strife and bitterness, and to put an end to that good feeling which has so long prevailed among honourable members.",41
299,Mr MCCOLL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," Judgin g by the chorus of approval with which the motion has been received, the honourable member for Franklin may fairly be said to have ""struck o i l . "" The only dissentient voice which has been raised is that of the lionorable member who has just resumed his",41
300,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member for Parramatta also opposed it.,41
301,Mr MCCOLL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"He disagreed, not with the terms of the motion, but with the sugin the gestion made by the honourable member for Barrier, that the political guillotine should be introduced. With one remark made by the honourable member for Kennedy I cerHe never tainly disagree. He said that the length of the speeches delivered by an honourable member in this Chamber was a matter between himself and his constituents. But something more is involved. Any 'honourable member who avails himself of the Standing Orders to occupy more than a fair share of the time of the House simply tramples on the rights of his fellow members. He wastes the time, not only of his fellow members, but of the country, and his action also involves a waste of money. Each day's sitting of the House costs something like j£ 1,600, so that the honourable member who monopolizes three or four hours of each sitting-day is guilty of a waste of public money. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, there is very little in prolonged speeches that is really worthy of attention. It seems to me that this motion, coming before us, as it does, practically at the close of the session, is tantamount to one of censure on the session, and upon honourable members themselves. The fact that nearly every honourable member approves of it, shows that they regard it in that light, and adds point to it. I trust that after what has been said, honourable members will pass a denying ordinance, and so curtail their speeches that we may be able to transact some business. The honourable member for Darling laid very great stress on the necessity for a dissolution. No doubt the political atmosphere will not be clear until a dissolution takes place, but such a thing at the present time would be very unjust to those engaged in rural industries, who comprise a large section of the people of the Commonwealth. That, I take it, is the reason why the honourable member presses for a dissolution at the present time.",41
302,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The statement just made by the honourable member has been proved to be incorrect.,42
303,Mr HIGGINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We desired a dissolution three months ago.,42
304,Mr MCCOLL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Eve n then, it would have come at an inopportune time for the farmers and pastoralists. There is no doubt that the peculiar position of parties in this House is responsible for the present condition of affairs. I have always been a supporter of party government, but in view of our' experience in this Parliament during the last year or two, I have been led to consider whether it is not a mistake to regard it as indispensable. I am strongly inclined to endorse the views of the honourable member for Perth, and to think that if better progress is not made under the present system, it will be our duty before long to seriously consider whether it would not be possible for us to have a non-partu Government elected by the votes of honourable members of this House. If such a course were adopted, I think that we should place Australia in a very much better position than it is in at present. We have not resolved ourselves into strict party lines, and, that being so, a non-party Government seems to be a necessity of the situation. I believe this motion will bear good fruit, and trust'that it will be carried.",42
305,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I am somewhat surprised to find my fellow members sitting in judgment upon themselves. The object which the honourable member for Franklin has in view meets with the warm approval of honourable members of the Opposition. No one is justified in taking up more time than is necessary for him to place his views clearly before the House, and I think that the Government should, long before this, have submitted to our consideration the draft Standing Orders which have been prepared, after very careful consideraselftion, by the Standing Orders Committee. There certainly ought to be a standing order placing a reasonable time limit upon the speeches of honourable members. I feel that, in any circumstances, the Prime Minister would not be a party to an attempt to curtail any address that was relevant to the subject before the Chair, and which was having a good effect upon the House. The Standing Orders, which we have temporarily adopted, enable practically one member to say whether or not an honourable member shall be allowed to discuss a certain topic. I should prefer any set of Standing Orders to one that makes one honourable member practically a despot. If the new Standing Orders contain any provision designed to prevent unduly protracted debate, I shall welcome them, for it seems to me that it is just as necessary to place a limit on the speeches delivered by the older members of the House, as it is to impose one on those delivered by younger and less experienced members. Debate interrupted under sessional order limiting the time for private members' business. SUPPLY (1904-5). ADOPTION OF RESOLUTIONS : PROCEDURE : ORDER OF BUSINESS.",42
306,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," In pursuance of a friendly arrangement with honourable ""members opposite, I wish to move, by concurrence, without noticeThat the Standing Orders be suspended in order to allow the reports, from the Committee of Ways and Means to be adopted, and the Bill for the Appropriation for Works and Buildings to be passed through all its stages without delay, and the Appropriation Bill to be read a second time. We shall not go on with the Appropriation Bill in Committee until other contentious matters Have been dealt with. That is the understanding to which I have come with the leader of the Opposition. I have undertaken not to proceed with the Appropriation Bill in Committee until all other contentious business has been dealt with.",42
307,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why pass the second reading of the Appropriation Bill?,43
308,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why not?,43
309,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The necessity for moving the suspension of the Standing Orders will not arise until the resolutions have been reported from Committee of Wavs and Means. Mr Reid' - Then I move That the resolutions reported from Committee of Supply be now adopted.,43
310,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I have no objection to the resolutions from Committee of Supply being agreed to, but I shall object to the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable the second reading of the Appropriation Bill to be passed.",43
311,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member cannot discuss that now.,43
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," Ap parently the' resolutions reported from Committee of Supply cover, not only appropriations for new works and buildings, but also the ordinary appropriation for the services of the year.",43
313,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The motion for the suspension. of the Standing Orders which the Prime Minister read will not be moved until it is necessary to move it. It is not now before the House. Before a Bill sanctioning the appropriation of money for the purposes of new works and buildings can be introduced, the resolutions from the Committee of Supplv and resolutions from the Committee of Ways and Means must be agreed to by the House.",43
314,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not wish anything to be done at this stage, under cover of the statement that only new works and buildings are affected, which will unduly carry forward the ordinary appropriation for the various Departments.",43
315,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The appropriation for works and buildings and the appropriation for the ordinary services of the year will be covered by separate Bills, I understand.",43
316,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Estimates which were put before honourable members are divided into two parts. I gathered from the statement made by the Prime Minister this afternoon that it was intended to proceed further only with the second division, namely, those covering new works and buildings, and transmitted with the following messageIn accordance with the requirements of Section fifty-six of. the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Governor General transmits to the House of Representatives Estimates of Expenditure for Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c , for the year ending the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and five; and recommends an Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund accordingly. That is a different message from the message with which the Estimates-in-Chief were transmitted, and I presume that in accordance with it, a Bill may be introduced sanctioning only appropriations for new works and buildings. There is no serious objection, so far as I know,, to the introduction and passing of such a Bill ; but I do not think that it is right to carry the ordinary appropriation for the year any further. I understand that the leader of the Opposition 'has agreed only to the carrying forward of the appropriations for new works and buildings.",43
317,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The practice which this House has uniformly followed is that the resolutions reported from the Committee of Supply are brought up, as on the present occasion, and adopted by the House. The matter is then dealt with by the Committee of Ways and Means, and its resolutions are in turn reported and adopted. Bills are then introduced to give effect to the resolutions of the Committee of Supply and of the Committee of Ways and Means. Last year three such Bills were introduced; but this year I understand that only .two Bills will be brought in. These Bills will be dealt with separa : tely. If the House thinks fit, one may be passed and the other rejected, or one put through all stages and the other passed merely through the first-readingstage. This division takes place after the resolutions of the Committee of Ways and Means have been reported and agreed to.",43
318,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I would point out to the honourable member for Hume that I am not now asking for any favour. We have arrived at the present stage in the ordinary course of business. Resolutions have been reported from Committee of Supply, and I have merely moved their adoption. - I have, however, pointed out that in the course of a friendly chat with the leader of the Opposition-to which I do not hold honourable members opposite, because he did not bind them, in any way-w e came to the conclusion that the constitutional usage to which he referred this afternoon would be sufficiently protected if we took the ordinary Appropriation Bill no further than into Committee, until after the other contentious business of the session had been concluded, and passed through all stages a Bill authorizing the construction of new works and buildings.",43
319,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why not stop at the. first reading of the Appropriation Bill?,44
320,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is a matter of no great importance. I am willing to make twelve stages, if honourable members think that that would be more acceptable to them, though personally I wish to push on with business. If we do not take the Appropriation Bill further than into Committee, it will be open to honourable members to speak on every item of it.",44
321,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But its principle is affirmed when the House agrees to its second reading.,44
322,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If any honourable member has observations of national importance to make on the second reading, I shall not press it. What I shall propose must be done with concurrence. I am not, however, asking any favour of the House at the present time.""",44
323,Mr HIGGINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We have arrived at the present stage in due order.,44
324,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Yes .,44
325,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," The right honourable gentleman says that the proper constitutional course is being followed ; but, in my judgment, the Estimates should be divided. In this case they have been transmitted with two separate messages from the Governor General.",44
326,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There is a constitutional reason for the course proposed, the Senate having the right to amend the Bill covering expenditure on new works and buildings, but not having the right to amend the ordinary Appropriation Bill . Therefore, two separate measures have to be sent to them from this House.",44
327,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In that case two separate resolutions should be submitted for adoption by the House, one covering the ordinary Estimates and the other the Estimates for works and buildings. agreeing to the resolutions of the Committee of Supply, the House agrees to all the items covered by them, and when that has been done it is very difficult to deal with any items separately. It is only reasonable that ;the two sets of Estimates should be kept separate, and that two resolutions should be submitted to this House.",44
328,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Separat e resolutions covering the two divisions of the Estimates were reported from Committee of Supply.,44
329,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The resolutions read by the Clerk covered the whole of the administrative portion of the Estimates. If it is proposed to deal only with new works and buildings, the suspension of the Standing Orders ought not to be moved to cover the ordinary Estimates for the year.",44
330,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have not yet moved the suspension of the' Standing Orders. We are now at a stage which has been arrived at l in the ordinary course. I will niot consent to postpone the adoption of the resolutions from the Committee of Supply.,44
331,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I think that the Estimates covered by 'the two messages should have been dealt with separatiely. A ow it is proposed to mix them up, and to T suspend the Standing Orders, in order",44
332,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There is no such motion before the Chair.,44
333,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But such a motion is to be brought forward.,44
334,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member cannot discuss a motion that is not before the Chair.,44
335,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am only referring to it, because of the statement made by the Prime Minister. The course proposed to be followed will result in confusion and possibly something worse. The resolution will relate to a matter with which we do not propose to deal at this stage.",44
336,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We do propose to deal with it. The first reading of the Appropriation Bill follows the carrying of the resolutions of the Committees of Supply and of Ways and Means. Those resolutions can be considered without any favour from any one.,44
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am now taking exception to the submission together of resolutions dealing with two distinct Bills. I am prepared to allow the Bill relating to the appropriation for new works and buildings to go forward to the Senate at the earliest possible date, but I think that we should deal with the other resolutions relating to the ordinary By Estimates in the usual constitutional way.",44
338,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Order ! The honourable member is now really discussing the point of order upon which I gave a decision a few minutes ago. I then indicated that we are following the course that has invariably been adopted in this Parliament. The point at which the division of the two Bills takes place is when the resolutions of the Committee of Ways and Means are reported. The honourable member is now practically contending that my ruling is wrong.,45
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I ask, Mr Speaker, whether it is the constitutional practice to deal with two sets of resolutions practically in one, or whether we should not first deal with the resolutions of which it is proposed to finally dispose, leaving the others in abeyance until we are prepared to consider rtheAppropriation Bill embodying the ordinary Estimates.",45
340,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The two messages came down from the Governor General, and were, by a resolution of the House, referred to the Committee of Supply. That Committee has chosen, in its wisdom, as it had a perfect right to do, to consider both messages, and to report to the House, not first one, and then the other, but both sets of resolutions at the same time. The Committee 'had a to do that, and the question now is that the report of the Committee of Supply be agreed to. As I pointed out before, the next step will be to refer the resolutions to the Committee of Ways and Means, and upon the resolutions of that Committee being reported, it will be proposed that Bills be prepared to give effect to them. At this point the two matters will again become separate as the Constitution requires, and the House may then determine what shall be done.",45
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I you, Mr Speaker, whether it is constitutional for the Committee to report upon two Bills at once? For instance, if two Bills dealing with different subiects were referred to the Committee, and were reported in one resolution, would that be constitutional ?",45
342,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the messages related to different subjects they would be referred to different committees; but in this case both resolutions were properly referred to the Committee of Supply, and the Committee of Supply properly reported the two matters at once. It is impossible to conceive of a case of the kind indicated by the honourable member.",45
343,Mr HIGGINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"May I submit, upon the point of.order, that it would be well for us not to pass resolutions referring to the Committee of Supply two messages at the same time. You, sir, have just informed us that the House referred to the Committee of Supply two messages together.",45
344,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That has been done eveiy year.,45
345,Mr HIGGINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The course to be taken was a new one owing to the distinction between the ordinary Estimates and the special Estimates to be made for new works and buildings. This is the result of the distinction made in the Constitution between Bills which the Senate may amend and Bills which it may not. A misunderstanding has arisen owing to the House combining the two messages in the one resolution, and sending them to a Committee of Supply. I apprehend that what is now being done is perfectly regular.",45
346,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"What is the honourable member's point of order? . Mr HIGGINS - I am arguing on the point raised by the honourable member for Hume. I understand that his contention is that it is not right for the House to deal with a resolution of the Committee of Supply with regard to two distinct mesperfect right sages. I take it , however, that the House cannot do anything else at this stage, and that the mistake has arisen from our having sent to the Committee of Supply two distinct messages under cover of the one resolution.",45
347,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I would remind the honourable and learned member that a Committee of Supply is set up at the beginning of every session for the purpose of considering all financial matters relating to Supply that may be referred to it. Each desire to ask year various messages have been referred from time to time to the Committee of Supply, which 'has brought up its report on every occasion, as upon this, covering all the matters referred to it. Upon one occasion three separate messages were covered by the one report, and I am not sure that in another case there were not 1 actually four messages referred.to the Committee and reported to the House in the one set of resolutions. We are not adopting any new practice or one under which any mistake can possibly arise.",45
348,Sir JOHN QUICK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I desire to ask whether it would be convenient for me at the present stage to raise a question which has been under discussion for some little time, and which probably should have been dealt with in Committee of Supply. I;refer to the retirement of Colonel Price, the late District Commandant of Queensland, and the question whether the circumstances of his case would render it advisable to provide for him some special gratuity or compensation. Upon reflection, perhaps I had better take an opportunity to refer to the matter when the Appropriation Bill reaches the Committee stage.",45
349,Sir WILLLAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," The Defence estimates are included in the resolutions of the Committee of Supply, and, therefore, I presume that the honourable and learned member would be entitled to raise the point he has mentioned.",46
350,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable and learned member would have been perfectly entitled to do so, but he has indicated that he will wait until the Appropriation Bill reaches the Committee stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. WAYS AND MEANS (1904-5). TARIFF COMMISSION.

If we have done wrong in the past it is not too late for us to retrace our The effect of carrying the two resolutions proposed by the Prime Minister will be pledge honourable members, to a certain tent, to the whole of the Estimates. That an argument that would be used by the Prime Minister if occasion arose. To mind, the proper method is to deal with resolutions separately, and they should been reported separately. I wish it to placed on record that this method may vent the general Appropriation Bill being dealt with as honourable members may deall its stages this evening. sire, and that I shall not regard myself being prevented by the adoption of these solutions from taking any action I may fit with regard to the Appropriation Bill, I trust that their adoption will not garded as being binding upon member. 11 z",46
352,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," Wit h regard to the order of business, I may say that the understanding at which I arrived with the Prime Minister last evening was that the Appropriation Bill, covering the estimates for new works and buildings, should be passed.",46
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,-No one objects to that.,46
354,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is not the Prime Minister proposing to go a step further?,46
355,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"So far, nothing further than that has been attempted. With regard to the Appropriation Bill, it was agreed that it should be checked at the Committee stage. There was no understanding arrived at between the Prime Minister and myself that the Appropriation Bill should pass its second reading this evening.",46
356,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not regard the understanding with my honourable friend as binding the whole of the Opposition. It was merely in the nature of a conversation between us.,46
357,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Quite so. I stated that I saw no objection to advancing the Appropriation Bill to the Committee stage so long as we transacted the serious business of the session which remains to be done before this House lost control of that measure. That control, it-seems to me, will still be retained if the Bill be advanced to the Committee stage.",46
358,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not regard all the of the Opposition astoeingbound regard by the conversation which took place beproper tween the honourable member for Bland and myself last evening. Consequently, I steps. shall not complain if some honourable members opposite do not feel inclined to assist to the Government so far as does the honorexable member for Bland. But I am quite is willing to take only the first reading of the Appropriation Bill to-night. As honourable my members are aware, that is merely a formal the stage- a stage at which it is never dishave cussed, and one which merely introduces be the Bill to the notice of the House. But prethere is a positive reason for putting the Bill relating to works and buildings through Later on, as when we reach the Bill stage, I propose to reamend my resolution, so as to ask the Comdeem mittee to put the Works and Buildings Bill and through all its stages at the present sitting, be reand to pass only the first reading of the any honourable Appropriation Bill.",46
359,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I am quite sure that the Prime Minister will find that the members of the Opposition will the only too willing to help him to transact the business of the country, so far as lies in their power, having regard to their public duty. So far as - the Works and Buildings Bill is concerned, I think that he will receive every assistance. Regarding the Appropriation Bill , I understand that this afternoon he announced his willingness to recognise the right of this Chamber to retain control over it until all the serious business which, remains to be done has been transacted.",47
360,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is so.,47
361,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Amongs t that ""serious"" business, I take it that he includes the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , the question of preferential trade, and the appointment of the Tariff Commission.",47
362,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Certainl y not. I look upon an executive act as quite different from a legislative act.,47
363,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think it is only right - that the meaning of the rather ambiguous statement of the Prime Minister should be made clear.,47
364,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Surely , I was talking of 1 measures of legislation-no t of executive acts. There is a wide difference between the two things.",47
365,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable gentleman knows very well that a certain motion was withdrawn upon the distinct promise that he would perform that executive act.,47
366,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am not questioning the fact that I am going to perform it. am pledged to do so. Mr ISAACS:-Of course, it will be the duty of the Opposition, so far as lies in their power, to see that that executive act is performed. But the Prime Minister must not understand that we at all acquiesce in his statement that the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the working of the Tariff has-now been divested of ' party significance.",47
367,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I will take it any way the honourable ancl lea'rned member desires. shall be only too happy to satisfy honourable members. I will admit that it is still a party question, if they please.",47
368,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am willing to believe that the Prime Minister will carry out the very distinct promise which he made,47
369,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The absolute promise.,47
370,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I admit that, to alarge extent, the appointment of the Tariff Commission is an executive act, and I know that the Prime Minister-agains t the wish of some honourable members upon this side of the Chamber-ha s assumed the full responsibility of that executive act.",47
371,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is so.,47
372,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Therefore , we desire to have, at the earliest possible moment, a distinct announcement as to the - personnel of the Commission. Mr WATSON,-The right honourable gentleman is going to submit to me the names of those whom he proposes to appoint, and I have agreed to assist him.",47
373,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That leaves the honourable and learned member free to make a party question of it. Others take a broader view of their public duties.,47
374,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Prime Minister cannot fail to recognise that both he and his Government must accept full responsibility for the appointment of that Commission as a party question.,47
375,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As any Question that the honourable and learned member likesparty, or otherwise.",47
376,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,A m I to understand that the Prime Minister does not pledge himself to place the appointment of the Tariff Commission upon the same footing as preferential trade and the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill?,47
377,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not understand the honourable and learned member.,47
378,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I should like to have a clear understanding that before this session closes I Mr Reid - The honourable and learned member is now coming to another point.,47
379,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I should like to have a definite understanding that before this session closes, and in sufficient time to enable us to express our opinions upon the matter, the Prime Minister will appoint the Tariff Commission, and take full responsibility for his action.",47
380,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If I appoint the Commission, surely I must take full responsibility for my action. I have to watch my honI orable and learned friend very carefully. He must not resume his seat under the impression that I have pledged myself to carry out a certain executive act before a certain date. I should scorn to occupy my present position if I allowed myself to be dictated to in that way. Having regard to my position as Prime Minister, and to that of the Government as advisers to the Crown-and the appointment of this Commission will be in the nature of advice to the Crown, without which it could not come into existence- I decline to give any pledge in such a matter. I have given something, however, which the leader of the Opposition has acceptedsomething which is just as satisfactory as any sort of lawyer-like pledge which my honourable and learned friend could construct- 1I have given my personal assurance to the honourable member for Bland that I intend to push this matter through with the utmost despatch. But I gave that assurance voluntarily, and I ""give to the honourable and learned member for Indi, who seeks to impose terms upon me and to exact pledges, no satisfaction whatever.",47
381,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," The Prime Minister should understand that he is not giving personal pledges to any honourable member, and I am quite sure that the honourable member for Bland accepts no such pledge. What the right honourable gentleman is here to do-and what he is bound to do-is his duty to the country.",48
382,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But not at the dictation the honourable and learned member. He hauled that flag down when he indulged similar tactics upon a former occasion.,48
383,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Prime Minister backed down, and if he had not done so would not be in office today. We feel the ing necessity-and we intend to insist upon it sion.theThe - of holding the right honourable gentleman was that heimpression to the pledge which he gave to this and the country. He may be as insulting as he pleases, but the country will not want, I hope, for men in this House who will stand to their guns, and do their duty, in spite of all that he may say. . Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) - I should . like to ascertain whether it is proposed put these resolutions separately or together.",48
384,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Goo d gracious ! only following the practice which has been followed from time immemorial. Why these objections ?,48
385,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Prime Minister ment. seems to be very vigilant.,48
386,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I cannot understand all these absurdities.,48
387,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Eve n though the practice adopted upon the-present tieen followed from time immemorial, we should not hesitate to adopt a better if one can be inaugurated. I merely wish to know whether, if these resolutions are plain King's English. 11 z 2 put together, they will have any effect upon the Bills which will subsequently be introduced.",48
388,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There are really two resolutions before the Committee, and if the honourable member for Wide Bay, or any other honourable member, desires it, 1 will put them separately. But I would point out that if they were put together it would not prevent the introduction of sepavate Bills.",48
389,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I should be glad if you would put them separately.,48
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, When the honourable and learned member for Indi submitted a motion having reference to the appointment of a Tariff Commission- a motion which was withdrawn in consequence of a statement by the Prime Minister,48
391,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,In consequence of not having the numbers.,48
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It was with drawn owing to a statement and a promise which were made by the Prime Minister. Scarcely had the honourable and learned member withdrawn his motion than the right honourable gentleman attempted by his glibness of speech to deprive his previous state of ment of anything in the nature of a promise as much as he possibly could. No doubt, in that is why the honourable and learned member for Indi is rather dubious as to his future action with regard to this matter. he I was present this afternoon when the Prime Minister made the announcement concernappointment of the Tariff Commisleft upon my mind was doing all that he could, House by means of his command of language, to draw the Opposition into his net.",48
393,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is this a new intrigue?,48
394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am not speaking to the honourable member. The language of the Prime Minister this after to noon was not very definite. Apparently, he desired to convey the impression that We are the appointment of the Tariff Commission and the Tariff question itself were not in all future to be regarded as party matters.",48
395,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I never made any such state,48
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I may have 0 misunderstood the right honourable gentleman.,48
397,Mr WILSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member occasion has generallv does.,48
398,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not think system that is a very nice remark to make. I always like to hear a statement made in It is certainly undesirable that statements should be made on which different constructions may be placed. I wish it to be clearly understood that, in my opinion, it is absolutely impossible for a Tariff Commission, consisting of members of both sides of this House, to be appointed, unless the House has an opportunity to consider its personnel. When the suggestion was made on a previous occasion, that the appointments should be ratified by the House, the right honourable gentleman said that he and his Government would accept the whole responsibility for them.",48
399,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is not proposed take the remedy out of the hands of the House.,49
400,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The whole tenor of the remarks made to-night by the right honourable gentleman, went to show that while he would not give the House an opportunity to consider the appointments made to the Commission, in a secondary way he would make the Opposition, as a whole, a party to the selection made. The Tariff cannot be taken out of the category of party questions.",49
401,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I did not speak Tariff question; I spoke only of the appointment of the Commission.,49
402,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have not had an opportunity to read the Hansard report of the statement made by the right honourable gentleman, but I 'listened very attentively to his speech. Unless the House is to have an opportunity to ratify the appointments made to the Commission-to approve of its personnel- I shall throw the whole responsibility, upon the Government.",49
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They will never be able to bear it.,49
404,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We shall see. In regard to the interjection made a moments ago by the honourable member for Moira, I would say that I desire to see Commission appointed before we pass the Appropriation Bill . The Prime Minister promised the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the House generally, that Commission would be appointed at the liest possible date, or, at pall events, at an early date. Nearly a month has elapsed since that promise was given, it has not yet been fulfilled. I certainly do not think that the Commission should appointed after Parliament has been rogued, and at a time when we shall have no opportunity to raise any objection Unless such a statement as that which I have just made were clearly put before the House, the Prime Minister, judging by the remarks which he made this evening, might endeavour to 'hold the leader of the Opposition responsible for the personnel of the Commission, although we should not have had an opportunity to consider the matter. The leader of the Opposition, in his kindness of heart",49
405,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,H is sense of public duty.,49
406,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I know that the leader of the Opposition, in his kindness of heart, will be prepared to assist to the Prime Minister in every possible way; but in view of the remarks made this evening by the right honourable gentleman, it seems to me that if the Commission were appointed after the House goes into recess, the Opposition might be called upon to accept its report, whether it approved or disapproved of its constitution.",49
407,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What utter nonsense !,49
408,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I wish, at all events, to put before the Committee the position that I take up. When the right honourable gentleman promised the honorof the able and learned member for Indi that the Commission would be appointed at the earliest possible date, with the result that the amendment relating to the question was withdrawn, I certainly thought that 'he proposed to make the appointments within the next three or four weeks. No further time should be occupied in making a selection of gentlemen, of whom the House would approve, to carry out such an onerous and important duty.",49
409,Mr FULLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"How long did it take the honourable member, as Minister of Home Affairs, to select the members of the Capital Sites Commission?",49
410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is useless few for the honourable and learned member to endeavour in this way to draw a red herthe ring across the trail. I shall decline to be bound by the report of the Commission unless I feel that, in the circumstances, its constitution is a fair one. I hope that the the Prime Minister will appoint the Commisearsion before the Appropriation Bil l is passed. The desire was, in the first instance, that the appointment should be but made by the House; but, in view of the promise made by the Prime Minister, the be amendment moved by the honourable and prolearned member for Indi was withdrawn, and it is only fair that that undertaking to it. should be carried out.",49
411,Mr MCCOLL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I think it is just as well that the House and the country should know that interest in the appointment of the Tariff Commission is not confined to the honourable and learned member for Indi, the honourable member for ' Hume, and the small coterie which surrounds them. There are honourable members on this side who are just as keen in their desire that a Commission shall be appointed, and that it shall be a fair one, as are honourable members of the Opposition corner.",50
412,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We do not, at all events, hear much from them.",50
413,Mr MCCOLL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The suggestion was made, and endorsed by the House, that if possible the whole of the States should be represented on the Commission, and honourable members will recognise that it is not an easy matter to make such a selection in the course of a week or two. This matter does not lie altogether in the hands of the Prime Minister; it is just as much the business of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is as keen, as ardent, and as honest a protectionist as is any honourable member of the Opposition corner. orable members on this side will see that the promise made by the Prime Minister is carried out to the full. The leader of the Protectionist Party, sits on this side of House, and his honour is also involved in the appointment of a satisfactory Commission, so that the country, need not fear that a fair and honest Commission will not be appointed. The appointment of the Commission is not a matter that comes solely within the purview of the House; it is an Executive act, and as honourable members of the Opposition have insisted that the Government shall take the responsibility for it, full time must be allowed to the Government to make a wise selection, and such as the importance of the matter demands.",50
414,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I think that honourable members of the Opposition, who are interested in the proposals for an alteration of the Tariff, are quite justified expecting that the pledge given by the Prime Minister four weeks ago shall be redeemed before the House goes into recess. Of course, as the Prime Minister has said, the Government must take the responsibility for the appointments.",50
415,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am not going to appoint a Commission until I am perfectly satisfied that I have obtained the best men available for the work; I am not going to oblige mv enemies by doing anything else.,50
416,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is a very proper attitude to take up. Every one admits that the matter is of sufficient importance to justify the closest attention of the Prime Minister.,50
417,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We have to obtain the consent of those whom we invite to act on the Commission.,50
418,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is so. I do not deny for one moment that it is unreasonable to expect that the whole matter should be dealt with in the course of a few days. At the same time one can quite understand the anxiety of honourable members of the Opposition that the Commission shall be appointed before the House goes into recess.,50
419,Mr HIGGINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Before the Appropriation Bill goes up to another place. . Mr Reid - Honourable members may keep the Appropriation Bill here for a year. I made no bargain with any one about the Appropriation Bill and t'he Royal Commission.,50
420,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is only reasonable Hon- that honourable members of the Opposition should exhibit some anxiety to .have the Commission appointed before they are deprived by the prorogation of Parliament of the opthe portunity to express any opinion as to its personnel.,50
421,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would be a pretty start to the deliberations of the Commission if we had a political controversy in regard to its personnel before it entered upon its work.,50
422,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not anticipate that there is any likelihood of such an occurrence.,50
423,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would luin its usefulness before it began its investigation.,50
424,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not suppose that the right honourable member anticipates having to fall back on men whose appointment would be likely to provoke such a discussion.,50
425,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If I could secure the twelve in apostles, I should not be able to satisfy every honourable member opposite.",50
426,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am quite prepared to rely on the assurance of the Prime Minister that he will give every consideration to.the matter, and deal with it as expeditiously as possible. If , as time goes on, nothing is done, we shall be able to take action; but in the meantime there is no reason to suspect the bona fides of the Prime Minister. I am prepared to allow the matter to remain in abeyance until there is evidence that the appointment of the Commission is being improperly kept back, and that the pledge given by the right honourable gentleman is not being fulfilled.",50
427,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I wish to say that there are two ways of putting these matters to one . occupying my position-the way adopted by honourable members sitting below the gangway, and the course followed by the leader of the Opposition. After the statement which has just been made, I have no difficulty in repeating to the House the personal assurance I gave to the leader of the Opposition, that I shall lose absolutely no time in this matter-that I shall make it a personal pressing matter of public concern to appoint the Commission without a moment's avoidable delay. I can give such an assurance to any one who approaches me as the leader of the Opposition has done; but when there is a veiled threatwhen veiled conditions are sought to be imposed, and veiled stipulations for pledges are made- I can only meet such approaches in one way. I congratulate the country and the Opposition that I am able to pursue the path of duty in a more pleasant way when I am approached as I have been by the leader of the Opposition than I should be under certain other conceivable circumstances. If my personal assurance to the leader of the Opposition that I shall make this a special matter of urgency is not sufficient to inspire confidence that I will do what I say, all the pledges in the world will not make it worr/ny of respect.",51
428,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, The Prime Minister said this afternoon that the Appropriation Bill would not leave this Chamber until all matters of serious importance had been transacted.,51
429,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I referred to matters ot legislation. I do not talk like a lawyer drawing out a declaration.,51
430,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable gentleman would uphold the dignity df his position belter by a little silence.,51
431,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is difficult to be silent when the honourable and learned member adopts such a tone. I have to come down to his level.,51
432,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I may make it difficult for the Prime Minister, but he must try. I do not quite understand that the leader of the Opposition approached the Prime Minister.",51
433,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"When one comes to see you, he may be said to approach you.",51
434,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is the first intimation we have had of anything of the kind. Whatever may have taken place, we understood that the Appropriation Bill, preferential trade, and the appointment of the Tariff Commission were placed on the same footing.",51
435,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable and learned member could not have understood that from the speech of the Prime Minister this afternoon.,51
436,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We not only could, but did understand it.",51
437,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Who are "" we "" ? I do not recognise the honourable and learned member. I deal with the leader of the Opposition.",51
438,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If we, in this corner, have a duty of a special nature to perform, it is to have regard for the question of protection.",51
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We say that the honourable and learned member and his party are bogus.,51
440,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable and learned member was once a very ardent protectionist. Mr T OSEPH COOK - That was when I had about as much sense as the honourable and learned member has now.,51
441,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"At any rate, we are now discussing a serious matter. We understood that those three subjects, which are all of great importance, were placed on the same footing in the arrangement made between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. If they are to be treated differently, we do not consent to it. If the Appropriation Bill is to be delayed until the other two matters have been dealt with, we shall do our best to prevent the appointment of the Tariff Commission being placed in.any worse position.",51
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Who are "" we "" ?",51
443,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the House goes to the country, honourable members will soon find out who "" we "" are.",51
444,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I understand from the speech of the honourable member for Echuca, that he expected that the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is lespected on this side of the Chamber, would take the lead in regard to the appointment of the Tariff Commission, but the Prime Minister, to use his own words, has taken the matter into his pressing personal consideration.",51
445,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Surely that does not prevent my honourable colleague from working with me?,52
446,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It shows that the free trade Prime Minister, and not the protectionist Minister of Trade and Customs, will . have the appointment of this Commission.",52
447,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is the duty of the Prime Minister to deal with the appointment - cf Commissions, whatever the subject of inquiry may be.",52
448,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is at any rate well that the honourable member for Echuca, and the other protectionists who are supporting the Prime Minister, should know that they are relying, not on the Minister of Trade and Customs, but on the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman said, "" I am not going to bind myself to appoint t'he Commission before the recess,"" and the Postmaster-General interjected, "" No, we made no promise 'to appoint 'it before the recess."" What consideration will the protectionists get if Parliament cess before the Prime Minister appoints this Commission ?",52
449,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Honourable members opposite are naturally suspicious.,52
450,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We desire a fair Commission^ and the House should have an opportunity to discuss the appointments. I think that the Prime Minister is right in saying that the subject to be investigated should not be discussed before it is referred to the Commission, but, seeing that the Prime Minister holds office without the support of the country, and is half protectionist and half free-trader, we should know who are to be on the Commission before we go into recess. The Prime Minister says, "" I am not going to submit to veiled threats. I am not going to give lawyerlike pledges."" Whenever t'he honourable and learned member for Indi rises to speak, the right honourable gentleman seems to think that he can secure the cheers of his supporters by throwing insults at him. In my opinion, it would be better for him to amend his manners. But, although in the beginning 'he took up a very strong position, after the leader of the Opposition had risen he said, "" Of course, when things are put in that sweet way, I am ready to back down. As I have been asked so nicely, I will give way in everything."" It was only on the 25th October, because of the action of the honourable and learned member for Indi, that the Prime Minister promised to appoint this Commission. Now we have arrived at tihe 24th November, and nothing 'has been done, and, no doubt, if-he can get into recess without appointing the Commission, the Prime Minister will be only too glad to do so. Every one knows that the right honourable gentleman holds his position on sufferance, because of the fear of a dissolution. But the very man who keeps him in power-the honourable member for Wilmot-say s that he cannot stand him. The right honourable gentleman is in office, not because he enjoys the confidence of those who support him, but because he is the least of several evils, and they wish to keep the Opposition out of power. The right honourable gentleman is not trusted by this House, nor by his followers, nor by the country, and it is a disgrace to allow a man who is distrusted in that way to appoint a Commission like this.",52
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is the honourable member in order in speaking of the appointment of the Commission by the Prime Mingoes into re- ister as a disgrace?,52
452,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Who minds what he says?,52
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not suppose that it matters; but I do not think that he should be permitted to speak like that.,52
454,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In my opinion, the honourable and learned member for Corio has not transgressed the rules of debate.",52
455,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Was he in order in referring to the Prime Minister as ""that man""?",52
456,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The rule is that an honourable member should refer to other honourable members by the names of the constituencies which they represent.,52
457,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Russian Ambassador to the United States is reported to have said a little time ago, "" There is no doubt that we Russians did tell lies, and did break our treaties, but we hold Port Arthur."" Similarly I think that the Prime Minister has constantly broken his pledges, and has gone back on all the convictions and principles of his life, in order to hold office. Therefore, we cannot trust him in this matter, and must insist upon the appointment of the Commission before the recess. I am not good at ""stone-walling,"" but if the Prime Minister announced that he would not appoint this Commission before the recess, I would do my best to keep the House sitting, even if it meant a month's talking. We had a discussion this afternoon about the waste of time in Parliament. Occasionally what seems to be a waste of time is not so in reality, and a "" stone-wall,"" which would avoid such a catastrophe as I believe the Prime Minister is trying to bring upon us, would not be a waste of time. We desire that an impartial Commission shall be appointed, and therefore we wish to know, before we go into recess, who are to be the members of the Commission. I am glad that the matter has been brought forward by members of the coterie-as the honourable member for Echuca has called us--to which I belong. We have separated ' from the other protectionists in the House, and from our leader, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.",52
458,Mr MCCOLL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Not separated from, but deserted.",53
459,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"When the honourable member for Echuca says that of us, I take it, not as an insult, but as an appreciation. I am glad to have deserted a party which can follow a free-trade Prime Minister, who, in my opinion, intends to act unfairly. If our protest to-night fails, we must use other methods, and the responsibility must lie upon the members of the Protectionist Party who are supporting the Government to see that their part of the compact with the Prime Minister is kept. I appeal to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, because he can, apparently, do what he likes with this Government. A short time ago we heard that the Prime Minister would set aside for him only one day for the discussion of preferential trade. Then a paragraph appeared in the newspapers, stating that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat thought that one day would not be enough, because he wished, not only to make a speech on the subject himself, but to enable the House to come to a conclusion in regard to it. We do not now hear that only one day is to be devoted to the question.",53
460,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does not that show that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has more influence than have honourable members opposite.,53
461,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think that he has more influence than any other man in this community.,53
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,And yet the honourable and learned member deserted him.,53
463,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is the most influential man in the community.,53
464,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,And deservedly so.,53
465,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,And yet the honourable and learned member's leader is fighting him.,53
466,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"He is not, but I do not wish to discuss the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. All I say is that he must have great influence with the Prime Minister, and that we have a right to ask him to use it. We were told in the first instance that the Prime Minister intended to allow the honourable and learned member for Ballarat one day in which to place his views upon preferential trade before the country, and that the whole question was then to be closed up. The honourable and learned member, however, wanted the House to arrive at a decision upon h*is motion. Theft the Prime Minister expressed himself as agreeable that there should be a certain amount of discussion. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was not content with that. He stiffeneci his back, and the Prime Minister, whilst declaring that it would be premature to take any action at present, because Great Britain had not declared herself, agreed to allow the honourable and learned member all the time he required. More than that, I believe that a promise has been made that the Appropriation Bill shall not be passed until the motion has been disposed of.",53
467,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I did not make any such degrading promise.,53
468,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In view of the influence which he possesses with the Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat ought to see that the Tariff Commission is appointed without delay. We know that he does not trust the Prime Minister. I had the pleasure of listening to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat speak about twelve months ago, when he gave a very frank expression to his opinions with regard to the Prime Minister. Although he has been sitting behind the Treasury benches for some little time, I doubt very much whether his views have undergone any change. We have a right - this little group of members in the Opposition corner, the small coterie of protectionists in this cave of Adullam-cal l it what you like",53
469,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would not be parliamentary.,53
470,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not wish to say anything hostile to the Minister of Defence nor to my protectionist friends on the Government side of the House. I appeal to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to take a hand in this fight. If he assures us that he has obtained a promise that the Commission shall be appointed before we go into recess, the whole matter will be disposed of, and I shall be satisfied. He pulls the strings, and the Prime Minister works.",53
471,Mr DEAKIN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have every confidence in the Prime Minister.,54
472,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Hear , hear.",54
473,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have appealed to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to see that the Prime Minister keeps his promise,' and appoints the Commission almost immediately. The honourable and learned member has replied, "" I have every confidence in the Prime Minister.""",54
474,Mr DEAKIN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , that he will keep his promise.",54
475,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Mr Chairman, "" 'nuff said.""",54
476,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I cannot understand what all this commotion is about. I was under the impression that the gentlemen who represent the Protectionist Party on this side of the Chamber had ample confidence in their late leader, and, seeing that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has told us that he has every confidence in the Prime Minister, it naturally follows that he has obtained information with regard to the appointment of the Tariff Commission that has not yet been communicated to the public. I think that honourable members are quite justified in assuming that the honourable and learned member has full power to see that the promise given by ""the Prime Minister is kept. I understood that the Prime Minister stated that he was prepared to communicate to honourable members the names of the members of the Commis'sion before we went into recess. MrREID - That statement is absolutely unfounded.",54
477,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,A m I to understand that the Prime Minister absolutely refuses to communicate to us the names of the members of the Commission before we go into recesS?,54
478,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I never said anything of the kind. Does not the honourable member think we had better get to work, and do something for the men who are waiting employment?",54
479,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We know what this playing to the gallery means.,54
480,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am not playing to gallery, but I have had a special appeal made to me from the Labour Councils on behalf of thousands of men who are out of work.",54
481,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Prime Minister makes an appeal on behalf of some men who are out of work, and we know exactly what his motive is. If the right honourable gentleman has any real solicitude for these men he will show it by expediting the appointment of the Tariff Commission, .because if we are to believe the advocates of the appointment of the Commission, the work which it will do will be of much gieater importance to the working men of Australia than the mere passing of a few works Estimates. I should have thought the right honourable gentleman had had a sufficient amount of experience of Commissions which have been appointed behind the back of Parliament, and that for his own sake he would have asked honourable members to share his responsibility. Honourable members belonging to the Protectionist Party seem to think that their cause is perfectly safe in the hands of Ministers who belong to the same fiscal faith as themselves, and personally I shall be perfectly satisfied, and will give the Ministry every assistance, in my power in closing the business of . the session if they will announce the names of the Commission before the prorogation takes place.",54
482,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member can sit there until he is b l in d; he will not receive any such assurance from me.,54
483,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I am surprised that so much heat has been shown during this discussion. I would like to remind the Committee that the Prime Minister was not the first in this Parliament to appoint a Commission. During the last session a distinct promise was given that the names of the members of a cerfjain Commission would be announced before the prorogation. Circumstances, however, prevented that promise from being kept, and the Commission was appointed during the recess. I refer to the Federal Capital Sites Commission, whose report was something like a Chinese classic, and had to be read backwards. I would strongly recommend the Prime Minister, in view of the results in that case, to announce to Parliament the names of the Tariff Commission.",54
484,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," The most striking statement made here to-night was that which fell from the honourable member for Echuca, to the effect that the the protectionist members on the Government side of the House were as anxious as, if not more anxious than, those on this side of the Chamber to have the Tariff Commission appointed. If my memory serves me accurately, not a single protectionist upon the other side of the iChamber uttered a' solitary word in support of the motion submitted in favour of the appointment of the Commission.",54
485,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What motion?,55
486,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The motion submitted by the honourable and learned member for Indi.,55
487,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The want of confidence motion ?,55
488,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is all very well to declare that it was a no-confidence motion. The Minister of Defence must recollect-as we all do-that the honourable and learned member for Ind i agreed to withdraw his motion because certain promises were made,55
489,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Because two or three honourable members upon the other side of the House would not vote with him.,55
490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Mov e another noPrime confidence motion.,55
491,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We shall not be recess. afraid to submit another motion of that character if the Government fail to do we conceive to be right. I repeat, that at no time have the protectionist supporters the Government uttered a single word favour of the appointment of a Tariff Comnot mission.",55
492,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Why , the honourable memof ber for Echuca was the first member the House to raise the question privatelv.",55
493,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Privatel y ? ' l i e was the first honourable member to cross to sort. the other side of the Chamber, and support a free-trade Prime Minister. I like to honourable members stick to their colours. Mr .REID - Why did the honourable member desert his leader, and call a meeting behind his back?",55
494,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have deserted did neither my leader nor my principles. occupy a seat upon the Opposition side the House, where I shall remain as long the Prime Minister continues in office. I work. do not intend to support the Government in any way.",55
495,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,And still we live.,55
496,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , by the grace of Cameron.",55
497,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"B y the grace of any honourable member who is at present himself supporting the Government, for any one member can, by a change of vote, unseat them. What I wish to emphasize is that but for the action of the honourable and learned member for Ind i no Tariff Comwould mission would have been appointed.",55
498,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not so.,55
499,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The protectionist supporters of the Ministry, who declare that they are anxious to secure the appointment of that Commission, have never raised their voices to protest against existing Tariff anomalies. When they say that they have full faith in the Prime Minister, or in the Minister of Trade and Customs, they are begging the question, because, but for the action of the honourable and learned member for Indi, no Commission would have been appointed.",55
500,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not so.,55
501,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Prime Minister says that that is not so, and yet the spectacle is presented to-night of honourable members upon this side of the Chamber demanding that the Commission shall be appointed, after a promise to that effect had been given. Apparently the Minister does not intend to constitute the Commission until Parliament is in",55
502,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member is at what liberty to draw what inference he chooses.,55
503,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In reply to the of honourable and learned member for Indi, in the Prime Minister stated that he would be under any duress in the matter, and further, that he did not wish the personnel the Commission to be discussed by this of House, as such a proceeding would be most improper.",55
504,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I never said anything of t'he Mr HUME ' COOK - Then my ears see must have deceived me. Words to that effect were most certainly used.,55
505,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I asked, "" Would it be a good start for the Commission if its personnel were discussed in Parliament ?"" I not say that it would not, or could not, I be discussed there, but that the Commission of would not be helped if it were attacked as in Parliament before it had begun its",55
506,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is practically the same thing.,55
507,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No , it is not.",55
508,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The fact is, the Prime Minister has got into the difficulty which we all foresaw, when 'he took upon the responsibility of appointing that Commission. The original motion affirmed that that body should be constituted by this House. The right honourable gentleman, however, declared that such a proceeding be tantamount to taking the conduct of business out of his hands, and expressed his willingness to appoint the Commission and to accept full responsibility for his tion. Originally, there were to be no members of Parliament appointed to that body; subsequently there were to be one or two, and at ,a later stage there were to be "" some.""",55
509,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Surel v one or two is "" some "" ?",56
510,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I think that "" some "" means more than one or two. Consequently, there have been several changes in connection with the appointment of - this Commission. Honourable members upon this side of the Chamber have a great deal to do with those changes, and it is because of the advances which they have made that they have been content to rest awhile. I do not wish to take any part in discussing the - personnel of the Commission, but I desire that it should be appointed without delay, in order that it may get to work. The Prime Minister promised that he would embrace the earliest opportunity of appointing it for that purpose.",56
511,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,So I shall. The man who is without responsibility can always do things easily and quickly.,56
512,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Seeing that a month has gone by, I think we are justified in inquiring when the Commission is to be appointed, and when it is to get to work. We have reason to make this demand, because amongst what the Prime Minister calls serious matters",56
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then it is a "" demand "" ?",56
514,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Undoubtedl y it is.,56
515,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member has only to demand a thing, and he will not get it.",56
516,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What are the functions of members of Parliament?,56
517,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Not to drive the Executive. T do not intend to be driven.,56
518,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is a respectful demand.,56
519,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Ver y respectful.,56
520,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is not the sort of demand which is made when a person puts a pistol to one's head, and says "" Give me so-and-so, or you die.""",56
521,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There is else in it.,56
522,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Prime Minister proposes to give time for the discussion of what he calls ""serious matters of business."" Amongst that business he includes the question of Preferential Trade, although I do not know that he has proacmised to grant sufficient time for its consideration to enable us to come to a division upon it. He has further pledged himself to give the House an opportunity to consider the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Surely the rectification of Tariff anomalies, locally considered, is far more important than either of those subjects.",56
523,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The appointment of the Tariff Commission is not a legislative, but an Executive, act. When I talk of legislative measures I do not mean Executive acts.",56
524,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The man upon whom we might have relied for a statement in connection with this matter- I refer to the protectionist leader in the Cabinetis absolutely silent.,56
525,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"How does the honourable member know what we are doing in Cabinet in regard to the matter? He cannot assume that we are doing nothing, because we do not tell him what takes place In our offices.",56
526,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Surely we have a right to expect the Minister of Trade and Customs-wh o is the equal in all things of the Prime Minister-to make some announcement upon the matter. The honourable member for Echuca has stated that the Government are doing something. But he is not an authority upon trie subject, and the Minister of Trade and Customs is. If the latter would make an announcement as to what is being done we should know exactly where we stood. In default of such a statement we are justified in suspecting that nothing is being done.",56
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In effect, the honourable member says that he does not believe the Prime Minister, but that he does believe the Minister of Trade and Customs ",56
528,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not rely upon the Prime Minister,56
529,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does not the fact that I am going to consult the leader of the Opposition in regard to the personnel of the Commission give the honourable member any confidence ?,56
530,Mr HUME COQK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Certainl y not, because the leader of the Opposition may be nothing consulted half-a-dozen times, and may consent to nothing at all. Probably he will not. I do not know that he has any more right to be consulted than has the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, or any other individual member having special knowledge of the subject.",56
531,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable member really think that the leader of the Opposinot tion has no more right to be consulted than made. an ordinary member of the House ? ,57
532,Mr HUMECOOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I did not say pour that?,57
533,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member went very near it.,57
534,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The fact that the Prime Minister consulted the leader of the early date ; Opposition does not bind the Opposition to the personnel of the Commission in way. . Mr Reid - But those who trust him may feel reassured by the fact that to be consulted.,57
535,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,When is the Commission to be constituted?,57
536,Mr HUMECOOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have no objecthe tion to the Prime Minister consulting anyFebruary next. body he pleases regarding the composition of the Commission. But the fact that he intends to consult the honourable member Bland does not bind the Opposition, or section of it, to approve of that Commishave sion.",57
537,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They will not be asked to approve of it. The appointment of a mission is an exercise of the prerogation the Crown.,57
538,Mr HUMECOOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If we are not to approve of the appointment, why should we consider it?",57
539,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Parliamen t is never asked approve of the exercise of the Royal rogative.,57
540,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am satisfied that the debate, which has elicited the statements made this evening by the Prime Minister, will lead to the appointment of the Commission at a much earlier date than would otherwise have been the case. has assured the Committee that he will make it his business to look into the matter as one of pressing importance.",57
541,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I said so last night-befor this debate occurred-to the leader of the Opposition.,57
542,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The statement was made privately. What we desired was the public declaration which we have obgent tained this evening from the right honorbe able gentleman. Other statements which months. have been made by him lead me to believe that the debate has saved time, and up several matters about which there was some doubt. I should certainly like to see the Tariff Commission appointed before session ends, and, speaking for myself, friends of the Opposition corner. shall not give my consent to the passing of the Appropriation Bill until we have had, a promise, but the appointment actually",57
543,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I wish to a little oil on the troubled waters, and to utter some words of encouragement to my honourable friends of the Alliance. There seems to be a general impression that the Parliament will be prorogued at an but, having regard to the progress made this evening, and any to the programme for the remainder of this session, which was announced yesterday by the Government, I think he is that honourable members of the Opposition corner have every reason to hope that the Commission will be appointed before Ave go into recess. It seems to me that session is not likely to close before The Government tell us that they intended from the outset-eve n before the matter was brought forward by for the honourable and learned member for Indi any - to appoint a Tariff Commission. They been about three months in office, so that we have a fair indication of the rate of progress they are likely to make in apCompointing the Commission, and can form of some idea as to when the proper time will arrive for the passing of the Appropriation Bill. The Government have now reached a stage at which they consider that the appointment of the Commission is an urgent to matter, and the Prime Minister is preprepared to accept nominations from any source.",57
544,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I did not say that. M i . SPENCE - The Government, at all events, are prepared to accept nominations from any reasonable source, and I presume He that honourable members of the Opposition corner are in a position to make nominations. We ought to have some sympathy with the Prime Minister, for he is at the e head of a very mixed party. The Cabinet consists of two opposing elements, and that possibly is the reason why they have been so long in arriving at the conclusion that the appointment of the Commission is an urmatter. Possibly the Commission will appointed in the course of the next three",57
545,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable memcleared ber is more hopeful than I am.,57
546,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Perhaps I am; but I wish to hold Out some hope of the appointthe ment of the Commission to my honourable There is some justification for their dissatisfaction, seeing that the Government have so long delayed the work of making a selection. The issues involved in the question of free-trade versus protection are so well known that there should be no difficulty in making a satisfactory appointment; but the trouble is that the Cabinet is equally divided, and that the two opposing parties apparently must share and share alike. I would suggest that the two sections of the Cabinet should meet in separate rooms, and decide first of all how many gentlemen from their party should be appointed to the Commission.",57
547,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Did the orable member make such a suggestion to our predecessors upon the fiscal question? They were equally divided.,58
548,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They were a united body, and had a solid party behind them, but the Government is not in that happy position. If they adopted my suggestion, I think that they would be able to appoint a Commission in less than three months. We know that they are anxious to go into recess, because that is their only haven of rest, and they certainly ought to appoint the Commission before Parliament is prorogued. Having agreed upon the number of members to be appointed to the Commission, the two sections of the Cabinet should proceed to select the men whom they think should represent the protectionist and free-trade parties. If the Commission were tacitly approved before the prorogation of Parliament, the Government would be able to go into recess feeling much happier than they would otherwise do, for they would know that they would not be liable to be attacked, on again meeting the House, for their action in regard to the matter.",58
549,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, Consider able heat has been' engendered by the discussion of this question. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - It is time we had a little more light.,58

555,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What does the honourable member mean by his dirty insinuations ?,58
556,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,As soon as an .honourable member rises to speak he is assailed by offensive interjections on the part of the hon- honourable member.,58

560,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,58

583,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I was not referring that matter; I was dealing with what I understood to be the statement of the Prime that the appointment of the Comit mission would be an Executive act which purhe would not submit to the approval of this Parliament. To make such a statement is to invite the antagonism of honorofable members. Why should he object to cannot taking them into his confidence?,59

600,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The great question of preferential trade with Great Britain is not in the hands of the Prime Minister, whose principles compel him to oppose such preference, but in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is supposed to be the head of the Protectionist Party in the Ministry. Surely the protectionists in this Chamber should set principle above everything else. What we wish to know is what is going to be done in regard to these two great questions, and in regard to the third great question which we have at heart, the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , which is now in the hands of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro? We were not elected by our constituents to hasten into recess. Our duty is to face the difficulties which are now causing such an outcry throughout the country. I trust that these matters will be lifted above party tions. I , in the first instance, objected to the appointment of any but Members Parliament to the proposed Commission, because I believe that Members of Parlialiament know more about Tariff matters than do persons outside, since we spent twelve months in discussing the Tariff, and obtained information in regard to it from all points of view. It has been decided, however, that persons who are not Members of Parliament, but who, I presume, have positions in the commercial world, shall be appointed.",60

I should like to know why the protectionists who are supporting the Ministry are now absent from the Chamber ?",60

We know to that what is practically a Commission has been sitting for the last twelve months, lecting evidence with regard to the effect of the Tariff upon our principal industries. threats. Testimony has been afforded from time time that our industries are languishing, and that our workmen are being thrown out of employment as the result of the operawith tion of the Tariff. All this should point citizens* to the extreme urgency of the case. I do not blame the Prime Minister, because know that it is part of his policy to ignore the claims of our manufacturing industries. He does not wish to see them gain any ascendency over the importers. however, to those who belong to the same fiscal faith as myself, for some light and leading. If the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is still the protectionist leader, why does he not give us some assurlight on the subject. ance that the Commission will be appointed without delay? Why should we to "" shut our eyes, and open our mouths, and see what God will send us?"" We are not here for that purpose, but are required expression. to do our best for the people of Australia in every walk of life. The Tariff Commission will, if it applies itself to its work conscienlence. tiously and earnestly, do an immense amount of good, as also will the measure which kind. is intended to promote the establishment of the manufacture of iron and steel our midst. The Prime Minister has avowed himself as an out-and-out opponent of Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and he prise them. is also unfavorable to the appointment of Tariff Commission. Unfortunately, we have a tug-of-war Government, one-half of Ministers pulling in one way, and the other tugging in the opposite direction. Hence we can obtain no satisfaction. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will succeed in converting the Prime Minister better. to his views, and that we shall be able obtain some assurance that no time will lost in doing that which is required serve our manufacturing interests. not see any necessity for the display of beat over this question, or for any threats or talk about resistance of demands. orable members, irrespective of parties, should be taken into Ways and Means. the Prime Minister, and the people should be told what steps, are to be taken.

If those are not threats, I do not know what threats are. the right honourable gentleman resists such menaces, there is only one course open to him, and that is to leave office, and allow honourable members in the Opposition corner to govern the country.

It is unfortunate that there cannot be two leaders of the Opposition. The honourable and learned member for Indi would no doubt make an admirable leader. submit, however, that he would have consulted his own dignity and the prestige of those honourable members who are associate with him, if he had refrained from re-opening a matter regarding which a definite arrangement had been, arrived at between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition, and from making demands, such as have not been preferred by the recognised leader on his side of the House.",62
619,Mr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I desire to place on record my opinion, that the protectionists of Victoria are not fairly sented on the Government side of the Chamber. I have taken the trouble to ascertain how many of the Victorian representatives sitting behind the Government belong to the recognised Protectionist Association, and I find that there are only three, including the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Laanecoorie, and another, whose name I forget for the moment. There are twelve representatives of Victoria upon that side of the Chamber who do not belong to the Protectionists' Association, some of them being free-traders, and the rest what we call ""shandy-gaff"" protectionists. Of the representatives of 12 A Victoria on the Opposition side, six belong to the Protectionists' Association, and two are outside its ranks, one of them being a free-trader. I grant that a man may be a strong protectionist, and still not belong to the association, but the protectionists of Victoria ' certainly do not recognise the honourable and learned member for Ballarat as their leader. If they held a Unless meeting in Melbourne, and the honourable and learned member appeared before them and claimed to be their leader, they would hurl him from the platform. The private life of the honourable and learned member is to be admired, and any) man might be proud of his personal friendship, but I absolutely deny his claim to be the leader of the Protectionist Party. The real protectionist parliament of Victoria is the Trades Hall, and the real power of the protectionists is in the trade unions, the members of whi'-.h disclaim the honourable and learned membeT as their leader. Cannot we point to the very large meeting that was held in the Town Hall the other night?",62
620,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There were only r,20o persons present, and that would not be a very large meeting in the Town Hall. I Mr MALONEY - I think that the Prime Minister will agree that the meeting was larger than that.",62
621,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Age estimated the number of persons present at 1,200, and that newspaper would not disparage a meeting held in support of the policy which it advocates.",62
622,Mr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I recognise that the right honourable gentleman has quoted a very good authority. I do not think theAge would wittingly make a mistake in regard to that matter, because it appertains to the politics which it advocates. At reprethe same time, I am of opinion that there were more than 1,200 persons present at that meeting. I am equally sure that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was notproud of his reception by the gathering in question. I maintain that the real protectionists in this House are to be found upon the Opposition benches. If a public meeting of protectionists were convened in Melbourne, we should soon ascertain who is the real leader of the protectionist party, and who constitute that party.' I will guarantee that if a meeting be called at any large centre in Victoria, it will be found that this State is feeling the injury which is being done to her industries by the present Tariff.",62
623,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is Victoria the Commonwealth ?,63
624,Mr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It constitutes a good portion of it. I have no faith in Commissions. The more experience I have of them, the more I am inclined to the view of the German who said, "" If the Almighty liad placed the earth in the hands of a Commission, I have doubts as to whether it .would ever have been built."" In nine cases jut of ten the appointment of a Commission is synonymous with delay. .Why cannot amendments in the Tariff be submitted to this flouse next session, and fought out to a finish? The Prime Minister has generously declared that when he appealed to the country upon the fiscal question he was defeated.",63
625,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The people declared for a fiscal truce, and I wish to see their decision respected.",63
626,Mr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If a Tariff Commission is to be appointed, I say that it should consist of an equal number .of tru.e free traders and protectionists-no t persons pf the shandy-gaff variety. If the Prime Minister will appoint staunch protectionists upon the one hand and ardent' free-traders upon the other, I shall bt content. Mr STQRRER'""p.assij-r-Whilst I am quite willing to assist the Government .to get into recess as soon as possible, I canho.t understand why there should be so .much delay in the appointment pf .the. Tariff Commission.",63
627,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the honourable member had the job'he would soon discover the .reason. I have six States to .deal with, .and I have to Obtain the services of the 'besjt. man in each. "" Mr'.""STORRER - I know tjhat the Prime Minister possesses a very wide knowledge of the jeadipg men of the J^mmsnw.eaJMi, and that he has many opportunities pf becoming acquainted with their abilities,.",63
628,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"My honourable friend should recollect that many of the ablest men are disqualified from acting upon the Commission, because they have business' transactions with the Customs House. That is my trouble. - Mr STORRER- I think that members of Parliament might be appointed to that body with advantage. Its constitution is an urgent matter, in view of the fact that manv industries are languishing. . Mr LONSDALE - Where ? ' Mr STORRER - I do nqt propose to reply .to any .interjections,- because I realise lhat'by so doing a good deal of unnecessary heat is engendered. Some 'honourable members fear that the personnel of the proposed Commission will not be satisfactory. Under such circumstances, I think that the Prime Minister should constitute that body without delay.",63
629,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I wish to make a personal explanation. I object to haying words put into my mouth which I did not utter. The allegation made by the honourable member for Parramatta that I threatened to deal it out to him is absolutely incorrect. I object to such statements being recorded in Hansard as emanating from me. The honourable member has said that when I asked why so much heat should be imported into the debate, the only interjection which he made was to the .effect that there should be more light. I really 'believe that the honourable member interjects without being aware of the fact.",63
630,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I (know what I said then, anyhow. Mr CHAEiJTER.:-The honourable member's mind is sometimes "" soured"" by his principles, and as a result 'he uses .words which are very offensive.",63
631,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is it because of a lack of principle that the - minds of some honourable members are not soured? Mr - CHANTER - I should be extremely - sorry to go tto the 'honourable member for Wentworth for principles. I can assure the honourable member for Parramatta - that - my remarks had no application to his personal career. I was referring to 'his political career. - Mr JQSEPH COOK - What 'has the honourable member to say about it?,63
632,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have no desire .to create friction. Mr. JOSEPH GqoK -^My political career, is better than that of the"" 'honourable member's, I hope.",63
633,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Certainl y it has not been more consistent.,63
634,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Consistentl y bad.,63
635,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable rnember for Wentworth will never have s.uc-h a career if he remains in Parliament all the days of his natural life. What does he knn.w of my political career? He is merely a bov in the House-r a political neophyte. He should sit silent, orotherwise he may get the political punishment which .ought to be administered to naughty boys. His manner is against him. and T would strongly advice him to cultivate a little more geniality .towards, his fellow members - I ant content to allow honourable members who occupy seats upon the cross bericheb to determine the nature of my remarks in regard to the honourable member for Parramatta. When he addresses the Chair I always give him respectful attention, and refrain from interjecting. I trust that he will act in a similar fashion, and thus allow honourable members an opportunity to state their views full y and in their own way. T t is not creditable that we should constantly have "" scenes'"" occurring in the House, when they could be easily avoided by honourable members bearing a little with each other.",63
636,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What is all this twaddle about?,64
637,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I call your attention, sir, to the remark of the honourable member. That is the kind of interjection which he is constantly making, and yet he declares that he never interjects. Is it to be supposed that honourable members can tolerate continual interjections of that nature? the CHAIRMAN - I would point out that it is entirely out df order for any honourable member td interrupt the speaker, and I ask the honourable member for Parramatta to refrain from doing so.",64
638,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have no further remarks to offer on this subject. I rose only to say that I did not use the words which the 'honourable member for Parramatta has attributed to me, and that if he will cease from interjecting I am sure.that he will have no cause to regret it.",64
639,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," Wit h a considerable degree of trepidation, and almost - fear, I rise to make' my recantation to the honourable member for Riverina, who has just resumed his seat. I deeply regret that he took what was intended, on my part, to be a jocular interjection-and therefore a thoroughly disorderly one-as a serious matter.",64
640,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why did the honourable member make such a statement?,64
641,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Onl y an honourable member of his modesty could possibly conceive that his whole political career could have been consistently!bad. For my part, I should not have dreamt of putting such an interpretation oh it.",64
642,Mr CHANTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They why make such"" an assertion ?",64
643,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have risen, not with the. object of making my honourable .friend still angrier"", but ,fq pour"" oil on the' troubled waters', and if I Have given"" him any offence, I can only say that' I am heartily sorry.",64
644,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I am somewhat surprised at the heat with which this matter has been discussed by certain honourable members opposite. They appear to be annoyed because some honourable members of the Opposition have made the request in all sincerity that the Tariff Commission shall be appointed before we go into recess. Simply because the statement is made by honourable members of the Opposition that it is only fair t'hat the Commission should be appointed before the Appropriation Bil l is passed, the Prime Minister asserts that a threat is being made.",64
645,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What a beautiful translation ! It sounds like poetry. Let us get some work done.,64
646,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am anxious that we should do so. If we have such a responsible Government as the Prime Minister professes to lead, why do they not expedite public business ?",64
647,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Why does not the honourable member help us to pass this motion, in view of the fact that he talks of the necessity to find work for the unemployed?",64
648,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have no desire to delay the business of the Committee. Since the present Government took office, some of their supporters have occupied more tim'e in making one speech than I have done on the several occasioris on which I have spoken' I have a right to express my views on this question without being twitted by t'he Prime Minister^ or by any one else, with a desire to delay the business of the country. No one can say that I hiave attempted t'o* "" s""tone-wall "" in any degree. * Mr MCCAY - But the honourable member 'has worked the oracle:",64
649,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I deny that I have done so. On the contrary, I have always endeavoured to assist the Government to keep a House. I have attended here every day at 2.30 p.m., when some of the supporters of the Government have been enjoying them.; selves in other States.",64
650,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Or blackguarding, the Labour Party.",64
651,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That , is so'. I have attended this House when some of the supporters 61 the Government have been touring the country denouncing the Labour Party, arid stating that we believe that maifiage is a luxury. As"" a matter of fact, I have proved that is the view held by. some honourable members' opposite, and by the organizers whom they employ fo tour .this State. the honourable member for Robertson knows better than to come to my electorate and make such a statement regarding the Labour Party and its aims, as that which he made in the back blocks. These are the honourable members who, like the honourable member for Robertson, tour the country making misstatements about the Labour Party, while we are attending to the business of the country.",64
652,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member should read what I said. I refer him to the Daily Telegraph.,65
653,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not intend to reply to interjections, because I am anxious that we should push on with the business before us. The Opposition are quite right In contending that the Commission should be at once appointed, and in stating that they are prepared to see that the Appropriation Bill is not passed until that has been done.",65
654,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does not the honourable member think that they might wait to see what is done before making threats?,65
655,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They have waited for some time. It is over a month since the Piime Minister promised to appoint this Commission. I am glad to see that some of the protectionist supporters of the Government are now present. We may now be told what is being done, as one of them has already said this evening, that they know everything,- whilst we know nothing. The Minister of Defence said that the honourable member for Echuca suggested the appointment of a Tariff Commission before the honourable and learned member for Indi submitted his proposal.",65
656,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Whil e the Watson Government was in power; the honourable member for Echuca raised the' question of a Tariff Commission, and spoke privately to his fellow protectionists on the subject.",65
657,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is the first I have heard of it. The statement which the Minister has just made differs from the interjection which he made while the honourable member for Bourke was speaking.,65
658,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That was an interiection, and I was cut short whilst I was ""in the middle of it.",65
659,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I agree with the honourable member for Bass that we should know before the House goes into recess what is to be the constitution of .the Commission. Even certain honourable members opposite would like to see the Commission appointed before the prorogation.,65
660,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Do not worry about us.,65
661,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Honourable members opposite will have quite enough cause for anxiety when the general election comes round.,65
662,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member may then come along and worrv us.,65
663,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I shall do'my best to worry certain honourable members who have broken the pledges made by them at the last general election. If the Prime Minister will apply the gag to his supporters in the matter of interjections, as well as in regard to speech-making, the progress of business will be expedited.",65
664,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why does not the honourable member,65
665,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Le t the honourable member conclude his remarks.,65
666,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member for Robertson has been ordered to keep quiet, and as a loyal and humble supporter of the Prime Minister I am sure that he will.",65
667,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"He was not "" oidered.""",65
668,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am very anxious that this resolution shall be dealt with.,65
669,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is very important that we should pass this motion, and have the talk afterwards. Honourable members opposite surely have an interest in the passing of a measure providing for works to be carried out. .",65
670,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The provision made for works in Victoria is not at all in proportion to the population of the State, but I shall deal with that matter when the second motion is before us. I agree with honourable members that before the Appropriation Bill is passed the Government should deal with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, appoint the Tariff Commission, and give the honourable and learned member for Ballarat an opportunity to submit' his motion in regard to preferential trade, so that the people, as the result of the debate, may gain more information upon the subject than they have at present. No doubt the representatives of Western Australia are also anxious that the Transcontinental Rail-: way Survey Bill should be dealt with this session, and I am confident that the honourable member for Cowper desires that the British New Guinea Bill should likewise be passed. I trust, therefore, that the Government will attend to these matters, and not abandon them all in their haste to get into recess. I do not make any threat as to what I am prepared to do, but it is only fair to the House and to the country that the session should not prove an absolutely fruitless one. If we have the responsible governhe ment of which the Prime Minister has spoken, why does he not see that the matters to which I have referred are dealt with before he asks usto pass the Appropriation Bill.",65
671,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Because honourable members will talk incessantly, and prevent business being transacted.",66
672,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Such a statement comes with an ill grace from the right honourable gentleman, having regard to the fact that, when he was leader of the Opposition, is members of his party made speech after speech, covering the same ground, in conthe nexion with our consideration of the Tariff, in a session which extended over seventeen months. I hope that the vernment will see that the matters to which I have referred are dealt with liament is prorogued, so that the people will not be able to sav that the session been practically abortive, and that the request of the Opposition that the constitution of the Commission shall be known before we go into recess, will be complied with.",66
673,Mr THOM AS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, The Prime Minister might have avoided the whole this discussion had he promised that the Commission would be appointed before passing of the Appropriation Bill .,66
674,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I might have avoided it by simply doing what I was told. Of course, that would save a lot of trouble.",66
675,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I understand that the Prime Minister has promised that he will night. ask the House to deal with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and with relating to preferential trade, of which notice has been given by the honourable learned member for Ballarat, before Appropriation Bill is passed. been told by him also that a promise to appoint a Commission is very different from a promise to give the House an opportunity to discuss the question of preferential ments. trade-that the one relates to a legislative and the other to an executive act. man in the street, however, will scarcely recognise the difference. The Prime Minnight ister states that in the one case he is jusI tified in making a promise, and that in the other he is not.",66
676,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I .have made the only mise that a Prime Minister could make.,66
677,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the Prime Minister can promise the leader of the Opposition - that the Appropriation Bil l will not passed until the Conciliation and Arbitrafound tion Bill has been dealt, with, why should not promise the honourable and learned member for Indi that the Tariff Commission will be appointed before the Appropriation Bil l is passed? It seems to me that the honourable and learned member, having submitted the motion which caused .the Prime Minister to promise the appointment of a Commission, is justified in seeking for an - assurance from the right honourable gentleman that the appointment will be made before the Appropriation Bill is passed. As my tendency to free-trade rather than to protection, I shall probably have less fault to find with Commission than the protectionist members of the Committee will have. As the Prime Minister has so many things to do, GoI suggest that if we adjourned for a week, it would give him an opportunity to conbefore Parsider this matter.",66
678,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member was has sent here to work. A son of toil should not knock out, when the curled darlings are willing to go on.",66
679,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Prime Minister has complained that he has too much to do, and I suggest an adjournment to give him of more leisure. It has been stated in the newspapers that he has a great deal to do the in keeping a quorum here. The Senate might go on with work",66
680,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They have finished their work, and are waiting for legislation from us. That is one reason why I wish to send the Works and .Buildings Bill to them to",66
681,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We could pass some the motion measures to-night.,66
682,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If honourable members would and pass half-a-dozen measures to-night, I the would agree to a week's adjournment. We have Mr THOMAS - At any rate, the Commission should be appointed before we go into recess, so that honourable members may have an opportunity to discuss the appoint",66
683,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I The wish to say a word or two In acknowledgment of the kindly advice given to me toby the honourable member for Riverina. am obliged to him for his lecture on consistency, for his precepts as to my future behaviour, and, above all, for his expressed prointention to let me alone in the future. Particularly am I obliged to him for his lecturette on temper, remembering the dis^ play of light and sweetness which we have be had from him. I recognise always his prointellectuality, and the high plane on which he dwells, and I shall do my best fo pay heed to his advice. I am afraid, however, I shall be unable to follow it.",66
684,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I wish to call attention to the fact that, although matters of great importance to protectionists have been discussed during this debate, only two of the protectionists who support the. Ministry are present, the honourable members for Moira and Echuca. . The Prime Minister,- not having made a satisfactory statement as to when he intends to fulfil the promise which he gave on the 25th October last, I appeal to the Minister of Trade arid Customs. In my constituency there are men who are starving for want of work.",67
685,Mr MCLEAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable and learned member cannot sympathize with them much, since he is blocking a Bill to provide them with work.",67
686,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Yes . The Senate is waiting to deal with it.,67
687,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I wish to inform the Minister of Trade and Customs, as the senior protectionist in the Ministry, that in my constituency there are iron-founders who have been without work for three months.",67
688,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Ye t the honourable and learned member somersaulted on them when the' Tariff wasbefore us.,67
689,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , more than any Other honourable member.",67
690,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There are iron-foundries in my electorate which are being closed, and throughout Victoria thousands of iron-workers are without employment, the longer the appointment of the Tariff Commission is delayed the more will the protectionist supporters of the Ministry Be to blame..",67
691,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,-Why did the honourable ancl learned member vote out of office tectionist Ministry?,67
692,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Hear , hear. M i , CROUCH - It is very well foi the Prime Minister to cheer, since he is enjoying the fruits of office in consequence of the defeat of the Deakin Ministry.",67
693,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But the honourable learned member need riot have played such a coritenvptible part in the' matter.,67
694,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I demand that the fight honourable gentleman withdraw that expression-.,67
695,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,i ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the statement. Mr REiD.^Must I? then I do. Mr CROUCH.^-We have heard a great deal about veiled threats to-night';. but I am about to make a sort df clothed appeal to th6 honourable members for Moira and Echuca. If those iron-founders continueout' of work-- ,67
696,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable and learned member helped to put them out of work by his action in regard to the Tariff.,67
697,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Not only are ironfoundries being closed down, but there is a cement factory in Geelong which has dismissed all its hands. I would point out also that fellmongeries which formerly employed over 800 men, now provide work for only eighty-five employees, and that several tanneries have been closed down. Thousands of men are walking about unable to find work, and at the point of starvation, and another month's delay is threatened. I wish the honourable members for Moira and Echuca to recognise their responsibility. They hold the key to the position, because either of them could decide the fate of the Government one way or the other. Every day's delay will cause more men to be thrown out of employment, and more factories to be closed down. I cannot stir the Minister of Trade and Customs; but if ever there was a time when the protectionist! supporters of the Government should revolt, now is the occasion. The Prime Minister has stated that he will not promise to appoint the Tariff Commission before we go into' fecessj and his protectionist supporters should show their resentment of his absolute repudiation of the pledges which he has given «here and elsewhere. I would appeal even to the right honourable member for Swan, who is now present, and ask him whether he thinks that our factories should be left to their fate. The Governa proment have promised that the Tariff Commission' shall be instructed to"" present pro 1 gress reports. As soon as such reports are brought up, Ministers will be compelled t'o take action. Then there will be"" an end td the fiscal truce; and an end to this "" Yes= no "" Ministry. The life of the Ministry and depends upon delay, and the more 6b 1 staeles"" t-bey can place in tKe' way/ of the Commission, the better off they will be"". If must be apparent to all honourable' members that the' Government are"" ihtere'sted iii delaying the appointment of the Cormnissi'dfii",67
698,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I should like f d pass this Bill, in order that we may provide work for some' of the starving unemployed fo whom the honourable arid learned member has referred.",67
699,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"What is the use of playing to the gallery like that? Mr CROUCH^The honorab.le and learned member for Indi has appealed to me to curtail my remarks for the present, in order to allow the Bill to pass, and I am perfectly ready to follow his suggestion, because I desire that every possible provision shall be made for the employment of the men who are now in distress.",68
700,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I appeal to the Committee, not in my own interests, but in the interests of the public, to pass a Bill which deals with a number of public works, and provides for the expenditure of a number of sums of public money throughout the Commonwealth. I have had appeals made to me by the Labour bodies of Australia, who have pointed out the great distress which exists in various parts of Australia, and the importance they attach to having the works for which provision is made in the Bill, set going. The Senate has arranged to meet specially tomorrow, in the hope that it* be able to pass the measure. I do not make this appeal in order to preyent discussion, because the Appropriation Bill - will afford opportunities to honourable members to make any remarks they wish upon every possible subject of importance. It is desirable that the Bill shall be passed to-night, so that W-e may send it on to the Senate in time for tomorrow's, sitting. I believe that honourable members j that Chamber will set aside their .Standing Prders, in order to, ensure expeditious treatment of the me.ar sure.",68
701,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Will that mean that employment will be afforded the following day? """" Mr Reid-No ; but it will help forward the movement for providing employment. It will effect a saving of a week, and, to people who are said to be starving, tljat - would surely be a matter of consequence. I have simply stated the plain facts, and I npw l.eaye the matter entirely in the hands of the Committee.",68
702,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is proposed to pass only the first - reading of the Appropriation Bill proper?,68
703,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is all at present. I am not asking honourable members to forego any opportunities for discussion. The fullest liberty will be afforded in that direction in connection with the general Appropriation-Bill.,68
704,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I shall not disregard the request of the Prime Minister, but T must say that the pathetic appeal of the honourable and learned member for Corio reminds me of the squeal of a trapped rat. If we have ever had a complete combination of confused contradictions in this House, we have had it in the conduct of the honourable and learned member.",68
705,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not the way to get the business through.,68
706,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable and learned member for Corio has made pointed allusion to me with the deliberate intention that his statement shall be published throughout the length and breath of the Commonwealth, and honourable members cannot expect that I shall sit silent under his imputations. I have everv respect for the feelings of honourable members, and a due regard for the request of the Prime Minister, but when the honourable and learned member for Corio accuses protectionists on this side of interfering with the workers of Australia, I ask how he can forget the attitude which he assumed whtin will the Tariff was before this Parliament ? Tf there was one member of the party who created distrust in the protectionists in this Parliament it was the honourable and learned member. His votes are on record in Hansard, and were registered against the interests of the very industries to which he has. referred' to-night, and amongst others against the industries of Geelong. Mr Webster:-That does not justify n the honourable member in his actiqn. .""' Mr KENNEDY.TT-It justifies me in refuting the slanders which have been cast on honourable members .on this side. What was it that put the present Prirne Minister in the position which he .ccGupies to-night ? Was it not, In the first instance, the vote of the hpnorafJle and learned member for Corio, who displaced the only protectionist Government we have had in the Commonwealth Parliament? It does not lie in the mouth of the honourable and learned member to accuse me of inconsistency, or of going back upon protection. I am, to-night, sitting behind the leader of the protectionist cause in Australia, whilst the honourable and learned member is sitting behind a leader who dare not-state to the electors what his fiscal faith fs.",68
707,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Who says that? That Is not true.,68
708,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I must ask the honourable member for Bland to withdraw that statement.,68
709,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I withdraw, and I say that the honourable member's statement is in-' correct.",68
710,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"When the honourable member for Bland was asked what the fiscal policy of his Government was, his reply was that the party which he led had no fiscal policy.",69
711,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I never said anything of the sort.,69
712,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We know that the party which the honourable gentleman leads today never had any fiscal policy.,69
713,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I never said that, anyhow.",69
714,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"What was the position on the other side when the honourable and learned member for Indi moved his motion with respect to the Tariff Commission ? Why did not honourable members opposite press that motion to an issue? Simply because adhesion amongst honourable members opposite can be obtained only for one purpose, and that is to displace the present Government. The honourable and learned member for Corio accused protectionists - on this side of inconsistency.",69
715,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I did-not; I appealed to honourable members to be consistent.,69
716,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"A strange appeal from such a charming bundle of inconsistency as is the honourable and learned member ! What was his attitude on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill ? The honourable and learned member declaimed more strongly than did any other honourable member against preference, and then at the crack of the whip he came into the fold.",69
717,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member for Moira should not talk about the crack of the whip.,69
718,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The whip has never been held over me, by the Prime Minister or by any one else. ' Mr CARPENTER - It was; brought the honourable member to his knees in twenty-four hours.",69
719,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Not h in g of the sort. I shall not allow my reputation to be slandered by so inconsistent an honourable ber as is the honourable and learned memprepared ber for Corio. I shall adhere to my stateregion. ment at the outset, and have regard for the request of the Prime Minister not to take up time unnecessarily.",69
720,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," It is rather refreshing to hear the. honourable member for Moira talk about his indepenlenged dence.

721,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I did nothing of the sort.,69
722,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member did not apologize.,69
723,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I have been surprised to hear the Prime Minister deny the statement made by the honourable member for Kennedy, that the honourable member for Moira humbly apologized for his action.",69
724,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I did nothing of the kind.,69
725,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The records of Hansard will corroborate the statement of the honourable member for Kennedy.,69
726,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Le t us get this Works Bill through.,69
727,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The Prime Minister cannot cajole me by pleading that the working men of the Commonwealth will be kept in a ""state of semi-Starvation unless we pass this-Bill to-night.",69
728,Mr WILKS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Prime Minister can get a bigger workers' vote than can the honourable member for Gwydir. I can also get a bigger workers' vote than can the honourable member.,69
729,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In reply to the hon- "" orable member for Dalley, I will say that if the honourable member will strip himself of his sectarianism I am prepared to meet him in any electorate in Australia. If the honourable member will strip himself of his yellow cloak and come into the electorate I represent I am prepared to face him any day in ""the week.",69
730,Mr WILKS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I can beat the honourable member and his party thrown in.,69
731,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We are accustomed and it to the vagaries of the honourable member, who would appear to receive a bonus from the Government to occupy the position of general interjector.",69
732,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not fair.,69
733,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,When an honourable memmember strikes me below the belt I am to strike bapk in about the same,69
734,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member should not have brought the yellow business into the matter.,69
735,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then the honourable member for Dalley should not have chalme on the labour question. I amat the affected indignation of the honourable member for Moira, who has tried to humiliate the honourable and learned! member for Corio by questioning his consistency. If there is any fiscal consistency to be found in this Committee it is to be found in the little party sitting in the Opposition corner. No argument which the honourable member for Moira use will justify the position which protectionists occupy on the other side. The idea of an honourable member of his calibre talking to those who understand something of political matters in this Commonwealth, and telling us what consistency means when we find protectionists sitting behind the man who has declared all his life that he does not believe in their policy, and is determined to uproot it. It is simply marvellous that we should see on that side any protectionists, except those who are opposed to the progressive party known as the Labour Party. The party I see on the opposite benches place conservatism before radicalism or democracy every time.",69
736,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Le t us get these resolutions reported. The honourable member can get all this in on another occasion.,70
737,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I know what it means to be in want of work. I know what it is to depend on my toil for daily bread, and the right honourable gentleman cannot appeal to me on that score in the crisis which is arising.",70
738,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member can get the ci isis at another stage.,70
739,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"When I see protectionists sitting behind a free-trade Prime Minister, who has sworn that he will throw himself across the track of the progressive party of Australia, all I can say is that if there is an inconsistent party in the House, it is themselves.",70
740,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is a good peroration. * Mr Webster - That is an unnecessary interjection. I never waste the time of the House, nor do I indulge in useless repetition or transgress the rules of the House any more than my humble ability will deter me from doing. I desire to safeguard the Government against any loss of their emoluments tonight in the form of cab-fares, because I realise that the Labour Party when it crosses the floor may have to submit to some charges at the hands of the right honourable gentleman who, in his time, has been such an adept at ""stone-walling."" I sympathize with his anxiety to give work to the poor unfortunate unemployed in the various States. Having known what it is to carry my ""bluey,"" without any food to eat, I can truly sympathize with the right 12 B honourable gentleman in his desire to help the unemployed, and therefore I now resume my seat. Questions resolved in the affirmative. Resolutions reported. can Motion (by Mr Reid ) agreed to, with conciirrenceThat the Standing Orders be suspended, in order to allow the report from the Committee of Ways and Means to be adopted, and the Bill for the Appropriation for Works and Buildings to be passed through all its stages without delay, and the Appropriation Bill to be read a first time.

Bill presented by Mr Reid , andread a first and second time. In Committee : Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Issue and application of .£404,240).",70
741,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have feconsidered the question of the manner of charging these works and buildings. When the Budget debate was initiated, I raised the question as to the wisdom of departing from what has hitherto been the practice, and charging the cost of these works and buildings on a population basis. Of course, I admitted then that if the transferred properties were paid for immediately, no injustice would be done to any of the States through the new procedure, but that if for some years we put up works and buildings, especially defence work's, in those States where no provision or little provision has been made in that regard, it meant that other States would for a considerable time to come have to bear a much larger proportion than they otherwise would, and larger than they should do. Leaving out of account the items for armament, totalling £180,000, and taking into consideration only the £300,000 odd, which are to go for works and buildings proper, including, of course, some works for defence purposes",70
742,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The total is only £130,000.",70
743,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Althoug h £130,00 0 is the amount to be spent this year, still we commit ourselves to an expenditure of £180,000. So far as New South Wales is concerned, there is a difference of only £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 between what is to be spent this year and her proportion of the total on a population basis. The proportion paid by New South Wales on a population basis would be £ 1 1 2 , 0 0 0 , and the estimates ot expenditure are £ 1 0 2 , 0 0 0 . But the position is centuated in the case of Victoria. Her share, on a population basis, is £ 9 3 , 0 0 0 , and the amount of money to be spent is £ 5 1 , 0 0 0 , showing a deficiency of about £ 4 2 , 0 0 0 . Western Australia, this year, will have spent £ 7 1 , 0 0 0 odd, and will have to pay, on a population basis, £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 odd. I have worked out these figures in accordance with the percentages of population shown in the Budget papers.",70
744,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Are not the figures given in detail in the Budget papers?,71
745,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not know ; if they are I might have saved myself the trouble of working them out. In Queensland there is a difference of only £ 4 , 0 0 0 , and in South Australia of about £ 4 , 0 0 0 . toria and Western Australia are the two glaring cases.",71
746,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Roughl y speaking, Victoria is going to pay' for some of the work in Western Australia.",71
747,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes . that is the. position, roughly speaking. Of course I do not pretend to say what the legal position is. The Treasurer's interpretation of the constitutional aspect of the question may be correct. But I do say that in the absence of any provision for payment for transferred properties, equities would have been preserved by continuing the old system; and, personally, I am strongly of opinion that it would be much better to continue that system, pending some decision in regard to payment for transferred properties. Of course it is quite possible that next year we may have a practical scheme in that direction. I do not hope, for my own part, that there will be any immediate outcome in regard to taking over the debts of the States, but I do hope for some practical method of payment for the transferred properties being arrived at. In the meantime, it seems to me that a grave injustice will be suffered by the citizens of some of the States by the continuation of this method.",71
748,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I referred to this matter during the Budget debate, and the Treasurer then stated that he had obtained an opinion from the Attorney-General, and also from the honourable and learned member for Corinella upon the subject. I think, whatever the legal position may be, that some new means of allocating these moneys ought to be found. It does not matter whether my own State is particularly concerned or not. This year, it appears that Victoria will be about £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 more acto the bad, and Western Australia will practically have the whole of that amount spent within her territory. On a population basis, Victoria will pay about £90^000, and have only about £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 of it spent here, and I desire to enter my protest against this new plan which the Treasurer has adopted. I have no doubt that the Treasurer has obtained the best opinion available; but, nevertheless, I think that the matter should be reconsidered, with a view to an alteration of the method adopted, even if we have to go back to the method which has been in operation for the last three years.",71
749,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"This is a most difficult question, as the late Treasurer knows. We Vicall know that the present Treasurer gives an immense amount of attention to these subjects, and the present method was adopted in consequence of its being found that the previous system worked out inequitably. If . however, the new system works inequitably, we shall have to arrive at some other method. This was the best way we could arrive at, after giving the subject the'best consideration. It will be admitted that the question is a most troublesome one.",71
750,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I quite recognise that this is a very difficult question the to deal with, but the Prime Minister must also recognise, in justice to the States that have spent large sums of money in developing their Torts and defences, that they are receiving no return whatever on that account from the Commonwealth.",71
751,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We thought that this scheme would work out with the least hardship.,71
752,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It would, if we were assured that it would be limited, but we have no such assurance. Next year the discrepancy may be twice the amount of that for the present year.",71
753,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The expenditure on forts in Western Australia will be large for some years to come.,71
754,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That will also be the Ch.se m other States proportionately. If the system adopted this year, is to form a precedent, there will be trouble.",71
755,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We are not tied to it for next year. to know whether any satisfactory arrangement has been made in regard to the Sydney Customs House? If the Minister will take the trouble to inspect that building, he will admit that it is in a disgraceful .condition. IF Hoes not provide sufficient accommodation for the present number of officers. I need scarcely remind honourable members that the question of the employment of day labour in carrying out public works has been referred to many times in this House. When I was in office I stated that it was .my intention, wherever possible, lo employ day labour upon those works, and that where is was not possible the contract system would be adopted. But I would point out that the works which are carried out by the Commonwealth are few in comparison with those which are carried out by the States. In New South Wales, fortunately, no trouble has been experienced in this connection, because wherever it was possible to perform work by day labour, that class of labour has been employed. The same remark is applicable to South Australia. A great deal has been said against the employment of day labour, but I claim that under proper supervision that system is cheaper than is the contract system.",71
756,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,So long as political influence is eliminated.,72
757,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , and so long as a good inspector is placed over the men to see that they perform their work efficiently. I confess that I used to be opposed to the day labour system.",72
758,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Hear , hear.",72
759,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member for Parramatta will recollect that in the New South Wales Parliament I at- tacked him for employing day labour in connection with a telephone tunnel. result of that attack a Committee was appointed to investigate the matter, and if honourable members will take the trouble to read the report of that ibodv, and the evidence taken before it, they will see that under proper supervision the dav labour system is cheaper than is the contract system by 25 per cent. In spite of the ourcrv against it-a n outcry which comes rnainlv from the contractors-ther e are certain works which should be carried out by day labour in preference to the contract system. I trust that we shall not revert to the old system under which contractors arp able to . make such large sums of monev. The nro: fits secured by them are due, not to the fact that the contracts accepted by the Government are too high, but to alterations and additions ordered by the architects, which enable them to make heavy claims for extras, representing the difference between the value of the work done by their employees, and the total sum paid , by the taxpayer. I refer to this matter, because I have heard and read of many statements in opposition to the day-labour system, and I have also heard the statement that it is gradually being dropped in New South Wales.",72
760,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,All true reformers are adopting the day-labour system.,72
761,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If that be so, I hope that we shall not return to the old system, which has enabled many contractors, more particularly in New South Wales, to make large profits, representing the difference between the actual cost of the work, and the price paid by the Government, and to become our largest money lenders. If we revert to the old system the taxpayers will have to pay far more for the services rendered than they would have to do under any reasonable system of day labour.",72
762,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I rise, not to discuss the merits of the day-labour system, but to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the Estimates provide for an expenditure of something like £ 2 , 3 0 0 , to enable the completion of improvements to the General Post Office, Sydney, which, until recently, were being made under the day-labour system. I believe . that the work in question was commenced whilst the honourable member for Parramatta was Postmaster-General in the State Government, and that he instituted the day-labour system. Recently certain changes were made, and a proposal was As a put forward, that the system of employing day labour in carrying out these improvements should be discontinued, and that the work should be handed over to contractors. The late-Minister of Home Affairs vetoed that proposal, and determined that the day labour system should be continued.",72
763,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"At the same time he wrote a minute, insisting that no political influence should be allowed.",72
764,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is correct. In view of the success which has hitherto attended the day-labour system, I hope that the Minister will see that the works which we are now sanctioning, are carried out in the same way. With capable officers supervising the operations of day labourers, I",72
765,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What I am anxious about is that the adoption of the system this year shall not be used as an argument for continuing it.,73
766,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,This Bill does not touch the question of principle one way or the other. It is simply an Appropriation Bill .,73
767,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Will the Prime Minister give us a promise that before the end of the next financial year the Government will endeavour to evolve some scheme whereby the inequity of the present arrangement will be to some extent minimized?,73
768,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Certainly ; we will go into the whole matter afresh.,73
769,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I desire to say a word or two with regard to the method of constructing public works. The Government has not made any announcement oh that subject. I should like to have an announcement from the Prime Minister as to what are the intentions of the Public Works Department. I think I am correct in saying that no resolution has been passed by this House affirming the desirableness of constructing public works by day labour. I believe that it was the practice of previous Governments to carry out public works by day labour, wherever it was possible to do so. If the Prime Minister wil] assure me that that policy will be followed in the future",73
770,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I must ask the Minister of Home Affairs to answer.that question.,73
771,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the Minister will give me an assurance that that policy will be adopted wherever possible, I shall be satisfied.",73
772,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,To what works does the honourable member refer?,73
773,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"To public works generally. I understand that in carrying on those works, the Government make use of the Public Works Departments of the various States, and also of their officers. In most, if not in all of the States, public works are carried out by day labour. trust that the Minister of Home Affairs will stipulate that wherever possible, the practice which has previously been followed in the carrying out of public works, shall be adopted. Mr . DUGA LD THOMSON (North Sydney-Minister of Home Affairs) - I am not aware that there has been any instruction for departure from the policy which has previously been followed in the Department over which I presida I can make no promise to the honourable member, 1.2 B 2 without first being afforded an opportunity of ascertaining what the effect of that promise would be. It seems to me that the question whether particular public works should or should not be constructed by day labour, must be determined upon the merits of each case. I shall deal with each work in that way, I shall also ascertain what practice has previously been followed, and whether any alteration has been made in that practice.",73
774,Sir JOHN QUICK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," In regard to the point raised by the leader of the Opposition, I should like it to be understood that the representatives of Victoria do not waive any legal or constitutional rights which may be involved. My own opinion is that defence works may properly be regarded as new works, and should, therefore, be federalized. But public works which might be considered of a developmental character-post-offices , for example-should , I think, be regarded as continuing expenditure,, and accordingly be debited to the States. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not waive any legal or constitutional rights in connection with this matter, nor do I think that the House could in any way prejudice those rights. If any rights exist, they are preserved. by the Constitution, and may be enforced hereafter by proceedings in the High Court.",73
775,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"And we would never put obstacles in the way of testing such a question if the States desired to do so. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) - Since the establishment of the Federation, a great deal of trouble has been experienced in effecting improvements and repairs to transferred buildings, which some of the States Governments contend partially belong to them. In this connection, I may instance the Sydney Customs House. Just prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the New South Wales Government added one or two storeys to that building; but did not I complete its interior. Later on, I induced this House to vote £ 2 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 , 0 0 0 to finish that work. Thereupon, the Premier of New South Wales objected to that money being expended, and maintained that a portion of the building still belonged to t'he State. The result is that the building is in a disgraceful and deplorable state at the present time. If I had had my way in the matter. I should have tested the position before the High Court long ere this. A similar dispute exists in regard to buildings In Bendigo and Perth. I should like think it will be found to the interests of the Commonwealth to continue'the system.",73
776,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I am sorry that the Minister did not give me the assurance for which I asked. He said that he was not aware of any change of policy in the administration of the Department since he had taken office, but at the same time he distinctly refused to give me the assurance that he would follow the practice of his predecessor. If he does not intend to do so, he should at once tell the Committee. This is a very important question, upon which the Committee, if asked, would be prepared to make a very - definite pronouncement.",74
777,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the honourable member finds any cause for complaint, he can easily deal with it.",74
778,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There may come a time when it will be too late to make complaints. I refrained from making a speech on the subject, because I anticipated a sympathetic reply from the Minister. I thought that as the practice had 'become so common in many of the States, 'and had proved so successful, he would be in full sympathy with the suggestion.",74
779,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Le t us hear what the Minister has to say, now that he understands the request made by the honourable member.",74
780,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I desire an as'surance that the practice, which has been found to work so well, particularly in those States which have adopted it generally, shall be continued.",74
781,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I thought that I informed the honourable member with sufficient clearness that I had not instructed a departure from any policy, ih respect of the matter to which he alluded, which was - observed by the Department before I took charge of it.",74
782,Mr CARPENTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable gentleman said that he would not promise to follow the old practice.,74
783,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I shall not make any promise in regard to the future policy of the Department until I have had an opportunity to make that investigation which any Minister ought to make before arriving at a decision in regard to such a matter. As the honourable member for Hume has said, by far the larger ; proportion of the works that are under the - control of the Department of Home Affairs are carried out by States Departments. The - Department itself has neither the officers .oor the plant to carry out these works. Whilst I am perfectly ready, to do anything that is in the best interests of the workers, it is expected, of course, that I shall see that the tax-payers of the community are protected, and that undue expenditure is not incurred in carrying out Commonwealth undertakings. Consistent with that view of my position, the day-labour system shall have my full support wherever it can be shown that it is cheaper than the contract system. I am not in any way antagonistic to day-labour in itself, but must judge by results; I merely say that, as Minister, I must not commit myself to any promise until I have had an opportunity to see the result of the working of both systems. That is the position. Honourable members can, at all times), know what is being done in connection with the different public works of the Commonwealth. I hope that should I be called upon at any time to do so, I shall be able to show good reasons for.any practice that is adopted by the Department in relation to a particular work. The honourable member for Hume has referred to the condition of the Customs House in Sydney, and I may say that on taking office, I found that the facts were as he has stated. I at once: entered into negotiations through the Prime Minister,, with the Premier of New South Wales to have that unsatisfactory position at least remedied to some extent. As the result of these negotiations, the Premier of New South Wales has agreed to allow that portion of the building occupied by the Commonwealth to be repaired and altered, and provision is made on the Estimates to enable the work to be carried out. Consequently, the cause of complaint in regard to that portion of the building to which the honourable member has referred will be removed. Negotiations have also been entered upon, and I hope they will be brought to a conclusion at the Premiers' Conference, if not before, for the settlement of the question of the ownership of the building. My action' has, so far, been successful, and I trust that it will be more successful in.the,future in securing a settlement. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Schedule.",74
784,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I should like some information in regard to the proposal to grant £1,000 for the construction of a new post and telegraph office at Canowindra. This post-office is .situated on the line, which divides the division which I represent from the Macquarie division, and, so that honourable members may understand the position of affairs, I may mention that at Canowindra there is a township built on private property, and what is known as the Government township, where a fine site was set apart on the laying out of the town for a' post-office, and where there is also a public school and a police station. The original post-office, however, was a rented building in the private town. A controversy ensued between the townspeople as to where the new post-office should be placed, and I understand that the State Postmaster-General, just prior to Federation, promised that no action would be taken without consulting those residing in the private township.",74
785,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Will the honourable member see the Postmaster-General about this matter?',75
786,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have hitherto got very little satisfaction out of the Postal Department in regard to it. I understand that tenders have now been called. The State paid at the rate of £1,300 per acre forabout one-third of""ah acre. I suggest that the Postmaster-General should nfeke inquiries to see whether a larger area should not be purchased.",75
