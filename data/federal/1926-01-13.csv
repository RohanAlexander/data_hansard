1,Sir GBANVIIXE EYRIE,Unknown,"Warringah) [11.6] - I move That the honourable member for Darling Downs Sir Littleton Groom do take the Chair of the Houso as Speaker. Those who have boon for many years members of this House are well aware of the qualifications of the honourable member for Darling Downs, but I remind those honourable members who are new. to the House that he has been a member of this Parliament ever since its' first session. He has held many and various portfolios in many and various Ministries, and never at any time in his long career has there been the slightest whisper of suspicion about.or reflection upon his honour and integrity as a public man. His extended experience has given him, perhaps, a wider knowledge of the rules and procedure of Parliament than is possessed by any other member of this House. He possesses a judicial mind and will, I am confident, discharge the duties of presiding officer with strict impartiality. I think I am justified in saying that he is the ideal man for the position of Speaker.  - I have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of the honourable member for Darling Downs for the position of Speaker of this House.",15
2,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.10] - I rise to enter my protest against the nomination of the honourable member for Darling Downs for the position of Speaker. The present personnel of this House is the result of an appeal to the country upon certain legislation and Ministerial acts which were based upon the Government's interpretation of the Constitution. The Government acted upon the advice of men occupying high positions, who were supposed understand the Constitution. Upon the issue placed before them by the Government, in accordance with the legal advice of these gentlemen, the people voted; but after the election the High. Court declared that the legislation passed by the last Parliament, at the instance of the Government, and the acts of Ministers thereunder, were ultra vires. The Government then found it necessary to shift from the position of the Attorney General the Minister who had given the misleading advice, and to appoint another lawyer to do the job in the hope that a second mistake would - be avoided. elevate the disrated man to ,the position of Speaker of this Parliament will be to do an injustice to the community. To some extent, I concur in what was said by the honourable member for Warringah regarding the qualifications of the aspirant to this office, but those qualifications do not give him a right to the position. Technically, the Speaker is elected by the House, but actually the election bas been cut and dried in caucus in accordance with the terms of the pact between the parties supporting the Ministry, and at the right time something may well be said about the honour of pacts. The honourable member for Darling Downs has been nominated by a Nationalist, and. the nomination, has been seconded by a member of the Country party, so we may regard his election as assured. The point I am emphasizing is that no sooner. was the election over, and the constitutional position in regard to deportation declared by the High Court, than the honourable member for Darling Downs retired from the position of Attorney-General, in which he had made such a mess of things.",16
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,That is not accurate.,16
4,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I leave the public to judge whether my statement is accurate or not. The judgment of the High Court that the Deportation Act is ultra vires, and cannot fulfil the purposes for which it was passed, justifies my statement.",16
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I think the honourable member desires to be fair, and I assure him he. is making a mistake.",16
6,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I do desire to be fair in all circumstances, and to see the same treatment meted out to men in all to spheres of society. If an ordinary working man made such a mistake as was made by the ex-Attorney-General in regard to the deportation legislation, he would not be transferred to another job, but would be "" fired.""",16
7,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Hi s union would not allow him to be "" fired.""",16
8,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The honourable member, who is so obsessed with thoughts of bolshevism and communism, and can see nothing but those forcesoverwhelming the Commonwealth, and dismembering the Empire, had a duty as a legal memTo ber of this Parliament to point out to the Government the mistake it was making in connection with the deportation proceedings. He has legal knowledge and experience, and draws a high fee from the country for making his knowledge available to this Parliament, but when the Government was in need of some advice, the honourable member was found wanting. I voice the view of the class I represent, and I know well that if a man working at Canberra, or on the north-south line, made a huge blunder, he would be "" f i r e d "" im mediately instead of being transferred to a sheltered position. The nomination of the honourable member for Diarling Downs for the position of Speaker is an affront to the community; it is immoral. A f t e r his long years of office, I should have thought that the honourable member would have been content to retire to the back benches, and there ponder over the mistake which led to a lowering of his political status. His resignation from the Ministry was not unexpected by me. I have been waiting for the resignation of another gentleman who was concerned in that bungle; it has not occurred yet, but in futur e when we quote the Annotated Constitution, we shall not refer to the authors of it as "" Q u i c k . and Garran,"" but as "" Quick and the dead."" I object to the nomination, and shall vote against the motion. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [11.15] - I agree with a good deal that the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) has said respecting the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom). He is respected by every honourable member of the House. He has always been courteous and obliging, and has shown himself anxious to give the best advice possible on all matters submitted to him . But he has my sympathy this morning. It is not right that the Government should seek to shelter itself behind him , nor that it should try tq. hide its mistakes by displacing him from the Attorney Generalship. He gave certain advice, which the Government accepted. If the advice was wrong, the Government made a mistake in accepting it . It is not an elevation of Sir Littleton Groom to take him from the Attorney-Generalship and make him Speaker. I look upon what is proposed as a slight put upon him. The honourable gentleman who took Sir Littleton Groom's place in the Ministry gave the Government exactly the same advice as his predecessor. I well remember doing so from his place on the cross benches opposite. He went as far as Sir Littleton Groom, if not farther. He said that the Deportation Bill was quite constitutional, and quoted statutes and precedents in support of his contention. If Sir Littleton Groom made a mistake, so did the present Attorney-General (Mr Latham). I do not suggest that any Minister is infallible.",16
9,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that the High Court is infallible? Mr E . RILEY - I do not. In this case the High Court has given a liberal interpretation of the Constitution, whereas the advisers of the Government gave it a narrow interpretation. When the life and liberty of the subject are at stake, the Constitution should be interpreted liberally. In the past we have complained of decisions of the High Court. We have contended that it should have been more liberal in its interpretations. The freest and widest possible interpretation of the Constitution should be giyen when the liberty of the subject is at stake. If the men who were arrested, under the Deportation Act committed a crime, surely our ordinary legal machinery is adequate to deal with them. It ought not to be necessary to pass a special act and to stretch the provisions of the Constitution to punish their offence. This was done simply to give the Government an election cry. We know that very well. The party to which I belong is suffering for it at present, and we believe that the whole country will suffer for it later on; but we shall bear our sufferings cheerfully, for we know that ultimately our time will come. In agreeing to take the Speakership, Sir Littleton Groom is saving the face of the Government. If I had been in his place and had been asked to retire from the Attorney Generalship-the next position in the Cabinet to that of the Prime M in ister-and to accept the Speakership, I should certainly have declined. Speak 1 ing personally, I look upon Sir Littleton Groom as a friend. I believe that he has the friendship of every honourable member. He will have difficulty in fulfilling"" the duties of Speaker with the dignity him and success of the last Speaker, but I believe that be will do his utmost to be courteous and kind to honourable members generally. It has been stated that he is in ill health, and that for this reason he retired from the torney-Generalship. I trust that his health may improve, and that we may have the pleasure of seeing him smiling at us with his usual cordiality from Mr Speaker's chair. Seeing that the Government has seen fit to remove Sir Littleton Groom from the At torney-Generalship, I should like to know whether it proposes re-organize the Attorney-General's Department. The officers of the department have given the Government bad advice. It cannot be expected that the Attorney-General shall devote the whole of his time to preparing legal opinions for the Government. If there was anything wrong with the constitutionality of the Deportation Act, there is something wrong with the department. If there was anything wrong with the drafting of the bill, there is something wrong with the department. What has Sir Eobert Garran to say about the matter ? He is the public servant who should be the guiding star of the Cabinet >n constitutional matters. Every bill thai, has come from the Attorney-General's Department lately, especially those dealing with taxation matters, has needed amending, in consequence of faulty drafting, a month or two after Parliament has passed it . Tbis is the fault of the Attorney-General's Department. The department should be thoroughly overhauled, so that we might be able to place some reliance on its work. I regret very much that the ex Attorney-General (Sir Littleton 7 Groom) has been slighted by the Government, and I regard this proposal as a sop. The Government, by offering him the Speakership, is trying to heal the wound that it bas inflicted by removing him fro m the Attorney-Genf-ralship.",17
10,Mr BEUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.22] - 1 very much regret that certain things have been said this morning. Our present business is to determine which of our number shall hold during this Parliament the high and dignified office of Speaker. I had no intention of speaking on the matter, but I feel that I must do so in justice to Sir Littleton Groom. It is quite obvious that two honourable members who have spoken this morning are under a misapprehension. ' U has been suggested that Sir Littleton Groom was asked to retire from the Government because of a certain decision of the High At - Court. I endeavoured to correct that mistake while the honourable member for Adelaide (M t . Yates) was speaking, but I was not able to do so. The honourable member said that he desired to be fair, and I , therefore, ask him to call to mind the exact facts of the case. Sir Littleton Groom intimated to me on the 5th December, six days before the High Court to judgment bad been delivered, that he wished to be relieved of his portfolio. This fact has been published, and is public knowledge. Sir Littleton Groom had held office in various Ministries for a longer period, probably, than any other Minister with one exception. His desire to retire had nothing whatever to do with any judgment of the High Court. I should like honourable members to bear in mind that later on there will be ample opportunity to discuss the H i gh Court judgment and the very wide constitutional questions that are associated with it . In determining this question, however, I hope that all opinions as to whether the Government acted wisely or not in connection with the deportation legislation will be put on one side. To-day we are electing a Speaker, and the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) has intimated that he is prepared to accept the position. Honourable members should, in considering the question before them, pay no regard to any opinions they may have as to how far the legal advisers of the Government - were wrong in connection with the Deportation Act, and how far the decision of the High Court in this matter was a reversal of its previous decisions. I ask the House to accept my assurance that Sir Littleton Groom's retirement had nothing to do with the decision of the H i gh Cotirt.",18
11,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.25]. - I cannot blame the Prime Minister for defending the proposal, or others for criticizing it . On many occasions in the past I have defined my attitude to the Speakership. Instead of the Speaker being elected and removed from the turmoil of politics for three years, he should be elected every session. The constituents of an honourable member who is elected Speaker ought not to be deprived of his services for as long as three years. I welcome the ex-Speaker (Mr W at t ) back to the political arena. He will no doubt recollect that I objected to his taking the Speakership, and that I said that the subsequent political history of those who became Speakers reminded me of the words, H i e jacet so often found upon tombstones. I am glad that he did not write of his political career in accepting the Speakership, and I hope that he will add another to the only exception that we have had in Victoria to the general rule. Only one Speaker in this State-Si r Thomas Bent-afterward s rose to political greatness. From Attorney General to Speaker is certainly a descent. A Speaker is required to hold the scales fairly, and I am certain that Sir Littleton Groom will, do so. I have always found him a courteous, studious gentleman in every sense of the word, and I regret that he is leaving the turmoil ' . f politics. The Prime Minister stated, correctly, that his resignation was received before the decision of the High Court was announced, but the Prime Minister knows that what the decision would be was common knowledge throughout Australia at that time.",18
12,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,That statement is not correct.,19
13,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If , however, Sir Littleton Groom has decided to write Hie jacet upon his political career, I promise him that while he occupies the chair, and while I remain in this House, I will behave to him as courteously as he has behaved to me, and will obey any orders he may give. I hope that the record made by Sir Thomas Bent will be equalled by the retiring Speaker, for I should like to see two exceptions to the general rule. In public, as I have already done in private, welcome the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) back to the floor of the House, although we shall still sit in opposition to each other. I support the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . Biley). No matter what the Prime Minister may say, the world will think that he has removed from the position of Attorney-General a very able, studious, and clever gentleman, to make room, perhaps, for another. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), who advanced the present Attorney-General, did not receive many thanks from him when he entered this House. The public will think that Sir Littleton Groom has been made a scapegoat. Be that as it may, Sir Robert Garran at least' should be taken to task. I would dare the Prime Minister, or any other honourable member, to support publicly the g if t of the end £1,000 to that gentleman and other officers of the Attorney-General's Department. That g if t was authorized by the Prime Minister, and notified in the Commonwealth Gazette. Who on earth reads the Commonwealth Gazette ? The voice of the man who drew public , attention to it cannot now. be raised here; he has been silenced by the vituperative, slanderous, and lying efforts of the press, supported by the moneypower of this country. I have never had - any time for Johnson, Walsh, and Garden, whom the Government has used as bogies to frighten the people. Honourable members opposite have come back m their numbers, but I cannot believe that they all accept the lies that the press and the wealthy section of the community uttered during the election. If this Government will bring about one desirable reform, namely, the establishment of the initiative, referendum, and recall, I shall be glad to leave politics. I should like to put to the country the question, "" Which is right, the High Court judgment, or the mean, contemptible attacks on the liberty of men who, at all events, are British 1 "" Would any member of the Ministry care to face the electors and say, "" I support all the lies that have been uttered about these three men ? "" In my 37 years' experience of political life I have not seen a Government placed in a more despicable position by a judgment of . the H i gh Court, and II thank Heaven that there is a High Court. It is said that the Prime Minister intends to go forward with his deportation policy, but if he w i ll take the advice of one who, at all events, tries to be an honest opponent, he will now drop the subject, and regard the rights of citizenship as sacred. At present He is proposing to build on a foundation that may be used by his successors, and then it may be his turn to thank Heaven that there is a High Court.",19
14,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [11.35],- I thank the honourable members who have moved and seconded my nomination for this important position, and respectfully submit myself to this honourable House.",19
15,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [11.36] I do not propose to oppose the election of the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) as the Speaker of this House, my main reason being that I feel certain that any such opposition would not be effective. Although the honourable member is at the present moment seated among us in sartorial simplicity,- I am confident that the upholsterers are already actively engaged in preparing the garniture which we shall shortly see adorning him, and which will contribute so much to his dignity and beauty, as well as to his material warmth and general comfort during the months of January and February in which the House will be in session. I can only hope that when he assumes the robes of his high' office he will succeed in looking a little less ferocious than his immediate predecessor. Of his predecessors it is perhaps fitting that I should say a word or two. I shall go no farther back than to my amiable and lionorable friend, the member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), who has pursued the path of greatness, from the throne to the bathroom, at the behest of the Nationalist party. Eeferring to Sir Littleton Groom's immediate predecessor, . I must say that in following him Sir Littleton Groom will be required to live up to a very high standard of excellence. The Speaker of the last Parliament, the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt), was nearly always and, when he could not his way to be fair, he was entertaining. I am very glad that he finds himself impelled to resume his position in the fighting ranks of Parliament to give effect to the emphatic mandate which he has recently received from the pawnbrokers of St. Kilda. It has been suggested that Sir Littleton Groom will not be elevated by his election to the position of Speaker, but that he will be - to quote an honourable colleague and coin a word- "" delevated "" to that high office. With that view I do not agree, because I can see no reason why the Government should penalize Sir Littleton Groom for having given advice which, though bad from the legal point of view, helped it to win the election. It would be an act of base ingratitude-and , in this connection, I can appreciate the indignation of the Prime Minister-for one who had rendered such distinguished service to the. Government in its hour of trial to be disrated after the Government had gathered the fruits of his advice. And, in any case, why should one honourable member be dis-. placed by another whose advice was equally bad? It must be consoling to Sir Littleton Groom to cast his eye along the brilliant phalanx of legal talent on his side of the Ohamber, and to know that, without exception, they concurred in the unsound advice which he gave to the Government. I have always made it a matter of duty to defend, to the best of my ability, that profession of which I am an inconspicuous member, even, though the darts and arrows have been thrown sometimes by honourable members on this side of the House, and I regret that recent occurrencesiu Federal politics have not made my task any easier in this respect. The present circumstances remind me strongly of an analogous case in which a person consulted an eminent surgeon regarding the state of his health, only to be told that his case was not one for a surgeon, but fov a plumber. Among the members of the Labour party in this House, we have some tradesmen, and, in future, when intricate and involved constitutional questions arise, I shall be very deferential to any views which they may exfair, press regarding them. Having no desee sire to further delay the proceedings, I repeat that L do not agree with those who have suggested that Sir Littleton Gtroom, by his election - to the Speaker's chair, is to be disrated or relegated to the place of general ablutions; rather do I hold that he is about to be honoured and given a well deserved reward for his services. It has been stated that his elevation will enable him to enjoy a rest from the more strenuous duties of a ministerial position, but in this connection I utter a word of warning. If Sir Littleton Groom seeks a rest, it is possible that he will not obtain it while occupying the Speaker's chair. I regretfully admit that we on this side . are somewhat short-handed, but I assure honourable members that, notwithstanding that handicap, our output during the coming session will be not less tban heretofore. I do not think I need add anything f u r ther, except to pay my tribute to the personal qualities of Sir Groom. I have known him for many years, during which we have both beeu members of this House, and I have - a very high opinion of him personally. Indeed, I have not so poor an opinion of him as a lawyer as have some members on the other side of the chamber. Sir Littleton Groom is a genial and friendly man; he does not easily make enemies, and, in the discharge of the responsible duties of his high office as Speaker of this House, I am sure that, he will be absolutely fair to all honourable members. When I said just now that I did not offer any opposition to his election as Speaker, only because any opposition on my part would not be effective, I must be understood to mean that I regarded this matter as having been already settled elsewhere-althoug h a pretence is now made of consulting honourable members on this and that, therefore, it would be useless for us to oppose the nomination. I hope that in the discharge of his high office he will enjoy sustained good health. So far as I am concerned, I shall lend him all the help I can, consistent with the performance of my distinguished and onerous duties as one of the members of a reduced Opposition. Members of the House then unanimously calling Sir Littleton Groom to the chair, he was taken out of his place  son, and conducted to the chair. Then Mr SPEAKER ELECT-stand ing on the upper step, said- I thank honourable members very much indeed for the great honour they have conferred upon me in selecting me as Speaker of this honourable House. I am conscious of the high traditions attaching to the position, traditions which have been worthily sustained by a long line of predecessors, whom, with the help of honourable members, I shall try to emulate. I shall do my best to be an impartial Speaker, and I know that I can rely upon the .assistance of members of all parties in the discharge of my important duties.",20
16,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.47] - I congratulate you, Speaker, upon your election to the high office that you - are now called upon to fill. I speak, I think, for all honourable members in expressing confidence that its Littleton great traditions will ever be maintained by you. Every member of this House appreciates the services that you have ren- dered to the Commonwealth in the past. I think you must have gathered from the speeches that have been made that you have earned during your long parliamentary career the confidence, the respect, the good will , and also the affection of those with whom you have been associated. As the head of the Government I congratulate you, and I assure you that in the position which you now occupy you will have the support not only of the Government but also of all other honourable members, because we recognize that you are now the custodian of our rights and privileges.",21
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [11.48] I , too, congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the highest position within the g if t of honourable members. I side- feel sure that you will discharge your high and honourable duties in an impartial manner, that you will do your best to maintain the dignity of this chamber, and to carry out your duties with credit not only to yourself but also to the assembly over which you will preside. So far as honourable members on this side of the House are concerned we shall do everything possible to assist you in the discharge of your high and honourable duties.",21
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), ' and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) for their kind congratulations, which I greatly appreciate. One looks back over the 25 years of our national life with feelings of gratification. During that period we have done our part in the building up of Australia as a nation, and I think that no other Federation has, during a similar period, done its work more effectually, nor with the maintenance of greater good will between the federal and state authorities. I regret the absence of some faces that we saw in this chamber last Parliament. Three of those who are no longer with us were members when the first Commonwealth Parliament met 25 years ago. One of them did not seek re-election; two Mr of them have died, and our sympathies are with their families and relatives. I welcome the new members to House, and assure tbem that they receive every assistance from me, from the officers of the House, in the formance of their high duties. P RESENTATI ON OF MR .

Charles MCDonald, the Hon. Sir Austin Chapman, , and Senator O'Loghlin-hav e passed away. I propose to move motions of sympathy in regard to the two first-named, both of whom were members of the House. In regard to Senator O'Loghlin, a similar motion will be moved in another place. I now move That this House records its sincere regret the death of the Hon. Charles MCDonald, who was a member of the House from the of the Parliament until the recent dissolution, and who for many years held the of Speaker; and this House expresses appreciation of the energy and ability with In which he devoted - himself to his public duties, and tenders its profound ' sympathy to his bereaved wife and daughter in their great On far too many occasions since I have been Prime Minister it has been my painf u l task to submit motions recording our regret in the death of members of this Parliament, and our sympathy with those whom they have lef t behind. The frequency of these occasions emphasizes the trials of the service rendered in the Parliament of this country, and the great strain which political life upon those who undertake it . For a considerable time the honourable gentleman whose death we mourn today had not been in robust health, but the announcement of his death on the eve of the general election came as a shock to all of us. It was a matter of particular sorrow to those who had been associated with him in this Parliament; but even amongst the outside public, who knew him only by reputation, there was general regret. The late Mr MCDonald had a very long and honourable career in the public life of Australia, commencing in 1893 when he first entered the Parliament of Queensland. At the advent of federation he entered federal politics, and at the time of his death he was one of the few remaining members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. ""With his passing, another link with that historic assembly has gone. Throughout'his parliamentary career he played a very active part. He was a Temporary Chairman of Committees in the first Commonwealth Parliament-from 1901 to 1904. During the years 1905 and 1906 he served on a select committee and also on a royal commission. In 1906 he was elected Chairman of Committees, a position he held until 1910, when he became Speaker. That high position he occupied for a total period of six years-firs t from 1910 to 1913, and then from 1914 to 1917. During his occupancy of that high office he did much to add to its dignity and honour. He upheld the great traditions of British Parliaments, and earned the respect and regard of honourable members oil all sides of the House. Those brief facts show how strenuous was his public career. His was a continuous record of honourable service of which any man might well be proud, but the continuity and strenuousness of his service probably hastened his death. This House feels deeply his loss, and desires to express to his widow and daughter its deep sympathy. I hope that the knowledge of the extent to which his public services were appreciated will help to comfort them in the period of sorrow through which they are now passing.",23
30,Mr CHARLTON,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Hunter ) [ 3 . 4 5 ] - I join with the Prime Minister in deploring that so often in recent years occasion has arisen for motions of this description. Two gentlemen who were memplaces bers of the first Federal Parliament, .both of whom were nominated at the recent election, and one of whom was returned, have been prevented by death from taking part in the proceedings of the House today. The death-roll of this Parliament during the last eleven or twelve years has been very heavy. To-day we are mourning the loss of one who was a colleague and personal friend of mine. He was a member of this House from its inception, and throughout his long public life gave of his best in the interests of his country. All honourable members will agree that the late Charles MCDonald, worked strenuously. He had strong convictions, and was unwavering in them, but withal he was kind and considerate, and allowed to every other honourable member the right to differ from him. He ' held many positions in this House, and as presiding officer for six years discharged his duties in a wholly satisfactory and efficient manner. For a considerable period he experienced bad health, and no greater testimony to his worth could be found than the fact that although his physical disabilities prevented him from taking as active a part in parliamentary life as he had formerly done, the electors continued f a it h f u l to him. I hope that the knowledge that the deceased gentleman lived a useful life, and was respected by every member of the House and the community generally, will be of some consolation to his sorrowing widow and daughter, and the other members of his family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members, standing in their places. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Mrs MCDonald the foregoing resolution, and a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. DEAT H OF THE HON. SIB.

In circumstances he would have been with us today; instead, we have the knowledge that he is no more. His death is so recent that it is difficult to say all that one feels in regard to him. time a Ministerial colleague of mine, he was a man for whom I had the greatest possible respect, and even affection. had made for himself, in some respects, an almost unique position in this House. Although for many years he had suffered from serious physical infirmities, he bore them heroically, and never allowed them to interfere with his work in this Parliament. His courage evoked the admiration of all honourable members, and created in our hearts a very great affection for him. His passing has also ended a very long and continuous career in the public life of Australia. He was first elected to the Parliament of New South Wales, in 1891\ He remained a member that assembly until he became member of the first Commonwealth liament on the inception of Early in that Parliament he attained Ministerial rank, as Minister for Defence, which position he held in the years 1903 - and 1904. Other offices which he held were: master-General, from 1905 to 1907; Minister for Trade and Customs in 1907 and 1908, and again in 1923. He retained his last portfolio .until his retirement, on account of ill health, in May, 1924. Sir Austin Chapman's name will always be associated in our minds with great reforms which he continually to achieve. He was a very keen advocate Mr Bruce. of progress in our postal service generally. H is name will always be associated with the advocacy of penny postage for Australia. He also rendered great service in connection with the provision of old-age and invalid pensions, for which a great many indigent men and women have had, and many still have, cause to was bless his name, and thank him. He was a notably vigorous advocate of the early Parliament. removal of the Seat of the Commonwe'ilth Government from Melbourne to Canberra, for which he worked strenuously and conOn tinuously. It is a matter of very great regret to all of us that, although we are so close to the establishment of the Federal gloom, Capital at Canberra, he was not spared Austin to see the accomplishment of the project, ordinary and to join us in our new home there. We all have the feeling that, through the death of Sir Austin Chapman, we have lost a sincere f r i e nd and a loyal comrade, Por some and we sorrow because he is no longer among us to take the active part which he formerly took in the public affairs of He Australia. We trust that the appreciation and honour in which he waa held by those who were associated with him in this Parliament, by all who knew him in public life, and by many who never met him personally, may do something to temper the grief of his wife and family during the sad time through which they are passing.",24
32,Mr CHARLTON,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Hunter ) [ 3 . 5 4 ] - I endorse the sentiments expressed by the right honourable the Prime Minister. I have followed the public career of Sir of Austin Chapman for a very long timea long before I entered poltical life. T well Par- remember when he was first elected to the Federation. Parliament of New South Wales. At that time-befor e the Labour party was formed- I was a very strong protectionist. I was much attracted by Ministerial the politics of Sir Austin Chapman, Postthough then I had not met him. Some years later, I had the privilege of meeting him, and ever after we were the best of personal friends. I differed a good deal with Sir Austin Chapman in politics, but I always admired him as a man. He never percertain mitted political differences to interfere strove with the administration of the various departments which he controlled. He was uniformly fair ancl just. That, I consider to be a fine tribute to be able to pay to a man who was for so long in public life. He played a prominent part in the affairs of this country, and as the Prime Minister stated, ho was a keen advocate of the early removal of the seat of the Federal Government to Canberra. I sincerely regret that he was not spared to participate in that event, but I suggest that when the Government is established at Canberra, it should do something to commemorate his memory. My sympathy, and I believe the sympathy of every honourable member of this House, goes out to his wife aud family in their sad bereavement. I trust that it will be some consulation to them to know that their husband and father had the good wishes and respect of every member of this Parliament and of the people of Australia. That ho was highly respected in his own district was eloquently shown by the majorities with which he was returned at each election.",25
33,Mr MAHONY,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Dalley) [3.56] - I should like to add my personal tribute, to the memory of Sir Austin Chapman. It was with great sorrow that I learned of his passing. I had been personally associated with him in mauy public matters for many years. He was always actuated by the highest motives, and he had a sincere love for Australia, and desired to see it progress. He was at heart a thorough, straight-going democrat. Through his death the public life of Australia is indeed the poorer. . No man could have worked more unselfishly than he did for the establishment of the Federal Parliament at Canberra, and I express my appreciation of his sen iocs in that regard: I hope that the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) for honouring his memory at Canberra will be adopted hy the Government. He carried out his public duties with energy and ability, and his memory deserves to he perpetuated. His work here is clone, but he will be remembered for it. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Lady Chapman the foregoing resolution, and a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. Houso adjourned at 3.59 p.m.",26
