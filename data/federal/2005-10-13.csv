1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 am and read prayers. NA WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Nelson, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to put beyond doubt the Commonwealth's power to make arrangements for the safe and secure management of the small quantity of radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies from the use of nuclear materials in medicine, research and industry. Radioactive waste management includes all of the activities that are involved in the handling, treatment, conditioning, transport, storage and disposal of radioactive waste. Successive Australian governments since the Hawke Labor government have endeavoured to make responsible arrangements for managing Australia's radioactive wastes. In doing so they have been defeated by the attitude of state and territory governments who fully agree with the need for such facilities providing they are ‘not in their backyard'. In an attempt to deal with such parochialism, an objective, scientifically based study to find a highly suitable site for a national low-level radioactive waste repository was initiated in July 1992 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. Simon Crean MP. After considerable effort and expense this process ended last year following action in the Federal Court by the Rann Labor government to oppose use of the selected site near Woomera in South Australia. In response to the intransigence of the South Australian government, the Prime Minister announced on 14 July 2004 that the national repository project would be abandoned and the Australian government would examine sites on Commonwealth land, both onshore and offshore, for a co-located facility for management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies. State and territory governments are now expected to make their own arrangements for managing radioactive wastes in their jurisdiction, in a manner consistent with Australia's international treaty obligations. In July 2005 I announced that, following a significant desktop examination of Commonwealth sites, including offshore territories, the Australian government will undertake detailed on-site investigations at three sites on Commonwealth owned land in the Northern Territory. Mr Snowdon-And not anywhere else. Why not?",19
3,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"The three sites include a site called Fishers Ridge, about 43 kilometres south-east of Katherine. Mr Snowdon-You are outrageous; this is disgusting.",19
4,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"The second site is near Harts Range, 100 kilometres directly northeast of Alice Springs. Mr Snowdon-You are outrageous.",19
5,The SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,Order! The member for Lingiari!,19
6,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"And the third site is Mount Everard, about 27 kilometres directly north-west of Alice Springs. These three sites are currently Department of Defence sites owned by the Commonwealth. Over the next year a detailed site selection process will be undertaken, with a range of studies being conducted to identify a preferred site or sites for detailed environmental impact assessment in accordance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Mr Snowdon-You're doing it because you can, not because it's responsible.",19
7,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"These studies will include assessment of site characteristics such as security, transport access and geological, floral, faunal and heritage aspects. Subject to environmental approval, the preferred site and related project proposals will then need to satisfy the licensing procedures for radioactive waste management facilities set out in the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act. Subject to these further regulatory approvals, it is envisaged that the facility will be constructed and become operational in 2011. Indeed, it must. While the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act provide authority to site, construct and operate the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Facility, legislation is required to reduce the potential for costly delays by putting these powers totally beyond doubt. Mr Snowdon-You don't care what the Northern Territory community say, do you?",20
8,The SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,Order! The member for Lingiari! Mr Snowdon-This is outrageous.,20
9,The SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,I warn the member for Lingiari! Mr Snowdon-He's outrageous.,20
10,The SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,The member for Lingiari will remove himself from the House understanding order 94(a). The member for Lingiari then left the chamber.,20
11,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Recent statements from the Northern Territory government that it will attempt to obstruct the project reinforce the need for this legislation in the interests of responsible management of Commonwealth radioactive waste. This is a national interest issue. Part 2 of the bill provides clear and express powers for the Commonwealth to proceed with activities necessary or incidental to further investigating the three sites the government has identified in the Northern Territory. This is necessary because the Territory government has introduced a specific law purporting to prohibit the Commonwealth from establishing a facility, which could include activities essential to the process of selecting a site for the establishment of a Commonwealth facility. Further, they have made it clear they will do everything possible to halt or frustrate the Commonwealth's actions. Because of these very real concerns about politically motivated obstruction of the Commonwealth's activities and the need to progress this important project, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 will not apply to the site investigation phase of the project. Part 3 of the bill provides that the responsible minister may declare one, or part of one, of the specified sites as the place where a facility may be established and operated, subject to the Commonwealth regulatory processes I have mentioned earlier. Part 3 also allows for an access route to be declared in order to provide for all-weather road access to the site. Part 3 of the bill also effects the acquisition or extinguishment of all interests, if any, which the Commonwealth does not already hold in the site selected for a facility. Part 5 of the bill, importantly, provides for affected parties, if there are any, to be compensated on just terms. A number of existing state and territory jurisdictions purport to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth's activities in establishing and operating a facility and/or transporting radioactive material to a facility. State and territory jurisdictions may introduce additional legislation purporting to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth in these activities. Notwithstanding any state or territory legislation, part 4 of the bill provides the Commonwealth with the express authority to do anything necessary or incidentally required to proceed with the establishment and operation of a Commonwealth facility at the selected site, and transport waste to the facility. To ensure there is no suggestion that the Commonwealth would seek to circumvent proper Commonwealth regulatory scrutiny, the bill explicitly provides that the processes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, must be complied with. In particular, the operation of the facility, including transport of radioactive waste, will proceed in accordance with licences issued by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, known as ARPANSA. The highest standards of safety will be applied to ensure that operation of the facility does not present a hazard to people or the environment in the Northern Territory or along interstate transport routes. Transport of radioactive material has an excellent safety record internationally and in Australia, with around 30,000 packages of radioactive material transported safely around the country each year. The government would have preferred to act with the cooperation of the states and territories, whose citizens receive direct and life-saving benefits from the Commonwealth's activities in this field. It ought to be remembered by the House that every Australian, every member of this parliament, will at least once throughout his or her lifetime benefit from a medical procedure with a radioisotope sourced from Lucas Heights and that waste needs to be securely and properly stored in the longer term. As a measure of this government's intentions we have offered to allow access to the new facility by the Northern Territory for management of its radioactive waste. The Northern Territory currently has 16 cubic metres of low-level radioactive waste at the Royal Darwin Hospital in the middle of Darwin, and also intermediate-level waste at Mount Todd in the vicinity of one of the proposed three sites. However, despite the lack of cooperation, the government will not shy away from doing what is required in the interests of all Australians. It is worth noting that the scientific basis for safely operating a facility such as the Commonwealth is proposing is well established and widely applied internationally. I have yet to hear a sensible, practical alternative from those opposed to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Facility. Those opposed to it might reflect on the fact that there are 124,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste stored in Champagne, one of the most beautiful areas of France and highly acclaimed internationally. It is extremely important that all Australians understand that we cannot expect to receive the benefits of nuclear sourced radioisotopes and then totally disregard or even actively oppose the need for facilities for the safe, long-term storage of low-level and intermediate level waste. On average, every single Australian will benefit at least once from a medical procedure to either diagnose or treat a cancer or other disease using a radio-pharmaceutical sourced from Australia's only nuclear reactor. Every year more than 400,000 Australians undergo medical procedures that use the isotopes produced by Australia's only nuclear reactor and save people's lives every day. There are also a host of applications of radioactive materials that we rely upon and indeed take for granted, in areas as diverse as sterilisation of bandages, syringes and women's hygiene products, minerals exploration-particularly in the Northern Territory-and processing, ensuring the safety of oil and gas pipelines and accurate filling of bottles and cans containing food and beverages. Every Australian, including Northern Territorians, benefits substantially from these initiatives. To ensure that these medical and industrial procedures and products are available in the future, we have a responsibility to provide the facilities needed for managing the small quantity of radioactive wastes that arise in their production and use. We are looking at 0.00002 per cent of the land mass of the Northern Territory on Commonwealth owned land. Passage of the bill is essential if Austrawealth's lians are to continue to realise the benefits of the wide range of uses of radioactive materials in our daily lives. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. It is in the interests of this country. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA WASTE MANAGEMENT (RELATED AMENDMENT) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Nelson, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
12,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (9.14 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends schedule 1 to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to include a reference to a decision to select a site for a Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility made by the responsible minister under section 7 of the proposed Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005. In introducing the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 I spoke about the importance of proceeding with the establishment of a safe and secure facility for the management of the Commonwealth's radioactive waste. It needs to be made absolutely clear. A number of existing state and territory jurisdictions have enacted legislation that purports to prohibit or regulate the Commonactivities in establishing and operating a radioactive waste management facility and/or transporting radioactive material to a facility. State and territory jurisdictions may introduce further legislation purporting to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth in these activities. Recent statements from the Northern Territory government that it will attempt to obstruct and delay the project reinforce the need for this bill to ensure the Commonwealth can act with certainty and without undue interference from vexatious and wilfully obstructive parties to responsibly manage Commonwealth radioactive waste. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2005",22
13,Mr HUNT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.16 am)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2005. The tariff proposal that I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, with effect from 11 May 2005. The proposal reduces the rate of customs duty from three per cent to zero for goods entered under item 47 to schedule 4 of the tariff. Item 47 applies to machinery that incorporates or is imported with other goods, which for technical reasons render the machinery ineligible for a tariff concession der. Item 47 allows such goods to be dutiable at the same rate of customs duty that would apply if the goods were subject to a tariff concession order. The lowering of the duty rate applying to goods entered under item 47 maintains consistency with the 2005-06 budget decision to remove the three per cent duty on business inputs that are subject to a tariff concession order. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2005) Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2005)",23
14,Mr HUNT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.18 am)-I move: Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2005). Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2005). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2005) and Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2005) formally place before parliament proposed decreases in the excise and customs duty rates applied to aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline. The current rate of aviation turbine fuel is $0.03151 per litre and the current rate of aviation gasoline is $0.03114 per litre. These rates comprise two elements. One element is provided to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the second element is used to fund the Location Specific Pricing Subsidy provided to Airservices Australia. The purpose of the location specific pricing subsidy was to limit the effect of location specific pricing at smaller airports where low traffic volume limits the ability to meet the orreal cost of air traffic control services. In the 2004-05 budget, the government announced that it would continue the location specific pricing subsidy until 30 June 2005 to enable Airservices Australia to move towards longer term pricing arrangements for providing terminal navigation services. The announcement also indicated that the location specific pricing subsidy would continue to be funded from revenue collected from excise and customs duty on aviation fuels up to 31 October 2005 to ensure full cost recovery. Consequently, the government is proposing to reduce the excise and customs duty rates applied to aviation gasoline and aviation turbine fuel, with effect from 1 November 2005. The excise and customs duty rates on aviation gasoline are proposed to fall by $0.0026 per litre, and the excise and customs duty rates on aviation turbine fuel are proposed to fall by $0.00297 per litre. As a result, the excise and customs duty rates on both fuels are proposed to be equalised at $0.02854 per litre. A summary of the alterations contained in these proposals has been prepared and is being circulated. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 4) BILL 2005 Cognate bill: NA NA BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 October, on motion by Dr Nelson: That this bill be now read a second time.",23
15,Mr HAYES,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (9.21 am)Before the interruption of yesterday's debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, I was speaking about two young women who represented New South Wales at the recent international university games, they being Belinda Battistel and Ali Hudson. This was the first team that Australia had sent to the games in almost 20 years. If the Minister for Education, Science and Training continues with his destructive approach to VSU legislation, this could well have been our last effort at the international university games. Recently two young female hockey players were photographed near the minister, holding signs indicating that their sporting teams would no longer be able to compete because of the minister's issues about VSU. I think that was pretty widely circulated via email communications. I am quite certain that the skills of our young basketballers, like Belinda Battistel and Ali Hudson, will suffer the same fate. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate both Belinda and Ali on their successes and I would like to assure them that federal Labor will continue to fight for their right to participate in sporting events like the university games into the future. We will strongly oppose the introduction of VSU. I am proud to stand in this place today and support the continued existence of student services, particularly the student services provided by the University of Western Sydney through its student association. As the member for Chifley said yesterday, Western Sydney Labor MPs are very proud of the university and very proud of the level of services that it provides. It goes without saying that we are very proud of the students that we produce through the University of Western Sydney. I hope that the member for Macarthur, in whose electorate the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney resides, can tear himself away from toeing the party line long enough to come out in support of the university and its campus in his electorate. I hope that he is willing to stand up to his minister and say no to VSU. I know that local students in south-west Sydney do not want VSU and I am sure that, like me, the member for Macarthur has received many approaches from students in the electorate, and probably from the student association itself, to discuss their concerns over VSU. If the member for Macarthur votes in support of VSU, I hope that he will at least be willing to meet with the representatives of the students association and tell them why VSU will be better for them and why it will be better for students studying at the Campbelltown campus. The minister has failed to convince the party room of the merits of VSU and he has failed to convince the public. Delaying this bill is not going to fix it and it is not going to make the issues go away. Despite the minister's best efforts to defend the decision in question time, we all know-and the public knows-that the VSU legislation cannot be passed, because it is lousy legislation and it is very poor public policy. No matter how long the minister decides to delay, the VSU legislation will not be passed. According to the minister, VSU legislation is off the agenda until 2007. Waiting until 2007 is not going to change the fact that it is bad policy. The attack on universities in the outer metropolitan and regional universities like the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney-is now delayed, but I call on the minister to go further and abandon the legislation completely. I call on members opposite who claim to have a commitment to higher education, and who are more than willing to visit university campuses in their electorates for photo opportunities, to support Labor's amendment. Do not dodge the issue; throw the legislation out and keep it out. Do not come into this place and vote down Labor's amendment to support services to local students and follow it up by voting in support of changing conditions for charging international students for those very same services. At least members opposite should have the courage to vote consistently. There are some members opposite who have privately expressed concerns about the VSU legislation to the minister. That must be the case. It cannot just be those coalition senators. There must be concerns about this. I encourage those members to use their vote later today to express those private concerns in a very public manner and have their vote recorded as supporting services for all students, not just international students. They should vote for a rational approach to the provision of student services for all students, not just selected ones. I call on the government to drop the VSU legislation. If they did that, they would not even have to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. I know that many international students need these services, and I support their provision. In addition to the normal trials and tribulations of students during their time at university, international students have the added challenge of living in another country far away from their personal support network. They should have appropriate support services in place. That is not contested. I cannot help but wonder why, areas- if these services are so valuable and important to international students, we would consider them to be any less valued and less important to local students. I also have to wonder why the minister believes that such services will be able to adequately operate for international students after the infrastructure and networks that have been established for local students are torn down. Any business operator will tell you that if you have something up and running for one group of customers there are economies of scale to be achieved by using the same set-up to service a new set of customers. Today is a victory for all those student groups that have actively campaigned against VSU. It is a victory for the student organisations, regional communities, university staff, vicechancellors, campus activists and sporting organisations, and for all the other people who lent their support to the anti-VSU campaign. It is certainly a victory for the estimated 4,200 people employed by service providers at Australian universities who were set up, quite frankly, to lose their jobs as a result of VSU. But let's have a full victory. Let's do away with the prospect of VSU once and for all. I would like nothing more than for the minister to come into the chamber today and announce the removal of the VSU legislation. The minister should admit that he has been defeated and stop clinging to the faint hope that, if he delays the passage of the legislation until 2007, those much needed extra votes might suddenly emerge. I will not be opposing the legislation before us today, because I believe that it is important that all students be given the same opportunity to maintain the support services provided by student organisations. I will be supporting Labor's second reading amendment calling on the government to withdraw the VSU bill, and I encourage all members opposite to do the same.",24
16,Mr ALBANESE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Grayndler) (9.31 am)I rise today to speak in opposition to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, and I speak in favour of the second reading amendment to be moved by the member for Jagajaga which will call for the withdrawal of the voluntary student unionism bill. As we saw yesterday, the Minister for Education, Science and Training was forced to delay his extreme attack on student services. The minister's boyhood dream appears to have been shattered by Senator Barnaby Joyce. It appears that Backflip Barnaby has found his footing just in time. The delay to this legislation enormous victory for students on university campuses around this country. It is a victory for student organisations, regional communities, sporting groups and the arts community. These are groups in our community who vehemently oppose this legislation because they know what the VSU bill would do and how much damage it would inflict on student services and student life around this country. The minister should listen to his parliamentary colleagues and drop this bill altogether. A delay will not change their minds, nor will it change the minds of those groups and communities that have fought so hard against it. Indeed, the National Union of Students and student organisations around the country have vowed to continue the campaign against this legislation until it is off the minister's agenda forever. It is time that the minister listened to reason rather than pandering to fringe elements and extreme voices in his own party. The VSU legislation is motivated entirely by conservative political ideology. As the Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed out recently, instead of real reform and support for the higher education sector Minister Brendan Nelson has offered only his own ideological indulgences. The government continues to paint itself as a reasonable reformer. It continues to assert that this debate is a matter of black and white and that the abolition of universal student unionism will be a simple matter of changing only a student's enrolment options. By clouding the debate in its favourite rhetoric of ‘choice', the government hopes to disguise the real outcome of the introduction of VSU. It is deeply misleading to assert that this legislation will not abolish student organisations. Funds will not miraculously appear to replace student contributions nor will private enterprise suddenly jump into fill the is an voids left by defunct catering outlets and other services, including in child care, run by student organisations. Universities will not be able step in and fill the $161 million nationwide black hole that would be created by this legislation, given the government's cuts to university funding in general. In reality VSU means the closure of thousands of essential services. It will take choices away from Australian students. The arguments for VSU are spurious. The debate surrounding this issue has been shallow, slogan ridden and full of misconstrued facts. The government is muddying the waters of truth by asserting that it is this bill that ensure freedom of association, when the vast majority of campuses already have opt-out or conscientious objection clauses. Membership is only available to those who have been accepted to study in a higher education institution and, most importantly, students are made fully aware of student union fees prior to their enrolment. No breach of freedom of association occurs-a fact reinforced through judgments made by both the Victorian and South Australian Supreme Courts in 1999. The government is ignoring these facts. It is an arrogant government set on using its newly acquired Senate majority to implement a policy that not only has been opposed time and time again by the Senate but also proved disastrous when it was introduced at the state level. Both at home and abroad there are clear examples of the failure of VSU, the subsequent reduction in student services and the inevitable closure of student organisations. In 1994 the Victorian state government's Tertiary Education Amendment Act 1994 prohibited universities from collecting fees from students on condition of enrolment but allowed institutions to voluntarily collect amenities and services fees. In 1994 the WA state government introduced the Voluntary Membership of Student Guilds and Associations Act, which prohibited universities from making student association membership a condition of enrolment and from imposing fees that were not directly related to their curriculum. In 1999 the Howard government tried to introduce the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill through the then education minister, the Hon. David Kemp. This was overwhelmingly opposed by the Senate and the Australian community. The experience in Western Australia illustrates the disastrous effects of VSU. By will 1999, the membership take-up rate by students was as low as six per cent on some campuses. The student guild at Edith Cowan University was forced into voluntary liquidation the same year. Even WA's sandstone university, the University of Western Australia, was forced to slash its clubs and societies program, and the disabled student department was closed. Let us not pretend that VSU does not mean the death of student organisations. New Zealand is the only other country in the world to allow VSU, legislating for universities to hold individual referendums in 1999. Only two campuses voted for a voluntary system. The University of Waikato reverted to universal membership a year later, citing a decline in student services and representation. The University of Auckland still charges a fee for student services which are now provided by the university. If the government's argument of choice was anything other than shallow rhetoric, this legislation would implement campus referendums like those used in New Zealand. This would be a real choice for students. Instead, choice is only a slogan bandied around by the education minister to justify the closure of student organisations and to silence dissent. Unlike the education minister, our international competitors recognise the value of universal membership of student organisations. Across England, Europe and, yes, North America, the universal levying of fees for student services and representation is the norm; it is a given. In the United Kingdom, membership of student unions is a condition of enrolment. Even the Thatcher government, while urged to take action to stop compulsory student union membership, rightly decided against it. America's most prestigious institution, Harvard University, charges $US1,900 in an annual universal student levy. This fee does not include residential or health costs but goes in its entirety towards the provision of student services and representation. This kind of a fee is far from the $100 to $500 fees charged by Australian student organisations. If the education minister really wants our universities to be amongst the top 20 in the world, alongside the likes of Harvard, Oxford and Yale, then examining the student structures that these institutions protect and foster would be a valuable exercise. If our institutions are to continue to compete on an international stage, let alone rise to be amongst the top 20, then Australian students must not be denied the provision of similar welfare, study support, campus experience and personal development opportunities as enjoyed by students studying overseas. The international reputation and competitiveness of our universities will suffer under the restrictions of VSU. It will act as a barrier in the free trade of higher education. In 2003 international students contributed approximately $1.7 billion to higher education institutions in tuition fees, an amount which adds up to 13.8 per cent of total revenue. Recently, concerns have been aired regarding the stalling of the international student market. While there are a number of contributing factors to this potential downturn, the introduction of voluntary student unionism will leave our institutions out in the cold. Australian universities market themselves internationally on the extracurricular opportunities available to students. Especially considering the emerging competitiveness of our neighbouring Chinese universities, with robust and vibrant campus cultures, international students will choose to stay within their region, or opt for an American or European institution, rather than bringing their scholarship and tuition fees to our shores. This is not a debate about students being compelled to join trade unions. Student unions are not industrial unions; they are organisations that provide services and representation for a direct constituency. They do not work against or seek to undermine universities. Rather, they play a vital role in assisting universities to achieve their goal of providing a quality educational experience to all students. A far better analogy is likening student unions to local councils. Just as members of a local government area must pay fees for local services in the form of rates, members of a university community have a responsibility to pay for university services. While not every local resident may use the local library, child-care centre or park, it is compulsory that every resident pays, because unless that occurred the services simply would not exist. If given the choice, most residents of course would choose not to pay. However, the result would be no garbage collection, no child-care centre, no public library, no community functions, no swimming pools, no community programs and no support for residents, particularly the elderly. The same can be said of university campuses. Student unions can provide subsidised services. Unlike a private enterprise, the union's aim is not to derive profit from provision. Similar to tax, services can be provided to students on a needs and costs price basis. As a member of a local community, we contribute rates. As a member of society, we pay taxes. As a member of a university community, students pay fees. The principles and outcomes are the same: a viable and fully-functioning community which looks after the interests of all. Critics of student union services argue that students should have the option to pay for what they use and not pay for services that they do not. However, without universal membership students would not have the option of choosing different services because they simply would not be there. The government assumes that student services will be replaced. That simply would not be true for many campuses under VSU, particularly those in regional areas. Most students are only on campus approximately 30 weeks of the year. There is no rule against MCDonald's or some other institution or corporation setting up shop at the University of Sydney. They do not do it because it is not financially viable for them to do it-to have, for 20 weeks of the year, essentially no custom. Things are much, much worse for Australia's isolated campuses. Amber Jacobus, President of the University of Western Sydney Students Association, comments that vending machines would probably replace food outlets and says: Why would you come out to US, where there is no food on campus and no buses? That's sort of degrading ... we already suffer that stigma of coming from the west. VSU will further divide the haveand have not campuses. While the sandstone and Group of Eight universities will be able to attract some private enterprise, campuses like US will suffer. The introduction of VSU will only further the education minister's agenda of creating a two-tiered higher education system in this country. The minister is intent on driving a wedge between the rich city campuses and those struggling in isolated areas. In rural and regional areas young people often have little access to cultural and social opportunities. Student organisations currently fill the gap. At Monash University's Gippsland campus the student union contributes funds to run the local leisure centre. At the University of New England the students association is the sole administrator of the student employment database and works with the local community to find jobs for students. The UNE students union partly funded the town's local cinema and runs a 24-hour radio station-one of the oldest regional community radio stations in Australia. Across this country student organisations often provide the only forms of these types of services in these rural and regional communities. The education minister continues to make the suggestion that student organisations are run by left-wing radical students who are misappropriating the funds of their peers. This is simply not true. Student organisations are democratic organisations. As with all democratic organisations, all members have a right to vote for their leaders and they have voted for leaders in the past, such as Joe Hockey, Peter Costello and Tony Abbott. If they do not like what their leaders say, they can vote them out and run for the position themselves. The democratic process occurs annually on university campuses right around this country. Universal student union membership fees ensure that all students are represented and that they are provided with relevant campus services. Like them or hate them, student organisations have been at the forefront of vital campaigns for decades. Students have been trailblazers in successfully campaigning for real change on issues. The Vietnam War is a perfect example of this, where students played a key role in facilitating action against that war. Students have also been at the forefront of the massive public movement against the war in Iraq. More recently, students have campaigned against this government's attacks on higher education that saw a 25 per cent increase in HECS and an increase in the number of domestic undergraduate full fee paying places to 35 per cent for government funded courses. Whether or not you agree with that, the point is that dissent is a vital part of our civil society. It is vital that students have a right to have an organisation which expresses their views. On a number of views, which everyone agrees with such as the opposition to apartheid in South Africa, students played a critical role. No-one defends it now, but there was opposition from the current Prime Minister to sanctions opposing apartheid in South Africa. Thank goodness for the student movement. The introduction of VSU would mean that there is no official body for students to participate in higher education policy. NUS continues to be the most effective representative lobby group for students and young people. The government has already got rid of the Australian Youth Policy Action Coalition and replaced it with the Prime Minister's handpicked National Youth Roundtable-and as time goes on we hear less and less from that. This government has also slashed funding for environment and heritage groups in my portfolio throughout Australia, threatening to also remove their tax deductible status if they make any political statements. This is a government obsessed with silencing activity by community organisations. Student organisations are not replaceable. Just on the border of my electorate sits the University of Sydney. There are many student organisations within Sydney university: the SRC, of which I was a member; the union; Sydney Uni Sport; and the Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association. All of these organisations contribute to a vibrant and robust campus culture. These organisations provide opportunities for students to get involved in activities outside of the classroom, whether that be sport, clubs and societies or student politics. Through involvement in these extracurricular activities, students make friends, have relationships and develop themselves as human beings as well as having fun from time to time on the sports field. They develop skills such as preparing a budget for the film society, running a membership drive for the Christian club or arguing with the world's brightest students through being involved in a global intervarsity debating tournament. These are skills in running and promoting organisations, in motivating people and in solving problems. They are skills demanded by Australian employers. They are skills which provide social capital and a benefit to the Australian community as a whole. It has been said that, to develop these skills and retain a vibrant campus culture, only sport and social societies need be retained on campuses. However, the ViceChancellor of the University of Sydney has acknowledged the importance of a full range of activities. Professor Gavin Brown has said: I seriously believe that experience in student politics or in the SRC ... is enormously valuable both to the individuals who participate in it and ultimately to the country ... you should provide students with the opportunity to be engaged in serious political involvement while they are students, because that is ultimately to the net benefit of society. The University of Sydney's SRC has many advocate services such as help with Youth Allowance and Centrelink, legal matters, tax advice, harassment issue, academic issues, problems with university administration and tenancy advice. No other body within the university could provide these services to people, many of whom come from a disadvantaged background. How can a student be represented by simply an advocate whose employment is dependent upon the institution to which they are appealing? It is important that these organisations exist. In summary, voluntary student unionism will mean the death of student organisations. It will not increase choice; it will take choice away. Students will be denied the choice to purchase subsidised food for their lunch. They will be denied the choice to put their child in child care whilst they attend class. They will be denied the choice to develop the essential skills that employers demand. They will be denied the choice to stand up and collectively oppose attacks on their own education and attacks on the education of their children. That is what this debate is about. When prominent individuals like John Coates and Kevan Gosper, of the AOC; Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush; David Clarke, the Executive Chairman of Macquarie Bank; and David Gallop of the NRL argued the case for student organisations, the minister would not listen. Now we have members of the coalition arguing the case. What the minister should do is stand with the community at large, say no to VSU and withdraw this legislation.",26
17,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The speech of the member for Grayndler was very well reasoned. It outlined, in a reasonable way, why the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and, indeed, the VSU bill cannot be accepted. But, of course, reason is not the basis for the government's decision to introduce the bill under debate and the VSU bill into the House. It strikes me that this bill shows a level of hypocrisy by the government in how it deals with overseas students on the one hand and Australian students on the other. Through this bill the government is seeking to continue with compulsory student service fees for overseas students while in its VSU bill it wants to prohibit them for Australian students. Why is there one law for foreign students and another law for Australian students? The reason is that the government seeks to silence dissent and to attack those that it perceives to be its opposition. attacking what it perceives as political organisations, the government is willingly allowing all Australian students to lose essential services. This is a spiteful indulgence by the government. This bill and the VSU bill are unnecessary and a waste of the parliament's time. If the Minister for Education, Science and Training wanted to focus on things that matter in his portfolio, he would be looking at the shortage of places in our TAFEs and universities. He would be seeking to ensure that our education system is the best in the world. He would be focusing on ways to improve our current education system. Instead we see this spiteful, wanton behaviour by a government that is out of touch and has no regard for anyone who chooses to disagree with it on any particular matter. The member for Grayndler was right: there are organisations that have been systematically confronted by this government and punished for contradicting the government's view on certain matters. I had the good fortune to go to Monash University. For some of the time. I was involved in my student union. I was also involved in sporting associations, debating clubs and the ALP club, of which I was happy to be president for some time. I remember that most students did not involve themselves actively, or at least on a weekly basis, in student politics. I can certainly understand that; there are so many other things to be doing and constraints on people's time. Many students have to make a living so they can afford their education and there are so many other pursuits that you can undertake at university. But I was involved and, indeed, the Treasurer, who went to Monash University, while not in the ALP club, was in the Labour Club, as I understand it. He was very active; in fact he became the chairperson-I In think it was called-of MAS, the Monash Association of Students. The Treasurer sought to be an office bearer of the student union and associated with a political organisation called the Labour Club. I want to tell the Treasurer this: introducing a bill that would remove the capacity for campuses to provide services to their students will not change the fact that he played a role in the Labour Club and was the chairperson-that is, the equivalent of president-of the student union at Monash. It seems like this is a 20-year payback by the Treasurer. The bizarre thing about it is that this student at Monash, who sought the highest office you could reach in the union, at the time did not advocate voluntary student unionism or that fees should be paid on a voluntary basis and was happy to have his university degree paid for and to be the chairperson of the student union. It is quite hypocritical of the Treasurer and other members of government who had active political roles on their campuses to later remove that capacity for students of today. As I said, a small minority decide to involve themselves in the specifically politically active areas of student unions. Indeed, the money afforded to that activity is negligible when you look at the budget of student unions and what they are expended upon. The overwhelming proportion of the budget expended on campuses across the country is used for services such as housing and accommodation, child-care, transport and employment assistance-vital services that enable those students who need assistance to be given it. This is where you see the government, as I said, being indulgent in wanting to fight old fights and where it is being wasteful by not focusing on the things that matter in education. I understand that the minister for education probably has some proving to do of himself-that he indeed has the politics of the government side. Here is a man who boasted that he never voted for the Liberal Party. Here is the minister for education who boasted that he always voted Labor and that he was a member of the ALP. He used to wear an earring as well. Last term he wore an earring, but he has since got rid of it. That is fair enough. He also got rid of his ALP membership, but that clearly is not enough. What the minister for education has to prove to the hard Right on the other side of the chamber is that he is willing to indulge in ideological battles at student campuses. So here we are, in the most important chamber in the land, having to debate matters about student politics. This is the Commonwealth of Australia's pre-eminent chamber, and we are having to consider legislation that is about fighting student politicians. As we know, this is motivated by revenge on the part of some on the other side. The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005-which is contradictory to the VSU bill-is a case of the minister proving himself worthy of being a Liberal Party minister because of his history. We have seen it with all the legislation that he has introduced since he has been the education minister. We saw it first with the universities and the TAFEs being punished-that is, deprived of Commonwealth expenditure-if they did not introduce Australian workplace agreements at each TAFE and university. Mr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Just to help the member for Gorton, who is obviously short on content, could the member, instead of wandering aimlessly from earring fashions through to personal assassinations of the education minister, bring himself back to the business of the bill. I think the House would appreciate it. Mr Edwards- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: I have listened intently to the member for Gorton. This is a cognate debate. He is speaking to the bill and, in my view, speaking very deliberately to the bill and in a very professional and decent manner-although it might be getting up the minister's nose.",31
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I remind the honourable member for Cowan that decency is not the only requirement. I am sure that the member for Gorton understands the requirement to be relevant to the legislation before the House and recognises that the various chairs during this debate have allowed discussion about a proposed second reading amendment.,33
19,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I thank the member for Cowan for defending my contribution to date.,33
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I remind the honourable member for Gorton that it was not a defence; it was on the point of order.,33
21,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I agree with the member for Cowan's point of order, but I am not surprised that the minister at table felt the need to stand up and defend the minister for education-he needs a lot of defending. There is no doubt that the minister for education needs a lot of defending because of the way in which he has decided to introduce the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. It clearly shows a contradictory approach by the minister and the government by allowing, on the one hand, voluntary fees to be applied to Australian students should the VSU bill be passed and, on the other hand, incorporating compulsory fees for overseas students in the bill before us. The minister at the table has been out to my electorate, and I am still waiting for the much promised Sunshine college. I attended the meeting that the minister convened and, in good faith, I listened to him about this proposed college. There are many young people in desperate need of training in my electorate. When the government said before the election that they would build the Sunshine college, these young people believed that that college would be built, starting next year. But there has been no news from the government and the minister at the table about it-and it is the minister's responsibility. Returning to the bill before us, I want to draw a comparison between it and the fact that the government has chosen to contradict the policy it outlined in the VSU bill. I understand that the minister for education has to prove his worth, given his history of association with Labor. I am even considering the notion that the Treasurer has to support the expunging of student unions because of his former association with the labour club at Monash University. I understand that this might be some sort of ritual passage, some sort of initiation process, that the minister for education has to go through in order to fulfil his obligations to the Liberal Party. Essenthe tially, the government are not focusing on those things that matter to the bulk of the student population; instead, they are choosing to punish those people whom they see as being in disagreement with them. I understand why the VSU bill has not been enacted and certainly not been passed in the chambers to date. One of the reasons why the minister has had to delay the voluntary student unionism bill and, instead, this week introduce the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 is that the National Party have grave concerns that the bill is very unpopular in their electorates. The Nationals understand that the student union fee is required for fundamental services that students need in their everyday lives. The Nationals are not caught up in some sort of AUS or NUS war-some sort of student political battleground that the member for Indi, the Treasurer, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Education, Science and Training seem to be indulging in. The Nationals-including Senator Joyce-understand that, if you go to the campuses in regional Australia, those services that are provided to students are necessary and essential. That is what worried me yesterday when I heard the member for Bass say in this place that child care is not an sential service. I read the Hansard because I think there was some attempt to suggest that he said otherwise. The member for Bass was actually arguing that nothing incorporated in the student amenities was essential. He was asked whether child care was essential and he said that it was not. Most of the Nationals in this chamber know that services like that are essential. I was very disturbed and surprised that the member for Bass-someone who represents Launceston, a great part of northern Tasmania and a fantastic part of this country-said in this place that child care is not essential. It may not be essential to him, but he has to think outside of his own circumstance and understand how important child care is for many parents who are trying to earn a living or indeed seeking to improve themselves through education. The fact that he does not have the wit to understand the importance of child care as a service at a campus level is an indication of the government's ignorance or contempt of students in need of services. Some people may have the private means to study without a great deal of support. Some students are parents-in some circumstances possibly single parents-looking after their kids, trying to better themselves, trying to acquire a more formal education so that they can find a suitable job, and it is very unfortunate indeed that the member for Bass thinks that that type of service which assists students is not essential. But it is indicative of the government's lack of regard for students and their basic needs. It is indicative that the government is so obsessed about silencing dissent-that is, attacking so called student politicians-that it is very happy to throw out all other services that are required for all students. I should not be surprised, but I am very disappointed that the member for Bass has es- that view. I would be very disappointed if that view that child care is not essential is shared by other government members. I can assure you that that is not the view on this side of the chamber. Labor believe that students deserve decent services. We believe that there is nothing wrong in allowing for a fee that would ensure that that assistance is available for people who require it, whether it be housing assistance, employment assistance, transport assistance or, indeed, childcare assistance. The fact that the government is quite happy to throw all of that out in its spiteful indulgence in attacking what it sees as its enemy shows how little this government is concerned about education and how it is more interested in having old fights with student politicians.",33
22,Mr SNOWDON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to make a contribution to this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. I make a couple of observations about the ESOS bill. Sections of the ESOS Bill will allow a university to charge fees to international students for services such as counselling and advocacy support services, which the VSU bill would deny local students. I am reminded of the second reading amendment that the shadow spokesperson on education, Ms Macklin, will be moving: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) in light of the contradiction between the ESOS bill and the VSU bill, and the Minister's humiliating backdown on introducing VSU for the 2006 academic year, condemns the Government; and (2) believes that the government must now withdraw its VSU bill, and avoid the inconsistency in making student services fees compulsory for overseas students at Australian universities while trying to ban fees being charged to Australian students”. We can see the hypocrisy. On the one hand, the minister is enshrining in legislation the right of universities to charge a fee for services for overseas students while, on the other hand, through the so-called voluntary student unionism legislation, the minister wants to outlaw universities charging Australian students a fee for exactly the same purpose. What do we call that? Trying to walk both sides of the street, or do we call it as is-an absolute act of hypocrisy? The government knows that if Australian universities are to be taken seriously as academic institutions overseas, they cannot be seen to be stripped of their vibrant campus life and support services for students. This is yet more proof that the proposed legislation has everything to do with ideology and bashing political opposition to the government and nothing to do with choice for students. Although the education minister has backed down, I note that there is a report in the Australian Financial Review this morning, headed ‘Howard to press on with university reform', in which the Prime Minister is reported to have said: I would expect the VSU [voluntary student ism] legislation would be introduced this year; that's always been the government's intention. They have a minor problem, of courseMs Macklin-The numbers.",34
23,Mr SNOWDON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"that is, they do not yet have the numbers. We have seen only this week Senator Barnaby Joyce demonstrating on at least one occasion that he is prepared to stand up to the bullying of the government, so they cannot be certain that they have the support of Senator Barnaby Joyce-and I do not think they can be certain that they have the support of the National Party generally. They certainly do not have the support of the vice-chancellors of Australia's universities, the student bodies of Australia's universities, the academic bodies of Australia's universities and, dare I say it, the wider Australian community. It is important to understand that what we see here is the government taking a backwards step because someone in a position of influence and power-that is, someone with a vote in the Senate-has dared to front it. The government won the last election so it handsomely that it got control of the Senate. One would have thought the government would have chosen to use that power responsibly, but it is very clear now that this government has chosen to abuse process and to abuse the power it has in this place by introducing legislation such as the VSU legislation. This legislation does not have community support, the support of the academic community generally or the support of the leadership of the universities, yet the government intends to impose upon the Australian community its ideological fixation with the abolition of student unions, ignoring the wonderful work carried out by these organisations in the universities. Somehow, by parading around the country because you are part of a student body, you unionare ipso facto an activist-someone who might go out and put their hand up to oppose the government's decisions. What a hide! The hide of university students actually expressing a view and walking in the streets and demonstrating their opinion! I am a child of the sixties and I am very pleased that I am, because I was able to participate in and observe the demonstrations, led from the university campuses, about Australia's involvement in Vietnam. Imagine if this government had been in power then! What would they have been doing to those students? All sorts of things, one would imagine, but they would certainly not have been allowing them the freedom to demonstrate their views, to organise collectively and to use the resources they had available to them to express their views publicly and to try and influence public opinion. That is very important. I think we need to appreciate the importance of the student bodies in universities, historically and worldwide, for their ability to hold governments to account and raise issues of importance to the Australian community and the world community. This government says, ‘Because they might do that, and because we might have a few activists on the campuses who might be taking leadership positions against us, we will ban them-get rid of them-and abolish university union fees, and students will no longer be required to affiliate with these organisations.' Never mind the fact that the quantum of money spent by these organisations on political activities is infinitesimally small in comparison to what they spend on the sports facilities they administer and fund and the cultural activities and welfare services that they administer and fund. We have heard from the member for Gorton that he reviewed yesterday's Hansard and learned that the member for Bass said in this place yesterday that child care is not an essential service. Tell that to the single ents who are university students and require child care. Tell that to the young couples who have children and might be students. We were not all born with a silver spoon in our mouths. Some of us have been workers. Some of us understand the need to put ourselves through universities-as we have done-and to fund our own living expensesMr Farmer-Or TAFE.",35
24,Mr SNOWDON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Or TAFE, in your case, comrade. I am pleased to see that you have been to one. The arrogance of this government knows no bounds. That is demonstrated by the view now expressed by the government that they can do anything at any time in this place. We have seen again this morning how the government abuse their power in this place. The VSU legislation is but one example. We had another example this morning with the introduction of the nuclear waste management legislation in this place, which completely ignores the views and concerns of the community of the Northern Territory. But because they can do it they will. Because they believe they can get it through the House of Representatives and the Senate, they will. No matter how extreme it might be, they will do it. We see it again in the emerging and current debate on industrial relations. We know where this is coming from. We are in a time warp. We have been taken back to the sixties by the Prime Minister and this government, because these are the views he expressed when he first came into this parliament. We see that ideology riven throughout the minds of the government members, but I am sure it is not in their hearts. I cannot believe for one moment that all of the people on the government benches support the propositions about the abolition of student unions. I cannot believe it; I do not believe par- it-because we all know they do not. Ordinarily, they are gutless but, thankfully, there was a glimmer of hope this week when one National Party senator from Queensland voted with the opposition. So maybe, instead of lying supine at the feet of the Prime Minister, some of them will get a bit of steel in their backbone and stand up to him instead. If they are prepared to do that, we might see a viable debate in this place and see people really value the notion of democracy: that we can have alternative views properly debated both in the party room and the chamber, instead of having people trodden on and belted. You can just imagine what has happened to Barnaby Joyce this week-and we hear that Minister Vaile is coming back from overseas on Friday. It is reported in the Australian Financial Review this morning that he says he is going to talk to him-that is, Barnaby. Well, what sort of counselling session do you think that might be? Barnaby, my friend, you just keep going on as you are. Do not be counselled by these people. You stand up for what you think is right. I know for certain that, in the case of the concerns that I have about the way in which this government operates in the Northern Territory, those people from the Country Liberal Party who sit on the government benches here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate-the member for Solomon and Senator Scullion-will not stand up for the Northern Territory like Barnaby Joyce has stood up for his consistency. They will not stand up for the students at Charles Darwin University. What do you think is going to happen to a place like Charles Darwin University? Of the 1,100 units offered previously by the university, 340 units have been cut this year. In ice Springs, in the business school nine courses are advertised this year. In the past those nine courses have had lecturers in front of students in classrooms. Of those nine courses, only two courses will have lecturers in classrooms. The other people will be expected to do their courses online. Given that sort of environment and knowing it has lost millions of dollars as a result of decisions deliberately taken by this government, what capacity has Charles Darwin University got to augment or supplement or act in lieu of the work which is currently being done by the student union as a result of the fees which are paid to it by its students? We know the answer to that is very simple. If it has already cut courses because it cannot fund the university properly because of decisions taken by this government, what hope has it got of maintaining the services which are currently provided by the student union? We know the answer to that, don't we? This is a small university in the Northern Territory and this government-it is an absolute joke-on every occasion that it possibly could, has shown its absolute contempt for the people of the Northern Territory and the services that they have access to-utter contempt. As I said this morning, we saw it again with the introduction of nuclear waste dump legislation-absolute contempt for the people of the Northern Territory. Here we see it again with this VSU legislation. We see their short-sighted fixation on getting their ideological fix. We should not ignore the fact that there are some fundamental issues here. The universities do not support the government. The student bodies do not support the government. The academics do not support the government. The bulk of students would be most concerned about their inability to access services in the future. When I spoke in a previous debate on this subject, I quoted from a piece by Kent Rowe, who was presiAldent of the Charles Darwin University Students Union. I will do that again: But sausage rolls are not the issue. Since the 1996 election the Howard government has removed $6 million a year in recurrent funding from our CDU alone, or around $40 million to date. Last year his government introduced HECS changes which included a 25% rise in HECS fees, and also opened the door for “buy your future” $200,000 degrees. Students also enjoy GST on text books and increasing student to staff ratios. As I have said as an addendum, they now have the indignity of seeing units slashed because of the university's inability to resource them. He goes on: None of these policies have been good for students and, in pursuing its role of standing up for the best interests of students, the Students' has rightly criticised the Government for them. The Howard Government irritated by informed, organized criticism of his anti-student policies Students' Organisations, so now he wants to shut us up. The legislation his government introduced in Parliament today is designed to do just that. What kind of Government bans students from making organised political comment? Let us think about this. What kind of government seeks to ban students from making organised political comment? Let us have three examples. He gives the Suharto government in Indonesia in 1978, Deng Xiaoping in China 1989-and we all recall the infamous Tiananmen Square massacres-with the other being John Howard in Australia in 2005. What shame! What shame this Prime Minister is bringing on us as a nation! These extreme steps are not based on any rationale which can be reasonably adduced as coming from discussion, conversation, consensus or even good debate but they come from his own ideological fixation on what he believes. The Australian community should not have to stand for this. Certainly Australian students should not have to stand for it. We need to comprehend that, if these changes are to proceed, in the case of the Northern Territory, without a shadow of a doubt we will see the student services which are currently provided by the university through the student union all but disappear. Forget about the student political activity; just think about their access to the welfare services, the childcare services, the cultural activities that they participate in and the sports activities which they are responsible for running and administering. Is that not shameful? We now have a piece of legislation which shows the hypocrisy of the government. It is now proposing, through the ESOS bill, that we allow people to charge fees for students from overseas. What does that tell you? I am embarrassed at times to stand in this Union place and observe and debate the government because of what it is doing. I have been in this place a long time and I have to say by that, even in their most strident days, the Hawke and Keating governments never abused their position and power in the way in which this government is doing. We are seeing a succession of decisions taken by this government, a succession of legislation being passed through this parliament which is aimed at denying access to services, such as this, or imposing the government's will on communities that do not want that will imposed upon them, such as the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005, which was introduced in this place this morning. We are seeing it time and time again, and it is shameful. I am concerned about it. I am concerned about the state of our democracy when the government can choose to abuse its power the way it has. But, as I said earlier, there is a ray of hope, a light which sparkles at the moment. Let us see if it continues to do so. There is at least one coalition member in the Senate-and we know that there is a coalition member in this place who stood up to the government on Telstra-who has at least this week been prepared to stand up to the government. Let us hope it continues. (Time expired)",36
25,Mr FARMER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (10.32 am)-Before I begin summing up the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and cognate bill, I would like to set the record straight in relation to some funding that is provided by the Australian government for our universities and for higher education. If you listen to members of the opposition, you would think that there had been a significant amount of money taken away from our universities and higher education sector. In fact, it is quite the opposite. will be, and there has been as a result of the work of the Minister for Education, Science and Training and his reforms to the higher education sector, an extra $11 billion of new money that will be injected into the higher education sector over the next 10 years. In summing up, I would like to thank all of those who spoke on the bill est in this significant development in higher education in Australia. The Australian government is committed to developing a strong, high-quality higher education sector which not only underpins our economic, cultural and social development but also competes with the best on the international level. Higher education is increasingly being delivered in a global context. Just as Australian universities are establishing branches, campuses and alliances in other countries, foreign universities are similarly looking to expand their operations into Australia. The changes proposed by these bills to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 provide a framework for the higher education sector in Australia that will ensure the sector's international competitiveness. The amendments will enable higher quality foreign universities which want to offer courses to Australian and international students in Australia to be listed as higher education providers in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. Together with the amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, the changes will allow Carnegie Mellon University, a private United States based institution, to operate an overseas branch in Australia. Carnegie Mellon University will offer education and training services to international and domestic students in Australia for the commencement of the 2006 academic year. Carnegie Mellon University is a prestigious private, not-for-profit institution, currently ranked No. 38 out of 200 on the Times Higher Education SuppleThere ment ranking of world universities and ranked 54 out of 500 on the Jiao Tong University's ranking of top world universities. These amendments reflect the Australian government's commitment to giving students greater choice of excellence in higher education. The anticipated entry of Carnegie Mellon University into Australia will enhance for their inter- that choice. The bill inserts a new list of table C providers, being overseas higher education institutions with Australian branches that have been approved under the national protocols for the higher education approval process. Table C providers will have limited access to certain Commonwealth assistance, including FEE-HELP and OS-HELP. As a result, Australian students studying at Carnegie Mellon University will have access to the same entitlements that they would if they had enrolled at an Australian higher education provider, reflecting the Australian government's commitment to ensuring that all eligible Australian students are granted equal access to entitlements. The introduction of Carnegie Mellon will invigorate the Australian higher education sector, generating worldwide interest and publicity. It will also attract more students to Adelaide from the Asia-Pacific region, bringing increased revenue and prestige to South Australia as an international centre for higher education. The amendments will also strengthen tuition assurance requirements under the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 contains a number of amendments to the act that better reflect the policy intent of tuition assurance requirements. These amendments include mechanisms that will provide improved, comprehensive consumer protection for students studying at non-table A providers in the event that a higher education provider ceases to offer a course in which the student was enrolled. The amendments clarify that, where a private provider ceases to offer a course, students will not be financially disadvantaged. Students can either switch to another higher education provider without incurring any additional cost or have the option of obtaining a refund for the uncompleted units. If a student chooses to transfer to another provider, the amendments ensure that the student will not pay twice for that unit. The ond provider will bear the cost, as is the rent practice. Where the refund option is taken, any HELP debt will be remitted, and the student learning entitlement and FEEHELP balances are to be repaid to the student. Under the tuition assurance, a student who transfers to another provider and then withdraws due to illness or family circumstances will also be able to obtain a refund and a recrediting of the student learning entithat tlement. The second provider will not bear any cost in such cases. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 established the national elements for the regulation of international education and sought to ensure international students receive the education and training for which they have paid. The act strengthened public confidence in the student visa program by ensuring that only genuine students come to Australia to study under these arrangements and that they are appropriately supported in doing so. To do this, the ESOS framework requires higher education providers to meet a range of obligations. In particular, it ensures that all registered providers, including universities, continue to make certain support services available to overseas students. These services are required under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students-the national code. This includes appropriate arrangements for independent grievance handling and dispute resolution, and access to information on counselling services, orientation, academic progress, further study and accommodation. It is a long standing policy of the Australian government that non-Australian government funding, tuition fees or student contributions paid by Australian students should be used to subsidise the tuition or services secprovided to overseas students. The governcurment is determined to maintain this policy and, as such, it is necessary to ensure the privacy of charging overseas students for the services defined in the national code. The amendment allows a provider to include an amount in its tuition fee, but not a separate fee, to cover the national code requirements. This, however, is not a new policy but one that reinforces current requirements to ensure overseas students receive quality protection-one of the major attractions for overseas students coming to Australia, in fact. The amendment does not place an additional legislative financial requirement upon educational providers, including universities.

30,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training why it is that the government considers it reasonable for overseas students to pay a compulsory fee but unreasonable for Australian students to pay a compulsory fee and for that fee be used for exactly the same purposes.",42
31,Mr FARMER,NOES,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (10.55 am)-I understand the opposition's interest in and fascination with the student union movement. However, I do not think it is unreasonable for Australians to expect overseas students to pay a fee for services that may be provided at universities.",42
32,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"Jagajaga) (10.55 am)Nobody is suggesting that Australian students should pay for the services received by overseas students, and Labor do support this amendment bill which will see overseas students paying a compulsory fee. The question we are asking is: why is it all right for overseas students to pay a compulsory fee for counselling services but not all right for Australian students to pay a compulsory fee for counselling services for Australian students?",42
33,Mr FARMER,NOES,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (10.56 am)-I make the point that these services are limited services. They include independent grievance handling, dispute resolution services, counselling services regarding orientation and academic progress, services for further study and accommodation, the approval of accommodation and welfare arrangements for overseas students under 18 years of age, and the appointment of a student contact officer who is responsible for the provision of support services to overseas students, including counselling. These services will promote the successful adjustment by overseas students to life and study at an Australian institution and assist those students to resolve problems which could impede successful completion of their study programs. If you look at those limited services, nobody could reason that they should not be paid for; they should be supported because of the nature of these overseas students.",42
34,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"Jagajaga) (10.57 am)Of course, the opposition agree. We think that these services should be provided and that overseas students should make a contribution to their cost through the compulsory fee that is going to be allowed through this legislation. My question again to the parliamentary secretary is: if it is all right for overseas students to pay a compulsory fee for those services, why isn't it all right for Australian students to pay exactly the same compulsory fee for exactly the same services?",42
35,Mr FARMER,NOES,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (10.58 am)-In answer to the member for Jagajaga-and in conclusion-this bill has been debated by both sides of parliament for quite a period of time. In relation to that, ernment is a government of choice; it is all about being able to provide people with a choice and being able to provide students with a choice. We are simply saying that if students do not want to pay a compulsory fee at a university then they should not have to. It is as simple as that. This is very simplistic. The feeling from many students is that they agree with this.",42
36,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,Jagajaga) (10.59 am)The problem with the parliamentary secretary's answer is that this bill is about imposing a compulsory fee on overseas students. That is the point of this amendment bill. And the whole purpose of that compulsory feeMr Hardgrave-You support it!,43
37,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"We do support it, and I am trying to get an answer from the parliamentary secretary about why it is okay to have a compulsory fee to pay for these very important services for overseas students but the government will not allow a similar compulsory fee so that these services can be made available to Australian students. Would the parliamentary secretary please answer the question?",43

NA AMENDMENT (VIDEO LINK EVIDENCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time.",43
42,Ms ROXON,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Video Link Evidence and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I move the opposition's second reading amendment as circulated: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that: (1) the video link evidence provisions of the bill will have a retrospective effect, applying to proceedings instituted before the commencement of the new provisions; (2) the proposals in the bill in relation to the admissibility of video link evidence appear to favour prosecutors over defendants by providing a court with a narrower discretion to disallow prosecution evidence compared to defence evidence; (3) a number of the measures appear to be inconsistent with similar measures allowing video link evidence both within the Crimes Act 1914 and under other Acts; (4) the definition of an ‘observer' is inadequate; (5) courts would face practical and legal obstacles to the enforcement of contempt and perjury laws in cases where video link evidence is received from a foreign country; and (6) there is a serious question as to whether coverage of the bill is adequate”. The primary purpose of the bill is to create new video link evidence provisions under the Crimes Act 1914, which will apply to proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and also to proceeds of crime proceedings relating to those offences. The bill provides for video link evidence to be used in proceedings for certain terrorism and related offences. This is provided for mainly by item 5 in the schedule, which inserts a new part 1AE into the Crimes Act. According to the explanatory memorandum, the coverage of these offences has been intentionally broad so that they cover not only direct terrorist offences but also peripheral and ancillary related offences, such as the giving of false and misleading statements to ASIO while being questioned under warrant for a terrorist offence. Important evidence from overseas witnesses that are unable to travel to Australia could be put before the court, using video link technology, unless there are compelling reasons why this would be inappropriate. The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 and to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The bill will amend the following legislation for unrelated purposes: the Crimes Act 1914, to modify matching profiles rules for DNA databases; the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988, to correct an unintentional omission from the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, to fix an error in regulations and enable payments out of confiscated assets accounts; and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, to enable law enforcement officers to retrieve authorised surveillance devices under warrant. This bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and the committee will report back on 1 November. While most of the bill is uncontentious in its effect, there do appear to be several issues relating to video link evidence that the committee will need to examine closely, including the differential treatment of the prosecution and defendants in relation to the use of evidence in the proposed amendments to both the Crimes Act 1914 and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. Another issue that will need to be examined closely is the retrospective effect on proceedings that have already commenced, and there are several other minor matters, including inconsistencies in the treatment of video link evidence between various sections of the Crimes Act. Labor's primary concern with this bill lies in the provision of differential treatment of prosecutors and defendants in relation to the test for refusing admissibility. I will move now to the issues surrounding the use of video link evidence in criminal matters generally. The use of video link, also known as television link or CCTV, evidence is well established overseas. It is also widely used in civil proceedings in Australia. When it comes to its use in the criminal law, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania all provide for video link evidence in criminal matters. In the federal jurisdiction, video link evidence is currently available under the Crimes Act 1914, part 1AD, for child witnesses; the Crimes Act 1914, part 3A, for child sex tourism offences; the Evidence and Procedure (New Zealand) Act 1994; the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987; and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994, as so determined in the Australian courts. So legislative provisions to protect child witnesses and/or sex offence witnesses from intimidation, distress or psychological harm associated with recounting their experiences in a daunting courtroom environment are already in place, and were supported by Labor. Part lAD of the Crimes Act 1914 already provides, in relation to sexual offences, for the giving of evidence by child witnesses under the age of 18 by closed-circuit television, video recording or other alternative means and that a child witness may be accompanied by an adult when giving evidence. In addition, part IIIA of the act in lation to child sex tourism offences makes similar provisions for the giving of evidence by witnesses of all ages, with the additional provision covering unreasonable expense or inconvenience. In addition, video link can be used in various other matters under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. And that is a brief synopsis of video link law as it stands at present. The new regime proposed in this bill is an issue that we now need to discuss. The provisions before us are intended to apply to certain terrorist and terrorism related offences listed in proposed section 15YU and will cover all criminal proceedings, including committals, for those offences. The regime as proposed will specifically exclude defendants from giving evidence by video link. Proposed section 15YU(3) makes the effect retrospective for proceedings instituted before the commencement of the new part 1AE, as well as for proceedings instituted after that date. That is something that Labor believes the committee needs to consider in terms of its appropriateness. Another issue relates to fair treatment and balance between the prosecution and the defence. Under the bill, the court must ‘direct' or ‘by order, allow' a witness to give evidence by video link if they are ‘available' or ‘will reasonably be available' to do so. Both prosecutors and defendants may apply for such orders and must give reasonable notice to the court of their intent to make such an application. However, the tests that are applied to such requests appear to differ depending on whether the request is made by a prosecutor or defence. There is a legitimate query of how this conforms with the general common-law requirement that a criminal trial be fair. The provisions in the bill in relation to the readmissibility of video link evidence appear clearly to favour the prosecution by providing a narrower test for the court when considering whether it can refuse an application from prosecutors. For the prosecution, a court can disallow the application if making the order would have a ‘substantial adverse effect on the right of a defendant' to receive a fair hearing. For the defendant, a court can disallow the application if the making of the order would be ‘inconsistent with the interests of justice for the evidence to be given by video link'. This dual test is at variance with those currently in the act. Labor's concerns on this issue are equally applicable to items 22 to 25 that amend the provisions of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994, which deal with other types of foreign material such as videotapes and transcripts of examinations to treat as foreign evidence. In amending the Foreign Evidence Act the bill also proposes a dual test for non-video link evidence from foreign jurisdictions creating a separate regime for the prosecution of designated offences. The present test in section 25 applies to both prosecution and defendant. Under this test it must be: ... to the court's satisfaction that, having regard to the interests of the parties to the proceeding, justice would be better served if the foreign material were not adduced as evidence. The test proposed under the new section 25A is applicable to the prosecution only and it reads: ... the court may direct that the foreign material not be adduced as evidence in the proceeding if the court is satisfied that adducing the foreign material would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of a defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearing. In the provisions for both video link evidence in the Crimes Act and the non-video evidence regime covered in the Foreign Evidence Act, the effect of the changes is to weaken the court's discretion to disallow prosecution evidence. The differential test for prosecution and defence, the inconsistency with current legislation and the problem of retrospectivity in procedural terms are all a major concern for Labor. Another issue that may arise under this new bill is the limited ability of the Australian courts to apply the law of contempt and perjury to witnesses giving evidence via video link from a foreign country. Contempt is primarily concerned with conduct that interferes with the administration of justice and may be subjected to legal sanctions, including custodial offences. Perjury is the offence of intentionally misleading a court. The powers of courts to deal with cases of contempt or perjury are a major component of judicial power, but it is unclear from the bill how these matters would be addressed in order to ensure fairness to the accused and to ensure that the court in question is able to have available adequate sanctions to supervise the administration of justice. Labor do not oppose the use of video link evidence but, as I have outlined, we do have some serious concerns about the video link provisions in the present bill. Rather than achieving consistent treatment across the law, the bill creates another video link evidence regime that is often at considerable variance with those already present in Commonwealth law. In addition, the definition of ‘observer' in this bill under proposed section 15YV is excessively loose and should specifically rule out criminals and terrorists. The second question is why the bill inserts yet another separate video link regime into the Crimes Act. Given the prevalence of video link evidence in other parts of federal criminal law and its extensive use in state and overseas jurisdictions and in our civil law, it is appropriate that we consider whether this bill is in fact too limited in its scope. Accordingly I move the second reading amendment that is circulated in my name, which outlines Labor's concerns and the need for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to closely scrutinise and flesh out options for improving these provisions in the bill. I might now briefly summarise some of the other measures contained in the bill. The bill includes a change to forensic procedures to expand the number of DNA profiles a volunteer can be tested against and to remove the requirement that interjurisdictional matching be confined to a specific investigation. Items 6 and 7 amend the Crimes Act to repeal the existing definition of tape recording at section 23B(1) and replace it with a definition that includes digital recording. This is not related to the taking of video link evidence but instead to the taping of interviews. The two other acts that will be altered by this bill are the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Surveillance Devices Act. Schedule 1, items 26 to 28 amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to clarify that the new video link evidence provisions of Part IAE apply to the Proceeds of Crime Act and to insert a new provision to allow payments out of the confiscated assets accounts in relation to the conduct of an examination with the approval of the DPP. The amendment will empower the DPP to approve payment to a third party which has carried out an examination under the act. This provision is not part of the link provisions. And, finally, the bill will correct the status of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal members to retrospectively validate examinations conducted under the act by AAT members who were inadvertently divested of their power to conduct such examinations by an error in regulations. Schedule 1, items 29 and 30 amend the Surveillance Devices Act to clarify that a law enforcement officer may apply for a retrieval warrant for a tracking device that was lawfully installed. The current act provides only for a surveillance device to be retrieved. These other measures are largely uncontentious; but, as mentioned previously, Labor has concerns with this bill and will closely examine the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, when it is released, before making our final judgment on the bill. The second reading amendment that I have moved outlines the significant concerns that I have already gone through. In summary, the issues that are of particular concern to Labor are the number of the video link measures that appear to be inconsistent with other current measures in the act; the measures that would take effect retrospectively for proceedings instituted before the commencement of these new measures; the effect of changes to weaken the court's discretion to disallow prosecution evidence; the disparity between treatment of prosecution and defence requests-the same problem arises again under the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 where a new section introduces a narrower test for the court's discretion in allowing video link evidence; the issue that there is no adequate definition of an observer in the bill; a limited ability for courts to enforce contempt and perjury laws in cases where video link evidence is received from a foreign country; and, finally, whether the coverage of the bill is adequate. These concerns are all video factors which we would expect the Senate committee to address in its report on this bill. Perhaps our greatest concern about this bill is that it appears to have been prepared by the Attorney-General in a rather slapdash manner without a full and proper consideration of the issues involved. Why, for example, is video link evidence in criminal matters to be limited to just child sex tourism, child witnesses and terrorist offences, especially given that New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania all have much broader capabilities for use of video link evidence in dealing with criminal law matters? Indeed, we can use video link evidence at the Commonwealth level on a broad criminal law basis under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Foreign Evidence Act. Why is it that the government is tinkering around the edges when it is clearly time to put in place a broader regime in the Crimes Act with necessary protections in place? As it is, the changes in this bill could leave Australia unprepared to take video link evidence in relation to other non-terrorist related federal crimes like sex trafficking, drug trafficking or people smuggling. In its haste to put these changes up, the government has dropped the ball when it comes to implementing a broad regime to assist the courts in fighting crime. Given all of those remarks, I make clear that Labor will support the bill in the House, while reserving our right to amend or oppose the bill in the Senate after seeing the recommendations from the Senate committee report.",43
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,Mr Quick)Is the amendment seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson-I second the amendment.,47
44,Mrs VALE,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Video Link Evidence and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The technical amendments in this bill demonstrate the Howard government's continued commitment to combating terrorism. The purpose of this bill is to create new video link evidence provisions that apply to proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime relating to those offences. These new provisions will facilitate the prosecution of terrorism offences by ensuring that, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, important evidence from overseas witnesses who are unable to travel to Australia can be put before the court using video link technology. The bill also amends the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 to facilitate the use of foreign material as evidence in proceedings for terrorism and related offences and proceeds of crime relating to those offences. These changes complement the new video link evidence provisions and will assist in circumstances where it is not possible for evidence to be given by video link. Regretfully, I wish to also tunity to note that yesterday was the anniversary of the Bali bombings. Three years ago yesterday, 12 October 2002, was a day when evil struck with indiscriminate savagery. Yesterday we remembered the 88 decent Australians and three permanent residents of this country who lost their lives in the terrorist bombings in Bali. They were young innocent Australians enjoying a holiday in a beautiful part of the world. They were senselessly struck down amidst the joy of being amongst their family and friends and the beautiful people of Bali. Yesterday, we stopped to mourn their loss with their families. As the Prime Minister described at the time, what happened was barbaric, brutal mass murder without justification. It was a terrible reminder that terrorism can strike anyone, anywhere, at any time. Nobody anywhere in the world is immune from terrorism. We are reminded that, in this borderless world, with a particularly mobile young population, Australia has dearly learned that we too are not immune from such horrible attacks. This unfortunately was demonstrated again with another attack in Bali on 1 October this year. Again Australians going about something as inoffensive as a joyful holiday have had their lives interrupted and, in the case of four fellow Australians, taken away. I wish to briefly refer to an article in the Canberra Times of Thursday, 13 October. This article expressively evokes the sentiments of many Australians. The article is entitled ‘Aussies unite in grief against “ideology of hate”': Grieving but defiant Australians turned yesterday's third anniversary of the original Bali bombings into a rallying point in the war against terrorism. At ceremonies around the nation and on the Indonesian resort island, Australians remembered the 202 people killed including 88 of their own nationals, in the Kuta nightclub bombings of Octake this opportober 12, 2002. In Canberra, a survivor of the 2005 Bali attacks made an impassioned call for Australians to stand together and never let terrorism prevail. ‘The important thing is not to let it defeat us,' Newcastle university student Joe Frost urged as Indonesian police denied reports they had identified one of the three suicide bombers who struck 11 days ago. ‘We have to stand together and just keep battling because it's not a war that we're going to win any time soon, if ever,' he said. ‘We can't let it get us down. We've just got to keep standing strong.' Mr Frost represented the hard-hit city of Newcastle at a Parliament House service attended by the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley. Looking again at this legislation before us, most state and territory legislation allows for evidence to be taken by video link from witnesses overseas. But, generally, the decision to grant an application to take evidence by video link is discretionary, based on an assessment of whether it would be fair to the defendant and whether it would be convenient or in the interests of justice. Being mindful of this week in Canberra and in the parliament, this legislation is timely. The proposed video link evidence provisions will limit the discretion of the court to refuse applications for a witness to give evidence by video link in terrorism proceedings, whilst ensuring that the right of the defendant to receive a fair hearing and the interests of justice remain important safeguards. The application of the proposed video link evidence provisions in this bill will be limited to terrorist matters. offences, by their very nature, are likely to involve witnesses that are overseas and may be unable to travel to Australia to give evidence. Terrorism offences also involve matters of national security that warrant the application of special rules. Offence specific video link rules are not novel. Part IIIA of the Crimes Act 1914 already contains specific video link evidence rules for child sex tourism prosecutions. Some of the video link provisions in this bill are based on those existing provisions. The proposed video link evidence provisions will be applicable to witnesses within Australia as well as overseas. Applying the video link evidence rules to witnesses within Australia will cater for circumstances such as where bringing a witness into the courtroom to give evidence would pose an unacceptable security risk to the witness or another person. State and territory video link evidence rules will be preserved so that parties will have discretion as to whether to make an application under state or territory legislation or under this new federal legislation. Amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 will include the proposed section 15YU, the purpose of which is to set out when the video link evidence provisions in new part IAE of the Crimes Act 1914 will apply. The listed offences are all either terrorism offences, offences that may be committed in the context of a terrorism offence or offences that may be sufficiently related to terrorism to very warrant the application of the new provisions. For example, section 34G(5) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 provides that, if a person is before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant in relation to a terrorism offence, it is an offence for the person to make a statement that is, to the person's knowledge, false or misleading in a material particular. This offence carries a maximum penalty of five Terrorism years imprisonment. Whilst an offence against this section is not directly related to a terrorism offence as such, evidence from witnesses who are overseas may be required to prove that the person made such false or misleading statements in the context of investigating the terrorism offence. It is important that special questioning powers for investigating terrorist offences can be enforced. Section 11.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 ensures that part IAE applies to ancillary offences such as attempting to commit, inciting the commission of or conspiring to commit one of the offences listed in proposed section 15YU. The new video link evidence provisions will also apply to breaches of section 6 of the Crimes Act that relate to any of the listed offences. Proposed paragraph 15YU(2)(b) provides that new part IAE will also apply to proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 relating to the offences listed in subsection 15YU(1). The Proceeds of Crime Act provides a mechanism for the restraint and confiscation of proceeds and instruments of crime. The act includes both a conviction based confiscation regime, where confiscation action follows conviction, and a civil confisca- not apply. tion regime, where property can be confiscated without first requiring a conviction criminal charge. The civil based scheme allows for the confiscation of unlawfully acquired property as long as the court is satisfied-on the civil standard of balance of probabilities-that a person has committed a ‘serious offence', that property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or that the property is an instrument of a terrorism offence. Paragraph 15YU(2)(b) will enable part IAE to apply to civil based Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings so long as the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings relate to the offences listed in subsection 15YU(1). For example, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions may seek to take Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings to restrain or confiscate property which has been used or was intended to be used as an instrument of a terrorism offence. Paragraph 15YU(2)(b) also provides that the video link evidence rules in proposed part IAE of the Crimes Act would apply to the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings to restrain and confiscate property, whether or not criminal proceedings have been taken in relation to the terrorism offence. Proposed section 15YV of the Crimes Act sets out the circumstances in which the court must direct or allow a witness to give evidence by video link. Firstly, either the prosemay cution or the defendant must have made an application under section 15YV for a direction or order that a witness give evidence by video link. It is important to note that, where an applicable state or territory law also allows evidence to be given by video link, it would be open to the prosecution or defendant to instead make a video link application under that state or territory law, in which case the rules in proposed part IAE would Secondly, the prosecutor and defendant or a must have given the court reasonable notice of their intention to make such an application. The court will have sufficient time to make the technical arrangements necessary for the video link and the other party will have an opportunity to consider the proposal before the application is made. The witness must also be available to give evidence by video link. This will prevent undue delays by overcoming the potential misuse of the provision by a party seeking a direction or order in relation to a witness who cannot realistically be made available to give such evidence. Likewise, the facilities required by proposed section 15YY must be available or reasonably capable of being made available. Finally, the witness cannot be a defendant in the proceeding. This ensures that a defendant facing terrorist charges must give any evidence to the court in person. If all of these circumstances are met, proposed subsection 15YV(1) provides that, where the prosecutor has applied for the direction or order, the court must direct or allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless the court is satisfied that giving the direction or making the order would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of the defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearing. This ensures that, in a terrorism prosecution, where evidence from a witness be critical to the prosecution's capacity to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond reasonable doubt, the court will only be able to disallow video link evidence where there is a compelling reason to do so. Under state and territory video link provisions, the onus is generally on the party seeking to adduce evidence by video link to convince the court that it should allow the evidence. These new rules essentially put the onus on the other party to provide a compelling reason why the evidence should not be allowed. Proposed subsection 15YV(2) provides that, where the defendant applies for the direction or order, the court must direct or allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless the court is satisfied that it would be inconsistent with the interests of justice for the evidence to be received by video link. This ‘interests of justice' test is broad enough to allow the court to consider the interests of both parties. This bill also amends the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. The proposed new part 1AE in the Crimes Act 1914 will deal with video link evidence from witnesses both from overseas and within Australia in proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime proceedings relating to these offences. The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 deals with other types of foreign material such as video tapes and transcripts of examinations. The proposed amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 will assist in treating the foreign evidence in a similar manner to the new video link evidence rules in part 1AE of the Crimes Act 1914 in proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime proceedings relating to those offences. This will assist in circumstances where it is not possible for evidence to be given by video link, perhaps because of restrictions under the law of the foreign country. Section 24 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 provides that foreign material may be adduced in a proceeding if the material would be admissible if the witness were giving evidence in person. Subsection 25(1) provides that the court may direct that foreign material not be adduced as evidence if justice would be better served if the foreign material were not so adduced. Also in relation to the Foreign Evidence Act, item 25 of this bill inserts a proposed new section 25A. This new section applies to a criminal proceeding for a designated offence or a proceeding under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to a designated offence. Item 22 also inserts a definition of designated offence into subsection 3(1) of the Foreign Evidence Act. It is defined to include the same list of offences that are listed in proposed subsections 15YU(1) and 15YU(2) of the Crimes Act 1914. These include terrorism and other related offences. Proposed section 25A provides that if a proceeding is a criminal proceeding for a designated offence or a proceeding under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to a designated offence and the prosecution seeks to adduce foreign material as evidence in the proceeding, then subsection 25(1) of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 does not apply. Instead, proposed subsection 25A(1)(d) will apply, and it provides that the court may direct that the foreign material not be adduced as evidence if the court is satisfied that adducing the foreign material would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of the defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearing. This will provide a narrower test than the one that still applies if the defendant is seeking to adduce the foreign material under subsection 25(1). Proposed subsection 25A(3) stipulates that it is immaterial whether the proceedings for the designated offence or proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to the designated offence were instituted before or after the commencement of this section. Section 24 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 will still apply, so that the foreign material will only be admissible if the nature of the material is such that the witness could have given the evidence in person. This will ensure that the normal rules of evidence, and the normal protections which apply under those rules, will continue to apply in proceedings covered by proposed section 25A. In conclusion, I would like to return to the courageous words of young Joe Frost from Newcastle, a university student and a survivor of the 2005 Bali bombings which occurred only a few weeks ago. He reminded Australians to be strong. ‘We have to stand together,' he said. A little later he said: ‘We can't let it get us down. We just have to keep standing strong.' Australians will stand strong. This important legislation is a vital tool in strengthening our laws and providing our law enforcement officers and courts of justice with the lawful means of protecting our freedoms and our great Australian way of life. I commend the bill to the House.",48
45,Mr MELHAM,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"A primary purpose of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Video Link Evidence and Other Measures) Bill 2005, according to the explanatory memorandum, is: ... to create new video link evidence provisions that apply to proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime proceedings relating to those offences. Page 1 of the explanatory memorandum continues: These new provisions will facilitate the prosecution of terrorism offences by ensuring that, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, important evidence from overseas witnesses that are unable to travel to Australia can be put before the court using video link technology. … … … The Bill also amends the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 to facilitate the use of foreign material as evidence in proceedings for terrorism and related offences and proceeds of crime proceedings relating to those offences. These changes complement the new video link evidence provisions. This will assist in circumstances where it is not possible for evidence to be given by video link. There are other features to the bill, which I will not go into. However, I want to read out the provisions in relation to where the court may take evidence by video link. I think this is where the bill, with the greatest respect to the Attorney-General, is deficient because we have different tests for prosecution and defence witnesses. As it stands, taking video evidence in criminal trials is fraught with danger-and we are talking about the liberty of the subject here-but to turn around and have differential tests when previously differential tests did not exist, I think, leaves the bill open to criticism. Section 15YV, ‘When court may take evidence by video link', states: Application by prosecutor (1) In a proceeding, the court must: (a) direct; or (b) by order, allow; a witness to give evidence by video link if: (c) both: (i) the prosecutor applies for the direction or order; and (ii) the court is satisfied that the prosecutor gave the court reasonable notice of his or her intention to make the application; and (d) the witness is not a defendant in the proceeding; and (e) the witness is available, or will reasonably be available, to give evidence by video link; and (f) the facilities required by section 15YY are available or can reasonably be made availableand this is the testunless the court is satisfied that giving the direction or making the order would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of a defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearingwhereas for an application by a defendant: (2) In a proceeding, the court must: (a) direct; or (b) by order, allow; a witness to give evidence by video link if: (c) both: (i) a defendant in the proceeding applies for the direction or order; and (ii) the court is satisfied that the dant gave the court reasonable notice of his or her intention to make the application; and (d) the witness is not a defendant in the proceeding; and (e) the witness is available, or will reasonably be available, to give evidence by video link; and (f) the facilities required by section 15YY are available or can reasonably be made availableand, again, here is the testunless the court is satisfied that it would be inconsistent with the interests of justice for the dence to be given by video link. A newspaper article dated 10 October 2005 by Joseph Kerr and Cynthia Banham has the heading ‘New rules raise bar against defendant'. The article states: The use of different tests for the prosecution and defence raised legal hackles yesterday, with the president of the NSW Bar Association, Ian Harrison, SC, saying he could see no reason for the split. Mr Harrison is quoted as saying: I have a very significant suspicion that the similarity was intended to aid the prosecution and disadvantage the defence. It seems a higher bar to get over for the defendant. Further on, the article rightly points out: Courts already take video evidence under existing state and territory laws. In child sex tourism trials, courts apply the same admissibility test to both parties-that it be in the interests of justice that the video evidence be used. I was on the House of Representatives committee that looked at child sex tourism legislation, and we had it substantially amended. I recall that the government at that time proposed the same tests for both the prosecution and the defence. I would say to the Attorney that I think it is a worrying sign that, in terms of the admissibility of evidence, there is a differential test between the prosecution and defenthe defence. I am interested in the justification for this. Why do we have a different test for the prosecution and the defence? It needs to be borne in mind that we want to prosecute terrorists, or purported terrorists, but we should give them a fair trial. We should not have differential tests. Later down the track that will result in appeals, inquiries and a questioning of the whole process. I remember vividly reading in recent times about the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the MCGuire Seven-three different sets of trials in the UK-where people were convicted and those convictions were evi- subsequently brought into question. Indeed, in one instance, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, recently issued an apology to those people who were wrongly convicted. They were tried in an atmosphere where there was a lynch-mob mentality and the conduct of the police was less than satisfactory. We do not need differential tests for the prosecution and the defence in relation to the conduct of video evidence. Video evidence, as it is, is fraught with danger. The protections are not there for an accused person that would othdis- erwise be there if the evidence was given in person. I think there is a question there for the Attorney and he should tell us why there is a need for a differential test. We have already had tensions in the first use of video evidence in a terrorism trial, and they arose in the case of Faheem Lodhi, which appears in the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest. Video evidence was tendered by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in the committal hearings that were held between December 2004 and February 2005. Mr Lodhi had been arraigned in the New South Wales Supreme Court and his trial is to take place in February 2006. The Bills Digest states: A summary of the video-link evidence tendered in the committal hearings is provided to give context to the Bill. As some of the key proviBoulten sions of the Bill have retrospective operation, they may be in effect for this trial. Mr Lodhi was a 34-year-old architect from Punchbowl and he faced nine charges after allegedly plotting to bomb the National Electricity Group and several Sydney defence sites. He was arrested in 2004 and charged. In the case, the Commonwealth tendered the evidence of four overseas witnesses who all gave evidence at the committal hearing over defence objection by way of video link in late 2004, early 2005. One witness was being held in Singapore, without charge, under that country's national security legislation. The other three witnesses are serving sentences in the United States and have reportedly reached plea agreements with the US government to give evidence in various trials in the US, in Australia and in the UK. One can see that there was a need for video evidence because of the inability in some instances to bring these people to Australia to give evidence in person. That being the case, there should be safeguards and consistent tests in relation to their ability to give evidence. The Singaporean witness, Arif Naharudin, purported to identify Faheem Lodhi as a participant in LET training camps in Pakistan. Due to the operation of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004, defence counsel were not allowed to see certain parts of his evidence, on national security grounds, and the cross-examination was held in secret. The defence argued in court that Naharudin's testimony may be suspect. Phillip Boulten SC said: He is being held without charge. We do not know what pressures have been put on him. We want to know. If we're going to be restricted from asking questions about it, it is getting to the point in this whole process where there's barely any justice at all, let alone Australian justice. Although I have not spoken to Phillip SC about this case, I should put it on the record that he is a very close friend of mine. We were at the Legal Aid Commission together and we still maintain a strong friendship. When it comes to defence work, he is probably the most prominent member of the Sydney bar, and words uttered by him need to be taken into account. He is basically saying that the restrictions in relation to the questions that he is able to ask as defence counsel bring the process into question. I suggest to the Attorney that having a differential test for the prosecution and the defence brings the whole process of video evidence into question. In a recent article in Australian Prospect, Phillip Boulten SC also argued that the evidence of the fourth Commonwealth witness may have been tainted by torture. He said: A second American emerged badly from his cross-examination at the committal hearing in February 2005, where it was revealed that he had been arrested by Saudi Arabian police in Riyad, held without warrant and without charge for approximately four weeks in solitary confinement in a cell with the lights on 24 hours a day, interrogated regularly throughout the night by Saudi police and then handed over to the FBI who, after stripping him naked and photographing his genitals, dressed him in prison greens, placed him in irons, placed dark goggles over his face and then transported him from Riyad to Washington. He told Central Local Court in Sydney that it was in this flight that he first confessed his involvement in LET activities. There were also some other technical issues. In December 2004, the Commonwealth DPP requested and was granted an adjournment of six months, saying that the Australian translator spoke a different dialect to Naharudin and difficulties with the video link were causing confusion. I do not seek to go into the merits of that are currently before the courts; that matter for the judge and the jury. My pointand the reason I raised those examples-is that we already have an instance in which video evidence has been used. And I would imagine that video evidence is going to be used in more than the usual run-of-the-mill court cases, because of the nature of offences. I have no doubt that people will be in custody in America and there will be a whole range of other things. In some instances, it reminds me very much of when I was at the criminal bar and evidence was being given by prisoners against other prisoners because concessions or other things might have been offered to them by the prosecuting authorities. So, in framing laws that allow these people to be cross-examined, one needs to be very careful about the nature and quality of the evidence they may give. What worries me is that, in the current climate, we are operating from a presumption of guilt. I come from the school of thought that talks about the presumption of innocence-the school of thought that says, ‘Before you convict someone, their guilt must be beyond reasonable doubt, you must have reputable evidence that is not tainted and it must be a process that we can all be proud of.' If we lower the standards, mistakes are going to be made. This is not about getting a conviction at any cost; this is not about turning around and getting scalps. The laws that we passed a couple of years ago were laws that I supported. I was the justice spokesman at the time and Senator John Faulkner was the homeland security spokesperson. We negotiated with the government, amendments were made and we had laws that both sides of the parliament could be proud of. As a former public defender I had no problem with supporting new laws to plug the gaps in the Criminal Code-I saw that as our responsibility-but I wanted laws that cases were reputable and which you could run a is a ruler over in terms of basic principles. To me, the flaw in the bill before the House at the moment is that the test for the prosecution being able to have evidence by video link is different from the test for the defence being able to have evidence by video link. I think that is a real problem and it needs to be addressed by the Attorney and the government. We should go to an equal test for both the prosecution and the defence. This is something that the government should be looking at long term as I cannot see an argument for a differential test. I cannot see how it is going to disadvantage the prosecution to have the same test because, while at the end of the day it is an adversarial system, the onus is on the Crown. The Crown should bear the onus and it should not be an onus that is a diminished onus in terms of the normal criminal standard, because we are dealing with the liberty of a subject here. To me the values that we are defending against terrorists are values that we should defend internally. I believe that if you lower your standards the terrorists win, because they can point to a grievance and they can talk in their own little circles about how badly they were treated, how unfairly they were treated. The truth of the matter is this: what you need to do is take your population, the people, with you, and we should be learning from mistakes of the past, not repeating the mistakes of the past. If there is to be a lowering of the standard then we need to know why and if there is to be a differential standard we need to know why. On my reading of all the material to date I have not seen a justification for it, justification to say we need a lower standard for the prosecution because the bar is too high. So I look forward to the Attorney, in the summary of the debate, being able to explain why we have this differential test. I also say this to the Attorney: when you bring in laws such as this, they should be brought through the parliament and the processes of the parliament-and I understand this one is going to a Senate committee-to allow a level of scrutiny. If they are good laws they will withstand scrutiny. If there is problem with the laws then politicians on both sides of the equation can look at it. Concern for our system of justice is not only on one side of the parliament; it is on both sides of parliament. This concern is the one thing that does bring members from both sides together, through committee work where there is scrutiny. So that is my big question mark over this particular piece of legislation. I understand there is the retrospectivity question too. I know that there have been some concerns raised about that. I am not raising those concerns and I understand where the Attorney is coming from.",52
46,Mr RUDDOCK,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable members for Gellibrand, Hughes and Banks for their contribution to this debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Video Link Evidence and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I thank the member for Hughes for her supportive comments about the measure. I note that the member for Gellibrand has moved an amendment. I will deal with all of the points that she has raised except No. 5. Obviously, the government does not accept the amendment. In dealing with the member for Banks's observations, I will treat them in the context of the broader arguments that were made in the amendment put by and the speech made by the member for Gellibrand because they covered some of the same area. Firstly, the amendment, in my view, is premature. It is based upon assumptions that are contained in its numbered paragraphs, which form a premature view as to the way in which the bill would operate. I think she herself pointed out that these were all matters that will be considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I would prefer to await the outcome of that process before jumping to wild conclusions. The first matter that she raised was the claim that the member for Banks has not pressed: a that the bill is retrospective. It is not the case that it is retrospective. The provisions in this bill are procedural and they apply to proceedings that are to take place after the provisions come into force, thus they do not affect the substantive rights of either party. As for the points of principle made by the member for Banks, I do not demur in relation to criminal matters as to what the burden of proof should be, nor do I want to see proceedings that are unfair to the parties involved. But that does not mean that the ways in which those issues are dealt with have to be precisely the same. I will deal with the issues relating to different tests of admissibility that apply to the prosecution and defence, because it is correct that the tests are different. However, to imply that different tests necessarily mean that one party is disadvantaged over another is not, in my view, a safe assumption. I notice that, in commenting about the observations of Mr Ian Harrison, whom I know well and whom I respect, while he may have offered substantive arguments the quotes that were given were really an opinion without outlining the basis upon which that opinion was reached. The question, in my view, should not be whether the tests are different but whether the tests that have been set for the prosecution and the defence are fair and appropriate. That is the issue that I want to deal with. Both the defence and prosecution may make an application for a witness to give evidence by video link. If the prosecution makes the application, the court must allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless to do so would have a substantial adverse affect on the right of the defendant in proceedings to receive a fair hearing. While the tests differ slightly for the prosecution and for defendant applications, both allow scope for the rights of the defendant to be taken into account. It would not be practicable to make the test for the defendant's applications analogous to those that the prosecution has to meet. That test of course would be that if the defendant makes the application the court must allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless to do so would have a substantial adverse affect on the right of the prosecution in proceedings to have a fair hearing. In my view, those words would make no sense because the prosecution does not get a right as such to a fair hearing in the same way that you expect a defendant should. The test needs to be different, and the interests of justice test for the defendant appliof cations is an appropriate and flexible test that will give the court the capacity to protect the interests of the defendant. It will also allow the interests of the prosecution to be taken into account. The test for the prosecution applications is more narrowly focused on protecting the defendant's interests, as in that situation there is no need for the court to second-guess what is in the interests of the prosecution. That is essentially the gist of the argument that we make. If in some way we have failed to do that adequately and it comes through the committee process, I will look at it. I am not churlish about these things. If a bill can be improved, I am quite prepared to look at amendments, provided they do not derogate from my aspiration to ensure that evidence that is available-and ought to be available but cannot be obtained because somebody is not free to travel to Australia-would not be denied. I do not think the Australian community would want people who are charged with serious offences in relation to terrorism to be able to get off on the basis that you put in place procedural blocks for evidence that might significantly impact on the question of whether or not a person is guilty. The member for Gellibrand also notes that the provisions are inconsistent with other measures in separate enactments. There are differences, but why does a difference somehow imply a weakness or error? The differences are deliberate, carefully crafted to accommodate the objectives of this bill. For example, the main difference is in the test that applies when the prosecution adduces video link evidence. The test is intentionally different because the bill is designed to facilitate the admission of video link evidence in terrorist cases. It is not designed to be a general law dealing with video link evidence. The fourth point that was made by the member for Gellibrand is that the definition ‘observer' is too loose. The provisions are flexible, and that was deliberately so to ensure that the court would have the power to control its proceedings and to determine whether it was first necessary for an independent observer to be present-for example, if the representatives of both the defence and the prosecution were present in the place where the video link was given. These are matters that we think the judge, in ensuring that the trial is conducted fairly, should be able to address and make appropriate rulings on. So it was left not vague but flexible in order to give the judge control over those proceedings. Point 5 was related to whether the courts would ‘face practical or legal obstacles to the enforcement of contempt and perjury laws in cases where evidence is received from a foreign country'. There may be issues in relation to those questions, but I think the broader purpose of being able to get access to the evidence is important, and the efficacy of that is a matter that will be determined in the trial. Whether or not you would be able to use proceedings in relation to contempt and perjury when somebody is not within your jurisdiction obviously demonstrates that you cannot necessarily address those issues, but it should not be a technical defence to enable a person to avoid responsibility for their actions, particularly where terrorist acts have occurred. The fact that those remedies are not available to you may be a matter that the judge, in considering the weight that is put on some of these matters, may want to take into account, but again I think that is really a matter for the judge. Finally, there was a serious question raised as to whether coverage of the bill is adequate. The point I would make is that the government have brought forward amendments which are specifically targeted and designed to give the courts flexibility in managing trials for serious terrorism offences. If there are issues raised as to whether or not we have put in place sufficiently flexible measures, my argument would be that we have and that we have left the matter within the capacity of the courts to deal with. I think it is important in the context of the amendment and the bill that we do not lose sight of what we are about here. This bill is to ensure that the laws that we have put in place to target terrorist activity are able enforced. Experience has shown that, to successfully prosecute a terrorist, it will often necessary to rely on evidence from witnesses overseas who are unable to travel. I think the member for Banks brought out some of the reasons why they might be unable to travel. Sometimes people in these situations may be known to a person who has been charged here, and they are not going to be free to travel here. Yet the evidence might well be of a great deal of importance in securing a successful prosecution. This bill will ensure that, wherever possible in terrorism cases, important evidence from overseas witnesses can be put before the court using video link technology. If evidence cannot be given by video link because the laws of other countries do not allow it, the bill will ensure that the witness's testimony can be put before the court using alternative means-for instance, by way of a written transcript or a videotape. New video link and foreign evidence rules are balanced with appropriate safeguards. Video link evidence and foreign evidence cannot be adduced if it would compromise the defendant's right to a fair trial. An independent observer can be required to be present at a place where the video link is being given to safeguard against any impropriety in the giving of that evidence. In all cases, the normal rules of evidence and the protection provided by those rules will continue to apply. The bill makes a number of other important changes to the criminal law enforcement legislation. In conclusion, I am particularly keen to see this bill enacted. I have not commented on litigation that is afoot-I do not think it is appropriate for me as Attorney to do so-but it is quite clear that there are people who have been charged with serious terrorism offences where legislation of this sort could well be relevant to ensuring that the trials can be properly conducted. I hope the Senate to be Legal and Constitutional Committee will keep in mind in its consideration the urgent be need for this legislation and, hopefully, when we return in early November, the Senate will agree that the bill in its present form should be given passage.",56

49,Ms GILLARD,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"The National Health Amendment (Budget Measures-Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005 amends the National Health Act 1953 in relation to two changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme announced in the May budget. The amendments will implement new safety net and patient copayment arrangements for some pharmaceutical benefits where the pharmaceutical benefit is supplied within 20 days of a previous supply. The amendments will also increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS eligibility entitlements. The safety net 20-day rule will result in the following effects: the patient copayment amount will not accrue towards the safety net threshold, and the patient copayment will be the standard amount that applies to the person's entitlement. Reduced safety net copayments will not apply. The pharmaceutical benefits which will be subject to the measures will be determined by the minister on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The bill will also increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS safety net entitlements for general and concessional patients. These amendments will increase the general threshold by an amount equal to two indexed general patient copayment amounts on 1 January each year from 2006 to 2009 inclusive and increase the concessional threshold by an amount equal to two indexed concessional patient copayment amounts on 1 January each year from 2006 to 2009 inclusive. The increases will result in a gradual adjustment of the eligibility thresholds for the PBS safety net entitlements via increments over four years. These increases will occur in addition to the annual indexation of the safety net thresholds on 1 January each year. Labor will oppose this bill. Firstly, it shows the deep cynicism of the Howard government and its contempt for the electorate that, at the last election-even though it made a major statement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-the government did not see fit to advise Australians that it would be making these changes to the PBS safety net, which are clear cutbacks. Secondly, once again from the Howard government, this is a poorly thought-through piece of policy in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which will have all sorts of unintended effects and consequences. I will just paint the background to this bill before coming to its specific points. We know that the Howard government has been in a mode to cut back the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since the Treasurer first produced the Intergenerational report in the context of the 2002-03 budget. This was, of course, supposed to be a major opportunity for the man who would be Prime Minister to parade his credentials and his ability to about the big picture, the big national issues and the forces which will shape our nation over the next 40, 50 or 60 years. He correctly identified one of those forces as being the ageing of the population and, consequently, the need to think about how providing benefits to an ageing population can have intergenerational consequences and intergenerational equity dimensions. We know that the Intergenerational report which was delivered by the Treasurer was hardly earth-shattering stuff. Basically it fast-forwarded present spending settings by the Commonwealth government and suggested that, if they remain unchanged in 40 years time, the Commonwealth budget would be unsustainable due to the ageing of the population. About the only action item that came out of the Intergenerational report was the Treasurer's and the Howard government's announcement that it was worried about PBS sustainability, and it was consequently going to increase copayments for pharmaceuticals by 30 per cent. Of course we are all deeply concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme's sustainability, but there was always the smell of panic and ill thoughtthrough policy about the Treasurer's reaction to the Intergenerational report and his plans to cut back the PBS. Certainly in the 2001-02 year, the cost of the PBS had increased by 22 per cent. One can understand that anybody who is worried about fiscal sustainability would have looked at that figure and asked, ‘What's going on here?' Clearly that growth rate, if it were to be replicated each and every year, would make the PBS unsustainable over time. But there is an intellectual task here that was parently left undone by the Howard government, which was to diagnose why the cost of the PBS increased by such an extraordinary amount in the course of one financial year. We know of course that most of this inthink crease-some 10 percentage points higher than the average-was due to the Howard government's own actions in two specific areas. Firstly, there was the raising in the 200102 year of the income limit for access to the Commonwealth seniors health card by self-funded retirees. The Howard government, by taking that decision, made more people eligible for the concessional PBS arrangement. More patients were paying a lower percentage of the cost of the drugs because they were entitled to the lower copayment and therefore-do the maths-taxpayers were paying more. Secondly, this was the year that the government contributed to PBS costs by acting to list Celebrex at a price 20 per cent higher than that recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and without negotiating the quality discount also recommended. It then took the government far too long to realise that what it had anticipated would be an expenditure of $54 million a year on Celebrex was actually going to be in the order of $232 million a year. So there was a big jump in PBS expenditure. With a jump of 22 per cent you would be right to be concerned. You would need to get to the bottom of the causes. And then you find that significant causes have been the Howard government's own actions. If you then look more broadly at growth rates in the PBS, what we know is that the average annual PBS growth rate has been about 12 per cent, but it is important to recognise that the average figure disguises substantial fluctuations that have always occurred over the life of the PBS. Since June 2002 the cost of the PBS has declined sigapnificantly from the 22 per cent high I spoke of. It was 10 per cent in 2002-03, eight per cent in 2003-04 and 10 per cent in 2004-05. Commonwealth expenditure on the PBS for the next few years, from 2004-05 to 2006-07, will be under 10 per cent. It is then estimated to hit the 10 per cent mark again in 2007-08. We have some scepticism about the budget projections for the growth of the PBS because these estimates do not take into account the impact of major therapeutic groups coming off patent. The current budget estimates suggest that, without the savings measures included in this year's budget, the cost of the PBS would increase to 15 per cent by the end of these forward estimates. So the government projected a 15 per cent growth rate, used that as an argument to say it needed cutbacks and then said it thought the growth rate was going to be about 10 per cent. But we are concerned about the robustness of these estimates because there are always considerable cost savings on the PBS when major therapeutic groups come off patent and move to being cheaper generics. Those highly anticipatable savings have not been factored into the budget estimates. None of this is to say that we do not need to be concerned about PBS sustainability. Of course we do. But a competent government would be getting to the bottom of the growth rate, particularly the 22 per cent hike that started this flurry of PBS activity and particularly the push on copayments. And in terms of future estimates, a competent government would be modelling to get the most exact prediction of future costs that it could. The Howard government does not bother to do that. Instead it prefers to put into the budget things that will justify its policies rather than put into the budget things that might be truly accurate because they have been modelled. Where does this leave us? Of course we had the copayment increase, and the major part of that copayment increase came into effect on 1 January this year. There has been some evidence-it is only early evidence, I concede that-that the increase in the copayment is affecting the access to medicines that people need. We know that in the first six months of 2005 the number of concessional scripts-that is, the number of scripts that are taken out by poorer and older Australians who qualify for the concessiongrew by only one per cent and the number of general scripts dropped by five per cent. It may be that that is a result of changed prescribing practices. It may be that that is explained by a sudden outbreak of wellness in our community. But I suspect an element of that is that the increased copayments are having an effect. And if the increased copayments are having an effect then that may mean we are saving a bit of money now, with lower growth rates in scripts for concessional patients than would have been anticipated and a drop in the number of general scripts. We are saving money now but with a view to having far higher health expenditure in the future, because the sorts of medicines that people are likely to go without if they are under financial pressure and cannot meet the new increased copayments will tend to be those that are about stabilising health conditions. These would be health conditions where you are not necessarily experiencing an immediate feeling of unwellness but where, if you go off the medicine for a long period of time, you will hit a health problem. A clear example of that would be taking a statin-a cholesterol-lowering medication. If you go off your statins because you cannot afford them then you are not going to feel sick on day one. But the cholesterol build-up over time may result in you having a heart attack or some other major health problem that could have been avoided by consistent medication. So we are concerned about that. The 30 per cent copayment increase is not the only change that the Howard government have made to the PBS about which we are concerned, and it is not the only change that we think was ill thought through. During the federal election campaign, on the Friday of the second to last week of the campaign, the Howard government ran out and announced that they were going to engage in a major cutback to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-not in the interests of making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme sustainable or in the interests of financing expenditure on the other health areas but because they needed to snaffle a saving somewhere and to send it out of the health portfolio and into another portfolio to pay for some election sweeteners that they wanted to give older Australians. The government needed to cobble together a savings measure. No doubt, Howard government ministers, staff and others working on the election campaign were instructed by the Prime Minister-and others-along the following lines: ‘I need to find the best part of $1 billion. Someone find me $1 billion.' A weak and incompetent minister like the Minister for Health and Ageing was unable to resist when the pressure came on, so he was told to cobble together any old policy-it did not matter how incompetent it was-to find some savings for the Prime Minister to send out of health and into other portfolios during the course of the election campaign. That policy was to cut the cost of generic medicines by 12½ per cent. You could not find a person in the pharmaceutical industry in Australia or a health professional who would agree with this policy. Each and every one of them, if they were asked to come into this place to make a statement about it, would say that it was an ill-advised, ill thought through fiasco. It has been revised several times because it is a fiasco. It has unintended consequences because the minister for health, who does not understand the PBS, did not understand that if you cut the price of generic medicine then that flows through the therapeutic groups that the PBS has defined and starts to affect the prices that you pay for innovative medicine. So what is the result of this ongoing fiasco? On the one hand it has meant that we are now in a situation where four medicines attract a special patient contribution because the drug companies have not been willing to supply them for the cut price. These are innovative pharmaceuticals, not generic pharmaceuticals; they have no clinically effective generic substitute. So now if you have advanced lung cancer and you need to get a second-line treatment like Alimpta you are at risk of having to pay a special patient contribution of around $500. That has been one way in which this fiasco has cut in. The other way in which this fiasco has cut in is that the Minister for Health and Ageing has exempted some medicines-and I am thinking particularly of Lipitor-from the 12½ per cent cutback policy because he did not want to face the political heat of a special patient contribution on such a commonly taken medication. He has managed to punch a hole in the budget bottom line of around $237 million. It takes a rare genius to design a policy which, on the one hand, results in patients paying more and, on the other hand, punches a hole in the budget bottom line. It takes a rare genius to do that but somehow our minister for health has managed that double act. It is a policy of gross incompetence which I suspect will be a revised again and again. We know that the assault on the PBS did not end with that policy in the recent budget. Calcium has been taken off the PBS. That was a decision made without any expert advice. The minister for health has now sent had that decision to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and they have provided advice. He must not have liked that advice because he has done what he always does when he gets advice that he does not likehe has sent it back for ‘clarification'. We are still waiting to see what comes out of that process. In the meantime, people who take a lot of calcium-whether they take it because they are also taking PBS osteoporosis medication or because they have kidney complaints-are facing an increase in the cost of their calcium if this matter is not resolved. The problems that this government has created in terms of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme just go on and on. This bill represents another two problems. I will turn to the question of the safety changes. We have a PBS safety net arrangement for people who are high medication users. You need to be chronically unwell to be using enough scripts to be in the range of hitting the PBS safety net. If you are a person who uses a lot of medication-currently, if you need 52 scripts in a year-you will hit a safety net arrangement where thereafter you can access medicines at grossly reduced costs. So you have paid your PBS copayment for the 52 scripts-you might have paid that at a concession level because you are a concession card holder or paid it at the full rate-but then the safety net comes in and takes care of you. Now, under these changes, that is going to go up progressively so that it is 54 scripts, 56 scripts and so on. If the Howard government had wanted to change the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net arrangements then they should have done the following. On the day in the election campaign that they effectively made a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme policy change of some significance-when they announced the 12½ per cent price cutback policy to fund another election policy-to be honest with the electorate the Prime Minister should have held a press conference and said: ‘Understand this, Australians. If you vote for me, I will be cutting back the PBS safety net. If you do not want that done, do not vote for me, because I am going to do it.' But honesty is not something that we expect from the Howard government-and we never get it. Once again, we did not get it on this occasion. They did not tell the electorate. Seat holders in the Howard governmentcoalition members-did not walk around their electorates, knock on doors and say: ‘Are you a chronically ill person? Well, understand this: if you vote for me, I am going to come into the House of Representatives and vote to make the PBS safety net threshold harder for you to reach. If you are somenet one who needs a lot of medications you had better know that, before you walk or drive down to the polling station to exercise your vote.' They did not say that. It was a gross act of dishonesty and a gross act of hypocrisy, and on that basis we are opposed to it. Then there is the second bit of this bill-a Howard government special, particularly from the minister, who seems completely unable to think about health issues in detail and in depth; he has an intellectual bypass which means he is unable to do that-where there has been cobbled together this new thing called the ‘20-day rule'. This is supposed to be about a measure that prevents the hoarding of medicine. I understand that it is not desirable, in terms of people who go to the doctor and get multiple scripts, to have all of those scripts filled at the one time and for them to be looking for new scripts and be hoarding medication, particularly if any of that is motivated by trying to hit the PBS safety net threshold at an earlier point in time than they otherwise would. So there is an issue-but this is such a poorly designed proposition to deal with that issue. This is saying that, if you are prescribed a medication and within a 20-day period you go and fill a second prescription for that medication, the amount of the patient copayment that you pay to get the second script filled will not count towards the PBS safety net. If you have already hit the PBS safety net, then by filling that second script the reduced patient copayment that should apply under the PBS safety net will not apply. That is irrespective of why you are filling a second script within 20 days. We pressed the Department of Health and Ageing on these matters when we took the briefing, and we just got gobbledegook back. I would like the minister for health, when he comes in and sums up in this debate, to tell me why this House or any member in it, including any coalition member sitting in the government ranks-and I hope they understand that this is what they will be voting because we will make sure that everybody understands that this is what they did vote for-should be put in this position; why anyone should be put in the following positions, and I have a few examples. Let us imagine a low-income family that has reached their PBS safety net limit. There might be a member of the family who is chronically unwell-indeed, there might be a number of children who all share the same chronic illness. Let us imagine that one of the children in that family has asthma. Let us say that that child goes to school and does the kind of thing that kids often do: they lose their school bag and somehow they manage to lose their medication. They leave it behind and it is not there when they come back, or it is sports day and they leave their school bag and wander back onto the school bus. I am sure we can all remember times in our childhood when we lost jumpers, shoes, school sports uniforms, pens or books. You can also lose your asthma medication. Let us say that child has lost Ventolin, Seretide or Atrovent-all medications they could be taking. The family will have to replace that. They cannot have an asthmatic child wandering around without medication. Under this legislation, when they go to get the second script filled within a 20-day period, that family will be paying $85.80 to get that medication for their child, instead of $13.80. So we have a low-income family that has hit the PBS safety net threshold. They have an incident where a young kid has left their school bag somewhere and they cannot find their medication. They will be paying $85.80 instead of $13.80-an additional cost of $72. I hope the members on the coalition benches are proud to vote for that when we come to voting for this bill. Let us take another example: a diabetic patient who might be taking Metformin, Ramapril or Atorvastatin, one of the statin for, groups. Let us say that they have misplaced their medication. They could have been on holidays and left it where they have holidayed. They could have lost their luggage. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are someone who has had to confront a loss of luggage, travelling on planes from time to time. These things do happen; it is no-one's fault. It may be the airline's faultsometimes it just happens-and your bag does not come out on the carousel and you do not have your medication. Someone in that position may have filled their script and taken their medicine away with them. It has been lost and they need to replace it within 20 days. They will be hit with an additional $72 payment. That is someone with diabetes who, despite the PBS and all sorts of other government measures, would already experience high out-of-pocket costs day in, day out to manage their diabetes. Once again, I hope the coalition members who will file into this place to vote for this bill are proud of that as a result. I hope they are wandering around their electorates explaining to every diabetic that they have potentially cost them $72 extra if they happen to lose their medication. I have another example. This week is Mental Health Week. This government has lots of spin on mental health but precious little substance. We know that, even in Mental Health Week, the government has managed to deny appropriate funding to an organisation called depressioNet, which has helped 200,000 Australians and which will close at the end of this week. We all know exactly how low the real commitment of this government is to mental health issues. Indeed, the minister for health does not deign to look after this himself. He believes that dealing with mental health issues is somehow beneath him and has given the matter to his parliamentary secretary. There are obviously many people in our community who have a mental illness, who need medicine for that mental illness and who may be liable to lose or misplace their medicine. Indeed, forgetfulness could well be a side-effect of the mental health condition they are facing. So let us give an example of someone who has schizophrenia-tragically, too many people in our society do-with all the lifetime effects that having such a major mental health condition implies. That person could be taking Zyprexa. If they lost that medicine they would be required to pay an additional $4.60 to get the medicine. That may sound like a small amount of money to many people. But if someone is schizophrenic it may well be-tragically, is likely to be-that they will not be in the work force. They will be on some form of welfare payment, and they may be in the situation where they lose their medicine frequently. Each time they do, it is an additional $4.60. So this is the problem of the 20-day rule, and that is even before you get to things like people who live in rural and remote locations who come to town and fill all their scripts at once, not because they are going to take all their medication at once but because it will be a long time before they get back to town again. So they go into the chemist, fill all their scripts, take the medicine back home and take it as they are supposed to take it, but of course they will be caught within this 20day rule because they have filled the scripts. This really is I think an incredibly cruel policy, a policy that is likely to have its highest impact on elderly patients who have certain shopping cycles and may be confused or insecure about running out of medicines. It is likely to have strong effects on people with chronic conditions who might need extra supplies of medicines in order to have the medicine in more than one location or who may lose their medication. It is going to have strong effects on people who are taking mind-modifying medicines and may be more likely to be confused than the average person. It is an ill-thought through proposal from a minister whose understanding of health is so shallow that sometimes it takes my breath away. There is an issue here about medication hoarding, I understand that, but this is not the way to fix it, and that is why Labor will be opposing this bill. I will be recommending to members of the coalition backbench that, instead of just wandering in and voting for this in the way they will be instructed to, they actually have a think about it because it is going to have substantial demerits for people in their constituencies. I conclude by moving the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name and which makes these points. I once again urge coalition members to consider voting for the second reading amendment if they are genuinely motivated by the concerns of their constituents. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) failing to invest in the long term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; (2) failing to tell the Australian public at the last election that additional changes to the PBS safety net and patient co-payment were planned in addition to the 21% increase in co-payments and safety nets introduced last January; (3) continuing to implement changes to the PBS despite the fact that PBS growth rates have already slowed substantially and despite the fact that these changes will hit the poorest and sickest Australians; (4) failing to ensure that the 20 day restriction rule contains sufficient exemptions to cover situations that will arise regularly to people to get their prescriptions filled that time-frame; and (5) providing further opportunities for the Minister for Health and Ageing to intervene to limit the availability of medicines on the PBS”.",59
50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,Is the amendment seconded? Ms King-I second the amendment.,66
51,Mr BROADBENT,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"Of course we will be opposing the second reading amendment to the National Health Amendment (Budget MeasuresPharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005. Obviously the shadow minister has jumped ahead of the game because I am sure, with the consideration given by the people involved in the dispensing of medications under the rule that she has just mentioned, the proposal she has put forward as well as the examples she has outlined will be covered by reasonable people working through the process. There will be a number of drugs, of course, in this whole process that will not be subject to the 20-day rule and there will be further information going to doctors and pharmacists of people who have chronic diseases. The government today is putting forward this legislation to further strengthen the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and cement its commitment to essential, accessible and quality medicines for all Australians. In fact, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the most important supports for older Australians that this government has supported. Not only has it been supported by this government but also, as was mentioned by the shadow minister, the government has corralled even further numbers of Australians into the PBS and increased its eligibility for older Australians. This is a very important scheme for older Australians. The governrequire ment acknowledges that it allows people to inside live a longer, healthier and happier life. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme sets out to restrict and subsidise the amount that people pay over the counter for their medicines while facilitating a continuation of the sale of high-quality pharmaceutical items. It is in effect a legislated safeguard to protect the vulnerable in our community, particularly those individuals and families who rely on continuous and large quantities of medicines for a variety of illnesses, whilst ensuring that they are as cost affordable as possible. I know of many people in my electorate of MCMillan who have children or loved ones requiring large doses of particular medicines on a long-term basis to treat a variety of debilitating illnesses. I reiterate that the Australian government will not forget the plight of people in MCMillan who find themselves, even in prosperous economic times, financially marginalised by such unavoidable circumstances. The government will always keep in mind the needs and concerns of those that are least able in our community to look after themselves. This legislation will build and strengthen the PBS and, with it, the support and protection it offers people in the Australian community who need it most. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has rightly earned us the envy of many other countries with first-class health care systems. In the United States, for example, this is evidently so for a variety of drugs. In facilitating the measures made in the 2005-06 budget, this legislation will amend part VII of the National Health Act 1953, the act relating to certain aspects of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In building and strengthening the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the government has put forward several amendments to the current legislation that will implement new safety net patient copayment arrangements for some pharmaceutical benefits where the benefit is supplied within 20 days of a previous supply. The amendments will also increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS safety net entitlements. Part VII of the National Health Act provides for subsidised access to high-quality medicines and includes mechanisms which support quality use of medicines and appropriate use of government resources. In other words, the taxpayer is important. Supporting our war veterans for the tremendous service they have selflessly given our nation is a sponsibility the Australian government takes very seriously. In maintaining our commitment to this, expenditure on the PBS and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for veterans has grown at an average rate, as the shadow minister said, of 12 per cent per annum for the last 10 years. In 2004-05, this equated to a cost of around $6,500 million. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an invaluable asset to Australia's health care system and the measures the government is putting forward will ensure its success and survival for generations to come. Part of this strengthening also includes a widening of the PBS safety net threshold over the next four years and introduces safety net arrangements for the early supply of some PBS medicines. This will be of great comfort to thousands of people in my electorate who rely on the PBS to meet their shortand long-term health care needs. The government is in a position to put these measures forward only after considered and prudential planning that allows the strengthening of the PBS today yet sets in place careful fiscal management that will see the PBS available for generations of families and individuals as the years go forward. While supporting Australia's needs today under the PBS, we as a government must also be mindful that the system is carefully planned for the long-term future. The government recognises that, in putting forward these amendments, we are investing further trust in the judgment of people who rely on PBS medicines to use them wisely. I referred earlier to the strengthening and widening of the PBS safety net threshold. The threshold for general patients will increase by an amount equal to two general patient copayments and the threshold for concessional card holders will increase by two concessional copayments each year from 2006 to 2009. Where currently the general resafety net threshold is $874.90, it will proportionately develop by amounts equal to two indexed copayments each year for four years, resulting in a safety net threshold in 2009 which includes eight additional copayments. For those Australians reliant on the concessional safety net threshold, currently $239.20 and equal to 52 prescription copayments, it will increase by two copayments each year to 54 prescriptions in 2006, 56 in 2007, 58 in 2008 and 60 in 2009. These increases will be a welcome relief to many and will come into effect on 1 January each year, in addition to the usual annual indexation based on CPI. Contained in the amendments put forward in the legislation is also the inclusion of the safety net 20-day rule, which in effect ratifies responsible accessible use of PBS medicines. Through this measure, instead of attempting to bulk-buy excess quantities of a drug based on financial restrictions, patients will achieve the best value for PBS copayments by complying with the set entitlements. This amendment is responsible and fair. The introduction of the safety net 20-day rule is sensitive and practical in that it will only apply to PBS medicines where, on expert advice, it is appropriate. This will aid in the alleviation of inappropriate and potentially dangerous amounts of oversupply. Still mindful of this, the government also recognises that, where appropriate, if an additional or early supply of one of these medicines is required, it will be eligible for PBS subsidy but not eligible for safety net benefits. The amendments put forward in this legislation support a PBS that is accessible and sustainable. The Howard government is committed to easing the strain on people weighed down by the physical and financial duress of shortand long-term illness and, as such, the safety net will continue to play an important role in protecting people from financially out-of-reach costs that they may incur for PBS medicines. It is also important that we have regard the people in each of our electorates. In my electorate, for instance, I have people located around the smaller pharmacies who may only occasionally come to town-some only once a week and others a few times a month. My local pharmacists have raised the issues of access for those people with me and there were some considerations and discussions with my local pharmacists about this issue prior to this bill coming into the House. I said before that there will be a list of drugs that are not covered by the 20-day rule. They are yet to be brought forward-the pharmaceutical board will list them for us. The measure will actually help to ensure that pharmacists supply medicines to consumers only when they are needed. Commonsense will prevail for those situations whereby a medicine is lost. When a patient has a prescription for multiple supplies of medicine, he or she is normally not able to obtain a repeat supply until 21 days-which is the proposal-after the previous supply was issued. To avoid hardship, the script can be presented earlier using the PBS immediate supply provisions if the drugs have been lost, damaged or are needed for immediate treatment. However, from 1 January 2006, supply of some of the medicines under the immediate supply provisions will be excluded from the PBS safety net entitlements, and this will have two effects. Consumer copayments for these medicines will not accrue towards the safety net tally and the copayment amount that will apply after the safety net threshold is reached will be the person's standard copayment amount, not the reduced safety net amount, which I mentioned before. It is a measure for good practice and safe use of medicines and it will help to make the use of funding for the PBS more effective. Doctors will still be able to write a prescription for for which all repeats of the medicine are dispensed at the one time if that is necessary for the patient. The PBS rules allow for medicines to be supplied at intervals which reflect treatment needs and are flexible enough to allow convenient access for repeat supplies. This measure does take away the incentive for people to stockpile medicines when they do not really need them. There is a saving to the PBS of some $70 million over the four years. These measures should not be presented by the shadow minister as a further scare campaign for older Australians. Older Australians are very important to the Howard government. I think older Australians are very important to the opposition, too, and I do not think they would want to send a scare campaign message out into electorates right across Australia telling older people that they are going to have a problem, because they are not going to have a problem. People will be protected and looked after under this very expensive scheme covered by taxpayers. It should be remembered that this scheme has been supported by every government since its introduction. It is a scheme that needs ongoing management so that we can provide the latest and best drugs and so that our community is enhanced by this world renowned scheme. Australians are living longer, better, healthier and, in some ways, happier lives because of it. There is nothing more debilitating within a family than ongoing disease if you do not have the support that this nation gives to its citizens through the PBS. It could be said that the Howard government is the best friend the PBS has ever had, but managing this process is a part of government and I would have thought that the opposition, particularly the Labor Party, would be supportive of fiscal management that is appropriate for the day. In fact, rather than calling on government backbenchers and worrying about what they might be saying to their constituents, I hope the opposition will support this bill, because whoever is in government has to manage this very good but very expensive scheme in a fiscally appropriate manner. All schemes such as this need ongoing attention. I thought that the attacks on the ister for Health and Ageing were really unfair because, throughout the whole of this process, parties have put forward different health policies at different times, as was by the shadow minister during the last election campaign. Medicare Gold became a dog of a policy for the opposition. However, when the opposition drops a dead cat on the table, as Medicare Gold was, we still have to remember that now and again the opposition may have some good ideas. We should always be open and listen to how we can improve the PBS and Medicare, and it has been said many times in this House that the Howard government is the best friend Medicare ever had. Rather than putting forward a scare campaign on the PBS-which is what the previous address amounted to; nothing more, nothing less-would it not be better if Labor came forward with some constructive ideas to manage the PBS through the years ahead to make it affordable for Australian taxpayers while providing the appropriate benefits to those in need of these medicines? All of us are touched by older people; all of us have older people around us. We can see the benefits. We can see that the changes to the PBS over the years have all enhanced the system. As I said before, more people have been brought into the pharmaceutical benefits net. This has benefited another whole generation of Australians. If you have children with an ongoing need for these medicines, you will be provided for. A lost school bag will not be a reason for not being able to access medicines. It is just not on that a proposal like that would be put forward in this House. How many times have I heard, in my various visits to this House, the opposition put forward scare campaign after scare campaign, whether on aged care, pharmaceutical benefits or any of those health issues. Privately I hear some very Mingood proposals from some Labor members. Mr Jenkins-Don't publish your diaries!",66
52,Mr BROADBENT,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"I will not be publishing my diaries, ever! Labor members do seen not come into this House and put forward appropriate proposals that may benefit the scheme. I hope the next speaker surprises me. I hope the next speaker makes a positive contribution to this debate, having regard to the benefits of this scheme that are crucial to the nation as a whole and to how we can benefit older Australians and those with an ongoing need for these medicines. This has been the program of all programs. Every government is going to have to deal with the cost of this system. In a strong economy like ours, we must be free to alter these policies so that they fit with today's community. I believe that these changes will benefit the taxpayer and those in need of these medicines. I commend the bill to the House.",69
53,Mr JENKINS,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"The purpose of the National Health Amendment (Budget Measures-Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005 is to amend part VII of the National Health Act 1953 to put in place certain measures announced with respect to the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, in the 2005-06 budget. The amendments will implement new safety net and patient copayment arrangements to do with the supply of some medicines within 20 days of a previous supply and increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS safety net entitlements. Before the member for MCMillan leaves the chamber, I would like to congratulate him on his courageous effort to defend the decision on the PBS in this year's budget. I am not sure that I will be able to rise to high mark and make suggestions about how we can improve the PBS, but I intend to pose a number of questions in relation to the beneings. fit of the PBS as against other forms of treatment that I believe the government, if has a rational approach to the sustainability of the PBS, should be addressing. The surprising thing about the PBS is the way in which it affects all Australians, because of course it enables the supply of essential pharmaceuticals not only to older Australians but to all Australians. It makes them accessible and affordable. The honourable member for MCMillan is correct: the Australian PBS is a system that is the envy of the world. On both sides of this chamber-therefore, on both sides of the political spectrum in Australia-we have consistently sought to defend the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I put to the House that we have to remember to look at this measure in the context that it follows on from measures in the 2004-05 budget, which had the effect of savings on the PBS of $1.3 billion over the next four years. So 12 months before this year's budget the government said, ‘We have a problem. We have to address the sustainability of the PBS.' What did they do? They put in place a range of extreme measures to make savings of $1.3 billion. Twelve months later, with a general election in between, we then have the government coming forward with another couple of proposals, which are the subject of this legislation, to make further savings on the PBS to the value of some $210 million over the next four years. The point that has to be stressed in this debate is this. Before the 2004 budget the cry was, ‘We have a problem with the PBS, so we will put in place measures'-savage measures. Twelve months later, in the 2005 budget, what is the cry from the governhis ment? ‘We've got a problem with the PBS. We've got to put in place more measures.' So there is a further $0.2 billion of alleged savWhat sort of way is this to put in place policy proposals? Surely when the governit ment went to the people in October last year they could not have had this proposal, because they did not put it to the Australia public! As the shadow minister, the member for Lalor, has said, they were not out trotting around saying, ‘We've hit you for $1.4 billion worth of savings on the PBS in this year's budget. Next year we will be hitting you again for another $200 million worth of savings.' No siree. There was either a high level of deception in the way that they approached last year's election or in fact, after October, yet again, somebody was sitting around the cabinet table or in a subcommittee of cabinet and said: ‘We've got a problem with the PBS. It's out of control. We need another measure in this budget.' My problem is that I believe we will get to next year's budget, the 2006 budget, and, given the state of the poor old PBS-the $5.5 billion, the increases averaging seven per cent a yearthe cabinet again will say: ‘It's out of control. We need another measure.' That is the problem that the honourable member for MCMillan has. Whilst he was courageous, and he is the only person that is going to step up to the plate to support the parliamentary secretary who introduced this piece of legislation on behalf of the minister-and I compliment him for his couragethat is his difficulty. While he says he is proud of the government protecting the PBS, in the time that he has been outside this place before he came back for his third visit, he knows that there have been changes to the PBS over the course of the Howard government. Obviously they have been incompetent in putting these changes in place, because they have come up with another piece of legislation. My positive suggestion to the member for MCMillan is that he get down to the party room and say to Minister Abbott that it is a nonsense that year in, year out he has changes. As I have said in debates on previous health legislation, this is typical minister. Every month there is a different idea. It is out of control. Sometimes his proposals countervail others. As the custodian of the Australian health system, he ought to step back and do a proper study. Money is being thrown into other areas-the private health rebate and the safety net uncapped out-ofpocket expenses. There is money being thrown at problems, but in the wrong direction. At least there is some consistency in way they approach the PBS. The consistency is that they clamp down on the consumerthey clamp down and shift costs to the individual. I say this to the member for MCMillanand this is a fairly rough piece of economics and financial analysis: the explanatory memorandum on the increase of the safety net thresholds says that, in the fourth year, 2008-09, when we have gone from the equivalent of needing 52 scripts to be eligible for the safety net to the equivalent of 60 scripts, this will be a saving to the Commonwealth of $71 million. There are 150 seats in this House. If I divide $71 million by 150-I know this is a bit of voodoo economics-that is $500,000 to the seat of MCMillan. The other aspect of the voodoo economics analysis is that, if in fact we keep seeing the same number of scripts and the savings that are achieved by the increase in the threshold number of scripts from 52 to 60, that $500,000 is coming out of the pockets of people that live in the electorate of MCMillan. The only other way that there can be savings is there will not be the same number of scripts. That might be because people actually cannot afford them, and that brings a bigger problem for the member for MCMillan. This is not a scare campaign; this is stating the facts that the minister for health of this has to be up front about. Back in 1993-I think that is about the time period; it might be before that I was a backbench member of a government that did a bit about copayments and the PBS. The reason for doing that, unashamedly, was not necessarily to cost shift to the private person, to have them paying, but to set a marker. The belief was that by setting a copayment there would be a marker in the thought processes the gone through with the patient in discussion with the doctor for writing the script. The marker would say: ‘Is this really needed? Because we are putting an imposition on the patient themselves.' So, unashamedly, an aspect of that piece of policy was to set in place a reason for a reduction in the scripts. This led to a great deal of debate within the Labor Party caucus, but the point is that that was the basis. Going forward to the 2004 budget, the copayment itself was radically increased, and then in this year's budget the threshold was increased. That is not about setting markers. That is about shifting the responsibility for a large portion of the cost of essential medicines onto the person themselves; let us make no mistake. So that is the point at which we really have to think about what we intend by these sorts of measures. I believe there needs to be a bit of a deep breath, a step back by government and an analysis of the way that the PBS contributes to the level of wellness as much as to attacking illness in Australia. If it is about that, and if in fact, the basis of cost, people are avoiding having scripts dispensed and therefore heading down the track of unnecessary hospitalisations or the like, we have a problem. They are the things that I think we need to study. They are the things we really need to look at. If the anecdotal evidence is correct that disadvantaged and low-income Australians, as part of their discretionary decisions about what they purchase, have to decide that they will not get scripts dispensed because they cannot afford them, we have a big problem as a nation. The bean counters who look at these things ought to realise that the consequence of that is the person getting sicker and that therefore it is leading to other forms of more expensive treatment. I chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs back in 1993. We held a large inquiry right through the whole kit and caboodle from the pharmaceutical industry to pharmacies. One of the things that we always talked about during that inquiry was that we had to acknowledge that, in a cost-benefit analysis, the PBS is really very good value. I do not see a discussion and debate about the cost benefit of the PBS when we are looking at decisions like this. It is merely, ‘$1.37 billion saved last year; $210 million'-or whatever the figure is-‘saved this year,' without really looking at the potential for the loss of benefit. So, to the honourable member for MCMillan, that is where I say we are coming from. We are asking: are these measures actually appropriate? If he is going to get upon this, his third visit back to this place-as the lone government voice in support of these measures and talk about how good the PBS system is, let us step back. Why doesn'the come on board and say, ‘We'll have a proper inquiry; we'll have another look'? He was part of the community affairs committee on back in 1993 on his first visit to this place. He was part of the inquiry and he was a great contributor. But I want him to go back to MCMillan-it is not a scare campaign-and explain to them what value or peace of mind the punters of MCMillan are getting for their half a million dollars worth of savings in 2008-09, the out year of the four years of these measures, when the overall saving to the budget is $70 million, or explain how the $22 million nationally that is being saved by the 20-day rule gives them peace of mind. It is the reverse of the scare campaign: get out and give the assurances. Of the 37 million PBS subsidised prescriptions filled in Victoria, the share of the seat of Scullin in 2004-05 was nearly 966,000. Of these PBS subsidised prescriptions, the number for concession card holders was 930,409 in 2004-05. The total number of PBS subsidised prescriptions for nonconcession card holders in Victoria was 1.5 million and in Scullin was 33,000. The interesting figure is that the minority of scripts under the PBS are for non-concession card holders-something like four per cent in Victoria and 3½ per cent in Scullin. So, whilst of course the purpose of the PBS is to make essential medicines affordable and accessible to all Australians, it has its greatest impact concession card holders. We should never get away from that. We should never forget that. It is a very important aspect of the way Australia has put in place its health system. I support the honourable member for Lalor's second reading amendment, because I think it goes to issues that the government is not considering in the mishmash of proposals it has had over time for improving the PBS. I think that the government has to say to people that the benefit of the PBS far outweighs the cost; but do the savings, in the same manner, not lead to a greater loss of the benefit? Last year's budget proposals, on the evidence of figures early this year, have reduced the increase in the number of scripts down to something like one per cent. So there is a dynamic going on. If, as I contend, there has been a clamp on the demand over the journey since the copayment has been put in place, and if we have a further reduction, will that go below the line we want to go to? In a national sense, will that go below the line at which we get the full benefit from the PBS? This government has not been characterised by doing full investigation of public policy areas. There is not one area of public policy where we can say that this government has had an approach where it has put out in the marketplace for discussion and debate a full proposal about anything. The thing that characterised the Hawke and Keating years, especially in social policy, was that we were always out there putting forward proposals on housing and health et cetera-fully documented research that we put out to people who were interested so that they could have full discussion. We never see that from this government. What we see is policy on the run. It is either in the context of putting in all the dastardly things that create savings in the budget or, at election time, throwing a few sweeteners around and not really worryon ing about where the money is thrown or thinking about the outcome; it is just to grab the headline. It is about time this government stepped back and got fair dinkum, or in next May's budget we will find a further proposal: because the PBS is in disarray, it needs further savings. It is a nonsense; the government needs to be consistent and look at the overall problem.",70
54,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,I thank the member for Scullin for his eloquent and entertaining contribution.,73
55,Mr HAYES,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"The lengths to which this government will go now that it controls both houses of this parliament almost know no bounds. This government continues to amaze me when it comes to the extent to which it is prepared to wield its new-found powers as it continues to hack away at some of the fundamentals of our society. I oppose the National Health Amendment (Budget MeasuresPharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005. I do not want to see it simply amended or watered down; I simply do not want to see it passed. This bill represents the extent of meanness of this government. It is yet another example of the obsession with implementing two-tiered systems when it comes to government services. The Howard government's great social engineering experiment that we have seen thus far includes the introduction of a twotiered system in health; a two-tiered system in education and training; this morning, a two-tiered system in student services; and a two-tiered system in industrial relations, which is currently emerging. Now the government wants to apply it to pharmaceuticals. But, of course, that is really not going far enough. Given half a chance, this government acts to exacerbate disadvantage by introducing charges like those we have before us today. This is probably the perfect time for the government to slip through these changes, which it was too scared to take to the electorate at the time of the last election little over 12 months ago. It is the perfect time to slip through changes to the PBS under the guise of sustainability and under cover of a $100 million advertising campaign on its extreme industrial relations agenda. Members opposite may be wondering why I and my colleagues on the Labor side are upset about this bill. They might be wondering why we regard this as being of such importance. The reason is quite simple. These changes go to the core of people's well-being. By and large, they have the most impact on those who can least afford it, and they impact on families. No-one wants to get sick, but when they do they want to know that they can have access to affordable and highquality health and that they can obtain, at a reasonable price, the medicines they need to get back to good health. Under the changes in the bill being debated today, the simple desire to get better and to be well again now comes at a higher price. Of course, this will not come about just through one price but through a complex set of rules put in place to shift the cost of health care from government to consumers. I am sure the government is pleased that it did not have to pass a no-disadvantage test on this to contend with the development of this piece of policy, because the solution would certainly not have stacked up. I have to wonder whether the minister has produced a family impact statement, one that is satisfactory to Senator Fielding, because this legislation certainly does impact on families. This bill will introduce a complex set of rules, possibly the bluntest instrument available to the government, which it claims will support the affordability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme well into the future. But this bill and the policy it introduces do nothing to support the affordability or the susa tainability of the PBS. This bill simply shifts the costs off the government books and into the pockets of sick people and families. The bill claims to support sustainability of the PBS by doing two things: firstly, it sets in place a new safety net and new patient copayment arrangements; and, secondly, it introduces a threshold for eligibility for the safety net entitlements. This is where a new 20-day rule comes in. The bill before us introduces a 20-day rule aimed at stopping the accumulation of medicines and the filling of scripts in order to reach the safety net expenditure threshold early. While not wanting to make light of issues of health or the PBS, I do find the government's underlying agenda in this scheme somewhat amusing. As we have heard from previous speakers, a 20-day rule implements a time limit for filling a script. Under the 20day rule, a resupply within 20 days of a previous supply of the same pharmaceuticals for the same person will not count towards the calculation of the safety net entitlement. The copayment will not accrue towards the safety net threshold. The stated aim of this part of the bill is to discourage people from obtaining additional or early supplies to reduce the risk of wastage-or at least that is what it seems to be. It points to a clear concern of the government that people are either seeking to fill additional scripts and hiding medicines away in the cupboard or simply seeking to gain their medicines early. I must admit that I do not know the extent of this problem-or even if it is a real problem-but it seems to me that people who are engaging in that sort of behaviour are doing so because of flaws in the existing system. These people are almost being accused of being rational agents because they know that once they reach a certain level of copayments the cost of their pharmaceuticals will be reduced-or at least that seems to be the government's argument. It would seem to me that the motivating factor in this is not the desire to have more pharmaceuticals; it is the desire to reach the threshold. The threshold has created a perverse incentive for consumers, and I have to wonder whether setting some form of arbitrary time frame in which the same pharmaceuticals cannot be purchased would be the best way of addressing this problem-if indeed it is a problem. I find it particularly teresting that the immediate supply provisions that allow for subsidised resupply in the case of loss or destruction will also be subject to the 20-day rule, and those intending to travel will not receive any exemption. One can only wonder what sorts of abuses of the PBS travellers have been perpetrating to have this rule applied to them. The most significant of the two changes, when it comes to the concerns of the young families in my electorate, are the changes to the threshold for the safety net entitlements. This will result in a double whammy for patients. The changes contained in this bill do not introduce just one increase but set in train a series of increases in the threshold for each and every year, right through to 2009. Members opposite may scoff and say that this is not a big deal, that there are only increases in the threshold. I wish it were that simple. This bill implements increases in the threshold by an amount equal to two indexed general patient copayments in each of these years. This means that the current general safety net level of $874.90 will gradually increase to a level in 2009 that is the equivalent of eight additional copayments over its current level. As the previous speaker, the member for Scullin, said, the position with concession card holders is also not spared in this instance. The concessional safety net has also been caught up in this legislation. Over the next four years the concessional rate will rise from its current level of $239.20-or the equivalent of 52 copayments-to a level equivalent to 60 copayments in 2009. While most would think that the introduction of a new system of increasing the safety net would supersede the existing one, the government has decided to stick with its own two-tiered philosophy here as well. Currently the safety net increases are on 1 January each inyear and increase at the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, and the government has made it clear that this situation will continue. So what Australians will face when they wake up on New Year's Day of each year from next year through to 2009-in addition to any possible after-effects of the celebrations of the night before-will be an increase in the PBS safety net threshold. Let us be perfectly clear on what will happen. There will be an increase in the safety net well above the rate of inflation. The threshold will not simply be adjusted to indexation; there will be an out-and-out increase. We will have a two-tiered increment in the safety net to match the two-tiered PBS. The government claim that these changes are necessary to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the PBS. They argue that increfour mental changes are necessary because they will limit the alleged rorting of the existing scheme through the advance purchase of medications and the hoarding of medications, all done so that people can reach the safety net level of expenditure. If that really is the case, I find this is a pretty strange policy solution. It is a strange policy solution that did not make its way into the coalition's policy material released during the last election campaign. It is a policy solution that only came to light as a measure in this year's budget. The way that this bill and its measures are introduced will produce the desired effect, because they will stop people from using medicine. Health care costs are already one of the single biggest threshold budget items for Australian families, and this policy is going to make those costs bigger. This costshifting exercise will mean that, more than ever, people will be thinking twice about going to the doctor or taking their kids to doctor. Initially it was about whether or not they could find a bulk-billing doctor; now it will be about whether they can afford to have the script filled. The people who will find themselves at the greatest disadvantage when it comes to accessing medicines under this scheme are those already doing it tough under this government. The people who are facing considerable cuts to their welfare payments under the government's draconian welfare-to-work reforms are facing yet another setback. Families in my electorate are already doing it tough and this change means that things are going to get worse for them. The people of Werriwa are already facing significant increases in the price of petrol, which this government has refused to do anything about. Many families in my electorate are also suffering at the hands of the family tax benefit system and have to repay almost $1.5 million because of that flawed system. This is on top of already high mortgage repayments which, if the indications of the Reserve Bank as reported two nights ago are anything to go by, may go even higher. Now, when the family budget is already stretched to breaking point, they have to deal with this-policies that do nothing to lift the sure that families and family budgets are currently under. The instruments employed here are probably the bluntest that could have been employed by the government. Generally speaking, those who can least afford the copayments will be most affected by this change, and they are often those in society who, on average, have the highest propensity to suffer an illness. Higher copayments will cut down the use of pharmaceuticals, but it is also likely to mean that those groups who need access to pharmaceuticals will no longer be able to afford them. This is another mean act from a mean government. This bill the introduces another system where those who can afford access will get access and those who cannot afford it will be deprived. This bill has nothing to do with the sustainability of the PBS; it is about the sustainability of the government's budget position. After the government splashed around cash during the last campaign in an effort to secure victory, it has realised that, in order to maintain its budget position, it is necessary to cut costs elsewhere. It is necessary to shift costs from the government books and foist them on the broader populace. Put simply, Labor does not believe in a two-tiered health system. It does not believe that, in order to fix a system, it needs to remove access to the system from those least able to afford it. The price mechanism is a powerful tool which-I have to concede-can produce positive results. By the same token, price is also a powerful tool for producing vastly inferior outcomes if it is used wrongly. The changes implemented by this bill are a fine example of that. Labor believes that the PBS is an investment in the health of all Australians. It should not be abused; it should be used wisely and it should be financially sustainable. With this bill the government has signalled that it is determined to continue to presremove access to affordable health care. It has done this by introducing a scheme that will produce not one, not two, not even three, but in effect 12 increases in the safety net threshold for the PBS over the next four years. The passage of this bill will not make the PBS any more sustainable, it will not fix the growing hole in the budget and it will not introduce any further incentives for new medicines to be listed on the PBS. Access to the high-quality medical care that we have available in Australia should not be rationed simply on the basis of the ability to pay. We have all heard stories from people who continue to feel as though they have been ripped off by private health insurers as the minister continues to rubber stamp increases in their premiums, and now they are going to face this. This bill is a manifestation in legislation of an out-of-touch government thatbecause their fourth term agenda only extends as far as destroying the rights of working Australians-is bereft of ideas and is trying to paper over cracks that it has already created for itself through the high-tax, highspending regime that it has presided over for the last decade. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, when he introduced this bill, crowed: The safety net will continue to play an important role in protecting people from high out-of-pocket costs for PBS medicines. Surely this cannot be believed with regard to the structure of this piece of legislation. I oppose this bill and I oppose everything that this government has done to destroy a health system that once provided safety and security for all Australians, comfortable in the knowledge that if they happened to get sick they could seek and find help through an affordable and equitable system.",73
56,Mr MELHAM,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"The National Health Amendment (Budget Measures-Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005 seeks to ensure that the cost of health will continue to be prohibitive for those people who can least afford it. This government is rapidly turning the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme into a two-tiered system whereby the wealthy can obtain prescriptions but the not-so-wealthy need to juggle which prescriptions they can afford. The PBS was introduced by the Chifley government to guarantee access by all Australian citizens to 130 lifesaving medicines. There were two High Court challenges and a constitutional referendum before the PBS was finally introduced. It was social reform designed to provide ‘universal and affordable access to medicines'. Significantly it has been the only public health initiative to receive a democratic mandate through a referendum. This government has introduced a raft of changes since coming to office, none of which has assisted in the objective of ‘universal and affordable access'. In January 1999, the eligibility criteria for the seniors health card was extended. Apart from other benefits, the card allows its recipients to receive prescription medicines through the PBS at concession rates. Prior to the 2001 election, the government altered the eligibility criteria for self-funded retirees to access the Commonwealth seniors card. Far be it from me to suggest that this decision may have had a political motive. The change meant that people over pension age who were not in receipt of the age pension and whose annual income was less than $50,000 for singles or less than $80,000 combined for couples were able to qualify for the card. I note that the changes in the 2001 budget also meant access to bulkbilling. I do not begrudge self-funded retirees having access to the concessional rates of the PBS, but I do find it interesting that this direct impact on the cost of the PBS has not been referred to when the government speaks of cost blow-outs. This change must have had a substantial impact on the cost of the PBS to the Commonwealth. When the copayment concept was introduced in November 1990, pensioners faced a cost of $2.50 per prescription for the first time. However, to minimise the impact on low-income earners, the Hawke Labor government increased the pension and introduced a ‘safety net'. At the time, the use of discretionary drugs was lowered. In the 2001-02 budget there was a 27 per cent increase in the copayment amount, and safety net thresholds were increased. No compensation measure was introduced by this government to assist those adversely affected, and the number of prescriptions filled subsequently dropped. The impact on the PBS budget projections was further exacerbated by the government's failure to correctly assess the actual costs the drugs Celebrex and Zyban. The 2005-06 budget proposed changes which were introduced on 1 January this year. These changes included another increase in the copayment and raised the level of the safety net. Concession card holders will now pay $4.60 for most prescriptions, up from $3.60. General users are now paying up to $28.60-up from $22.40. The increase in the safety net means that, for general card holders, the threshold has increased by $188.50 to $874.90. For concession card holders, the threshold has moved to $239.20, or 52 scripts, in a calendar year. These measures are estimated to save the government around $1.1 million over the next four years. It seems to me that the government might pursue a fairer policy position by using some of the money spent on government advertising to fund the PBS. The same budget committed $45 million to four advertising campaigns that I am aware of. This is on top of $27.6 million on campaigns current at the time of the budget and a further estimated $35.1 million on pending campaigns. Prior to the last election, the government promised it would pay 12.5 per cent less for PBS drugs when the first generic version of each new drug group was made available to the market. Earlier this year, the minister announced that the much-trumpeted generics policy had resulted in a special patient contribution for four drugs. I am advised that these are special drugs for lung cancer, depression and epilepsy, which do not have generic equivalents but are listed in the same therapeutic categories as those that do. These drugs on the PBS will only be able to be obtained by people who need them if they pay the PBS copayment in addition to the government's special patient contribution-for example, Alimta, which is a drug for lung of cancer, will cost a patient around $460 in the special patient contribution if they need it. For sufferers of lung cancer, I doubt that there is any choice. But what if you cannot find the $460? The government has introduced many of these changes based on the increase in the overall cost of the PBS. I agree that the PBS must be sustainable into the future so that all generations can have access to the best pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the world. But at what social cost? These short-term solutions do not provide for the long-term sustainability of the PBS. Growth rates of PBS are not uniform. Since 1993-94, the average annual PBS growth rate, in real terms, has been around 11 per cent. In 200102 the rate of increase on spending on the PBS was 22 per cent over the previous year. The government failed to recognise that this increase was primarily due to the policy of raising the income limit for access to the Commonwealth seniors card; together with the cost blow-outs in Celebrex and Zyban. The government panicked, and we saw the introduction of the measures I have previously mentioned. Since June 2002 the growth in the cost of the PBS declined from the high of 22 per cent to 10 per cent in 2002-03; eight per cent in 2003-04 and 10 per cent in 2004-05. Expenditure for the next few years is anticipated to be under 10 per cent, while reaching 10 per cent again in 2007-08. Yet, in the first six months of this year, since the increase in the copayment, growth in the cost of the PBS has slowed to 2.8 per cent. Over the past nine years there has been a steady erosion of the PBS coupled with a steady cost increase to the consumer. Anecdotal and statistical evidence shows that these changes have impacted most directly on lower income earners and concession card holders. For example, in the first six months of this year, the number of concessional prescriptions grew by only one per cent and general scripts dropped by 5.1 per cent. Research by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment in 1993 showed that, while copayments may reduce excess consumption by people on moderate or high incomes, they may deter people on low incomes. Anecdotally, it has been suggested that, when medicines have a direct impact on the household budget, people will choose to decrease their use of preventive drugs and increase the use of drugs which relieve symptoms. For example, a person may not take medication to reduce hypertension but rather take analgesics to remove a headache. Analgesics are cheaper than a prescription. This government continues to chronically mismanage the PBS based on short-term solutions rather than long-term sustainability. Let me quote a specific example. Two of my constituents have asked me to make representations on their behalf to the minister. One is currently taking the long-lasting insulin Lantus. This costs $160 per month and the constituent finds it effective. The other constituent is pleading that Lantus be considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for her husband's condition. Both constituents have advised my office that the manufacturer has approached the PBAC to have Lantus listed on the PBS but has been unsuccessful. Yet two other longacting insulin products are being withdrawn from the PBS, and I am advised that Lantus could be one of the substitutes. I am told that the PBAC may have felt constrained in its approval decisions by pressures from the government to rein in the costs of the PBS. This is simply unacceptable. We hear nothing from the government on the fundamental concept of prevention rather than cure. My colleague the member for Lalor in a speech on 25 August quoted Canadian researchers. This research shows that there is a substitution between pharmaceuticals and medical services-that is, when the price of pharmaceuticals rises people are more likely to go to the doctor more often. Commonsense says that it must be cheaper to treat the symptoms not cure the illness. Consider someone with hypertension paying $28.60 per month for medication to reduce their blood pressure, which is offset by the PBS. Surely this is cheaper for the Commonwealth than paying for that person to remain in hospital while being treated for heart attack or stroke. In their submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry on the impact of advances in medical technology on health care expenditure in Australia, the Australian National University stated: Co-payments inhibit the use of essential medicines (including those for hypertension, high cholesterol, asthma, depression, heart conditions, diabetes, and thyroid conditions). Reducing the use of such essential medicines may cost the health system much more money than it saves. The federal government has three key responsibilities in the health area: the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare and hospitals. It does not take a rocket scientist to realise that it is more cost effective for the overall health budget to fund the PBS realistically than to spend on the higher end of the health system. Subsidising the PBS should be able to be offset by lower growth in hospital and medical costs. Medicines are subsidised, priced and prescribed with the goal of avoiding the higher end of treatment costs, which may otherwise be incurred through patients' use of hospital and medical services. The true purpose of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme remains social rather than financial. It fulfils a vital role of social justice and uity for the whole community by facilitating universal access to essential medicines. In achieving this objective, the government continues to fail dismally. I think the great tragedy is that we have a government approaching its 10th anniversary. What does it have to show for it? This is one area it is going backwards on. We know that $100 million has been allocated for advertising the government's spin when it comes to the changes in workplace relations. How that $100 million could be used on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is easy to imagine. It would make a contribution to our society instead of the negative advertising that we are subjected to. We are told that the figures, when that $100 million is spent, will be in the order of $1 billion worth of advertising over that 10-year period. That is a disgrace when the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at the moment is being mismanaged by this government. I say to the government: you have been elected to govern for all Australians. Stop governing for some Australians. Cut out the rhetoric. It is about time PBS and other worthy schemes are properly funded instead of your advertising for spin purposes.",77
57,Mr HATTON,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"I am happy to speak in conjunction with the rest of my colleagues on the National Health Amendment (Budget MeasuresPharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005. I point out, as the member for Scullin did, that there was one solitary member of the government willing to step up to the plate and argue the government's case. The member for MCMillan was the only backbencher willing to support the case put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing. You might wonder why government members are so unwilling to argue the case for the government. If you eqhave a look at what is in this bill, you will see that there is very good reason for the government members to be scurrying away from these provisions. This bill fundamentally injures the safety net that has been put in place to help people who are chronically ill avoid the need to expend moneys that they do not have on medicines that they need. Under Labor, the provisions that were put in in relation to this safety net ensured that the people who most needed the medicines, those who were most chronically ill, would be able to afford them, because the level of copayment was affordable. We ensured that once people got to the relevant level of prescription then, from that point, if they were a concession card holder, they would be able to get the rest of their prescriptions for that particular year free. For people who were general payees, we ensured that there were arrangements once they got to the level of the safety net. This has a dramatic impact on every Australian family, whether it is a single person in a household or whether it is a mother, father and a number of children. the When people were most pressed in looking to the care of their family and the health of their family, then, if they had expended up to the level of the safety net-once they got to that point-they could be assured that the extra expenditure that they might have to undertake would not be imposed on them. What do we find under this government? We find that under this government there was a 30 per cent increase in the amount that concession card holders and general people had to pay for the cost of all their medicines. It is now $4.60 per prescription up to a level of 52 prescriptions per year that concession card holders have to pay. What is the provision in this bill for people on concession cards? For the next three years, it will go up by another two scripts per year. We will find that after 1 January 2006 it will be 54 prescriptions in that year of 2006. In 2007 it will be 56. In 2008 it will go to 58 prescriptions. What will happen when we come to deal with people who are in the general category? They can face up to $28.60 for each of two extra prescriptions, because that is the increase for this year. I am not sure, but there may be a rise in those categories as well. The government argues that, first, it is a question of cost-benefit analysis and, second, it has to protect the community as a whole from people who might overuse or abuse the system. What is this system about if it is not about a safety net? The Minister for Health and Ageing may as well abolish the whole safety net entirely, and do it openly, rather than doing it by stealth, as he is here in this bill. The impact with the general provisions is on the number of prescriptions but there is also the specific provision that you cannot get a repeat medicine in less than 20 days. What if you are coming to the end of a period and you have already reached the safety net? For a person in the general category, you are looking at something like $879 a year before you even get to a concession. For any other medications you would pay $4.60 each instead of $28.60. Someone in that condition may be in a position where, for their own health benefit, they have to go and get a prescription. What is the impact of this if you have already reached the safety net? What is here in this bill is pretty simple: you can front up with $28.60, thank you very much. You will pay full freight. The expectation of the government is that it will make a great many savings-in the order of $140 million. Those savings will come from the pockets of pensioners and concessionaries and from the general population. There is a simple situation that many people will face. They will be asked to pay the full cost of those medicines when they need them. If a person has a repeat prescription, fundamentally there is a medical reason for that. I will give a simple and direct example of what that might be. I have twice suffered from a condition where I have had a cold sore directly in my eye. I take a prescription medication, Acyclovir. I have twice had that condition directly in the eye. I have it many times a year proximate to the eye-close to it. There is a potential that I could have it in the eye again. When I get that cold sore, I have to take the medication as a prophylactic and to fix the situation. I have to take the medication four to five times a day. It is only a very small tube, so I need the repeat tube. What does this provision say would happen if I reached that safety net point? Even if I am at the safety net point, if I need to get that provided on a repeat basis within 20 days it may be on the list of medicines that should be knocked out. In this simple example it is a situation where, if you do not use the medicine, you can lose your sight. That has happened to me twice when I got the cold sore directly in the eye. The ulceration had the effect that I lost part of the sight in my right eye. For any person who is a general member of the community or someone on a concession, the provisions of this bill lay out that the safety net will be stripped away. What should have been there to protect them will be ripped away from underneath them. It vitiates the whole purpose of the safety net being in existence. It will mean that people in similar positions, needing lifesaving drugs or drugs that could prevent the loss of sight or hearing, will be in a position where they will have to pay more for those if they need them. The provisions the minister for health has introduced here are savage and vicious. The changes to this safety net proposal are not based on the fact that the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been rising by 11, 10 or nine per cent a year. It is not because of those provisions. It is because of another set of safety net provisions-out-ofpocket provisions-that this minister for health introduced without a proper cost benefit analysis being done. He wilfully maintained the provisions prior to the last election and did not rein them in until after the election. The set of provisions in this bill mean not only that ordinary Australians will pay more for their prescriptions but also that their health will be challenged. The government seeks to take from them what previously was there. This provision was set up in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under the Chifley government and there was also the introduction of the safety net and its proper operation. The fact is that Australians who most need the help of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and this safety net-the weakest, the sickest and those who have the least money-will be put under incredibly greater pressure as a result of the viciousness of these proposals. It is possible to make savings under the PBS and to do it in an open and honest way. It is possible to say outright, prior to the election, that this is what the government intends to do-as it did last year when it saved $1.3 billion. This year it is $200 million to $400 million that the minister for health seeks to save. But it is also possible to do it in the way the minister for health has, in an underhanded way. Debate interrupted.",80

59,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Treasurer will be absent from question time today. He is travelling to China to attend the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting. I will answer questions on his behalf. NA Iraq,82
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement that a benchmark for Australia's job being done in Iraq is when the Iraqi security forces are able to deal adequately with the insurgency. I also refer to the US Senate testimony of General Casey, US Commander in Iraq. When asked how many battalions of the new Iraqi army were now capable of independent operations, General Casey replied: ‘One'. Given that it is now 2½ years since the invasion and the new Iraqi army effectively has only one battalion of 700 troops facing an estimated insurgency of 30,000, when exactly does the Prime Minister expect Iraq's security forces will be capable of dealing with the insurgency and when, therefore, will he detail to the Australian people his own exit strategy from Iraq?",82
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the testimony given by General Casey. I am also aware of separate assessments made by the Australian military that indicate that the security forces in Iraq which operate in the areas where Australians are deployed are improving in capability. That gives us grounds for some optimism. It is also the case that, when I visited Al Muthanna province in July, both the Australian military people to whom I spoke and the British military commander who came from Basra spoke positively of the improvements which had taken place in relation to the capacity of the Iraqi security forces. It is a slow process. I think that is self evident. But it is a very difficult task Iraqi security forces face. There are really two choices in Iraq. We can either persevere in the belief which the government holds that, through perseverance, a stable country will emerge, capable of looking after itself, or we can do as the opposition wants to do and cut and run and condemn the people of Iraq to the chaos, disorder and",82
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the member for Griffith on a point of order. Mr Rudd-Do you mean like you cut and run from Afghanistan, Prime Minister?",83
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Griffith will come to his point of order. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, the question asked for the Prime Minister to detail when he would put his exit strategy from Iraq to the Australian people.",83
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Griffith will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,83
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked by the member for Griffith shows very clearly the different approach that the two sides of this parliament have as to whether or not Iraq should be given the hope of a democratic future. The Labor Party do not believe in a democratic future for Iraq, whereas we on this side of the House do. Giving Iraq a democratic future will require the continued presence of coalition forces for some time into the future. I have no intention of foolishly, or without any proper grounds for doing so, making myself or this government hostage to a particular date. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith can ask as many questions as they like. Nothing will alter the fact that they do not really want a democratic Iraq. Their policy will condemn Iraq to years of chaos, terrorism and internal disorder. Our policy, on the other hand, will give to the people of Iraq the that the hope of a democratic future. Let me say, through the House to the people of Iraq, that I hope I speak on behalf of all Australians in saying that we would like to see a massive turnout at the referendum over the weekend. If there is a high turnout at the weekend, it will demonstrate the determination of the people of Iraq. It is very well for us to make fine speeches against the background of uninterrupted democracy but, when you are fighting to establish a democratic country in the face of the most fearful terrorism, your behaviour is to be admired. It should not be sneered at, as has been the case with the member for Griffith. Carers",83
66,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What is the government doing to support the 2.5 million Australians who provide invaluable care to elderly and disabled relatives?,83
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for raising this issue. Today, along with other members of the house-including the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Health and Ageing-I launched Carers Week. In the course of doing so, I was able to speak of a number of things that have been done by this government to expand the support for the magnificent carers of Australia. They comprise some 2.5 million Australians who are engaged in different ways in the informal voluntary care sector. They are amongst the most impressive, inspiring and praiseworthy of our fellow citizens. On this occasion, at the commencement of Carers Week, I want to say to all of our fellow Australians who are engaged in care: we are profoundly in your debt. You enrich the character of our national life, and we owe you something that can never be properly expressed or properly repaid. The government has enhanced in many ways support for carers, particularly over the last few years. We have announced significant enhancements in the formal care sector. For the past two budgets we have had additional one-off supplements both in relation to the carers allowance and the carer payment: $1,000 for carer payment recipients and $600 for carer allowance recipients. In the 2004 budget we announced a $2.2 billion investment in the formal and informal aged care sectors. In this year's budget we announced $207.6 million over four years to expand access to respite care. In September, the ister for Family and Community Services announced $57 million to extend carer payment to carers of children with severe intellectual, psychiatric or behavioural disabilities. I am pleased to say that I announced today at the opening of Carers Week a new initiative of the government: a package worth some $200 million that will allow ageing parents of children with disabilities, amongst other things, to establish private trusts of to $500,000 for the future care of their children without being affected by social security, gifting and means testing. This is a very significant structural change. It will affect many families with ing parents who wish to sell a large home and downsize on the basis that their disabled child might go into some other kind of residence. Under existing arrangements, the money provided for that other residence would be deemed a continuing asset and be caught by the means or assets test. That will no longer be the case when these new arrangements come into operation and, whilst I am not suggesting for a moment that this is going to meet all of the needs of carers in our community, it is a very significant step forward. I take the opportunity of paying tribute to Senator Kay Patterson, the Minister for Family and Community Services, who has campaigned long and hard for this change. She, more than anybody else in the government, has been responsible for this change with her persistence, her compassion and her commitment. It will bring relief and it will solve the thing that I have found in interviews with elderly parents of disabled adult children that bothers them most: ‘What will happen to our child when we die? Will they be properly cared for?' As I said, it does not solve every problem-I am not pretending that-but it is Min- a significant improvement. It will meet a need. I think it can be seen as part of an ongoing program by this government to expand the support we provide for a section of the community to whom we owe so much-that is, the 2½ million carers of Australia. Family Relationship Centres",83
68,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General and it concerns the interaction between the announcement that he made today of 50 further locations for up new family relationship centres and his government backbench committee established to oversee the selection and performance criteria for those centres. Can the Attorney confirm that seven of the eight government age- backbenchers on this committee will have a family relationship centre in their electorate? How can the Attorney assure the House that the members for Bass, Deakin, Greenway, Lindsay, Moncrieff, Riverina and Wakefield did not participate or in any way interfere in the location allocation for the family relationship centres? Further, will the Attorney now commit to the House that these backbenchers will have no role to play in assisting tenderers to make applications to run these services and no role in assessing tender applications to be made for the services to be run in their electorates?",84
69,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member reluctantly for the question she has asked. In relation to these matters, the decisions are mine and mine alone. I took advice from my department in relation to demographic matters. It certainly was aware of the choices that I was considering. I cannot comment on whether or not there are specifically centres in the electorates that have been mentioned, but I will check the matter, but it was irrelevant to the choices that were made. What I can say about the members of parliament who have served and will continue to serve on the task force that is advising on the broad implementation of these matters, but not on the choice of centres, is that they come from those parts of Australia where they have, with their contacts within their electorates, very considerable experience and capacity to advise and assist on these matters. I make no apologies whatsoever for involving those members in giving advice on the way in which those matters in their electorates that they are familiar with ought to be addressed. I have been asked a specific question about whether or not the members will be involved in the choice of those who tender. As to who will be successful, I can assure you they will not be involved in that process. I do not regard it as being appropriate. I think it would not fit with appropriate probity guidelines for them to be involved in that process and they have not been asked to undertake such a process. Family Law Reform",85
70,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. A number of families require services and support in Wakefield, like many families in Australiahence my interest in this subject. Attorney, would you advise the House of the government's plans to support families in Australia and are there any alternatives?",85
71,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. As his colleagues on this side of the House have quickly found out, he has considerable capacity and ability and a great deal of interest in the issue of families and keeping families together. He has produced some very erudite papers on these matters, which I would encourage all members of the parliament to read and consider. Today I had the pleasure of being joined by a number of my parliamentary colleagues, including the member for Wakefield, when I spoke with families at a public meeting here in Parliament House about the government's family law reforms. As members would know, we are embarking upon the most significant reforms in 30 years. Around Australia, we will be changing the landscape of the way in which family relationships are managed. Separation will no longer be seen as just a legal matter that you battle over in the courts. What we want is a situation where parents will be encouraged to sit down together and sort out what is best for their children. At the heart of this cultural change will be our new family relationship centres. I have previously announced that 15 of those centres will be opened by the middle of next year. Today I announced that the remaining 50 centres, to complete the network of 65 centres, will be rolled out progressively in the following two years. These new centres, along with the strong emphasis we are placing on outreach, will cover the nation. From Cairns to Campbelltown, and from the Pilbara to Launceston, families will have a place where they can go to get help. Having travelled around the country consulting with families on the role of these centres, I know they will make a real difference. Unfortunately, not everybody in the parliament shares that view. In fact, what we have found-and the Leader of the Opposition might like to know this in relation to colleagues-is that some of them seek to trivialise the matter. The salad bar analogy used recently by the member for Gellibrand poses some very significant questions because, whilst this government is providing ‘healthy' alternatives to help parents resolve their family relationship issues in a way that does not end up in court, the Labor Party offers little more than salad dressing. One piece of advice I can give to the member for Gellibrand-and her colleagues probably share this view-is that she should get on board and support the government's generational changes to the family law system. Government Advertising",85
72,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, isn't the case that marketing firm Colmar Brunton has been engaged by the government, at a cost of more than half a million dollars to taxpayers, to undertake extensive market research on the preparation and effectiveness of the government's spin and propaganda campaign to sell its industrial relations changes?",86
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not a spin and propaganda campaign; it is a public information campaign. There have been people engaged. The precise amounts and the exact names, I would have to check. Workplace Relations",86
74,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on how workplace relations reform will benefit small business? Are there any alternative views?,86
75,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his championing of small businesses in his electorate on the New South Wales coast. Small businesses his in Australia will be able to increase employment through, amongst other things, the removal of the unfair dismissal laws-through increased flexibility-which will enable them to take on extra staff. Yesterday we saw the animosity towards small businesses in Australia from the ACTU in an exchange between ACTU President Greg Combet and Richard Glover on ABC radio. An employer rang in pointing out that, because of the inflexibility in the current workplace relations system, he was unable to offer an extra shift to a 21-year-old employee. Instead, he and his wife had to do the work, resulting in less money for the employee and, of course, the employer and his wife missing time with their family. He asked Mr Combet, ‘What it about when the shoe is on the other foot, Greg?' There was an awkward pause on the radio and then Mr Combet said, ‘I'm afraid I'm not a small business advocate.' That is only too true. This hostile attitude towards small business was also revealed in The Latham Diaries. On page 179 of his book, talking about Greg Combet's attitude towards attempts by the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, to reform the ALP, Mr Latham said: Already, the dinosaurs are digging in. Greg Combet is in the media saying that he opposes reform because it might mean having small business representation at Labor Party conferences. Mr Combet made another comment yesterday which I am sure the House will find of interest. At the very time the union movement is railing against changes to industrial relations in Australia and workplace agreements which allow the trade-off of conditions such as penalty rates and the like, Greg Combet, speaking yesterday on the Richard Glover show on the ABC, said: I've negotiated numerous agreements where we negotiate, say, an all-up payment, an all-up lieu of, you know, penalty rates for working shiftwork or weekends. Mr Combet, on one hand, rails against this flexibility and, on the other hand, says, ‘I have negotiated these flexible types of agreements.' But it is not just Mr Combet. Here is an extract from a certified agreement, one of the parties to which is the Australian Workers Union, which is headed by",86
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The other Billy.,87
77,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the other Billy, whose employment prospects are to come in here. Clause 7 of this AWU certified agreement reads: Payment for public holidays, whether worked or falling during an off-duty period, has been averaged and is included in the calculation of the flat hourly rate. There are other examples of this. I will not take the time of the House toGovernment members-Go on!",87
78,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One more-again the Australian Workers Union, again Bill Shorten's union. This is another certified agreement of which one of the parties before the Industrial Relations Commission was the Australian Workers Union. Clause 3.1(a) says: Wages are for all hours worked. It goes on to say they include a loading for hours worked in excess of 12 hours per day et cetera-and this point: ‘as well as hours worked on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays'. There it is: ‘Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays'. What this demonstrates is the essential dishonesty of the ACTU and the Labor Party's campaign. What they are doing is this: on one hand they are out there trying to scare the workers of Australia, saying that this sort of flexibility is something that we do not have, yet on the other hand they are in the Industrial Relations Commisrate in sion negotiating the same flexibilityhypocrites! Government Advertising",87
79,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and follows on from the answer he gave to the previous question where he said the government's advertising campaign was about the provision of information to the public. Prime Minister, is it not the case that Colmar Brunton is working in close collaboration with Liberal Party mates including Jackson Wells Morris and advertising agency Dewey Horton, headed up by Ted Horton, who has directed Liberal Party election advertising for many years? Have two million of taxpayers' dollars already been forked out to Liberal Party favourites for the government's spin and propaganda campaign? Prime Minister, does this not prove that your fraudulent advertising propaganda is really a Liberal Party campaign for political purposes?",87
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth will rephrase that question and leave that offensive piece out.,87
81,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The last paragraph?,87
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The offensive piece.,87
83,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I draw your attention to standing order 100(d), which refers to the use of names of persons in a question. By natural perceptions, inherent in that question was a criticism of those people and their dealings with the government. I think, as such, those names should be struck out of any question in the interests of people who cannot defend themselves in this place.",87
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for O'Connor, I have asked the member for Perth to rephrase that question and in rephrasing it he will take into account that point of order. Mr MCMullan-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Are you, Mr Speaker, ruling that it is not possible to ask a question about the identity of paid consultants to the government?",88
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fraser will resume his seat. It is quite clear from the point of order that it was individuals not companies; it was individuals that were named. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, it is very important that you, in your ruling, make it clear that individuals who enter into contracts with the government cannot be protected from that fact being raised in this parliament; otherwise this is a scandal.",88
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fraser will be well aware of the point of order relating to standing order 100, which states quite clearly that questions that are critical of individuals will be put on the Notice Paper. So I am giving the member for Perth the option of rephrasing that question so that it falls within the standing orders. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I ask you to reconsider. You are proposing a public policy scandal.",88
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fraser will resume his seat. I have asked the member for Perth to rephrase his question so that it falls within the standing orders. The member for Perth will ask his question.,88
88,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the standing order that refers to this matter says that questions do not name persons unless that is ‘necessary to make the question intelligible'. It is impossible to put the government to account if questions cannot be asked in relation to",88
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Denison will resume his seat. It is quite clear that I have asked the member for Perth to rephrase his question. He can ask the question, but it must fall within the standing orders. I call the member for Perth.",88
90,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that Colmar Brunton is working in close collaboration with Jackson Wells Morris and advertising agency Dewey Horton-all of whom are under consultation and contracts from the Commonwealth government-Dewey Horton having been associated with Liberal Party election advertising for many years? Has $2 million of taxpayers' money already been forked out to these Liberal Party favourites for the government's industrial relations spin and propaganda campaign? Prime Minister, does this not prove that the government's misleading advertising propaganda is really a Liberal Party campaign for political purposes?",88
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am indebted to the member for Perth for asking that question. He mentioned a number of firms. Let me start with Jackson Wells Morris. It is probably well known in this House that, although Grahame Morris is no longer associated with that firm, he is my close friend-we have a very close friendship. He was a political adviser of mine over a number of years and is a person for whom I have enormous regard. The Wells is a former journalist who was my press secretary during one of my unsuccessful stints as the Leader of the Opposition-it seems to be a habit in this place to have unsuccessful stints as opposition leader. He was also press secretary to Andrew Peacock. But the Keith Jackson was, I think in either the 1970s or 1980s, the Labor candidate for Mackellar. A member of the advisory board to that company was none other than Kerry Sibraa. There is also a gentleman-I know this gentleman and I have a very high regard for him-whose surname is Cook, who is a senior adviser to that firm and was in fact either the principal private secretary or the senior adviser to John Dawkins when he was minister for education in the former Labor government. I suppose you could say that firm qualifies unconditionally as a group of Howard government mates! You might say that, but I think you would be stretching it a bit far. The processes of this have been correct, and the fact that you happen to have an association with the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, if you have the ability, should not qualify you. If you want a bit of field evidence for that going back to the time the Labor Party was in office, have a look at what Rod Cameron did for former Labor governments. Workplace Relations",88
92,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of the impact of the government's industrial relations reforms on families in rural and regional Australia?,89
93,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly people who live in rural and regional Australia-40 per cent of Australian families-want an industrial relations system that is flexible and able to provide particular benefits and tailored agreements to meet their needs. The employment agreements that can meet the individual circumstances of families that perhaps have to travel long distances will obviously have significant benefits in rural and regional areas. Families want flexibility, small business wants flexibility and we have just heard that unions want flexibility. The only people that do not want flexibility, it seems, are the members opposite. They want a staid, rules driven industrial relations system that cannot allow businesses to take advantage of their opportunities or families to negotiate an arrangement which enables them to have the very best possible lifestyle. WorkChoices will provide the real opportunity for families to negotiate a family friendly working arrangement. It will give them opportunities in relation to appropriate leave and family friendly arrangements, including personal and carers leave whenever that is necessary for their families. That is the kind of flexibility that it seems members opposite think is inappropriate. And, what is more, they do not want the public to hear about it. They do not want the truth, they do disnot want anything said about what is being proposed in this legislation and they do not want the public to be given information. All they want is to have distorted trade union campaigns endeavouring to tear apart these changed arrangements. Families that live in rural and regional Australia that might have to travel long distances may well choose a working arrangement that gives them the opportunity to work for longer hours and then have longer periods off. That is the kind of thing that unions are happy to negotiate on behalf of their members, but Labor opposite wants to put an end to that kind of thing. The strong economic performance that we have seen in Australia, the growth in our economy since the first tranche of industrial relations reform in 1996, ought to really be an inspiration for us to go further at this stage. The honourable member for Hinkler has noted in his own area the extraordinary drop in unemployment and the growth in business. We are in adjoining electorates and for many years we have had amongst the highest unemployment rates in the country. It is magnificent to see the drop in unemployment over recent times. That is very much about having a growing economy that is built on a flexible workplace. It is important that Labor should set aside its opposition to this proposed flexible new system. They boasted when they were in government how they kept wages down. We want a system that provides an opportunity for people to earn more in circumstances that fit their own family needs and also, as a result, to build strong and progressive businesses, because the progress and development of our country is very much dependent upon having a very successful business environment. Government Advertising",89
94,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, as part of the government's taxpayer funded spin and propaganda campaign, it is preparing 16page colour promotional brochures for Australian households and businesses? Prime Minister, is it not the case that, in addition the cost to taxpayers of this propaganda, 60,000 copies of this booklet were pulped at further waste and cost to the taxpayer?",90
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will see if there is some further information I can get for the member. I am not attempting in any way to disguise the fact that the government have embarked upon a public information campaign to explain the rationale for these changes. We regard it as utterly defensible. It was challenged before the High Court of Australia by the Labor Party and the unions, and when I last checked that challenge was unsuccessful. Health and Ageing",90
96,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the government's health proposals are benefiting older Australians? Is the minister aware of any proposals to provide free hospital treatment for older Australians? How might these proposals affect other parts of the health system, and what is the government's response?",90
97,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wentworth for his question, and I acknowledge the very broad range of the member for Wentworth's interests. In answer to the member for Wentworth, I can certainly assure him that older Australians can trust the Howard government to deliver high-quality, affordable health services. Thanks to the government's bulk-billing incentives, I can inform the member for Wentworth that some 85.5 per cent of older people now have their GP consultations bulk-billed. Thanks to another government initiative, more than 200,000 Australians aged over 75 now get comprehensive health checks every year under Medicare-thanks to the Howard government. Perhaps most importantly-thanks to the additional private health insurance to rebates that this government is offering to older people-1.1 million Australians aged over 65 can keep the security and the choice that private health insurance brings. But I am aware of a policy called Medicare Gold-an unfunded, unfair policy which purports to help older people by ripping off younger people. We now know that Medicare Gold served a wider purpose. Medicare Gold was part of Labor's secret plan to destroy the private health insurance rebate. Oh yes, Labor has been dobbed in by its former leader. The former leader said on page 347 of The Latham Diaries: Medicare Gold was part of my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate. It goes on: It required a lot of work to model the private health insurance applications and to secure the cooperation of the states, all handled by Gillard. So the member for Lalor was orchestrating Labor's secret plan to destroy the private health insurance rebate. And what was she saying at the time? She was saying, during the middle of the election campaign, ‘Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate.' She went on: ‘I have given an ironclad guarantee.' Who gives dodgy guarantees now?

98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Has the minister finished his answer? Before I call the minister, I remind the member for Gorton it is highly disorderly to be interjecting from outside of your seat.",91
99,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know that members opposite would not want me to conclude this answer without reminding the House that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had-and the only friend that private health insurance has ever had. Workplace Relations,91
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and follows those asked by the member for Perth. Is it not the case that the 16-page colour promotional brochures were pulped to allow for a more effective spin and propaganda campaign, as advised by Colmar Brunton? Prime Minister, is it not the case that the new cover now reads ‘A simpler, fairer national workplace relations system for Australia' instead of just ‘A simpler national workplace relations system for Australia'?",91
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I am able to further help the Leader of the Opposition, I will try to do so. Workplace Relations",91
102,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister update the House on how Australian farmers and their employees will benefit from workplace relations reforms? Is the minister aware of any alternative proposals?",91
103,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. The member for Hume is eminently qualified to speak, drawing on his life experiences as well as his experiences of the excesses of union power and intervention in the workplace. He spent 32 years in the meat processing industry and several years of that time on the floor of a meat works. He can tell stories about being forced out of work, as a young man with a young family, and being involuntarily on strike for six months or more, consequently making it very hard to provide for his family. The complexity and overprescription that have grown up over the years with regard to the union dominated award system defy belief. They certainly defy logic. There is no justification: it is utterly indefensible to have the system we have at present over six jurisdictions. I have been speaking in the last couple of days about pastoral awards. This is the New South Wales pastoral award, and it goes over 106 pages. But, in fact, those whose ambit it comes within get off lightly, because, when you look at the metal award in New South Wales, that award is 190 pages. There is no justification for this. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",91
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills is warned!,91
105,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This represents big unions and big government, which are embodied by the Labor Party. I have spoken about the cost of some awards in providing for the care of horses supplied by employees and how it varies between states. In some states it is $4, in others it is $3.50 and in some others it is $5.50. It varies, it is inconsistent and it lacks logic. It surprised me to find the same distorted hotchpotch of a system also exists in providing for allowances for bicycles-so much so that, under a number of awards, there is a higher allowance for bicycles than for horses. For instance, under the National Fast Food Retail Award, a bicycle allowance is $9 per week. That is twice the cost of the allowance provided for a horse across the country. With a horse-an essential aid for many in country areasthere are grooming, feed and watering costs. But why would you give twice the amount per week for maintaining a bicycle than you would for maintaining a horse? The Queensland Clerical Employees Award has $3.36 for a bicycle. So caring for a bicycle in Queensland costs about one-third of what it costs in New South Wales. And there is poor old Tassie-the Tasmanian Horticulturalist Award provides only 80c a day for a bicycle. The bicycles must feel neglected! The best of all is the New South Wales shop employees award, because there you get $9.80 for a bicycle-the highest of anywhere in Australia. But better than that: you get $9.80 per week for a tricycle. I do not know how many tricycle enthusiasts there are among the shoppies of New South Wales, but they are well catered for. The simple fact is that these awards-and there are thousands of them-get in the way of common sense. And it means that not only employers but also employees are spending most of their time trying to adhere to the conditions laid down by the unions and by the Labor Party, so they do not get on with the job. Treat Australians as adults! Workplace Relations",91
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Isn't it the case that, under the cover of the spin and propaganda campaign to sell the government's extreme industrial relations changes, details have been changed in the new, amended brochure to reveal the further erosion of conditions, entitlements and protections of employees, including the dropping in the new document-that is the one I have here, which has got the word ‘fairer' added-of the expression ‘terms and conditions and existing agreements will be protected', as contained in the pulped document?",92
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is what I said earlier: we are embarking on a public information campaign and all of the information we have put out is accurate. Automotive Industry,92
108,Mr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister advise the House of government efforts to enhance and promote the competitiveness of Australia's automotive industry? Are there any threats to the auto industry?",92
109,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston not only for the question but also for his very strong support for the auto industry-not only in South Australia but right around Australia. When it comes to the future of the Australian automotive industry, the government is well and truly taking the driver's seat. This industry has received two long-term plans worth about $7 billion, or even more, from this government. This is a serious investment in the global competitiveness of the Australian automotive industry and it is delivering results. Last year 130,000 Australian made vehicles were exported, and that is a record number. In 200203 $630 million was invested in R&D, an increase of $140 million on the R&D in the automotive sector of the previous year. Today, in a positive development for the local automotive industry, Mitsubishi Australia has launched its new 380 model, which has received very strong reviews. I understand that the member for Kingston has already shown his confidence in that product by ordering one. I urge other people to consider that also. There is an oversupply of capacity on a global scale and these are impressive achievements by the Australian industry. We in the government are not resting on our achievements. We are working to ensure that the future of the car industry is as strong as possible. Just recently I led a delegation of industry representatives to Japan and we promoted Australia's automotive capabilities to the head offices of Mitsubishi, Toyota, Nissan and Mazda. We had a reasonably positive reaction, I have to say. There was one response that we received from them, though, that we all need to bear in mind, and that is that we as an industry in Australia have to deliver on price, quality and, of course, security of supply. It is to the third element that the threats that the member for Kingston has asked about are emerging. Union strikes crippled the car sector in 2001-02, bringing production to a standstill and, at one stage, costing the industry $30 million a day. That is a disgraceful example of reckless union power, and it is no surprise that the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries pointed out on Tuesday in its statement that parts of the Australian automotive supply chain are still particularly vulnerable to disruption. It is surprise also, on that basis, that the FCAI has fully backed the government's IR reform package. Who opposed it? Doug Cameron opposed it, and so did the federal Labor Party. The federal Labor Party remain the biggest threat to Australia's car industry. Workplace Relations",92
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, doesn't the whole sorry process with these documents demonstrate that your whole approach to the living standards of Australian families is soft soap on the cover and a knife twisted underneath?",93
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not even those who sit behind you were impressed by that little rhetorical flourish. Let me take on face value, for a moment, the allegation made that soft soap is the appearance and that the twisted knife is the reality. Let me go through it. Which is the soft soap-the words of the Australian Labor Party or the reality delivered by the coalition? Let us take wages-a 14.9 per cent increase over 9½ years. Who is delivering-the coalition or the Labor Party? Let us look at interest rates. With the interest rates, people are $500 or $600 a month better off under the coalition than under Labor. Let us look at unemployment. There have been 1.7 million new jobs and we have the lowest unemployment level in 30 years. The soft soap represents the alternative policies of the Labor Party over the last 9½ years. It is now the fourth day that this parliament has sat since the release of this document and the Leader of the Opposition has had four days and four question times to try and build a case against this government, but he has failed again for the same reason that he has failed over the last 9½ years. The Leader of the Opposition's greatest problem is that he does not stand for anything. The no Leader of the Opposition's greatest problem is that he will grab hold of any opportunistic argument. He will never go out to the Australian community and argue a consistent proposition. I ask the members of this parliament-stretch back over 9½ years-can you think of one thing that the Leader of Opposition put forward 9½ years ago when he became the leaderMr Beazley interjecting",93
112,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says, ‘Weak.' That is the thing that you think about, politically speaking, when you hear the Leader of the Opposition. He has had 9½ years to define a persona. He has had 9½ years to tell the Australian people what he stands for. The only thing that can be said of the Leader of the Opposition is that, if the coalition is in favour of it, the Leader of the Opposition is against it. He once believed that you should roll back the GST. He is now so far in retreat from that that when the word ‘roll-back' came out of his lips in relation to industrial relations he said: ‘No, rub that out; airbrush that out. I didn't really say it.' I thought at one stage the Leader of the Opposition did represent an alternative leader of the Labor movement in this country, but I have watched him over 9½ years. He does not have the ticker to articulate an alternative policy to the Australian people. All he ever does is oppose for opposition's sake. NA Censure Motion",93
113,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"After all that dribbling and spitting, I seek leave to move: That this House censure the Howard Government for: (1) its deliberate deception of the Australian people about the damage its extreme industrial relations changes will do to Australians and their families; and (2) its outrageous waste of taxpayers' dollars for a fraudulent advertising campaign which is really Liberal Party propaganda and spin. Leave not granted.",94
114,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,I move that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of Opposition moving-on these cowardsimmediately,94
115,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.,94
116,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw that. I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of Opposition moving immediatelyThat this House censure the Howard Government for: (1) its deliberate deception of the Australian people about the damage its extreme industrial relations changes will do to Australians and their families; and (2) its outrageous waste of taxpayers' dollars for a fraudulent advertising campaign which is really Liberal Party propaganda and spin. Twice in this week the opposition has moved a censure motion against the government related to aspects of their industrial relations bills not yet before the House. The propaganda is out but not the bills. The propaganda is out-the soft soap is out-but not the knife. The knife remains sheathed for the course of the next couple of weeks. Twice in this House these so-called brave men-these folk full of ticker!-have squibbed a censure debate. The Prime Minister, who regards the industrial relations legislation as his leitmotiv and finest hour, has squibbed participation in the debate. I think that speaks volumes to the Australian people. Fairness, which has been added as an afterthought in these documents, is not the hallmark of this government. We say the system needs to be fair. The churches say the system needs to be fair. Australians want the system to be fair. Even the government's own advertising gurus say the system should be fair. So what does the government do? Instead of putting fairness into the system, it puts ‘fairness' into its slogan. That is where fairness ends. Instead of just pulping the first of its booklets, at vast public expense, it should pulp the bill. This deceit typifies the government's whole approach to industrial relations: soft soap sell on the outside; a twist of the knife on the inside. A sum of $100 million of taxpayers' money to sell the Australian public a wages cut. I will tell you one of the things that the Australian people know that I stand for and that my party stands for: the ordinary Australian who, for the last 9½ years, has been traduced by a political party that has said one thing in an election campaign and done another thing after it. It said it would never, ever do the GSTMr Ticehurst-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. This is a speech. This has nothing to do with the censure motion; this is a re-run of the speech he was going to do yesterday.",94
117,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,In calling the Leader of the Opposition I remind him that this is a motion to suspend standing orders and he should refer to that as well.,95
118,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"The whole point is that, if the government had the courage to confront a censure motion, it would be possible for them to lay out a defence of what it is they are up to. The Prime Minister loves the opportunity for reply in question time and to sit in coward's castle and abuse us and all that we do on this side of House. But when the moment comes for them to face the music, and there is a fair and even-handed debate in the place, they cut and run. That is the form of the government, and we are seeing that form here again. The unfortunate thing is that we are not the people who are being cut and run on in this case. The people who are being run over are the ordinary Australians, who will be shattered by the passage, ultimately, of this legislation. The reason why we have to discuss this matter in this place and why this motion to suspend standing orders ought to be carried is that these documents bear some very close examination indeed. Clearly these documents were put out and printed with one set of intentions in mind, and then they were got together to do two things: firstly, to soft-soap the cover of it and, secondly, to start to manoeuvre for the government a position where their words had enough wriggle in them to cover what their real intentions were. So all of a sudden we had dumped into the middle of the title the word ‘fairer'. That is the soft line. The more interesting thing is what then happened to other sets of words. In the old document, the document that the public will never see, one particular chapter-in fact the most important of the chapters in it-begins: ‘Your existing award conditions protected by law.' Out of that document are those words and inside instead is ‘WorkChoices and awards.' Out goes ‘Your existing award conditions protected by law' and in comes ‘WorkChoices and awards.' In the old document one of the subheadings in this chapter is ‘Preserving key award conditions.' In the document to be released it becomes ‘Protecting award conditions.' The word is softened immediately. In the old document, with its lovely little ‘protected by law' stamp over it, is ‘Terms and conditions and existing agreements will be protected'-so a nice little ‘protected by law' stamp over it. In the to be released document-nothing. There is nothing at all; it is gone. The ‘protected by law' is gone. Then in the old document you have the heading ‘Protected award conditions.' In the document to be released it becomes ‘Protecting award conditions in bargaining.' Two totally different concepts. What this government has determined to do is to rip those awards from underneath Australian workers. Nothing grates on our nerves more on this side of the House-and it is one of the reasons why we want an open debate and a censure motion on this-than to see some of the wealthiest people in this country standing before the dispatch box, mocking the conditions of some of the poorest, ordinary Australians-people who are shop assistants, not terribly powerful, and rural workers, desperately trying to get the resources together to support their families. These are people whose livelihood is less than the expense claims of the average Australian cabinet minister-and because, for their pitiful bike, horse or whatever, they are entitled to a $5 payment, they get mocked in this place. The ordinary Australian does not reside anywhere in the heart of the average Liberal or National Party member. They despise ordinary Australians, and they now want to brutalise them. The simple fact of the matter is that this entire panoply, facade, volume of words out there in the public conceals one essential and absolutely concrete purposethat is, the intention of the government is to introduce a set of laws that will cut people's wages. That is the point. They want to exercise downward pressure on wages at a time when the cost of living on so many fronts is rising quite dramatically. Their intention here particularly applies to those who find themselves less able to protect themselves in the work force, which happens to include a majority of the work force: young people entering it, women who are casuals, members of the work force who are skilled and semiskilled-few of whom are unionised. It is an odd thing about this debate: the unions are in fact standing, in the main, for non-unionised Australians-few of whom are protected by unions but all of whom are protected by the existence of an Industrial Relations Commission and a set of awards and a set of award conditions. Finally, we have got to debate these censure motions and have them seriously considered in this place because the intention on the part of the government has to be exposed in detail so that the public of this country understand what it is they are up to, because in the last election campaign they saw none of it. The government did not have the courage or the fortitude to go into the last election campaign telling the Australian people what they would do. But they have fraudulently spent $100 million worth of public funds to try to conceal from the public what it is they intend to do. This censure motion must now be debated. (Time expired)",95

122,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The minister will address the motion before the chair.,96
123,Mr ANDREWS,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Speaker, the motion before the chair should be defeated because the record of this government has been about improving the working conditions of Australians. In contrast, the record of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, is an abysmal record. Teenage unemployment in Australia, when this man was in charge of unemployment in this country, was 34.5 per cent. That is the record of the opposition that comes in and says, ‘Look at the record of the government.' Our record is a 14.9 per cent increase in real wages, 1.7 million extra jobs and over 10 million Australians in work. That is why this motion should be defeated.",96

Of course not. Each time the people of Australia have been asked who should lead this country, what have they decisively said?

143,Mr ANDREWS,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Speaker, I am responding to a matter which was specifically raised by the Leader of the Opposition. He talked about workers' entitlements and rights. Let me say about that that today we have the union movement in Australia railing against workers having flexibility in their arrangements and railing against the reality that is part of the workplace system today that workers are able to work on Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays. I gave some examples of agreements today where the very thing that the unions are railing against are the things which they are entering into agreements on and having them signed up in the Industrial Relations Commission. On one hand, we hear them in here railing against the fact that hundreds of thousands of people work on public holidays and, on the other hand, we have instruments of today employment negotiated and entered into by unions in Australia put forward for certification at the Industrial Relations Commission which provide that degree of flexibility. This is a confected outrage by the Leader of the Opposition. As I said, this was a man who, when told by Paul Keating that he had better go along and vote in 1993 for workplace change, did it. When he has been told not to do it, he will not do it today.",98

148,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRIME MINISTER,"Standing orders need to be suspended to enable the House to censure the Howard government for its deliberate deception of the Australian people about the damage its extreme industrial relations changes will do to Australians and their families and its outrageous waste of taxpayers' dollars for a fraudulent advertising campaign which is really Liberal Party propaganda and spin. Standing orders need to be suspended so that the House can debate that censure and censure the Howard government because of the matters that were exposed during question time. In question time we discovered that the government had prepared, at taxpayers' expense, documents as part of its multimillion dollar advertising campaign and had pulped 60,000 copies of a 16-page brochure at an estimated cost of $40,000. Why did it do that? Because it received advertising and market research advice that the spin was not quite right, that it needed to insert in the headline the word ‘fairer'-A simpler, fairer, national Workplace Relations System for Australia-that would go over better with the public. The problem is that this has exposed the complete lack of defence that the government has in this monstrous and massive abuse of taxpayers' funds for party political purposes. The Prime Minister stands at the dispatch box in question time and says, ‘This is all defensible and defended because it is providing information to the public.' The government inserts the word ‘fairer'-and it does not even believe that fairness ought to be a public policy priority or attribute in this area. In a speech given by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on 25 February 2005 he says: In the context of this debate and where we want the workplace relations system to be in five years time much is often said of the need to focus the workplace relations system on fairness. This is, and must be a focus of Government but, and as the Business Council of Australia recently argued, an emphasis on fairness only leads to regulatory excess and inefficiency that reduces productivity and discourages job creation. In the Australian on 16 February, the Business Council, which the minister was endorsing, said: ... there has been heavy reliance on workplace relations policies to redistribute wealth and the achieve ‘fair' outcomes. But using workplace relations to achieve fairness has often resulted in restrictive and uncompetitive workplace practices. The government as a matter of public policy does not believe that fairness ought to apply in this area, yet it inserts-at a monstrous expense to the taxpayer-the word ‘fairness' because it is advised by its market researchers, its advertisers and its Liberal Party election campaign mates that that will put the spin over better for the Australian public and they will be able to slide it through. How do we know this? Colmar Brunton, an advertising and market research company, has been given over half a million dollars to do market research, firstly, to help prepare the government's advertising and, secondly-and it was in the field last night in the Illawarra and Brisbane-to test the effectiveness of that advertising so far as the public is concerned. What advice have Colmar Brunton given to the Liberal Party mates Jackson Wells Morris and Dewey and Horton, the advertising agency? The advice they have given them is, ‘You've got to get the spin better. So: let's add the word “fairness” in because that will trick the public better. That will deceive the public better. That will make the monstrous abuse of taxpayers' funds', which the government is using for Liberal Party campaign purposes, ‘more effective. It will slide it through the punters better.' As the Leader of the Opposition showed during question time, once you get past the cover, the devil-and the knife to the conditions, salaries and entitlements of working Australians-is in the detail. It is on page 13 of the document. You change the cover to say ‘fairness' and then you change the inside to make sure that current conditions can be even further pulled away. It pulls the rug of the safety net, minimum standards and the independent umpire away from the living standards of working Australians. There is a need to suspend standing orders to censure this government for a massive, fraudulent deception. It is a corruption of the public policy and parliamentary and government process by using millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds for a Liberal Party campaign purpose to perpetrate a fraud on the public. In its defence, providing information to the public. It makes newspaper advertisements, TV advertisements and brochures, and it is happy to pulp them if the spin is not quite right despite the even greater loss and expense to the taxpayers. This government needs to be censured for acting like a gang of burglars, deceiving the Australian public. (Time expired)",98

161,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At the end of question time-or as it now turns out to have been the end of question time-members in this place and anyone in the gallery would have noted the Prime Minister directed an uncharacteristic spasm of pure hatred across the dispatch box towards me. A normally quite courteous man in an old-fashioned sort of way-even if he is thoroughly devious in the way in which he deals with the electorate-he reserved for the end of this week a package of bile such that I have not seen from him in a very long time. It was an indication to me and all my colleagues that, 12 months into this parliamentary term, we in the opposition are being very effective. We are holding this government to account for its deceit, its dishonesty, its exploitation of the public purse and, above all, for its willingness to impose on ordinary Australians and the happiness in their lives its rampant ideology. Another thing that we have done during this week is to demonstrate comprehensively that the propaganda campaign that the government have put forward is not about information; it is about spin. Closely monitoring public opinion and their failure to change it, they are trying desperately to work out a way in which their totally unacceptable positions can be made to seem more acceptable to the Australian people. I do not discuss polls-never have, either in government or in opposition-but I will today on this one thing. I guess we have an explanation as to why the government are so closely monitoring public opinion on this issue. In the polls that we saw earlier this week, a quite narrow difference between the government and the opposition on industrial relations matters has exploded into a 2-1 differential. Quite clearly, the pulping of the government's document, at vast public expense, followed by its reprinting with a different title to include the word ‘fairer', was a direct response from some form of their polling which was replicating to them the sudden collapse of public confidence in the willingness of the government to give a fair deal to ordinary working Australians. We see the dramatic expose of that in what we have had presented to us today. The second thing that we have tumbled over during this week has been the extent to which, as the government go through their phraseology, they seek the wriggle room to justify at the conclusion a massive diminution in the working conditions of ordinary Australians. That is what they are seeking to do. We have firm statements like ‘existing award conditions protected by law', ‘preserving key award conditions', ‘terms and conditions in existing agreements will be protected' and ‘protected award conditions'. That panoply of guarantees subtly but decisively undermines. Some of them have been removed, as I have already indicated, and boiled down to work choices and awards. From ‘preserving' we get ‘protecting' and from ‘protected award conditions' we get ‘protected award conditions in bargaining'. So the Australian people get a clear picture from the contrast between these two documents. The government will walk into this chamber-when it finally gets to presenting this blinking legislation; we have been waiting for it since May-with a metaphorical legislative knife between its teeth, as far as ordinary Australians are concerned. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in question time today started talking about the fact that there are bargaining arrangements which from time to time allow workers, if they wish to, to bargain certain rights for much higher levels of pay. Many backbenchers shouted out to him at that time, ‘If there is that level of flexibilcut ity, why are you bothering with the new legislation?' A logical question, I would have thought, but the answer is simple. In the legislation that is going to be put forward in a fortnight's time, or thereabouts, one absolutely essential condition, which to this point has accompanied the greater level of flexibility in the wages system put in place by the Keating and Hawke governments, is what is known euphemistically as the no disadvantage test. In effect, that means that you may not be deprived of any award conditions-be they the prominent sorts of award conditions that we have been discussing in this place or those that apply to more specialised types of employment, like the special shift allowances that nurses get, for example, and I suppose the award conditions that agricultural workers get or that shop assistants in some areas get under current law-without a complete and exact replication of those benefits in your other conditions. That provision has been watered down in previous legislation by this government but it still persists, at least to some degree, in the current legislation. When the Keating government introduced enterprise bargaining-with my solid support, I might say-they did so with that particular clause featuring very prominently throughout the legislative system. A great deal of flexibility and productivity was secured in the work force as a result of that measure. Now the government intends to move from a situation whereby flexibility was accompanied by fairness to a situation where fairness is removed from the system. It is Orwellian, it is Stalinist and it is equivalent to the sorts of dictatorships' propaganda of the 20th century-you tell people the exact opposite of what it is that you intend to do. You talk about fairness when you intend to remove it. I guess the folk who got the first of that pulped brochure-at least as they sat down and wrote it-understood exactly what the government had in mind, and fairness had absolutely nothing to do with it. We in the Australian Labor Party understand these things and what the government intends. It has nothing to do with the economy; it has nothing to do with productivity. The massive productivity growth which is incorporated and the substantial rises in real wages are entirely and exclusively a product of the enterprise bargaining arrangements put in place by the Keating government, of which there have now been four or five iterations and which of course are collective agreements. This was put in place by the Keating government. That and that alone is what has produced the substantial real increases in the wages of Australians over the last decade and a half. Nothing else hasnothing the government has done. The government's own industrial relations changes have been put in place to at least try and pare back from the less well-organised sections of the work force the benefits that were going to the better organised sections of the work force or the more skilled sections of the work force. The Keating government put in train the productivity that this country has enjoyed. This government has done nothing but detract from it. What was for the Keating government a process that permitted the Australian economy to modernise and grow has become for this government an opportunity to reintroduce into the Australian wages system the 19th century. The things that the government intends to deprive workers of and which it is going to remove from its legislation when it finally comes into this place include the removal of the independent umpire, the removal of the capacity, by and large, of most people in this country to get access to assistance from a trade union, and the removal of the no disadvantage test so people will be obliged to give up conditions without a compensating arrangement attached to it. What have they created? They have created a master-servant relationship, which was a feature of industrial systems in the colonies in the 19th century but has not existed in this country since Federation. I will not take a lecture from the Prime Minister on the subject of modernising the wages system of this country when he has the most old-fashioned concept of it. His analysis of it, I and my colleagues believe, is firmly rooted in the view that the industrial relations system he inherited reflects the lock-up mentality of 1960s and 1970s. He has erected a straw man to cover his attempt to reintroduce the 19th century. The consequences of this, particularly if the good economy created largely by the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments starts to slow down-as all economies do, often for reasons external to the country-will be the massive impoverishment of a large number of Australian families. The individual contract regime that the government wishes to put in place has been tried elsewhere. It was tried in New Zealand. In the 1990s, New Zealanders experienced the ‘working poor beneficiary'. Food banks were created to support people in full-time work, because they did not necessarily have the sorts of jobs that would sustain a bargainproductivity ing position by which, in the conditions in which everything was weighted in the hands of the employer, they could not get for themselves what might be described by all of us here as a living wage. Should there be an economic downturn-and if this legislation is put in place and this government is not removed-we will experience the same phenomenon here, once this legislation is passed. The union movement will survive the attack on it, but many Australian families will not. Many of the people I am referring to are skilled or semiskilled and, in the outer suburbs of this country, they are supporting a mortgage of considerable dimensions. The main breadwinner has an income of about $50,000 a year-that is the average-and the spouse has an income of about $25,000. That is a total of $75,000-and that split sustains it. When the main breadwinner's capacity to get overtime is gone, and when the capacity of the other contributor to get family-friendly hours is gone, family life will be simply unsustainable. What is being mounted here-and it was not foreshadowed during the last election the campaign-is the most massive attack ever on the Australian way of life by an Australian government. It will mean the destruction of the lives of ordinary Australians, about which the incredibly wealthy people on the Liberal-National front bench chortle and cheer in question time after question time. They will haunt the houses of average Australians with the propositions they are going to put through: no umpire, no protection, no underpinning, no-disadvantage testnothing. There will be absolutely nothing but a master-servant relationship in which the power persists with the person who owns the business. That person will have no incentive to conduct any sort of discussion other than on the basis of what optimises his profitnot necessarily what produces the best in but what optimises his profit. We are going to resist this in this parliament and put up a comprehensive alternative at the next election-and we will win.",102
162,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The deliberate campaign of dishonesty, misinformation, scaremongering and misrepresentation by the Labor Party and the ACTUwe have seen it since May, we have heard it in spade loads here today and we have seen it all week-must be seen for what it is: a political campaign. Those opposite are embarking on a political campaign. Their motive is to change the government, not to protect the well-being of Australian families. They could not care less about that objective. Their objective is self-serving; their objective is to change the government. It is a political campaign. ACTU Secretary Greg Combet let the cat of the bag in May when he said, ‘It is about changing the government.' These reforms are seen by the Labor Party and the ACTU as a political opportunity to turn their fortunes around. Both the Labor Party and the ACTU are desperate in this regard because the only thing that has fallen faster over the last 20 years than the Labor primary vote is union membership. (Quorum formed) Those opposite only have their hearts in this because they see, wrongly, a cheap political opportunity to get back in the race the back of their opposition to these fair and sensible policy reforms. They have not got their hearts in it because of any genuine agreement with the policies being proposed, because those opposite know in their hearts that these changes are necessary if we are to protect and grow the quality of life of Australian families. They know that if we are to spread the benefits, such as the benefits of flexibility that exist in some parts of the economy because of past changes, across the economy, we need to build on past changes and remove more of the roadblocks and third party interference that are holding back much of the energy and productivity of a lot of workplaces across the country. So it is a political campaign not motivated by any genuine concern. The only attacks have been dishonest misrepresentation of the material that we have put in front of the opposition. For weeks, if not months, they asked for details. They have now had them for a week-and what have we seen? We have seen only dishonest misrepresentation. We have seen them fly things up the flagpole here all week, only for those things to be exposed. We have seen them dishonestly misrepresent the AWA of a small operation in Queensland. We have seen them dishonestly misrepresent public holidays. All they have done all week is make a series of dishonest misrepresentations of what is proposed. They do not have their hearts in it other than for political motivations. (Quorum formed) As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, it is a political campaign by our opponents opposite. Sharan Burrow, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, gleefully started a doorstep interview this week with the statement: ‘Well, good morning, Comrades. This is a fight that the labour movement has been waiting for.' For Sharan Burrow it is simply the basis of a membership drive for an organisation that now repreoff sents less than 17 per cent of employees in private enterprise. The Leader of the Opposition was saying on national radio yesterday, dis- and again in the House today, they can run this thing all the way through to the next election. All these comments betray the real motives of the Labor Party and the ACTU, and so does their body language. Look at what they have been doing all week. Look at the disinformation, the level of the rhetoric and the fulminating. The Leader of the Opposition was almost going to explode this week with the fulminating that he has gone on with. Then there is the feigned anger of the Leader of the Opposition. Here is a man trying to cover up a few deficiencies. There are also the overstatements. Think about what has happened all week. Think about their comments. They have overreached on every issue. They have exaggerated. They have gone too far. The credibility of their case has been undermined day by day as they have overreached. It is betraying their desperation. They have an eye on the polls-don't you worry about that. Do not listen to what the Leader of the Opposition just said about never commenting on polls. He might not comment on them too much, but by golly he is always looking at them. Their body language this week has been betraying their desperation. These actions, these approaches to the debate, are all unwitting symptoms of a mob that has no genuine interest in the likely fect of these reforms on the well-being of Australian families. It is all about reversing their own political fortunes. It is all about saving their own skin. It is all about looking after their own well-being, not the well-being of Australian families. It is a political paign, pure and simple, by the Labor Partyan opportunistic grab for political advantage off the back of misinformation and scaremongering. We have seen another extraordinary example of this blatant misinformation and hypocrisy in relation to the claims about the treatment of the 38-hour week in our workplace. This week we had the member for Throsby, Jenny George, and the President of the ACTU, both saying things to that effect. ‘What a joke.' Sharan Burrow said. The Prime Minister has spent years saying he cares about work and family. ‘The 38 hour week,' he says, ‘on the one hand, is protected. On the other hand, you can average it over a year.' ‘What a joke,' says Sharan Burrow. We heard similar sentiments from the member for Throsby, who is a former President of the ACTU. A simple scanning of some publicly available agreements negotiated by various unions indicates that unions have regularly and for years agreed to the averaging of a 38hour week over a year in exchange for other benefits. There are seven, eight or nine unions here-all members of the ACTU. Either Sharan Burrow and Ms George are grossly ignorant of a standard practice that they have been fully across or they have sought to deliberately mislead the Australian public as part of Labor's disinformation campaign over the government's workplace relations reforms. If Ms George and Ms Burrow truly believe that averaging over a year is an attack on work and family, why have they not publicly and strenuously sought to stop the efunions, who they are ultimately responsible for, from negotiating this common practice? It is blatant hypocrisy and it is misinformation. The truth of the matter is that, in many cases, the averaging provision has helped save jobs, and job security is at the heart of camcreating strong and happy families. The Leader of the Opposition waxed lyrical in an attempt to denigrate the motives and the determination of this government to protect the well-being of Australian families. The soft option is to rant and rave and to give up on real reform, but the Leader of the Opposition has a history of shirking the hard decisions. If you go back to when he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, there are some classic quotes. ‘I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining. I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had,' said Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley as minister for employment gave up on the unemployed, and now he stands here and lectures us about taking hard decisions, about maintaining and protecting the living standards of Australian families. This government has no intention of shirking major policy decisions. This is a big reform but a fair reform. It has been well thought through. It is overdue. If we do not make these reforms, we will be left behind. Other countries will run past us and outcompete us. Australian families will be left behind. These changes are necessary if we are going to continue to grow this economy. It is a strong economy that provides job security, higher wages and better conditions and it is strong economy that provides for the well-being of Australian families. The only reason we are proposing these changes is to deliver on the workplace relations system that will give more flexibility, grow the economy and help Australian families. (Time expired)",104
163,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler) (4.04 pm)‘This reform has been well thought through,' said the member for Goldstein, but they cannot even produce the legislation. What has been well thought through is the need for them to have a propaganda campaign, paid for by the taxpayer, to drive down the wages and conditions of Australian workers, to transfer wages straight into profits. This nothing to do with economic growth. It has nothing to do with productivity. Indeed, it could in fact be negative because when you drive down the wages of average workers who spend all of their wage every week-on their mortgage, on food, on child care, on clothing and on education for their kidsyou dampen down economic growth. Those people do not have the savings and the opportunities that some of the spivs opposite have had and have taken for granted throughout their whole lives. We heard that this was well thought through. The opposition leader exposed that farce today in the parliament with two documents. The reform has been so well thought through that they printed tens of thousands of copies of a document but then had to pulp them because their pollsters and spin doctors, who they are paying millions of dollars-Liberal Party friends-advised them: ‘It's probably not a good idea just to say “A simpler national workplace relations system for Australia”. We need to add the word “fairer”.' Why did they need to get advice to add the word ‘fairer'? Because the concept of fairness is anathema to those opposite. The concept of equality, the concept of a fair go, is something that they oppose a and just do not get. They hate workers, when it comes down to it. They hate average Australians. They think that the people they are elected here to represent-those people of privilege-are the only people who deserve representation in this parliament. We saw it perhaps best here from the member for Gippsland. The member for Gippsland has for three days in a row got dorothy dixers in which he has spoken about agricultural awards, shop assistants and the average decent, hard working Australians who keep this country going, in pejorative terms. He has actually had the hide to criticise payments in awards for personal contrihas butions at the workplace level for rural workers who provide a horse for the benefit of themselves and their employer. That is seen by the minister as something that is hilarious. That has got a run for three days in a row, as it is so strange and odd that this would be included in awards! But the minister, of all people-given that he used to be a minister and then had to resign and pay back $9,000 of taxpayers' money over travel allowanceMr Kelvin Thomson-Shame! Shameand he's now a minister.",107
164,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Wills has been warned and should know the rules.,107
165,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"should be very conscious of the complex arrangements that come in our awards that we have to sign off on every month. Just as workers have in their awards transport entitlements, so do we, and ours are pretty generous. If the member for Gippsland drives his car from Sale in Victoria to Parliament House, he gets 522 times 63c-$328.86-each way. That is a total of $328.86 for five or six hours work, not bad money in the kick-something that the minister knows a lot about when it comes to public money. But, when he gets here, the minister has to sign off the registry to prove that he was here. He then has to reconcile it. There are documents the thickness of a telephone book that we have to comply with in what is essentially the equivalent of our award. But there is one difference between our conditions and the conditions of the average worker: this man, who has more wealth than probably every shop assistant in Australia combined, begrudges elements in awards such as $5. He begrudges $5 going to an average worker, which exposes, really, what the government are about. The member for Goldstein talks about how well the economy is going under this government. They speak about the flexibility that is there. Of course it is there, because Hawke and Keating Labor governments made sure through their industrial relations reform-which was all about enterprise bargaining and making sure that productivity was a key to wage increases-that the economy they inherited would go well. But this government have it confused. They have confused non-unionism with anti-unionism. It is true that unionism in this country has fallen to about one in four in the work force. They have thought this through and thought, ‘That means everyone hates unions.' Not true. Decent, hard working Australians know that they want a safety net. They want an Industrial Relations Commission. They might not even know who are members of their union. We have all had workers turn up to our electorate offices and say, ‘I need assistance. I've copped a raw deal off the boss.' The first thing you say to them is, ‘Have you gone to your union?' They say, ‘I'm not really a member-but I would like to join.' And you know what they do? They do just that-join. Part of the culture in this country is knowing that trade unions exist and will be there for those who need them. Part of the culture of the great Australian Labor Party that we will not walk away from is our connection with the trade union movement, something that we are proud of. The government in its documents has really exposed what it is about. This is a government that would construct an industrial relations system in which ‘fairer' just does not figure, in which ‘fairer' is an afterthought. This is also a government which has been exposed by these documents. What has it taken out of the documents? It has taken out ‘your existing award conditions protected by law'. Can you imagine the setting? In the minister's office, the document comes throughglossy, paid for as part of the $100 million spend. The minister or one of his advisers the gets it and reads: your existing award conditions protected by law. ‘We can't really say that because we're not doing it. We'd better take that out.' Then they have a look and read: preserving key award conditions. ‘Well, we're not really going to do that either. We'd better take that out.' Then they have a look and see: terms and conditions in existing agreements will be protected. ‘We're not going to do that either, so we'd better take that out.' What this document exposes-not a piece of propaganda from the ACTU or the ALP, but a document from the government, paid for by the Australian taxpayer-is what this government is really about: ripping the guts out of fairness in the Australian system. Fairness characterises us as a nation. We use it throughout our language: ‘fair dinkum', ‘fair go'. We can lose the Ashes and think, ‘That's all right, because it was about time the Poms won.' We have as part of our culture fairness before the law. The rights of trade unions are a core part of that. The fact is the government has just got this wrong. It knows it has got it wrong because its $100 million propaganda campaign has been exposed as being illegal. The AEC wrote to the minister today saying just that. (Time expired)",107
166,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Out of the mouth of the member for Grayndler is the MPI condemned. Where was the member for Grayndler's reference, throughout his entire diatribe, to investing in skilling the Australian work force? The Labor Party are simply using what has happened this week for political opportunism, and they have been told to do so by the union movement. They are running scared of the union movement and they must oppose. This is in total contrast to our position back in 1993. In their contributions, the member for Grayndler and the Leader of the Opposition referred to the former Prime Minister Paul Keating and what he did. I am glad they did that, because it stands in stark contrast. The actions of party when we were in opposition stand in stark contrast to the actions of the ALP moment, now they are in opposition. The reform process that is taking place at the moment in Australia is very much an evolutionary one. It started in 1993. We saw the second wave of reforms in 1996 and we are now seeing a third wave of reforms taking place in 2005. When Paul Keating introduced that first wave he was opposed by the union movement. But do you know who supported him? The opposition supported the moves, at that time, to make changes. Obviously we felt that he had not gone far enough-we would have liked him to have gone a bit further-but we still supported him. So the claims of the high and mighty on the other side that what we have today is because of their changes in 1993-that the fruits of those changes are what we are benefiting from-are pure hypocrisy. Back in 1993 the former Prime Minister was very prophetic. He said of the industrial relations system in this country: ... let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places ... emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses ... We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards ... to being full substitutes for awards. The statement made by Paul Keating that ‘we need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards to being full substitutes for awards' is precisely where we are today. What Paul Keating advocated back in 1993, at the beginning of the reform process, is exactly what is happening today. In this third stage our of reforms we are seeking to make agreements full substitutes for the choking award at the based system. Do we receive any support from the ALP? No. Do we receive any support from the union movement? No, of course not. We are not surprised by the union movement's opposition to this. They opposed the reforms then and they oppose them now. The difference is that they now have their comrades, those on the other side, who will do their bidding to avoid risking preselections and hard-earned financial support come the next election. The MPI this afternoon has been confused with a censure motion. The member for Grayndler's speech epitomised that fact. The argument today has been based on an attack on the government's advertising campaign. I can only wonder what it is that the opposition is asking us to do. Is it asking us not to inform the Australian public of one of the major reform programs undertaken by this government? It is an advertising campaignan information campaign-to inform the Australian public. By its very nature, when you have reform there is a lot of complexity to it. There is a lot to understand and comprehend. We did that with other reform programs over the last 9½ years. We did it with the GST. At the time, the Australian public got to understand exactly what we were doing. We are doing it again now. Ms Bird- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",109
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I have ruled before when we have successive motions that I think it is disrupting the House. I will not accept the motion.,110
168,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for your ruling on that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Any discussion on this MPI, which is about Australian families and their social well-being and the investment in skilling the Australian work force, must also take place in the context of looking at what has happened in the past. I have already referred to the 1993 Keating reforms, which we are continuing. We must also look at the record and performance of the previous government. One of its former senior ministers is now the Leader of the Opposition. The record of the Leader of the Opposition during that time is an absolutely abysmal one. Ms Hall- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",110
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I just ruled on that, Member for Shortland. I have ruled in the past that where we have successive calls for a quorum I believe it is disrupting the House. I took two and I am not going to take another.  ciate the ruling that you have made, but I cannot find, having looked at House of Representatives Practice, what underpins that particular ruling. I want to say that I accept you have a responsibility to ensure that the House is not disrupted",110
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am sure that if the Chief Opposition Whip has a close look at House of Representatives Practice he will see what I am relying on.  gise to you. I will take up your instruction. I did peruse House of Representatives Practice on another occasion but I will do so again. If I am permitted I might be able to take the matter up privately outside the chamber.,110
171,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Those points of order and interruptions remind me of one of my favourite black and white movies with Jimmy Stewart, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, because of all the filibustering that has taken place in order to take up my time. Those opposite do not like the Leader of the Opposition's record being exposed in this chamber. We know that this MPI is a fraud. It is a fraud because it certainly exposes what the ALP in government failed to achieve. During the time that Mr Beazley was the minister for employment and educationbasically he was the minister for jobs and skills, which is part of what this MPI is all about-we had one million unemployed, 329,000 long-term unemployed and teenage unemployment of 34.5 per cent. How did Mr Beazley feel about being minister for jobs and skills? This is what he said: ... I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. That was quoted in the biography on Mr Beazley by Peter Fitzsimmons. The opposition's record is an abysmal one and yet we have a government right now that is trying to introduce workplace relations reforms which will help further to improve employment prospects for Australians. One only has to go to today's Daily Telegraph to see some examples of long-term unemployed young Australians who are talking about coming up with agreements for working on weekends without penalties. Fred Whitbread is quoted as saying: I wouldn't mind as long as it is benefiting my long-term career. Following that, another guy, Adel Yahko, said: I'll work seven days a week, it doesn't matter. What they understand is that the way to advance from job to job is actually to be in a job to begin with. The people in the opposition do not understand that. They have never worked in the area of recruitment. They have no understanding. They have never run small business. Mr Albanese interjecting",110
172,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Grayndler can hardly make any contribution to the MPI; he failed to talk about the MPI. We all know that the best way to advance yourself is to be already in a job. These young people understand that. They need employment. Workplace relations reforms will provide that opportunity. The Leader of the Opposition cannot bring himself to use the word ‘rollback' any more but that is exactly-(Time expired),111

175,Ms GILLARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak briefly to the motion and then move an amendment. You would be aware that the sitting week which was scheduled to occur last week was cancelled on the motion of the government. It was a matter that was determined by the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister-the Prime Minister then writing to the Speaker about the matter. We think it is an act of contempt towards this parliament for this government to think that sitting dates are its plaything. The parliamentary secretary at the table is expressing some amazement at this. She might be amazed to learn that we have asked parliamentary chamber research staff about this and they are unable to identify a time that that has happened since this parliament was created at Federation. What that means is that this is the most arrogant government we have had since Federation. This is a government that is more contemptuous of this parliament and what it represents than any government we have had in the time since Australia has been a nation. It is a disgrace. We understand that in times of national emergency there might be a need to recall the parliament early, but there is no excuse for cancelling scheduled sitting dates.

207,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (4.45 pm)There is no greater symbol of the Howard government's contempt for our heritage than its request for roadworks at ANZAC Cove. In 2003, the Prime Minister promised to protect ANZAC Cove. He promised to make ANZAC Cove the first listing on the new National Heritage List. On 18 December 2003, the Prime Minister said: It seems to me ... entirely appropriate that the ANZAC site at Gallipoli should represent the first nomination for inclusion on the National Heritage List. And, although it's not on Australian territory, anyone who has visited the place will know that once you go there you feel it as Australian as the piece of land on which your home is built. Instead of protecting ANZAC Cove, this government and this Prime Minister requested roadworks which have damaged the site forever. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into matters relating to the Gallipoli Peninsula, which reported today, have confirmed this. The inquiry found: ... that significant sites of the ANZAC campaign ... have been lost forever. The coastal road has been widened beyond the extent necessary to ensure visitors' safety; spoil has been deliberately dumped onto the beach below; there were no environmental measures put in place to minimise erosion from the construction ... The inquiry also found: ... Australian authorities and the Australian government were complacent in their response to allegations and evidence that this damage was occurring. The Howard government's complacency continues to this day. In their minority report, government senators state: ... the Australian Government has, at all times, acted appropriately and correctly. How exactly is the trashing of this sacred site to all Australians acting appropriately and correctly? It is an extraordinary statement given the government, firstly, requested the road works and, then, failed to properly monitor the project. This complacency now threatens other elements of our ANZAC heritage. Further roadwork upgrades are planned for ANZAC Cove, but the government has already dismissed calls by the Senate inquiry for: ... remedial action before the onset of winter to stabilise and restore the vegetation at ANZAC Cove. To some extent the damage is done. What Australians saw for 90 years when they went to that site was that the integrity of the site remained largely the same as it was in 1915. When you went there you could get that sense of experience. Diggers who went back there certainly have said that that is the case, as have historians such as Les Carlyon, as have archaeologists and as have the RSL. The government must ensure that it does not get worse. It must ensure that this remedial action is undertaken before the onset of winter to ameliorate the scarring caused by the roadworks and to minimise future erosion. Proper heritage management plans must be put in place in partnership with the government of Turkey. Clear guidelines must be put in place for the future management, recovery, reburial or storage of human remains at Gallipoli which were uncovered by these roadworks. The Howard government must end its complacency on this issue and it must learn from its mistakes. It must ensure that no further damage is done to one of our most sacred sites. Mr Speaker, you may well recall that when I first raised this issue of the degradation of this site in the parliament the Prime Minister's response was to say arrogantly that it is regrettable that the question was even asked. Thank goodness the opposition did raise it or it could have been even worse. But now is the time for complacency to end. It should take on board the Senate inquiry recommendations and ensure that no further damage is done. It should get serious about protecting Australia's heritage. Mr Francis Eugene Joseph Galbally",115
208,Mr GEORGIOU,ADJOURNMENT,"Kooyong) (4.50 pm)I rise to pay tribute to Francis Eugene Joseph Galbally. Frank died yesterday after a long illness. He would have been 83 today. Over the course of one's life, you come across many people whom you respect and admire. There are few who achieved distinction in so many diverse fields as Frank Galbally. Francis was a brilliant advocate, an author, a great contributor to Australia's public policy, a defender of democracy against dictatorship in Greece, a proud husband and father, a man of intellect, of compassion and a man of passion. And he made the world's finest vodka martini. Francis Galbally came from a family of Irish Catholic provenance. He considered becoming a priest; indeed, he attended the seminary at Werribee for three years before joining the Navy after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. On his return from the war, he studied law at the University of Melbourne and began his career as a solicitor. He never went to the bar, and always told me that he had made a very wise decision. I will not say too much about his legal accomplishments because his legal colleagues are better able to do that. I will just say that the tributes to him are replete with references to his being the world's most successful defence advocate-a man who took on causes that were unpopular and even dangerous. He was, as former Victorian Chief Justice John Phillips described him, ‘a very brave, lionhearted man'. The fact is that the demands of the defence took their toll. He once told me that, despite his incredible run of successes, he did not want to do any more murder trials because taking the responsibility for somebody else's life was overwhelming. I first met Frank in 1975 and our relationship developed over the course of his work on the report on post-arrival programs and services. We then worked together on the Ethnic Television Review Panel and the Implementation Team for Multicultural Television and he was my chairman at the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Frank was a wise, generous and dear friend. He became involved with ethnic issues because, when Malcolm Fraser asked him what he wanted to do when we won government in 1975, Frank said he was concerned about the situation of Australia's ethnic communities. Malcolm Fraser, sharing these concerns, made him Chairman of the Committee on Post-Arrival Programs and Services. The resulting report, which had all its recommendations accepted and funded, was a watershed in multicultural philosophy and practice. Its fundamental principles were: equal opportunity and equality of access to general services, the provision of special services where these are needed, respect for cultural diversity, consultation, self-help and self reliance. The Galbally report, as it became known, institutionalised the commitment to multiculturalism: the right of all Australians to express and share their cultural heritages, the right to equality of treatment and the removal of discriminatory barriers-rights which were always accompanied, in Frank's mind, by the obligation to make a fundamental commitment to Australia. The Fraser government's implementation of these principles would, in itself, have earned Frank a place in Australia's history, but he went on to establish multicultural television, which had stalled, and to oversee the translation of the vision of a multicultural television service into reality. That reality is with us today, for the service to have survived despite repeated onslaughts from both left and right is a tribute to how well Frank built it. I believe that the work of Frank Galbally contributed significantly to the fact that what emerged from the mass immigration of the last half century was an admirable, decent, harmonious multicultural Australia-a society based on the appreciation of cultural diversity and on tolerance and mutual respect. Frank Galbally was a distinguished Australian who made a very distinguished contribution. He was a man of vision who conceived things that people had not thought of before and he had the capacity and toughness to translate them into reality. He will be sorely missed, and the thoughts of many people will be with his wife, Bernadette, and his many children, Michael, David, Francis, Simon, Paul, Bernard, Elsa and Joe. Government Accountability",116
209,Mr BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (4.55 pm)When the Australian people pay their taxes they expect the money to be spent on services for the Australian people. Nobody likes paying tax, but when they do they at least know it is going to a good cause. But we now have a government which is wasteful and slothful with taxpayers' money. This is the highest taxing Australian government in history-a government which is spending $100 million, not of its money but of taxpayers' money, on advocating a policy which has not yet even been introduced into this parliament. It is a government that is buying advertisements on prime time television which appear every five minutes at $90,000 a pop. It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money that this government should be ashamed of. Today we heard in the House the revelation that the government had produced 60,000 pamphlets on the industrial relations and changes only to have them pulped because they were not good enough. This is a government which claims to be a good economic manager but is prepared to see taxpayers' money wasted and thrown around like confetti at a wedding. And that is not all. There has been other wasteful spending from the government in the last 12 months. We have seen $100 million spent so far on private recruitment agencies. I do not deny that some use of private recruitment agencies is appropriate, but spending $100 million on private agencies for government recruitment shows that this government has an extreme ideological approach to these matters. I would contend that this sort of recruitment could be done much more efficiently by members of the Australian Public Service. This government has an ideological obsession with outsourcing. Last year an estimated $10 million was spent on media monitoring by this government-$10 million to watch themselves on television and read about themselves in newspapers. What an outrageous waste of money which would not pass the reasonableness test of the average Australian taxpayer. Another $80,000 was spent on massages for selected public servants. I do not deny that those public servants work very hard, but I think the average taxpayer would say that $80,000 on massages for selected public servants is not a good use of taxpayers' money-and if it is good enough for some public servants then it is good enough for all. The arrogance goes further. A few months ago I put a question on notice to the Minister for Human Services asking him if he had sought legal advice about his powers in relation to the Minister for Family and Community Services. I asked him if he had paid, at taxpayer expense, for legal advice on whether he was more powerful than the Minister for Family and Community Services. For good measure I asked the Minister for Family and Community Services whether she had sought legal advice about the Minister for Human Services. To her credit, the Minister for Family and Community Services answered promptly and said no. The Minister for Human Services took months to respond. Last week I received an answer or, rather, a non-answer: ‘My department seeks legal advice on a range of matters from time to time.' That was his answer. He refused to indicate how much he spent on legal advice about how much power he has in relation to a so-called colleague. It is an arrogant contempt of the processes of this parliament when a minister says, ‘I refuse to answer a question from an elected member of parliament.' I have written again to the Minister for Human Services and asked the same question under the Freedom of Information Act, and I expect to receive an answer. Then we will know how much money he spent finding out how powerful he is in relation to the Minister for Family and Community Services. We see an arrogant contempt for the forms of this House and an arrogant contempt in the use of taxpayers' hard-earned moneytaxpayers who work long hours going about their business and paying their tax. Nobody likes paying tax, but they do it because they know that community services will benefit. But taxpayers can receive no comfort from the way this government spends its money because it spends it on such things as advertisements and pulped pamphlets.",117

Mr Baird to move: That this House: (1) notes with concern the: (a) ongoing human rights abuses in Zimbabwe; (b) lack of accountable government and the failure to hold free and fair elections; (c) ongoing suppression of opposition political parties and human rights activists; and (d) implementation of Operation Murambatsvina (Clean Out the Trash) which has led to the internal displacement and famine; and (2) calls on the Zimbabwean Government to: (a) uphold the rule of law; (b) ensure that its citizens human rights are respected; (c) establish conditions and provide the means for citizens who have been internally displaced under Operation Murambatsvina to return voluntarily and with dignity to their homes or places of residence or resettle voluntarily in another part of the country; and (d) respect the rights of victims of Operation Murambatsvina, including access to justice and appropriate reparations, including restitution, rehabilitation and compensation.",118
